<p><b>A PRIMER ON PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY <br>
</b></p>

<p>Psychopharmacology, as the term is used here, refers to the
study of the interactions of drugs with the central nervous
system (CNS), including physical, behavioral, and subjective
effects. The term is not always used so broadly; we have chosen a
comprehensive definition because this brief paper is neither
detailed enough nor sophisticated enough to require the fine
divisions implied by more exact categorization into such
subspecialties as neurophysiology, neurochemistry,
neuropharmacology, psychopharmacology, neuropsychology, and so
forth. </p>

<p>As will become obvious, there are many areas in which basic
knowledge about the mechanisms of action of psychoactive drugs
does not exist. Our purpose here is to describe for laymen the
framework within which such knowledge must be sought, and the
difficulties involved.*<br>
</p>

<p>* Since this paper was written by a layman for laymen,
technical terms and discussion have been avoided as much as
possible. In most cases where extended discussion would have to
be highly technical, the conclusions of experts on the present
state of knowledge are set forth with a citation to the
discussion leading to these conclusions. Drs. Avram Goldstein,
Norman Zinberg, Andrew Weil, Frederick DiCarlo, and Alan Green
all read earlier drafts of this paper. They prevented some
embarrassing errors, but they are not to blame for any that
remain.<br>
</p>

<p><b>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I<br>
</b></p>

<p>The nervous system is composed of millions of nerve cells
(neurons) that are by no means homogeneous in structure. Some are
very long, even up to several feet; some are bushy, with -many
fibers reaching out to connect with other nerves; some are small
and simple. The cells do not interlock with each other at the
ends, where the impulse is transmitted from one to another. There
are, instead, microscopic gaps, called synapses, between them,
which must be bridged by the impulse. </p>

<p>There are several ways to categorize the parts of the nervous
system, each useful for different purposes. One division is
between the CNS-the brain and spinal cord-and the peripheral
nervous system, which is everything else. The peripheral system
is composed of nerve fibers extending out from cell bodies
contained within the CNS and, to some extent, of cell bodies
clumped outside of it but, of course, still connected. While the
peripheral system has groups of fibers (nerves) and groups of
cell bodies (ganglia), it is simple compared to the CNS, which
consists of millions of tightly packed neurons, fiber groups
(tracts), and clumps of cell bodies (nuclei) with billions of
synapses. </p>

<p>The psychoactive component of the effect of drugs is due to
their effects on the CNS rather than on the peripheral system,
and it is the CNS with which we are concerned. The peripheral
system is relevant only insofar as research into the mechanisms
of peripheral action casts light on the workings of the CNS. </p>

<p>Another way of dividing the nervous system is by function. The
somatic system includes both the central and the peripheral
neurons that convey impulses from the sense organs, organize them
in the brain, and deliver motor impulses to the skeletal muscles.
The autonomic system governs the smooth muscles of the
intestines, urogenital tract, and blood vessels; the heart
muscles; and the endocrine glands. In short, the somatic system
controls the body's response to the external environment; the
autonomic system governs the internal environment. </p>

<p>The autonomic system is further subdivided into two parts. The
sympathetic system generally mobilizes bodily resources for
action-it constricts visceral blood vessels so that more blood is
directed to muscles and brain, accelerates the heart beat,
inhibits intestinal and gastric activity, widens the pupils of
the eye, and secretes adrenaline The parasympathetic system is
the antagonist of these effects. It acts to conserve bodily
resources, usually by having effects that are the reverse of
those of the sympathetic system. The parasympathetic system is
more specific than the sympathetic, however. While the latter
tends to act diffusely, causing all the effects at once, the
parasympathetic system can act independently on different organs.
</p>

<p>The differentiation between autonomic and somatic systems is
clearest at the periphery of the nervous system. As one traces
the systems toward the CNS, the distinction becomes more vague.
In the main trunks of peripheral nerves, for example, the fibers
of the different systems are bound together and can be separated
only by tracing them to their terminations or on the basis of
some differences in fiber types. Within the CNS centers, division
of functions is always a matter of degree rather than of complete
specialization. While some centers are concerned primarily with
somatic or with autonomic functions, the two are always closely
coordinated, and the separation is not complete. </p>

<p>The CNS itself is not, of course, a random melange of
heterogeneous neurons. There are many different and identifiable
parts to it-medulla, pons, cerebellum, midbrain, reticular
formation, thalamus, optic tract, cerebral hemispheres, basal
ganglia, and so forth. For some of these, the functions are
fairly well established; for others, they are not. To try to
describe these would be far beyond the scope of this appendix.
For our purposes, it is enough to state the following
propositions: </p>

<ul>
    <li>There is much specialization within the CNS, in that a
        particular part will have a specific and identifiable
        function. (For example, the thalamus is a relay station,
        with impulses arriving from lower centers and being
        passed on to higher ones; the hypothalamus has the
        primary control over autonomic functions; the cerebral
        cortex contains the more complex psychological functions;
        and so on.) </li>
    <li>Each part consists of packed nerve cells with many
        connections to each other and to different parts of the
        brain. </li>
    <li>Many, if not all, functions involve more than one CNS
        center. </li>
    <li>It is easier to study motor or sensory functions, where
        CNS activity can be correlated with an output, than to
        study pure cognitive functions, where it cannot. <br>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><b>PROBLEMS IN STUDYING THE CNS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The study of the CNS is extraordinarily difficult. As Kenneth
Moore states, &quot;The human brain contains a complex of
millions of nerve cells that are anatomically independent but
functionally interconnected. An impulse starting in one neuron
can propagate throughout the nervous system over a variety of
pathways. The route taken is determined by the inborn
organization of the brain and by ongoing events that, because of
neural plasticity, can establish new circuits.&quot;' Obviously,
the number of permutations possible in such a system would make
study difficult, even if no other problems existed. Moore,
however, goes on to list some of the major impediments to
research on the CNS: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Many ideas about neural functioning derive from study of
        the peripheral system, where most synapses are well
        defined in that only one synapse exists at a particular
        point. In the CNS, the cell bodies are covered with
        synapses. They are also closely packed among other cells
        (the glia), which may perform some neural functions even
        though they are not neurons. </li>
    <li>In each peripheral synapse only one chemical transmitter
        is thought to act. Each CNS nerve cell may be affected by
        several different transmitters. [Transmitters are
        discussed on pp.67-68.] </li>
    <li>Neural reactions occur in milliseconds and are hard to
        find and measure. </li>
    <li>The biochemical processes involved in peripheral systems
        can be studied in test tubes (in vitro) where tissue
        slices can be made to react. This is not true for studies
        of the brain, because brain neurons in vitro are in a
        resting state, disconnected from the other neurons that
        ordinarily determine their activities. While artificial
        stimulation can be applied, there is no way of knowing
        whether this corresponds to actions in the body. In
        particular, it is difficult to relate any in vitro
        reactions to such higher functions as thought or emotion.
    </li>
    <li>Because the different units of the CNS have different
        functions and anatomies, the biochemical reactions of any
        particular part are probably not the same as those of any
        other part. </li>
    <li>There is a unique blood-brain barrier between the blood
        and the brain that makes chemical manipulation of the CNS
        via injection into the bloodstream more difficult than is
        manipulation of other tissues. [The capillaries in the
        brain are somewhat less permeable than the capillaries
        elsewhere in the body.] </li>
    <li>The synapses are so densely packed that chemical
        manipulation by administration directly to the brain is
        much more difficult. </li>
    <li>Some brain structures are not accessible in a live
        subject because they are surrounded by other structures.
        If it is not useful to study them in vitro, and one
        cannot study them in situ, it is rather difficult to
        study them at all. </li>
    <li>When experiments are carried out in a live subject it is
        often necessary to stop a chemical reaction quickly so as
        to preserve the tissue at a particular point in the
        process. This is usually done by rapid excision and
        immersion in a low-temperature liquid. Since the entire
        CNS is surrounded by bone, it is difficult to perform
        this operation quickly enough. Some chemicals present in
        vivo may never be identified because they are destroyed
        too quickly.'<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This represents a formidable list of difficulties. And, since
psychoactive drugs are usually fairly specific to the CNS-in that
they affect the CNS without having much effect on other body
systems-it is easy to see why knowledge of their sites and
mechanisms of action is less than complete, despite intensive
study during the past several decades. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THEORIES OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The present theory about the manner in which psychoactive
drugs operate is that they affect the transmission of the nerve
impulses across the synapses. This hypothesis is based upon more
general theories concerning the chemical nature of this
transmission. Researchers know that in a peripheral system
certain chemical substances (acetylcholine in the somatic system
and norepinephrine in the autonomic) are associated with the
stimulation of nerve impulses. These substances can also be found
in the CNS and appear to be correlated with activity levels
there. </p>

<p>Because nerve impulses are thought to be electrical in nature,
the theory of their effect is as follows: A nerve impulse that
reaches the synapse of a particular neuron stimulates the release
of a particular transmitter substance. This substance affects the
receptors of the adjoining nerve cell (the postsynaptic neuron),
changes its electrical potential, and triggers an impulse within
it. Most of the transmitter substance is taken back into the
neuron from which it came, although some of it is destroyed by
enzymes or diffused by the blood. The postsynaptic nerve then
returns to its original state. </p>

<p>Psychoactive drugs may affect this sequence by stimulating or
inhibiting the production of the transmitter substance, by
causing its release from storage, by affecting the process by
which it is taken back into the neuron, or by stimulating or
inhibiting its destruction. These processes have an effect on the
level and type of activity in the CNS and a consequent effect on
the perceptions and activities of the body. </p>

<p>Beyond this, it is difficult to say anything with much
certainty. Some psychoactive drugs are associated with increased
CNS levels of particular substances that are thought to be
transmitters, but the causation is not firmly established.
Mandell and Spooner have pointed out that the evidence for
transmitter theory is in many ways startlingly indirect.' Their
final comment is: &quot;Even on a neurochernical level, we must
talk about empirical correlates of behavioral states. Rigorous
establishment of the transmitter or modulator role of brain
substances appears to remain for the future.&quot; </p>

<p>The strongest evidence that a particular substance has
transmitter functions concerns acetlycholine Wh). Neurons
sensitive to this substance are distributed throughout the brain,
so that it can have excitatory or inhibiting functions, depending
on the region. ACh is difficult to study, because it does not
pass the blood-brain barrier easily and is destroyed rapidly
after artificial administration. Its effects on certain cells in
the spinal cord have been studied, but not much is known about
effects at other synapses in the CNS. There is also fairly good
evidence that two catecholamines-norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine
(D)-perform transmitter functions. Again, however, much of what
is thought about their action is derived from research with the
peripheral system, and conclusions must be approached warily. NE
and D, together with their degrading enzymes, are also located in
various regions of the brain.-' </p>

<p>Some researchers believe that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-11T),
often called serotonin, is also a transmitter, but the evidence
is not as strong as for the substances already discussed. As
Moore states, &quot;Despite years of active investigation, the
functional significance of this amine remains obscure.&quot;' The
substance may excite, depress, or have no effect on neurons, but
the reasons for the differences are not known. It has no
functions in the peripheral system and is thus even more
difficult to study than the other possibilities. </p>

<p>A number of other substances may be transmitters, but the
evidence is ambiguous. For example, the brain contains a
relatively high concentration of free amino acids, some of which
may have transmitter functions. And there are a number of other
possibilities, such as histamine, substance P, Prostaglandins,
and ergothioneine. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>Even if the transmitter theory were certain and a connection
between transmitters and psychoactive drugs proved, there would
be the problem of understanding the mechanisms by which the drugs
affect the transmitters. This problem relates to the more general
pharmacological question of the manner in which drugs affect
cells and to the basic pharmacological concept of receptor sites:
</p>

<p>. . . most drugs are thought to produce their effects by
combining with enzymes, cell membranes, or other specialized
functional components of cells. Drug-cell interaction is presumed
to alter the function of the cell component and thereby initiate
the series of biochemical and physiological changes that are
characteristic of the drug.... </p>

<p>The cell component directly involved in the initial action of
the drug is usually termed ... its receptor., </p>

<p>In its simplest form, the receptor-site theory is that, at the
basic site of action of any drug, there are cells or cell
surfaces that form molecular bonds with the drug molecules.
Current theory is that these sites are stereospecific-it is not
only the chemical composition of the drug that determines whether
the receptor can bond with it but its three-dimensional geometric
shape as well. A cell surface might have, for example, three or
four different points of contact where different molecular bonds
could be formed. A drug molecule must have a geometric shape that
allows proper subgroups of the molecule to come in contact with
these points for the formation of a firm bond. </p>

<p>This theory of stereospecificity explains why drugs that are
diverse in chemical structure may have similar effects (e.g.,
morphine, methadone, and meperidine). Even though chemical
structures are different, geometric structures can be similar. In
contrast, variations of the same substance with similar chemical
structures but different geometric structures may not have
similar effects.' </p>

<p>The classic assumptions of receptor-site theory are: (1) One
molecule of drug combines with one receptor site, (2) a
negligible fraction of the total drug is combined, and (3) the
response of the body to the drug is directly related to the
proportion of available receptor sites that are occupied. </p>

<p>The interaction between drugs and cells is governed by the law
of mass action. The molecules of a drug are constantly
associating with and dissociating from receptor sites. At some
point, for any given drug concentration, an equilibrium is
reached where association and dissociation balance. The
drug-receptor interaction, therefore, is dynamic, not static.
Since most drug-toreceptor bonds are thought to be relatively
weak ionic bonds that are readily reversible, this concept of
dynamic interaction becomes important in understanding the
process of antagonistic effects, blockade, and reversibility of
drug action. All are based on theories about differences in the
strength of bonds formed by different drugs and on competition
for receptor sites. </p>

<p>Since these basic assumptions do not, however, explain all the
observed phenomena of drug action in many cases, including the
action of narcotic analgesics, various departures from the basic
occupancy assumption have been suggested. The most important are
(1) that not only occupation of the receptor sites matters but
also the intrinsic &quot;efficacy&quot; of the drug; (2) that it
is not the occupancy of the site that matters but the act of
occupying, and that drug effect depends on the relative rates of
association and dissociation, and (3) that there are spare
receptors that may be occupied, although at a lower level of
efficiency, when the primary receptors are already occupied.
These explain some of the otherwise unexplained phenomena, but
they leave other, different mysteries of their own.' Nor are
these questions likely to be settled soon. </p>

<p>There are two ways to gain information about a receptor. The
first and only really satisfactory approach is to identify and
isolate it. Then the investigation can follow established
biochemical and physicochemical procedures. Sequence analysis can
establish the primary structure of the macromolecules. Techniques
like x-ray crystallography, high-resolution electron micrography,
spectrophotometry, and analytical ultracentrifugation can yield
data from which the secondary and tertiary structure may be
deduced. </p>

<p>In the case of proteins, recent years have seen the
elucidation of complete primary structures at an ever-increasing
rate.... </p>

<p>The second way of obtaining information about receptors is
indirect. It has dominated pharmacologic research in the past.
The approach is to draw inferences about a receptor from the
biologic end results caused by drugs. A powerful tool employed
toward this end has been the study of structure-activity
relationships (abbreviated SAR). A suitable biologic effect of a
drug is chosen for study. A prototype drug, which elicits the
characteristic effect, is then modified systematically in its
molecular structure. Substituents are added or subtracted at
various positions and in different steric configurations. A
series of such chemically related drugs is known as congeneric
series. By testing the members of a series and observing how
biologic potency is affected by each molecular modification, one
may ultimately draw conclusions about the precise mode of
combination of a drug with its receptor surface.10 </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the study of psychoactive drugs belongs in the
second category. No one has found the receptor sites or knows
which cells might be involved. Concerning narcotic analgesics,
Goldstein says, &quot;It must be remembered . . . that the
receptor, whose structural features are inferred from the SAR
studies . . . is entirely hypothetical.&quot;11 </p>

<p>Finally, theories of action at the receptor site say nothing
about the biochemical events in the CNS that constitute the
eventual product of the interaction of the drug and the receptor
site. &quot;Investigations of the mechanism of tolerance and of
the mechanism of narcotic action have been hampered by the same
difficulty-that the biochemical alterations produced by the drug
in the whole brain are unlikely to have much to do with the
specific biochemical changes that are responsible for the drug
effects at the sites of drug action.&quot;12 </p>

<p>Jaffe makes a similar point. After reviewing the various
theories and experiments on the effect of opiates on cerebral
neural action, cerebral metabolism, and neurotransmitters, he
says: </p>

<p>... Unfortunately, knowledge of the functional role of the
several postulated neurobumoral transmitter agents in the CNS is
still so limited and controversial that the demonstration of an
effect of morphine on them has not yet contributed significantly
to an understanding of either the neurophysiological and
behavioral effects of the drug or its mechanism of action .13<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>DRUGS OF ABUSE <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><b>OPIATES</b> </p>

<p>The Drugs.&quot; Opium is a natural substance derived from one
variety of the poppy plant. It contains over twenty different
alkaloids with varying properties, constituting 25 per cent of
opium by weight. A few of these-primarily morphine and codeine
are medically useful. </p>

<p>In discussing opiate abuse, the specific drugs of concern are
the following: </p>

<p><i>Morphine </i>is a natural alkaloid constituting 10 per cent
by weight of the raw opium. </p>

<p><i>Heroin. </i>Because heroin is produced by chemical
treatment of morphine with acetic acid, the technical name for it
is diacetylmorphine. In terms of analgesic effect, heroin is a
little over three times as potent as morphine-for example, it
takes three milligrams of heroin to produce the same analgesic
effect as 10 milligrams of morphine. </p>

<p>Although heroin is the principal opiate of abuse in the United
States, most research has been done with the more readily
available morphine. In the opinion of experts, such research is
applicable to heroin if the dosage difference is considered,
because heroin rapidly breaks down into morphine in the body.
Thus, its subsequent pharmacological action is the same. </p>

<p><i>Methadone </i>is a synthetic opiate of approximately the
same strength as morphine. </p>

<p><i>Meperidine </i>is another synthetic opiate that is about 10
to 20 per cent as potent as morphine. It is better known under
its trade name, Demerol. </p>

<p>While all four drugs are analgesic, euphorigenic, and in many
ways fungible, there are some differences among them,
particularly in maximal effect and duration of action. Throughout
this paper, morphine is the primary subject. Important
differences in the characteristics of the other opiates are
discussed where relevant. </p>

<p>Because of lack of information, two topics are not discussed.
First, it should not be assumed that the effects and
characteristics of raw opium are the same as those of morphine.
It has been suggested that the mixture of many different
alkaloids in opium may have substantially modifying effects on
the action of any individual alkaloid, such as morphine.15 This
is unproved; but-since the medical use of crude opium ended in
the Western world soon after 1850-there are no data either way.
Secondly, it is possible to produce drugs from crude opium that
are stronger than morphine. For example, some derivatives of
thebaine, a nonanalgesic opium alkaloid, may be one thousand
times more potent.16 The effects of such superpotent opiates have
not been studied and might differ qualitatively from those of
morphine. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses. </i>In the late nineteenth century, opium and
morphine were sometimes referred to by physicians as
&quot;GOM,&quot; &quot;God's Own Medicine.&quot; They were used
for asthma, dysentery, alcoholism, and a wide variety of other
diseases-including the simple cough.&quot; In fact, the opiates
are effective cough suppressants, constipants, and tranquilizers,
and, in an era lacking other drugs, their heavy use was natural. </p>

<p>Today, however, since there are drugs without the addictive
potential of opiates that are equally, or nearly as, effective
for most of these purposes, the medical use of opiates has become
less common. Yet, the opiates are still the most effective
pain-killing drugs known to medicine, and large quantities of
morphine and meperidine are used as such every year. Although
there is a continuing search for equally effective nonaddictive
pain relievers, none has been found, and it may be that none will
be. For a time, some of the narcotic antagonists were believed to
have the desired properties; more recently, pentazocine was
thought promising. But the latest evidence indicates that the
analgesic qualities of these drugs are due to properties that
also cause addiction. </p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity. </i>The exact method by
which morphine blocks pain is unclear. It does not appear to
block the transmission of the pain impulse through the nerves (as
do local anesthetics), because sensation and feeling are not
affected. For example, someone heavily dosed with morphine will
still be able to feel a touch or other relatively slight
sensations. In addition, experiments have shown that a patient,
even after being given morphine as a pain reliever, can
accurately determine the amount of pain he would be suffering
without the drug. What seems to change is the relationship of the
subject to the pain. Although he feels the pain and can tell how
great it would be without the drug, he is not
&quot;bothered&quot; by it. For these reasons, it is thought that
the drug acts in the part of the brain that interprets the nerve
message.&quot; </p>

<p>For a nontolerant individual, morphine is highly toxic. A dose
of 100 to 200 mg. would be sufficient to cause a fatal
respiratory depression. This, like the analgesic effect, is a
consequence of the effects of the drug on the CNS rather than on
other parts of the nervous system-morphine reduces the
responsiveness of brainstem respiratory centers to concentrations
of carbon dioxide.&quot; </p>

<p>Tolerance to the respiratory effect increases rapidly, and no
researcher has yet found an absolute limit to the quantity of
morphine that can be taken by a tolerant individual without
causing death. Some persons have been known to take as much as
four grams of morphine without adverse effect.&quot; </p>

<p>No one has discovered long-term organic damage caused by
morphine. In autopsy, neither gross nor microscopic examination
of tissues shows evidence of such effects.&quot; Various studies
have followed the medical history of addicts over a substantial
period of time, and, according to one of the studies, &quot;while
there is ample evidence that the aberrant way of life followed by
most heroin abusers has both acute and chronic medical
consequences . . . there is insufficient scientific basis for
maintaining that long-term use of opiates-in and of itself-is
related to any major medical condition.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>Addicts do, however, suffer from a variety of conditions
ancillary to their general life-style and frequently die of viral
hepatitis, bacterial infections, or other diseases. The death
rate of the addict population is not known, but it is usually
estimated as about 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent per year.&quot;
Malaria used to be common among addicts, until dope sellers began
using quinine to cut heroin. Other deaths are often attributed to
an overdose of heroin sufficient to cause respiratory depression.
The possibility of an overdose is always present, because the
quality of street heroin so varies that an addict may not know
how much pure heroin he is getting in any purchase or even how
much he is used to taking. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, several experts have stated that overdose and
disease do not explain all addict deaths.&quot; In many cases,
the dead addict did not receive more heroin than he was used to
or should have been able to take, given his pre-existing level of
tolerance. It is possible that some people have a special
sensitivity to heroin that takes the form of an idiosyncratic
response to a single dose or that is analogous to an allergic
reaction triggered by repeated use. However, there are no reports
in medical annals of persons having this reaction after receiving
morphine in a medical setting. Since morphine is used extensively
in medicine, it would be expected that such a serious effect
would have been observed by this time. But there are also some
reports of an unusually high death rate in England, where addicts
receive pure heroin. The English data on this are incomplete,
however, and the causative factors have not been adequately
analyzed. </p>

<p>Morphine does cause some physical effects, of uncertain
significance. There are changes in excretion of epinephrine and
norepinephrine. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is depressed.
Stabilized addicts become hypochondriacal, apathetic, and bored
with other people and have fitful sleep.&quot; Whether these
responses signify permanent change or damage, however, is not
clear. </p>

<p>In all animal species, including man, morphine has an
excitatory effect as well as an analgesic one. This pattern is
not unique to morphine; it is also true, for example, of
barbiturates and alcohol. The reasons are not well understood.
The effect could be due to be a difference in the speed with
which the drug affects different CNS centers, with certain
inhibiting centers being affected first. Or some CNS centers
excited by the drug may react first, with the response
subsequently suppressed by later-reacting centers. Various animal
species, however, react to morphine in different fashions. The
predominant effects in monkeys, dogs, rabbits, and rats, as well
as in man, are sedative, while in horses, cats, and mice they are
excitatory. </p>

<p>Man is considerably more sensitive to the effects of morphine
than are most other animals. For example, the effective analgesic
dose for a man is about <b>0.2 </b>mg. of morphine per kilogram
of body weight. In a dog it is at least ten times as high.&quot;
This raises a number of questions about the meaning of animal
experimentsspecifically, about the relative importance of direct
physical (as opposed to psychological or psychoactive)
consequences of taking the drug. </p>

<p>The opiates vary in several ways affecting consumer
preferences, abuse potential, and the ability of an addict to
stabilize his dosage and lead a relatively normal existence. The
major elements of variance are as follows: </p>

<p><i>Peak effect. </i>This is usually calculated as the maximum
analgesic effect that can be obtained from a given dose of the
drug as measured by the ability to relieve pain. Sometimes
euphoric effect is measured directly through the observation of
physical correlates of drug taking or through verbal responses to
tests designed to determine the degree of euphoria. It is
generally assumed, although not indisputably proved, that the
peak of analgesic effect and the peak of euphoric effect are the
same. </p>

<p><i>Duration of action. </i>This is a more diffuse concept,
because it could mean the duration of relief of a given amount of
pain or the duration of the peak effect. Generally, as used in
the sources, it seems to mean the length of time after
administration before the drug user begins to feel withdrawal
symptoms. Sometimes, however, the phrase &quot;duration of
analgesic action&quot; is used. The exact meaning of this term is
not clear, since it would seem to depend on the level of pain to
be relieved. Empirically, it seems to be about the same as the
generally accepted &quot;duration of action&quot; to withdrawal. </p>

<p><i>Method of administration. </i>All opiates can be taken
orally, subcutaneously (by injection under the skin),
intravenously (by injection into the vein), intramuscularly (by
injection into the muscle), or through the nasal passages. The
effects will differ somewhat, depending on the method used. In
addition, the effect of different methods of administration
varies with the drugs. For example, when taken orally, methadone
retains its efficacy more than morphine. </p>

<p><i>Potency and power. </i>The power of a drug is defined by
the upper limit of the absolute effects it can produce. The
potency of a drug relates to the dosage that is necessary to
produce a given effect. Thus, heroin is not more powerful than
morphine, because both can produce the same effects; but it is
more potent, because it produces equivalent effects at lower
doses. Viewed narrowly, potency might seem of little significance
medically, because one could always give more of the less potent
drug. Few drugs, however, are so specific that they have only one
effect, and the differences in potency may not be uniform for all
effects. For example, morphine is an analgesic producing a side
effect of nausea. Heroin is a more potent analgesic, but this
does not mean, necessarily, that it would be more potent in
causing nausea. </p>

<p>As stated above, potency of an opiate is measured in terms of
analgesic effects, and this is thought-and only thought to equal
euphoric effect. But, given the lack of knowledge about the
mechanisms by which opiates work, it is not impossible that the
various drugs affect different CNS centers in various ways, and
that therefore qualitative variations occur in psychoactive
experiences. Also, superpotent opiates, such as the thebaine
derivatives, might have distinct effects that have not shown up
in comparisons of existing drugs. </p>

<p>Although the basic facts about the opiates are not entirely
clear, the following facts are known: &quot; </p>

<p><i>Morphine, </i>taken subcutaneously, has its peak effect in
one half to one hour. Its duration of analgesic action is four to
six hours, and the decline from the peak is rapid. When it is
taken intravenously, the peak effect is reached sooner and is
somewhat greater. Morphine is effective when taken orally, but
the peak effect is much lower-perhaps only 20 per cent to 30 per
cent of the subcutaneous peak. The duration of action of oral
morphine is at least twelve hours and may be as long as
twenty-four. </p>

<p><i>Heroin </i>is generally thought to act about the same as
morphine. Some animal experiments, however, indicate that heroin
crosses the blood-brain barrier more quickly than morphine. If
this is true for humans, its peak would come more rapidly than
the morphine peak. Addicts sometimes cannot distinguish between
heroin and morphine when they are injected subcutaneously; most
are able to do so, however, when the drugs are taken
intravenously. </p>

<p><i>Methadone, </i>taken subcutaneously, has a peak effect in
three hours and a duration of analgesic action of about twelve
hours. When methadone is taken orally, the peak is about 70 per
cent as great and occurs after four hours. Duration of action
after oral administration is around twenty-four hours, and the
decline from the peak is slow. Intravenously injected methadone
peaks almost immediately, and the duration of action is lessened
accordingly. </p>

<p>Subcutaneous <i>meperidine </i>has a duration of analgesic
action of only two to four hours, and the peak is reached in less
than an hour. With oral administration, the peak is about 50 per
cent as high. Intravenous administration lessens the time needed
to reach the peak effect. Addicted medical personnel, who have
ready access to meperidine, tend to prefer that drug to the other
opiates, possibly because of its fast action and relatively high
potency when taken orally. The dosages of the different drugs
required to produce the same peak effect when administered
subcutaneously are: morphine-10 mg.; heroin-3 mg.; methadone-10
mg.; and meperidine-80 to 100 mg. </p>

<p><i>Addiction. </i>Three aspects of opiate use are particularly
important to an understanding of addiction and its consequences:
(1) the nature of the euphoric psychoactive effect; (2) the
development of tolerance to the drugs; and (3) the development of
physical dependence, with physical withdrawal symptoms, when the
drug is removed. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Eflects. </i>Opiates cause a mental clouding
characterized by drowsiness, an inability to concentrate,
lethargy, and reduced visual acuity. As was mentioned before,
stabilized addicts may be hypochondriacal, withdrawn, bored with
other people, and less motivated. Opiates, however, do not cause
slurred speech or significant motor incoordination.&quot; In some
persons, they produce a very pleasant euphoria, but this reaction
is not universal. Many people find that dysphoria, consisting of
mild anxiety and fear, results instead and may be accompanied by
such unpleasant effects as nausea and vomiting. Dysphoria is
extremely common at first use, even among those who eventually
become addicted; indeed, to attain euphoric effects at first may
be an atypical response. In some subjects, the initial response
is a desire to engage in increased activity.&quot; </p>

<p>Goldstein states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is well known . . . that most people react with extreme
    displeasure to an initial dose of an opiate narcotic, both
    nausea and dysphoria being common responses. It was once
    supposed that administration of opiates in legitimate medical
    practice might &quot;create&quot; addicts. There is no valid
    evidence of this claim, although it is true that the
    incidence of addiction is high in the health professions,
    where there is easy access to addicting drugs. It is quite
    obvious, however, that of the many millions of patients who
    receive morphine, an insignificantly small fraction ever seek
    to take the drug again. Likewise, in the population as a
    whole, very few of those who could obtain morphine or heroin
    illegally, if they wished, become addicts.30 <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this, people start taking opiates because they like or
expect to like the effect. It is not known whether those who
become addicts have a different response to the initial use,
experiencing some atypical internal metabolic change, or whether
they simply have more persistence. </p>

<p>For those who find that they have an affinity for the drug,
the euphoric effect is very powerful, although its exact nature
is almost indescribable. This effect can be divided into two
parts. The first part is the &quot;rush&quot;-the initial impact
of the drug on the nervous system. This appears to occur only
when the drug is taken intravenously, and not when it is taken
orally or subcutaneously. Sexual images are frequently used to
describe this effect: &quot;It was like a huge orgasm&quot;;
&quot;It was like coming from every pore.&quot; The second part
is the follow-up sensation of being &quot;high.&quot; Describing
this is more difficult, however, for there is no common
experience from which a pattern can be drawn. Basically, the
effect appears to be that of an emotional analgesic, suppressing
anxiety and care, although the analgesia is not a mere deadening
of emotion. On the contrary, it can be a profoundly heightened
sense of well-being. Whether everyone who persisted in opiate use
would attain this euphoric state, or whether such a state is a
selective reaction based on psychological factors, remains an
unanswered question. There is no model of the addict personality
as such that satisfactorily distinguishes between users and
nonusers; nor is the psychic explanation the only one available.
Some researchers believe that opiate addiction has a
physiological basis, and that the attempt to find psychological
variables is therefore pointless. The varying theories on this
subject are discussed in the last part of this section. </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. </i>A person can become accustomed to a drug's
effects and thus require steadily larger doses to produce a
constant effect. This phenomenon is common with many drugs in
pharmacology, not just drugs of abuse. Tolerance is not the same
as physical dependence and often occurs without it. It is an
important aspect of opiate addiction, because the addict's need
to take steadily larger doses to achieve a euphoric effect
elevates the cost of his habit, causing increased criminal
activity and presumably increasing any long-term toxic effects
that may exist. </p>

<p>Tolerance does not always develop uniformly to all aspects of
a drug's action. For example, while tolerance in time develops to
the sedative effects of barbiturates, the amount needed for a
lethal dose remains constant. On the other hand, tolerance seems
to develop to all the major effects of narcotics. It &quot;is
characterized by a shortened duration and decreased intensity of
the analgesic, sedative, and other CNS depressant effects as well
as by a marked elevation in the average lethal dose.&quot;&quot;
As observed in the section on toxicity, limits on tolerance have
not yet been determined. </p>

<p>Tolerance takes two forms. First, the body to some extent may
increase its ability to metabolize or excrete the drug. While
this has not been shown to be directly the case for the opiates,
it has been shown that brain morphine levels become lower in
tolerant than in nontolerant animals eight hours after drug
administration. Secondly, constant brain levels of morphine will
produce less effect in tolerant than in nontolerant animals,
indicating that there must be some form of adaptation within the
CNS at the cellular level. These two forms of tolerance are
called &quot;drug disposition&quot; and &quot;metabolic
tolerance,&quot; respectively. Several theories have been
developed to explain them-they are too complex to discuss
here-only to come to the same conclusion, namely, that &quot;the
precise mechanisms underlying these two forms of tolerance to
narcotics are not known.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>In a study of drug addiction as a social problem, an important
issue is the speed with which tolerance develops. If, for
example, tolerance develops rapidly, then whenever an addict
increases his dose for a few days-or possibly even for a day-he
will become tolerant to the increased dose and must therefore
maintain at least that level of habit from then on to avoid
withdrawal symptoms. Experimental evidence indicates that
tolerance does develop rapidly. Human subjects have been brought
to a level of 500 mg. of morphine within ten days. Tolerance to
morphine begins with the first dose administered and builds
rapidly; tolerance to heroin lags for a few days, then follows
the same course. In animal experiments, it has been found that a
dog, when given morphine continuously for eight hours, will begin
to recover from behavioral depression by the end of that time,
indicating a rapid development of tolerance to a given
concentration of morphine in the body.&quot; </p>

<p>It is not clear whether tolerance increases arithmetically or
geometrically. For example, although a nonaddict might find 100
mg. of morphine fatal, none of the sources indicates whether a
dose of 200 mg. would be fatal to an addict who was already
taking 100 mg. per day, or whether a dose of 600 mg. would be
fatal to an addict on 500 mg. </p>

<p>Another important question is how long tolerance lasts after
an individual has been abstinent for a time. Generally, it is
believed that tolerance disappears when the drug taking stops.
There are numerous street stories to the effect that addicts will
voluntarily detoxify themselves to the point where their habit
becomes such as to be economically supportable. Yet, in one
classic experiment rats were found to retain substantial
tolerance to morphine for almost a year after the last
administration of the drug.&quot; </p>

<p>The final important aspect of tolerance is the phenomenon of
cross@tolerance between drugs. Morphine, heroin, methadone, and
meperidine are at least partial substitutes for one another, and
tolerance to one confers tolerance to equipotent doses of the
others. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence and Withdrawal. </i>The term
&quot;physical dependence&quot; or &quot;physical addiction&quot;
means that an organism requires a drug for &quot;normal&quot;
physical functioning. Abstinence will result in physical symptoms
of varying types and severity until the body adapts to the new
state. The term &quot;addiction,&quot; however, is eschewed by
experts in the drug-abuse field. Since drug abuse is dependent on
an intermixture of physical and psychic variables, and since
drugs of abuse are often used in such low doses that the degree
of actual physical addiction is questionable, experts feel that
it is more correct to use the terminology &quot;drug dependence
of the morphine type&quot; or &quot;drug dependence of the
barbiturate type.&quot;&quot; Even the withdrawal symptoms
developed by abstinent users may be psychogenic in origin. In
addition, users of drugs that are not powerfully addictive
physically (e.g., tobacco) sometimes have a more difficult time
in abstaining from use than do users of addictive drugs. For
these reasons, it makes some sense to blur the distinction
between physical and psychological dependence when discussing
drug abuse as a social problem. </p>

<p>This should not induce the belief, however, that there is no
such thing as physical addiction or physical dependence. Clearly,
an opiate user becomes physically dependent in the sense that
abstinence will cause severe and well-documented physical
symptoms. These include restlessness and drug craving, followed
by yawning, lacrimation, runny nose, perspiration, fever, chills,
vomiting, panting respiration, loss of appetite, insomnia,
hypertension, general aches and pains, and loss of weight. The
intensity can be &quot;nearly unbearable&quot; if the dosage is
high enough.&quot; </p>

<p>Several researchers have commented that withdrawal from
opiates-as well as from barbiturates and other hypnotics-is
characterized by <i>rebound hyperexcitability; </i>that is,
during withdrawal, the physiological systems that were depressed
by the drug are in a state of increased excitability. It is not
clear, however, whether all withdrawal symptoms are rebound
effects, or whether this is a general,rule applicable to other
drugs as well.&quot; </p>

<p>Withdrawal from the various opiates has been studied
scientifically. As a general rule, the intensity and duration of
the withdrawal symptoms are related to the intensity and duration
of the drug's action. Thus, morphine withdrawal starts within a
few hours (four to ten, depending on the user's tolerance level),
peaks rapidly (around the second day of abstinence), then
declines sharply. Most of the obvious symptoms disappear within
seven to ten days. Meperidine withdrawal reaches its peak in
about twelve hours and lasts only four or five days. In some
ways, however, its peak intensity is greater than that of
morphine withdrawal. Withdrawal from methadone follows a slower
course. No symptoms appear until about the third day. After this,
they increase steadily until between the sixth and the ninth day,
when they peak at a level less than two-thirds as intense as the
peak for morphine withdrawal. Thereafter, they decline slowly,
not disappearing until after about two weeks. The maximum
intensity of methadone withdrawal is always tolerable, but its
duration may be the factor that causes some addicts to regard the
withdrawal from methadone as nastier than the withdrawal from
morphine.&quot; </p>

<p>The disappearance of the gross symptoms does not mean,
however, that the withdrawal is complete. Increasingly,
researchers are finding some effects that persist for many weeks
longer, and empirical observations show that the relapse
vulnerability is greatest immediately after withdrawal. Dr.
William Martin divides the abstinence syndrome into <i>early and
protracted </i>abstinence. In human experiments, subjects were
stabilized on 240 mg. of morphine, then withdrawn slowly over a
period of three weeks. They showed the general withdrawal
symptoms discussed above, although in milder degree than occurs
after sudden withdrawal. The symptoms persisted to some extent
for six to nine weeks. After this, the protracted abstinence
syndrome emerged, characterized by minor physical differences
that persisted through the twenty-sixth week of withdrawal. The
clinical significance of this is not clear, for it has not been
proved that protracted abstinence contributes to readdiction. But
careful experiments with rats have shown that postaddict rats
have a greater liking for narcotics than do rats that have never
been addicted. This preference lasts four to six months after
withdrawal.&quot; </p>

<p>While no limit on the development of tolerance to opiates has
been found, there does seem to be a limit on the degree of
physical dependence that can be developed, as measured by the
intensity of the withdrawal symptoms. For morphine, this maximum
is reached at dosages of around 400-500 mg. per day; higher doses
do not result in more intense withdrawal symptoms.&quot; </p>

<p>This points up the fact that tolerance to, and physical
dependence on, a drug are not the same thing. The body can even
develop a tolerance to drugs on which it does not become
physically dependent. But tolerance is always present when
physical dependence develops. </p>

<p>In the case of the opiates, the speed with which physical
dependence develops seems to lag only slightly behind the speed
of the development of tolerance. A patient receiving therapeutic
doses of morphine for a week or two will not have recognizable
withdrawal symptoms spontaneously after discontinuance, but these
can be precipitated by an antagonist after only two or three days
on morphine. By similar means, withdrawal has been caused in a
dog after an eight-hour infusion of morphine. Goldstein believes
that physical dependence is probably initiated with the first
dose of the drug.&quot; At that stage, of course, withdrawal
would be so mild as to be unnoticeable, but it seems possible
that a single dose could create a craving for the drug, even
though the physical genesis of this feeling would be unknown to
the user. </p>

<p>As might be expected, there are no definitive explanations for
the phenomenon of physical dependence. Its existence is simply
defined by the presence or absence of withdrawal symptoms. Jaffe
states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>At present no single model is able to account for all the
    complex phenomena that are seen with the many classes of
    drugs producing tolerance and physical dependence. It is
    likely that multiple mechanisms are involved, and that each
    model may reflect a facet of the truth. For the present the
    most heuristic models are the best ones <font size="1">.42 <br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Goldstein also observes that, although &quot;the mechanism of
the development of tolerance and physical dependence is still
unknown.... there has been no dearth of theoretical
speculation.&quot;&quot; It appears that dependence is due to
&quot;drug-induced alterations at the cellular level, with the
most prominent changes occurring in the CNS . . . these changes
are not limited to any one part of the CNS but occur throughout
the entire neuraxis.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>The sources are silent, however, on two important questions
about physical dependence and tolerance. The first of these
concerns stabilization dosages. It is well known, for example,
that an addict can be stabilized on a drug, since taking a given
amount will result in neither withdrawal nor euphoria. But there
is little information on how much latitude there is in the
stabilization dose. That is, if a morphine addict is used to 100
mg., can he take anywhere between 90 and 100 mg. without becoming
aware of the difference; or is his tolerance of deviation from
his normal dose less than this? Also, are there variations
between the opiates, depending on peak intensity and duration of
action? Generally, experts believe that it is harder to stabilize
on such short-acting drugs as morphine and heroin than on
methadone. The short, sharp peak and rapid decay characteristic
of the morphine effect may mean that a dose insufficient to
produce euphoria soon results in bodily concentrations too low to
prevent withdrawal. </p>

<p>Another important question is whether the euphoric effect
disappears at high levels of opiate tolerance. That is, will an
addict who is used to 500 mg. of morphine achieve euphoria if he
takes 550 or 600 mg.? The fact that the severity of withdrawal
levels off at around this dose might indicate an upper limit on
the ability to obtain a euphoric effect. None of the sources
found, however, presents evidence to support either possibility. </p>

<p>Finally, it is well known that physical dependence on a given
opiate can be satisfied by any other opiate. This is the
pbenomenon of cross-dependence, described by Jaffe as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Cross-dependence may be partial or complete, and the
    degree is more closely related to pharmacological effects
    than to chemical similarities. A broad-spectrum drug such as
    methadone, which depresses the entire range of functions that
    are similarly affected by morphine, can completely substitute
    for morphine or meperidine. However, meperidine, which has a
    narrower spectrum with less autonomic and sedative effects,
    does not entirely prevent the autonomic manifestations of
    withdrawal from morphine. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In general, any potent narcotic analgesic, regardless of
    chemical class, will show cross-dependence with other
    narcotic analgesics . <font size="1">. . . 45<br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="1">METHADONE MAINTENANCE </font></p>

<p>A successful method of treating heroin addicts is to maintain
them on daily doses of methadone. More detail about the programs
using this technique is contained in Staff Paper 3. </p>

<p>The pharmacological basis of methadone maintenance has been
covered in preceding sections, albeit implicitly. The significant
characteristics are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Methadone is a synthetic opiate. Its administration to a
        heroin addict will either prevent the withdrawal symptoms
        caused by abstinence from heroin or end them if they have
        already developed. </li>
    <li>Methadone and the other opiates exhibit cross-tolerance.
        A person tolerant to one of them is tolerant to
        equipotent doses of another. </li>
    <li>The action of oral methadone lasts about twenty-four
        hours. A methadone program can administer the drug once a
        day, rather than three or four times, as would be
        necessary if morphine or heroin were used. </li>
    <li>High doses of methadone (e.g., about 80 mg. or more) will
        prevent withdrawal, block the euphoric effect from an
        injection of heroin, and prevent the &quot;drug
        hunger&quot; (defined by Dr. Jerome Jaffe as &quot;a felt
        sense of physical abnormality&quot;) felt by addicts who
        have become abstinent. </li>
    <li>Lower doses of methadone (e.g., 50 mg.) will prevent
        withdrawal and the drug hunger. They will not block the
        euphoric effect of an injection of heroin, although
        presumably some minimum quantity of heroin is required.
        The success rate for programs using low doses is
        approximately the same as the rate for those using high
        doses for addicts in treatment six months. Experts
        believe that blocking the euphoria is not so important as
        preventing the drug hunger. </li>
    <li>No significantly harmful side effects of methadone have
        been discovered.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The effects of methadone on the heroin addict have been
described diagrammatically by Dr. Vincent Dole.&quot;'<br>
</p>

<p>Fig. 1. Diagrammatic summary of the functional state of a
typical &quot;mainline&quot; heroin user. Arrow shows the
repetitive injection of heroin in uncertain dose, usually 10 to

<p><img src="img00003.gif" align="bottom" width="1132"
height="397"> </p>

<p>Some important questions about the nature of methadone
treatment remain unanswered. Because methadone and heroin can be
substituted for each other in so many ways, it would seem logical
that their effects would be cumulative, and that the addict on
methadone would be able to achieve the euphoric state with a
smaller dose of heroin than he normally used. Certainly, other
drugs, such as alcohol and the barbiturates, have cumulative
effects. Yet, many of the discussions about methadone treatment
evidently assume, with actually saying so, that their effects are
not cumulative. </p>

<p>The explanation may lie in the pharmacological principle that
the body's response to many drugs is logarithmic, not linear.
That is, as the dosage is increased, steadily larger incremental
doses are required to produce a constant increment of response.
Heroin and methadone may be cumulative in their effects, but the
administration of methadone elevates the recipient to a point on
the dose-response curve where only very large additional amounts
of heroin have discernible impact.&quot; </p>

<p>In this context, it is important to remember the suggestion
made earlier that there may be a limit of 120-150 mg. per day of
heroin (the equivalent of 400-500 mg. of morphine) above which
additional amounts of the drug have no euphoric effect. If this
limit is roughly true, even with substantial individual
variations, then many methadone programs may simply boost the
addict to the point where he cannot attain euphoria. Either he
reaches this limit, which would be true at about 180 mg. per day
of methadone, or he reaches a dosage that leaves too small a
margin between his tolerance level and this limit for a euphoric
dose. Lower doses (e.g., 50 mg.) would not approach the euphoric
limit, but they might shift an addict to a point on the
doseresponse curve where the heroin dose he is used to taking
would not have any euphoric effect. </p>

<p><i>Physiological Factors Underlying Addiction. </i>It is
commonly assumed that the causes of addiction are psychological,
and that there is no inherent physical predisposition to
addiction. There is, however, no experimental evidence that would
rule out the possibility that drug addiction, or at least
vulnerability to drug addiction, has a physiological basis. As
Goldstein says: </p>

<p>Certainly socioenvironmental reasons can be found, <i>ex post
facto, to </i>explain each case of addiction to heroin, the
barbiturates, or alcohol, or of habituation to lysergic acid
diethylamide [LSD], marijuana, nicotine, or amphetamine. But most
people afflicted by the same adverse environmental circumstances
do not seek escape through drug abuse. Despite the present
paucity of evidence, therefore, the possibility should be
entertained that the characteristic effects of psychotropic drugs
upon mood, which underlie the development of drug abuse, may be
at least in part genetically determined. </p>

<p>Investigation in this field has not yet transcended the
difficulties of designing experiments free of self-selection or
other kinds of bias, and of working out methods suitable for
quantitation of subjective responses. It has been found, for
example, that housewives who drink large amounts of coffee
responded entirely differently to a test dose of caffeine in a
placebo-controlled experiment than did housewives who never drink
coffee. The coffee drinkers felt more alert and had a sense of
well-being after caffeine, as compared with placebo. The
non-drinkers obtained significantly fewer effects of this kind;
on the other hand, caffeine made them feel nervous and
&quot;jittery.&quot; But it is not known if the group habituated
to coffee would have reacted in the same way at an earlier age,
before their first exposure to caffeine. Large individual
differences are observed in the sensitivity of people to the
sleep-disturbing actions of caffeine, but again it is not clear
whether or not these are innate differences, independent of any
prior exposure to caffeine. One investigation on the coffee
drinking and smoking habits of monozygotic and dizygotic twins
suggests that these two kinds of drug-seeking behavior are
subject to genetic influences.411 </p>

<p>Dole has suggested that an addict may have an underlying
neurological vulnerability to addiction that is triggered by
opiate use.&quot; More recently, he has indicated that opiate use
may induce a metabolic change that will cause the body to crave
opiates thereafter.&quot; But he is not optimistic about the
potential of research on the question, given the present lack of
testable hypotheses that might explain it.&quot; </p>

<p>Another theory concerning physiological propensity to
addiction is more complex. Martin has suggested that an addict
has a particular physiological vulnerability to stress either
before he takes his first narcotic drug or after he starts taking
it. In Martin's view, this vulnerability is not lost after
withdrawal from the drug, and stress situations will trigger a
physiological reaction that results in a craving for the drug.
Martin believes that there is some experimental evidence for this
view and is more optimistic than Dole about possible
research.&quot;<br>

<p><b>THE HALLUCINOGENS</b> </p>

<p><i>The Drugs.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) </i>is a synthetic drug
discovered in 1938. It is closely related to the ergot family,
and ergotamine tartate, used in treatment of migraine headaches,
can be used as raw material in the manufacture of LSD. </p>

<p><i>Mescaline,</i> an alkaloid of the peyote cactus, was
isolated in 1896. It is about .025 per cent as potent as LSD in
producing an altered state of consciousness. But it is probably
just as powerful. </p>

<p><i>Psilocybin</i> <i>and psilocin </i>are the active alkaloids
of the Mexican magic mushroom and are about 1 per cent as potent
as LSD. </p>

<p><i>DOM </i>(also called STP) and MDA are other hallucinogens
chemically related to both mescaline and amphetamine. </p>

<p>DMT (dimethyl tryptamine) is a short-acting hallucinogen. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses.&quot;</i> Although there are no recognized
medical uses for the hallucinogens at present, some of them have
been, and are being, used experimentally for a variety of
research and therapeutic purposes. LSD and mescaline, for
instance, have been used for research on mental illness and in
psychotherapy. Since certain effects of these drugs mimic the
symptoms of schizophrenia in some ways, it has long been thought
that study of these effects will yield insights into the nature
and causes of psychotic states. A few experiments have been
conducted in which terminal-cancer patients are given LSD in
order to make the &quot;waiting for death&quot; period more
meaningful. Through the LSD experience, the patient learns to
live in the &quot;here and now,&quot; taking each day as it comes
rather than dwelling on his past. Alcoholics and drug addicts
have also been given LSD as part of more comprehensive courses of
treatment. </p>

<p><i>Physical Eflects and Toxicity. </i>LSD is effective when
taken orally, which is the usual method of administration. Some
users claim to have taken it nasally or by injection and state
that injected LSD produces a powerful rush. It produces some
somatic effects that are sympathomimetic, such as pupillary
dilation, increased blood pressure, tremor, nausea, muscular
weakness, and increased body temperature, but these effects are
usually minor. The major effects are almost entirely on the
CNS.&quot; </p>

<p>The effective dosage is quite small. Perceptual changes, the
most dramatic result, can be produced by as little as 251 mcg.
(micrograms). (I gram = 1,000 milligrams = 1,000,000
micrograms.)&quot; The standard dose taken by LSD users is
probably around 200 mcg., although the variability of street
drugs makes it difficult to be accurate. </p>

<p>Although no human deaths as a result of the pharmacological
action of LSD have been reported, animal deaths due to
respiratory failure have occurred in response to massive doses.
At present, it is not clear whether there is a fatal dose for
humans, but it is clear that the ratio of the lethal dose (if
there is one) to the therapeutic dose is very high. It is
difficult to determine the significance of animal experiments for
humans, because different species have markedly different
reactions. Some animals, for example, have been found to be
resistant to LSD; mice, in particular, detoxify the drug quickly,
and the half-life (the period within which half the drug is
metabolized) in a mouse is only seven minutes. In a human, the
half-life is approximately three to three-and-a-half hours; the
total duration of action of the drug is about twelve hours .57 </p>

<p>Despite claims to the contrary, there is no reliable evidence
that LSD causes birth defects. The early studies on this have
been discredited, and no definitive work has been done
since.&quot; One exhaustive study concluded that pure LSD, in
moderate doses, &quot;does not produce chromosome damage
detectable by available methods.&quot;&quot; This problem is
difficult to study, because that part of the population that uses
LSD heavily is also likely to be malnourished, careless about
hygiene and prenatal care, and prone to a variety of physical
problems. Since LSD seems to be a relatively specific drug, in
that it acts primarily on the CNS and has few peripheral effects,
it is not particularly logical to expect that it will produce
birth defects. It would be more sensible to study the large
number of legal drugs that have massive effects on various body
systems, because they would be more likely to affect the
reproductive system as well. The stress on birth defects as a
possible result of LSD appears to be motivated more by the desire
to prevent its use than by the desire to prevent birth defects. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Eflects.&quot; </i>The hallucinogens do not
produce hallucinations in the classic sense-it is rare for a user
to see things that are not there. Rather, perception is altered:
Afterimages are prolonged and overlap with present perceptions;
objects seem to move in a wavelike fashion or melt; and sensory
impressions become overwhelming. Synesthesia-a state where colors
are &quot;heard&quot; and sound is &quot;seen&quot;-is common. </p>

<p>Perhaps more important to the user than these perceptual
effects are the subjective effects. Time may seem to pass very
slowly; self-boundaries appear to disintegrate; and the user soon
comes to feel a sense of oneness with the universe. There may
also be a sense of unusual clarity, and one's thoughts may begin
to assume extraordinary importance. Moods may change radically,
from gaiety to depression, from elation to fear, or vice versa. </p>

<p>Many users attach great meaning to their experiences. Some
regard the use of LSD as a form of psychotherapy, since they
believe it increases <b>one's </b>self-knowledge and
self-awareness, largely through the recall of old and hitherto
buried memories. Others may go further and emphasize the mystical
and religious aspects of their drug-induced feelings. </p>

<p>Some of the possible, long-term psychological reactions were
examined in an experiment in which LSD was administered to
previously naive subjects. The subjects were given a number of
psychological tests-before taking LSD, immediately after the
experience, and six months later.&quot; All changes were quite
small; the main findings indicated a negative correlation between
the use of LSD, on the one hand, and aggression, competition, and
preference for structure and conformity, on the other. Rather, a
positive correlation with an increase in aesthetic appreciation
was found. One result of the experiment was proved particularly
illuminating: Fifty-nine per cent of the subjects who had been
given 200 mg. of LSD thought that the drug had had lasting
effects on their personality, even though the tests
&quot;provided only minimal supportive evidence.&quot;&quot; In
the control groups, none of those given 25 mg. of LSD, and 13 per
cent of those given 20 mg. of amphetamine, had similar feelings
about the experience. While other researchers have found a
negative correlation between chronic LSD use and aggression and
competition,&quot; there is a self selected quality to the
voluntary chronic user that did not exist in the above
experiment. </p>

<p>The major short-term risk of taking LSD is the &quot;bad
trip,&quot; a term used to describe several different types of
adverse experiences. A mild adverse reaction can mean only that
the images and feelings during the experience were unpleasant. At
the other extreme, a serious panic reaction, accompanied by
immense anxiety and fear, may occur. Bad trips are probably
common, but most of them do not reach the severe level. </p>

<p>Under clinical conditions, serious adverse reactions appear to
be rare. In one study, for instance, it was found that 25,000
administrations of LSD to 5,000 people in clinical settings had
resulted in only 0.08 per cent serious reactions in experimental
subjects and 0.34 per cent in subjects undergoing therapy.
&quot;Serious&quot; was defined as causing either suicide or a
suicide attempt or a psychotic break lasting more than
forty-eight hours. 14 </p>

<p>Of course, most LSD use does not take place under clinical
conditions; some observers believe that such use may therefore
result in higher percentages of adverse effects, for several
reasons. To begin with, putative LSD may be heavily adulterated
with substances ranging from strychnine to methamphetamine. Also,
use of LSD has been an illegal and deviant activity; this may
make users anxious and more susceptible to bad reactions. It is
also possible that a higher proportion of street users have
psychological factors impelling them toward deviant behavior than
would be true of an experimental population. Age differences may
also be an important factor in adverse reactions (a theory in the
field is that young users are more likely to lack the experience
and identity that enable a more mature person to handle the
powerful impact of the drug) . </p>

<p>One could, of course, argue the precise opposite on almost
every point made in the last paragraph. For example, street users
may seek out warm and supportive settings that reduce the
incidence of bad reactions as compared with the clinical setting.
LSD use may be deviant in the context of the larger culture but
not in the subculture within which most users live. Older people,
generally more rigid in their attitudes, may resist the drug
effect and panic, while younger people, being more flexible, may
accept -the drug experience more easily. Contact with a
subculture in which LSD is common may reduce fear of the drug,
regardless of age, more than will clinical reassurances. </p>

<p>At present, there is no rational way to choose between these
arguments. It should be emphasized that reports of large numbers
of serious adverse reactions among street users have not been
documented. What evidence there is consists mostly of anecdotes. </p>

<p>Chlorpromazine, a powerful tranquilizer used in the treatment
of psychiatric illness, will counter the physical effects of <b>LSD
</b>almost immediately. If, however, the LSD user is having a
panic reaction, it may continue in spite of the chlorpromazine.
Physicians familiar with this phenomenon believe that
chemotherapy may prolong panic because of the anxiety its
administration arouses in the patient. &quot;Talking the patient
down&quot; in a calm manner is the preferred treatment .115 </p>

<p>There are some long-term risks associated with LSD use. In
some individuals, prolonged negative effects are associated with
use of hallucinogens; cases of serious depression, paranoid
behavior, and prolonged psychotic episodes have been documented.
Whether the hallucinogens cause these effects is not clear. LSD
may serve only to precipitate them in someone who is about to
have such a problem anyway. The frequency of such effects is not
known. </p>

<p>Another possible long-term effect of the hallucinogens is the
flashbacks recurrence of some aspect of the drug experience vhen
the subject is nor under the influence of the drug. The flash)ack
encompasses a wide range of possible LSD-like perceptual or
subjective effects of varying degrees of severity and duration,
lasting from a few minutes to several hours and occurring with
indeterminate frequency. The user is not affected between
experiences. Causation has not been definitely proved, however,
and it could be that a controlled experiment would find similar
experiences in a non-LSD-using populations&quot; </p>

<p>The most common type of flashback recorded is the recurrence
of perceptual distortion; the rarest is the recurrence of altered
physical sensation; and the most dangerous is the recurrence of
disturbing emotion and panic. (This may be hard to distinguish
from the depressive reaction or schizophrenic episodes discussed
above.) The last two types of flashbacks are more likely to occur
after a bad trip than after a good one. </p>

<p>Assuming that flashbacks are caused by LSD, the mechanism
responsible is a mystery. The theory that LSD persists in the
nervous system is not compatible with its known short life, and
the theory of a persistent, undiscovered metabolite is
incompatible with the wide variations in onset and duration.
Nevertheless, there is no lack of other theories, ranging from
semipermanent changes in the optic pathways, to learned responses
to stress, to dissociative reactions. Generally, it is probably
psychological rather than chemical, but, given the lack of
knowledge about the relationship between psychological and
chemical events, this conclusion does not tell very much.&quot; </p>

<p>There is no information on the incidence of flashbacks, the
extent to which they occur after only one LSD experience, or the
relative frequency of the different types. </p>

<p>The effects of the other hallucinogens are similar to those of
LSD. Mescaline, which lasts as long and has about the same
effects, although it is less potent, seems to be the usergs drug
of choice. It is unclear whether this preference is due to the
publicity regarding possible birth defects caused by LSD or to
some subtle difference in effect. It may just as well be due to
the belief of many users that natural substances are superior to
synthetics, a factor that may also account for the preference for
the mushroom hallucinogens. This question has not been studied
clinically, and it is difficult to know the effects of natural
hallucinogens, since they are rarely available. Most street
mescaline is either LSD or LSD plus speed or some other
adulterant. </p>

<p>DOM (STP), MDA, and some other drugs are a cross between
hallucinogens and amphetamines. The duration of action of DOM is
sixteen to twenty-four hours, and rough observations indicate
that the incidence of panic reactions and flashbacks has been
higher than that associated with LSD. The physiological effects
(rapid heart rate, dry mouth, dilated pupils) are also more
pronounced. It is possible that, when the drug first appeared,
users were more prone to panic, because they were not prepared
for the long duration and greater physical reaction.&quot; Jaffe
states that low doses of DOM give some of the subjective effects
of LSD without the perceptual or hallucinogenic effects, although
the drug has typical psychedelic action at higher doses.&quot; </p>

<p>According to some sources, MDA causes an LSD-type reaction for
the first six to eight hours, but it also has amphetaminelike
effects that persist for a longer time. Other reports are that
MDA is <i>sui generis, </i>with LSD-like subjective feelings but
without the perceptual distortion of LSD or
depersonalization.&quot; </p>

<p>DMT is a hallucinogen whose effects last only forty-five
minutes to an hour. It is sometimes called &quot;the
businessman's lunch.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. </i>Tolerance to the hallucinogens develops
rapidly. If taken daily for three or four days, LSD will cease to
have any substantial effect.&quot; The tolerance does not appear
to be so closely tied to the dosage as in the case with other
drugs to which tolerance develops-that is, it seems that one
cannot achieve the desired effect simply by increasing the dose.
The sources, however, are ambivalent on this. Sensitivity returns
after a few days of abstinence. </p>

<p>There is cross-tolerance among LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin
but not between any of these and the amphetamines.&quot; There is
no information on DOM, MDA, or DMT on this point. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence and Withdrawal. </i>Hallucinogens such
as LSD and mescaline do not produce physical dependence, and
there are no withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation.&quot;
Again, there appears to be little information on DOM, MDA, or
DMT; at least, there are no reports of dependence or withdrawal.
They are likely to be about the same as LSD. </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>A number of CNS effects of LSD
are known; the manner in which LSD causes these effects, however,
is still not known. LSD and the other hallucinogens interfere
with the production and action of serotonin (also called 5-HT or
5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain. This is an important body
substance with significant effects on many organ systems. But,
since the functions of serotonin in the CNS are not known, this
does not represent substantial progress in understanding
LSD.&quot; <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CANNABIS&quot;<br>
</b></p>

<p><i>The Drugs. Cannabis sativa, </i>the hemp plant, grows
almost everywhere in the world. It flourishes in hot, dry
climates, and it is generally believed that plants produced in
such regions have the most pronounced psychoactive effects. <i>Marijuana
</i>consists of the chopped leaves and stems of the cannabis
plant. It is usually smoked, but it can be taken orally. <i>Hashish
</i>is formed of resin scraped from the flowering top of the
cannabis plant. It, too, can be smoked or eaten, and it is
thought to be about five to eight times as potent as marijuana.
Some experts believe there are qualitative differences in effect
as well as simple differences in potency. <i>Kil, bhang, and
gania </i>are other preparations of cannabis used in various
parts of the world. Their potency lies between that of marijuana
and that of hashish. </p>

<p>The most important psychoactive ingredient of cannabis is
known to be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but the
possibility of additional ingredients exercising some effect has
not been precluded. </p>

<p><i>Cannabis </i>is a difficult drug to classify. Although it
is often referred to as a mild hallucinogen, it does not have
many of the effects associated with hallucinogens, and probably
has a different mechanism of action altogether. It also has some
sedative effects but lacks many of the other characteristics of
the sedative hypnotics. With good reason, therefore, it is
usually classified as unique.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses. </i>There is no accepted medical use for <i>cannabis
</i>in the United States. In the past, especially during the late
nineteenth century, it was quite popular among European and
American doctors, who prescribed it for a variety of ailments
ranging from menstrual cramps to migraine headaches. It was thus
used generally as a mild anodyne (pain killer) or
tranquilizer-but it may have more specific effects as well.&quot;
</p>

<p>By the early twentieth century, the use of <i>cannabis </i>for
medical purposes had declined, largely because of inconsistency
in the potency of the drug. Since <i>cannabis </i>was cultivated
in many places with wide variations in climatic and soil
conditions, no physician could be sure of potency of any given
batch. This made it difficult to predict results. It also
inhibited research, since nonreplication of scientific findings
might invariably have been due to differences in the drugs used. </p>

<p>Another problem was that there was no satisfactory way to
administer the drug for medical purposes. Smoking is not a
medically acceptable method, because the doctor cannot know how
much of the drug is being inhaled and absorbed. Oral
administration is possible, but effects are delayed. Moreover,
since neither the plant material nor the resin is soluble in
water, injection is difficult. Thus, as other drugs became
available-particularly the barbiturate sedative hypnotics, which
began appearing on the market in <i>1903-cannabis </i>was
replaced. </p>

<p>Almost no research has been done on the drug since the late
nineteenth century, and government policies made such research
impossible from 1937 to about 1968. Whether <i>cannabis </i>has
unique medical uses or is in some ways superior to common
tranquilizers now in use is therefore an open question. A revival
of interest is now taking place, however, in the medical
community. For example, several doctors are using <i>cannabis </i>to
treat migraine headaches, and some research is being done into
its effectiveness as a treatment for epilepsy. Certain variants
of THC may lower the blood pressure of hypertensive people.&quot;
</p>

<p>The isolation and synthesis of THC-achieved in the early
1960's-has promoted such research by making consistency in dosage
conceivable for the first time. In addition, NIMH has a project
under way to cultivate <i>cannabis </i>in Mississippi, with the
objective of providing drugs of constant quality to researchers.
But there are still problems: For example, there is some evidence
that THC is subject to oxidation, and that the potency of <i>cannabis
</i>may therefore change over a period of time that varies with
storage methods. Also, THC is expensive to synthesize and remains
in short supply. Recent work has developed at least one water
soluble derivative of THC with a pharmacological profile similar
to that of the original drugs. This should aid research further. </p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity. </i>The immediate physical
effects <i>of cannabis </i>on man are mild. Heart rate is
increased moderately. There is a dilation of the conjunctival
blood vessels (i.e., a reddening of the eyes) and sometimes an
increase in heart rate. There appear to be no changes in
respiratory rate, pupil size, or blood-sugar level. After a
single inhaled dose, measurable physical effects reach a maximum
within half an hour and diminish three to five hours later.&quot;
When <i>cannabis </i>is eaten, the effects are delayed for
several hours, and symptoms may persist for up to twenty-four
hours. </p>

<p>As discussed in the next section, subjective effects of high
doses of the cannabinols may be similar to those of LSD. This has
led some to classify them as mild hallucinogens. Physical effects
are not the same, however, because <i>cannabis </i>does not have
the stimulating effects of LSD and has sedative properties that
LSD lacks. There is no cross-tolerance between the cannabinols
and the hallucinogens.&quot; </p>

<p>At present, there is no reliable evidence of organic damage,
and the most that can be said against <i>cannabis </i>is that the
effects of long-term or heavy use have not been ascertained. To
be sure, heavy, long-term smokers of <i>cannabis </i>develop
bronchial disorders, but these seem no different from the
difficulties experienced by heavy smokers of tobacco. Reports of
long-term brain damage are suspect, at best. For one thing, they
derive from studies of <i>cannabis </i>users in underdeveloped
countries, such as India and Morocco. These studies, furthermore,
are skewed by the fact that they used inmates of mental
institutions as subjects and assumed a causative relation if they
found that the inmates had been users of <i>cannabis. </i>Scientific
protective devices, such as control groups and blind studies,
were lacking. The recent crash program of federal research has
not filled this gap, and many experts do not expect that it will
do so. In this view, gross organic damage would have been found
before now, and long term subtle damage is difficult to study
retrospectively. </p>

<p>The lethal dose of THC for humans has not been determined, but
it is known that the cannabinols are not very toxic: There has
yet to be a report of a human death due to an overdose of THC.
Animal experiments have found that the 16thal dose for rats is
between 800 and 1,400 milligrams of drug per kilogram of body
weight for oral administration. Extrapolating from studies in
mice, the ratio of the lethal dose to the effective dose for
humans would be about 40,000 to 1. (The effective dose is that
amount necessary to produce clinically desired effects. For THC
in humans, it is about 50 micrograms per kilogram.) By way of
comparison, the ratio for barbiturates is about 10 to 1&quot; </p>

<p>Recent research has found that injected THC has a half-life in
the body of fifty-six hours, and that traces can be found in the
urine for up to eight days. There is also a possibility that it
may accumulate in lung or fat tissue.&quot; The clinical
implications of these facts, however, are not known. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Effects. </i>The general effect of <i>cannabis
</i>is &quot;a subtle mood change not easily perceived by the
novice.&quot;&quot; The most common mood encouraged by the drug
is a sense of increased well-being, but this is heavily dependent
on the setting and expectations of the user. The nervousness that
may accompany first use, for example, can negate any reaction to
the drug. Set and setting help to produce a wide range of
reactions and may be more crucial determinants of the effects of <i>cannabis
</i>use than those of most other drugs.&quot; The effects
described below are those observed in clinical trials and
obtained from interviews with users. </p>

<p>One important effect is the enhancement of the senses.
Sensitivity to colors, sounds, patterns, textures, and taste is
greatly increased. Perception of space and time is distorted in
ways that can be either pleasing or disconcerting. In particular,
time passes very slowly. Inhibitions may be relaxed in a manner
reminiscent of the effects of low doses of alcohol. The subject
may develop a sense of being in a fantasy or dreamlike state (an
effect achieved also by sedatives and anesthetics). </p>

<p>In clinical experiments, large doses of THC have produced
LSD-type experiences, but this requires quantities of THC far in
excess of the concentrations found in organic <i>cannabis. Real </i>hallucinations
do not occur. </p>

<p>The dose-response curve of THC has not yet been established;
nor have systematic comparisons of THC and LSD been made. </p>

<p>Significant adverse reactions to <i>cannabis </i>are rare, but
they do occur. They are more common when strong forms, such as
hashish, are used. There are four types that may result: </p>

<p>(1) simple depression, (2) a panic state, (3) toxic psychosis,
and (4) psychotic break. </p>

<p>Of the four, the simple depression reaction is the mildest and
most common. Its genesis is not known. People may be responding
idiosyncratically to pharmacological effects of the drug; or <i>the
cannabis </i>may intensify pre-existing but suppressed
psychological states or traits. It is likely, also, that the
different explanations might each account for some of the
depressions seen. In any event, the reaction ends spontaneously. </p>

<p>The panic reaction occurs when a user interprets the use or
effects of <i>cannabis </i>as a threat to life or sanity. It is
most likely to occur in subjects with no prior drug experience
who are ambivalent toward drug use and possibly fearful of police
arrest. Verbal and personal support by peers is the most
effective therapy; hospitalization and the use of tranquilizers
are usually contraindicated unless the person is highly
agitated.&quot; </p>

<p>Many panic reactions have been misdiagnosed as examples of
toxic psychosis-a condition in which the presence of toxins in
the body causes organic malfunction in the cerebral cortex and a
resultant psychotic state. This reaction is even rarer than the
panic reaction and ends when the toxins are flushed from the
system. A user is vulnerable to such a reaction when consuming <i>cannabis
</i>in concentrated forms, especially if the drug is mixed with
food and drink. The effects are delayed while the drug is being
absorbed, and the user cannot use the effects of the drug as a
measure of when he has had enough. In the view of some experts,
smoking <i>cannabis </i>allows the user to regulate consumption
in reaction to the immediate effects of the drug's passing into
the blood stream via the lungs. </p>

<p>The view that differences in reaction to the two methods of
administration are due to control of dosage can be questioned,
however. Dr. Andrew Weil states: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This theory of autotitration sounds nice, but I do not see
    it happen much. Most marijuana smokers I know smoke as much
    as they are handed. What is interesting is that one reaches
    some sort of ceiling in smoking: beyond a certain point, one
    does not get any higher, only more sedated. With oral
    ingestion, on the other hand, one can <br>
    easily get into the toxic range. These observations suggest
    pharmacological differences between the two routes of
    administration.86<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of <i>cannabis </i>may also trigger a psychotic break
in individuals who have normal psychological histories. Although
evidence is scarce, the degree of risk is probably very small. A
recent study reviewed twelve cases of <i>cannabis-related </i>psychotic
breaks arising over a ten-month period among soldiers stationed
in Vietnam. Only two of the twelve had &quot;significant
psychiatric histories and diagnosis of personality
disorder.&quot; In all cases, the reaction occurred after the
first use of <i>cannabis </i>and was self limiting, in that the
condition cleared spontaneously.&quot; Since about 30 per cent of
the 500,000 American soldiers in Vietnam at the time had probably
consumed <i>cannabis </i>at least once, often in potent form, the
incidence seems low. </p>

<p>Other data support this conclusion. During a fifteen-month
period, approximately 30,000 persons were treated at the Haight
Ashbury Clinic for a variety of medical and psychiatric problems.
An estimated 95 per cent had used <i>cannabis. </i>No case of a
psychotic break was recorded.&quot; </p>

<p>The risk of a psychotic break may be higher for users who have
a history of mental disorder. There is some evidence to support
this, but there are no statistical data on the degree to which
such population is at greater risk than &quot;normals.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. Cannabis </i>appears to have the unusual
property of &quot;reverse tolerance,&quot; in that regular users
are more sensitive to the drug than novices. This characteristic
has been conventional wisdom within the drug culture for some
time; it is supported by a recent scientific study that used
radioactive isotope tagging to detect THC in body tissues several
days after the drug had been injected. The conclusion was that
THC may accumulate in the body, so that a regular user may
already have a &quot;basic dose&quot; and require only a small,
additional amount to obtain a psychoactive effect.&quot; </p>

<p>It is not known whether pharmacological tolerance to <i>cannabis
</i>develops. Because of the &quot;reverse tolerance&quot;
effect, experts have assumed that there was no such tolerance;
but, if the effects are cumulative, then &quot;reverse
tolerance&quot; in users could be accompanied by pharmacological
tolerance. For example, when synhexyl, a potent synthetic <i>cannabis
</i>derivative, is administered, tolerance develops in four to
six days.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence. </i>There is little evidence that
physical dependence develops with the consumption of <i>cannabis,
</i>and no significant withdrawal symptoms accompany cessation of
use. If dependence of any kind develops, it is probably
psychological, but even this appears to be minimal.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>The way in which <i>cannabis
causes </i>CNS effects is not known. </p>

of marijuana have recently been published, taking up many of the
above issues in greater depth. Some of these are </p>

<p><b>THE MAJOR STIMULANTS<br>
</b></p>

<p><i>The Drugs.&quot; </i>This category of drugs includes those
that have the effect of stimulating physical and mental activity
and of providing a feeling of such stimulation to the user: </p>

<p><i>Amphetamines </i>are synthetic drugs that are part of the
general category of sympathomirnetic agents-a group of drugs
whose effects resemble the response to stimulation of certain
nerves of the sympathetic nerve system (hence
&quot;sympathomimetic&quot;). They are CNS stimulants. </p>

<p><i>Methamphetamine </i>is a close relative of the
amphetamines. The major distinction is that it has a different
ratio between central effects and peripheral actions than do the
basic amphetamines. Small doses of methamphetamine produce
prominent central stimulant reactions without significant
peripheral effects. </p>

<p><i>Cocaine </i>is an alkaloid of the coca plant. In general
effects, it is quite similar to the amphetamines. </p>

<p><i>Methylphenidate (Ritalin) </i>is a mild CNS stimulant,
between caffeine and the amphetamines in its effects. </p>

<p><i>Phenmetrazine (Preludin) </i>is also a sympathomimetic
agent. Its effects are almost indistinguishable from those of
amphetamines. </p>

<p>This section discusses amphetamines primarily, as the
prototype. Significant differences are noted as relevant. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses.&quot; </i>The amphetamines are used to treat
a rare condition called narcolepsy-the inability to stay awake.
They are also used in the treatment of obesity because of their
characteristic of depressing the appetite centers, but the
results in this area are unimpressive. Amphetamines are useful in
the treatment of children with hyperkinesis. This condition,
which is also called minimal brain dysfunction, is one in which a
child shows an inability to concentrate, a deficiency in motor
skills, a low frustration level, and often an abnormal EEG
pattern. </p>

<p>Quasimedical uses are very common. Amphetamines increase
short-term physical and mental performance and are widely used by
people who desire this effect, such as students and athletes.
They are also used by people who have become dependent on or
habituated to them to maintain their normal level of functioning.
</p>

<p>Cocaine is not used medically for any of the above purposes,
but it is used as a local anesthetic. </p>

<p>Ritalin is effective in treating hyperkinesis and, because it
is milder than the amphetamines, may be the drug of choice.&quot;
</p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity. </i>In different relative
degrees, sympathomimetic agents have the following major
actions:&quot; </p>

<p>A peripheral excitatory action on such smooth muscles as those
in blood vessels supplying the skin and on salivary and some
sweat glands; </p>

<p>A peripheral inhibitory effect on other types of smooth
muscles, such as those in the wall of the gut, on the bronchial
tree, and on the blood vessels supplying the skeletal muscle; A
cardiac excitatory action that increases heart rate and force of
contraction; </p>

<p>Certain metabolic actions; </p>

<p>CNS excitatory actions, such as respiratory stimulation and
others. </p>

<p>Amphetamines follow this scheme. Blood pressure is increased,
and the smooth muscle responses, while somewhat unpredictable,
are as indicated. The amphetamines are more potent in their CNS
effects than other drugs in the group, and it is through the
effects on the CNS that they stimulate respiration, depress the
appetite, and reverse fatigue. The results of an oral dose of 10
to 30 mg. of amphetamine (the standard therapeutic dose is 10
mg.) are wakefulness, alertness, decreased sense of fatigue,
elevation of mood with increased initiative, confidence, and
ability to concentrate, elation and euphoria, and an increase in
motor and speech activity. Prolonged use or heavy dosage is
followed by mental depression and fatigue. </p>

<p>Cocaine has the same effects as the amphetamines. The major
difference is that the effects of the amphetamines last several
hours, while those of cocaine seem to last only minutes.&quot;
Ritalin has less motor effect on motor and mental activities than
do the amphetamines. Some CNS effect is produced by doses that
have little effect on respiration and blood pressure.&quot; </p>

<p>The amphetamines can be quite toxic. Severe reactions have
occurred with only 30 mg., and death has resulted from 120 mg. of
injected amphetamine. The range is wide, however, and doses of
400 to 500 mg. have been survived by nontolerant individuals.
Death from overdose is quite rare, possibly because the ratio of
lethal to effective psychoactive dose is high for a tolerant
user.&quot; </p>

<p>Cocaine is toxic because the central stimulation that is the
immediate effect of the drug is followed by depression of the
higher nervous centers. Death from respiratory depression occurs
when the vital medullary centers are sufficiently depressed. The
fatal dose of cocaine has been estimated to be about 1.2 grams
taken at one time, but severe toxic effects have been reported on
doses as low as 20 mg.&quot; </p>

<p>The basic symptoms of amphetamine poisoning are extensions of
its normal therapeutic effects on the CNS, the cardiovascular
system, and the gastrointestinal system. A fatal dose ends in
convulsions and coma. Cerebral hemorrhage is a common autopsy
finding, but it is rarely massive. &quot;Pathological findings in
both man and animals are generally nonspecific and show pulmonary
congestion and often congestion of other organs including the
brain.&quot;&quot;' </p>

<p>Amphetamines are usually taken orally, but they can be
injected. Cocaine is not effective when taken orally, but it can
be snorted and absorbed through the mucous membrane or taken
intravenously. Medically, cocaine is only applied to body
surfaces as a local anesthetic; it is not injected or used
internally. </p>

<p>The major, long-term toxic effect of amphetamine use is a
paranoid psychosis that is often indistinguishable from a
schizophrenic reaction. This can occur after continued use or
even after an extremely heavy single dose. It usually disappears
within a week if the individual stops using the drug. Cocaine can
cause the same condition even more rapidly. </p>

<p>Whether these drugs cause long-term organic damage to the body
is at present unknown. Some experts who have worked with
amphetamine users believe that there is a long-term deterioration
that is explicable only in terms of organic damage. At present,
however, this has not been definitely established. In animal
experiments, death often results from continued administration of
methampbetamine, but the reason appears to be that the animal's
disinterest in food, combined with its hyperactivity, results in
a malnourished conditi6n that leaves it vulnerable to infection.
There have been some preliminary reports attributing arterial
disease to methamphetarnine use, but these have not yet been
substantiated and should not be accepted until further evidence
develops. </p>

<p>Hepatitis is very common among amphetamine users. This is to
be expected when hypodermic needles are used without proper
sterilization, but its incidence goes even beyond the level
logically attributable to this cause alone. Some consideration is
now being given to the possibility that amphetamine is itself
directly toxic to the liver. No clinical evidence on this
possibility has been developed, however, and it remains only a
possibility.&quot;' </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Effects. </i>When taken orally, amphetamines
produce an elevation of mood and feeling of power and intensity
that many persons find quite pleasurable. The drugs increase
concentration and physical and mental performance and reduce
fatigue. Some users claim that orgasms are delayed and made more
intense when they occur, but no objective experiments have been
done. </p>

<p>The drugs produce the same effect even when taken
intravenously. In addition, the user obtains a &quot;rush&quot;
that is reputed to be different from, although related to, the
effect obtained from opiate injection. Again, sexual analogies
are often made by users. It is difficult to know whether the rush
is a product of the drug itself or of the process of intravenous
injection. Some users actually prefer impure methamphetamine
because of the belief that the impurities cause a faster, more
intense rush.&quot;' </p>

<p>As the dosage increases, the experience seems to become more
fragmented. Increased ability to concentrate turns either into a
compulsion to do repetitive tasks over and over or into a total
focusing of attention on some object or toy. Heavy users have a
compulsion to take mechanical objects apart and a similar
compulsion to try (unsuccessfully) to put them together again.
Such repetitive behavior occurs in animals as well as in
humans.&quot;' </p>

<p>Eventually-and fairly predictably-heavy amphetamine use during
a limited period of time will result in paranoid ideation and the
toxic psychosis discussed above. To some extent, users are aware
of this aspect of amphetamine use and can make allowances for it
during the experience. They will not act on moderate ideas of
persecution or visual illusions. If the run continues long
enough, this control will be lost. </p>

<p>Some heavy users may become chronically psychotic, in that
they exhibit psychotic symptoms even when not taking the drug.
The California experience is that normal functioning returns over
a period of six to twelve months, although the user himself may
feel some residual disablement .104 </p>

<p>Cocaine has roughly the same effects as amphetamines in terms
of creating feelings of well-being, euphoria, and power.
According to the accounts of users, these feelings are even
stronger with cocaine than with the amphetamines, but reliable
evidence is unobtainable. </p>

<p>Tolerance.&quot; Tolerance to most effects of the amphetamines
develops rapidly, and very high dosage levels can be reached. A
speed user on a run may inject as much as a gram of the drug
every two or three hours around the clock for several days.
Whether this is drug disposition or cellular tolerance is not
known. The development of tolerance is not uniform, however, and
the ability to withstand what would otherwise be a fatal dose
does not confer tolerance to the toxic psychosis. </p>

<p>It is not certain that tolerance to cocaine develops. There
are reports of very large doses-such as 10 grams per day-but
individuals seem able to tolerate the same doses after a period
of abstinence as before. it is known that the liver is extremely
effective at detoxifying cocaine and can process a lethal dose
every hour. </p>

<p>There are no reports of cross-tolerance between cocaine and
the amphetamines, but cross-tolerance between amphetamine and the
other stimulants has been reported clinically. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence. </i>For a long time, it was believed
that there were no withdrawal symptoms from amphetamines and
therefore no physical dependence. At present, it is thought that
the prolonged sleep, lassitude, and depression that follow
discontinuation of the drug are greater than would be
attributable to the preceding loss of sleep and weight. These may
be withdrawal symptoms. In addition, the percentage of REM sleep
increases after discontinuance of amphetamine, returns to normal
when amphetamine is given, and rises again when amphetamine is
withheld. This meets the criteria for a withdrawal
symptom.&quot;' The sources are silent, however, on the extent to
which these symptoms are dose-related. </p>

<p>Some experts in the field believe that amphetamines are far
more dangerous than the opiates. This is related not only to the
typicality of the euphoric effect but also to the problems of
tolerance and stabilization. Dr. Weil elaborates: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In fact, amphetamine dependence is more serious than
    narcotic dependence because it is inherently less stable.
    When a person begins using a tolerance-producing drug, he
    must soon face the problem of trying to stabilize his use in
    order to keep his life from being disrupted. More than any
    other class of drugs, the amphetamines foil the user's
    attempt to reach equilibrium with his habit because they
    produce such powerful and unrelenting tolerance.
    Consequently, users develop erratic patterns of use such as
    &quot;spree shooting,&quot; alternation with barbiturates
    and, eventually, with heroin. The high correlation of
    amphetamine use with impulsive and violent behavior is
    consistent with this pharmacological instability.107 <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because intensive use of amphetamines is a relatively recent
phenomenon, there is little information on such problems as
readdiction vulnerability, physiological bases of abuse, or
comparative success of different methods of treatment. There is
no treatment comparable to methadone, but neither is there any
particular evidence that such treatment is needed. The pattern of
heavy amphetamine use is probably too hard to sustain for an
extended period of time anyway, and there is increasing
indication that heavy amphetamine users eventually turn to
&quot;down&quot; drugs, such as heroin or barbiturates.&quot;' </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>There are several theories about
the mechanisms of the CNS effects of the amphetamines, most based
on analogies to their peripheral effects, but none is
definitive.&quot;' While the effects of all the drugs are
similar, the mechanisms may be different; for example, there are
probably significant differences between the amphetamines and
cocaine.&quot;'<br>

<p><b>BARBITURATES AND TRANQUILIZERS<br>
</b></p>

<p><i>The Drugs.&quot;'</i> Barbiturates and tranquilizers are
sedatives (calming agents), hypnotics (sleep-inducing agents),
and depressants. The category encompasses a wide range of drugs
of different families. For example, over 2,500 barbiturates have
been synthesized, and at least twelve are in common clinical use.
In the area of nonbarbiturate hypnotics, Sharpless lists
twenty-three commonly used drugs belonging to ten different
families. In addition to these two groups, there are a number of
major tranquilizers that are used in the treatment of psychiatric
disorders. </p>

<p>More is known about these drugs than about those discussed in
previous sections. This is in part because they have been in wide
use for a long time, and in part because most of them have more
general effects than do other drugs of abuse. Drugs of this
category act on a number of bodily systems besides the CNS, and
these other systems are more easily studied. This section
discusses the effects of the drugs only insofar as these are
relevant to their abuse potential. </p>

<p>The major drugs involved are as follows: </p>

<p><i>Barbiturates </i>are derivatives of barbituric acid; they
were first used medically in 1903. The major abused drugs in the
series are secobarbital and pentobarbital. </p>

<p><i>Meprobamate (Equinil, Miltown), glutethimide (Doriden),
chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and diazepam (Valium) </i>are CNS
depressants belonging to several different families. Medically,
they are regarded as anti-anxiety agents-not hypnotics-and they
and similar drugs are called the minor tranquilizers. </p>

<p>One group of powerful tranquilizers, the <i>phenothiazines
(Chlorpromazine),</i> are not covered. While they are in common
use, especially for the treatment of serious mental illness, this
class of drugs does not appear to be abused.&quot;' There is no
satisfactory explanation of why they are not attractive to drug
abusers. Obviously, their psychoactive effects must differ
significantly from those of barbiturates or the minor
tranquilizers, but the nature of these differences is unexplored.
</p>

<p>The discussion here centers on barbiturates-the most powerful
and often abused drugs-and brings in others as relevant. </p>

<p><i>Medical Uses.&quot;' </i>The barbiturates are used as
calming agents and as sleeping pills. Some of them are also used
as anticonvulsants in the treatment of certain types of poisoning
or epilepsy. The tranquilizers are used in any situation where
the patient will benefit from an anti-anxiety drug. They are not
sleep-inducing, except insofar as insomnia may be caused by
anxiety. Both are widely used in the practice of medicine. </p>

<p><i>Physical Effects and Toxicity.&quot;' </i>The barbiturates
are general depressants of a wide range of cellular functions in
many organ systems. They are not general anesthetics or
analgesics, however, and will not prevent or relieve pain. (Some
of the ultra-shortacting barbiturates are anesthetics when
injected, but this is a minor exception.) They are respiratory
depressants, and in high concentrations they have direct effects
on the cardiovascular system. Most of the peripheral effects-the
effects directly on the organs themselves-occur only at
concentrations of the drug that exceed those necessary to affect
the CNS and are thus relatively rare. &quot;The CNS is
exquisitely sensitive to the barbiturates, so that, when the
drugs are given in sedative or hypnotic doses, direct actions on
peripheral structures are absent or negligible.&quot;&quot;' The
effect on the CNS can range from coma to mild sedation, depending
on the particular drug, the method of administration, and the
dose. In some individuals, and in some circumstances, low doses
will act as a stimulant rather than a sedative. It is not clear
whether this depends on the mental set of the user or on the
pharmacological phenomenon that the first effect of a drug is
sometimes on brain centers that regulate and inhibit excitatory
bodily functions. </p>

<p>For short- and intermediate-acting barbiturates, the hypnotic
dose is 100-200 mg., which will give six or seven hours of sleep
in the proper environment. The sleep is like physiological sleep,
except that the proportion of REM phase is reduced. (The
amphetamines also reduce REM.) The usual sedative dose is 30-50
mg., given two or three times daily. </p>

<p>The duration of action varies with the particular barbiturate.
Some will last only ten or fifteen minutes, some for more than a
day. Performance degradation, however, may last longer than overt
effects. A 200-mg. dose of secobarbital (which is known as
intermediate in its duration) may cause decreased performance ten
to twenty-two hours later. The aftereffect of the drug may be
hyperexcitability, even though functioning is, in fact, still
impaired. </p>

<p>Taken in large quantities, barbiturates can cause death. The
lethal dose varies, but it can generally be assumed that anything
over ten times the normal hypnotic dose administered at one time
will cause severe poisoning. Moderate poisoning is strikingly
similar to alcoholic intoxication, with slurred speech, poor
reflexes, and the rest of the well-known syndrome. Severe
poisoning is characterized by a deep coma, with respiratory
depression, falling blood pressure, shock syndrome, kidney
failure, and other complications. </p>

<p>The long-term effects of barbiturate use seem to be in some
doubt. The pharmacology books mention only the results of severe
intoxication, not the effects of chronic use. At the same time,
it is known that alcohol and the barbiturates have many
characteristics in common and are to some extent substitutes for
each other. Barbiturates will suppress the withdrawal symptoms of
alcohol and vice versa; the intoxications are similar, and so are
the withdrawal symptoms. In the formal literature, abuse of the
two kinds of drugs is linked as &quot;drug dependence of the
barbiturate-alcohol type.&quot;&quot;' The destructive effects of
long-term heavy alcohol use are familiar, and some authorities
believe that barbiturates may have very similar effects on the
cells of the liver and brain. Presumably, our knowledge of the
toxicity resulting from long-term but moderate use of
barbiturates is in the same limbo as our knowledge of comparable
use of alcohol. </p>

<p><i>Psychoactive Effects. </i>The literature contains numerous
descriptions of the effects of barbiturates on outward behavior.
Intoxication may cause sluggishness, slowness of speech and
comprehension, bad judgment, exaggeration of basic personality
traits, moroseness, or irritability.&quot;' </p>

<p>The sources do not contain a description of the subjective
effects, however, and the nature of the &quot;high&quot; involved
in heavy use is less discussed than is the case for any of the
other drugs of abuse. The general effect seems to be one of
tranquility and peace. How this compares with an opiate high is
not clear. </p>

<p>At doses only slightly in excess of the therapeutic dose, the
effect may be one of excitation and mood elevation rather than of
tranquilization. </p>

<p>A combination of barbiturates and amphetamines produces more
elevation of mood than either taken separately. The reason for
this is not known. Nor is it known whether this is the reason for
the common drug abusers' practice of taking the two in
combination. </p>

<p>The other depressants in this category are abusable and have
much the same effects and symptoms as abused barbiturates. Abuse
in the sense of self-administration does not seem to be terribly
common, however; some of them, such as Librium, have rather
minimal euphoriant effects. In general, from the standpoint of
the abuser, barbiturates-particularly short-acting ones-are a
superior good, with others acceptable as substitutes only if
barbiturates are unavailable. </p>

<p><i>Tolerance. </i>Both drug disposition and pharmacodynamic
tolerance to the barbiturates develop with repeated
administration. The first is caused by the activation of
drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and consequent increase in
the speed of detoxation of the drug. A higher dose is then
required to maintain a given tissue concentration. The second
involves the adaptation of nervous tissue to the presence of the
drug. Tolerance develops quickly, and the CNS probably becomes
resistant to the effects of the drug during the action of a
single administration.&quot;' </p>

<p>The tolerance, however, is largely limited to the sedative and
intoxicating effects of the drug. The lethal dose is not much
greater for addicts than for nonaddicts. In addition, the range
of tolerance is narrow. An individual tolerant to 1.2 grams of a
particular drug may show acute intoxication if the dose is raised
as little as 0.1 gram per day. </p>

<p>The other drugs of this class develop tolerance in the same
way and with the same limitations as do the barbiturates. </p>

<p><i>Physical Dependence and Withdrawal. </i>Severe physical
dependence on the barbiturates develops, but, unlike the
situation for the opiates, the dosages required for this effect
are higher than the therapeutic dose. With pentobarbital, for
example, 200 mg. per day can be taken for months without
producing withdrawal, and 400 mg. per day for three months will
produce EEG changes in only 30 per cent of the cases. The other
70 per cent apparently show no effects. After 600 mg. per day for
one to two months, half the subjects will have minor withdrawal
symptoms, and 10 per cent may have a seizure. After continuous,
intoxication with doses of 900 mg. to 2.2 grams, 75 per cent of
the subjects may have seizures, and 60 per cent delirium; all
experience lesser symptoms.&quot;' </p>

<p>Defining &quot;major&quot; withdrawal symptoms as seizures or
psychoses, the time and dosage necessary to produce severe
physical dependence for different sedative hypnotics have been
calculated as follows: ...<br>

<p>* Dosages sufficient to produce &quot;major&quot; withdrawal
signs in humans.<br>
</p>

<p>As Table 1-1 indicates, the other sedative hypnotics are
thought to produce dependence similar to that caused by
barbiturates. They have not been as carefully studied. </p>

<p>We have found no study that divides opiate withdrawal into
major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; symptoms. Thus, it is not
possible to compare the development of barbiturate dependence
with that of opiate dependence. </p>

<p>Once physical dependence develops, withdrawal from
barbiturates is severe, and-unlike opiate withdrawal-may be life
threatening. For one of the short-acting drugs, for the first
twelve hours or so the patient seems to improve as the
intoxication clears. He then becomes restless, anxious,
tremulous, and weak, and sometimes has nausea or cramps. Within
twenty-four hours, he may be too weak to get out of bed,
experience severe tremors in the hands, and have hyperactive deep
reflexes. The peak is reached on the second or third day, and
convulsions may occur. Half the patients who have convulsive
seizures go on to delirium, which occurs between the fourth and
seventh days. This consists of high anxiety, hallucinations, and
disorientation. Once delirium occurs, it may not be suppressed
even by large doses of barbiturates. This is contrary to the
normal course of withdrawal symptoms, which are quickly
suppressed by the drug of addiction. The reason for this anomaly
is not known. During the delirium, exhaustion and cardiovascular
collapse may occur. The withdrawal syndrome usually clears by
about the eighth day, if untreated. For longer-acting drugs,
seizures may not occur until the seventh or eighth day, and the
general course is slowed down accordingly.&quot;' </p>

<p>Hallucinations sometimes persist for months, but &quot;this is
felt by most investigators to be a manifestation of an underlying
psychosis.&quot;&quot;' The sources do not discuss whether
barbiturates, like the opiates, have early and protracted
abstinence syndromes. </p>

<p>Meprobomate (Equanil, Miltown) follows the short-acting
course. Libriurn follows that of the long-acting barbiturates. </p>

<p><i>Mechanisms of Action. </i>More is known about the fate of
barbiturates in the body than is known about the other drugs of
abuse. It is known, for example, that they are transformed by the
liver into a number of inactive metabolites that are in turn
excreted. This lessens the concentration of the drug and causes
the withdrawal from its site of action in the CNS. The general
state of knowledge concerning metabolism, physical
redistribution, and excretion is discussed in the sources, as are
the general theories of sites of action in the CNS. These are too
technical to discuss here. The mechanisms by which barbiturates
operate to cause CNS effects are not well understood.&quot;'<br>

<p><b>A WORD ON ALCOHOL<br>
</b></p>

<p>Problems of alcohol and alcoholism were not within the mandate
of the Drug Abuse Survey Project, and they have not been included
in the report or in any of the supporting papers. In the context
of this chapter, however, one comment should be made: Alcohol is
a drug and could easily be analyzed in the same terms as the
drugs that are covered. It has a potent psychoactive effect and
is, like most of the drugs with which we are concerned, highly
specific to the CNS. Both tolerance and physical dependence
develop, and withdrawal can be a very serious clinical condition.
The drug causes organic damage. The interplay of physiological
factors and psychological factors involves as many uncertainties
for alcohol as for the opiates. </p>

<p>In short, the common distinction between alcohol and
&quot;drugs of abuse&quot; is based on the fact that alcohol is
known and accepted in the culture, not on any pharmacological
considerations. It is entirely possible that alcohol is
inherently more dangerous than most of the other drugs discussed.
</p>

<p>In his listing of the hazards of different drugs, Dr. Samuel
Irwin makes the following rankings, starting with the most
dangerous: ... </p>

<p>1. Glue sniffing </p>

<p>2. Methamphetamine </p>

<p>3. Alcohol </p>

<p>4. Cigarettes </p>

<p>5. Barbiturates and hypnotics </p>

<p>6. Heroin and related narcotics </p>

<p>7. LSD and other hallucinogens </p>

<p>8. Marijuana<br>

<p><b>GOALS OF DRUG EDUCATION</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Prevention through education&quot; has become the newest
panacea of the drug-abuse field. Law enforcement has failed to
stem the supply of illegal drugs, and rehabilitation efforts have
thus far failed to reclaim many abusers. Everyone now talks of
pouring money into education to stop the problem before it
begins. </p>

<p>As of any educational undertaking, the first task of a drug
abuse-prevention program is to define the goals sought. If
objectives are not understood, developing the educational effort
and the techniques to be used is difficult. At present, this is a
major problem of drug education. No one is sure what goals are
realistic or desirable, and proponents of massive efforts cannot
agree on what they hope to accomplish. The most that can be said
is that there are a number of possible objectives for
youth-oriented, drugeducation programs: </p>

<p>Stopping all experimentation with foreign substances </p>

<p>Keeping experimentation at the minimum and limiting it to
relatively safe substances </p>

<p>Preventing casual experimenters from becoming habitual users </p>

<p>Preventing addiction or severe dependence </p>

<p>Reinforcing the anti-experimentation tendencies of those who
have not yet tried drugs </p>

<p>Presenting information for students to use in making drug
decisions for themselves </p>

<p>Increasing student understanding of the complex factors
related to drug use, social attitudes, and policies </p>

<p>For adult audiences, the goals may be somewhat different- for
parents, to give them the best information available, to heighten
their concern about the effects of drugs, to make them less
likely to panic if they find one of their children using drugs,
to encourage them to lobby for more education, treatment, or law
reform, or to teach them to communicate more openly with their
children on the subject. For teachers, counselors, and other
&quot;gatekeepers&quot; the object might be to train them to
create an atmosphere of communication in their classrooms or to
recognize student drug experimenters and abusers, deal with them
sympathetically, and channel them into treatment if necessary.
Teachers might also be equipped with the tools to stimulate
objective discussion of the subject with their students. </p>

<p>The traditional goal of most parents, educators, community
leaders, congressmen, and government officials has been to
discourage young people from experimenting with illegal drugs at
all. In the past, government and privately sponsored education
efforts have tried to do this by emphasizing the horrors of
addiction and lumping all drugs together as leading to the same
ultimate doom. Virtually all experts now agree that such tactics
have not proved effective. Indeed, in many cases, they have been
counterproductive, causing disrespect, skepticism, and resistance
to all advice on drugs. Despite the widespread implementation of
this technique, youthful addiction and experimentation with
illegal drugs have increased. Consequently, within the past few
years there has been a change in emphasis, with more and more
programs concentrating on an honest presentation of accurate,
factual knowledge about the effects of drugs (insofar as such
knowledge is available). The assumption is that drugs are
obviously bad, and that telling the facts will be enough to
convince young people not to experiment. </p>

<p>Although the approach may have changed, the aim of most public
and private antidrug literature remains the same-to discourage
young people from trying marijuana, psychedelics, amphetamines,
barbiturates, and, above all, heroin. The theme of a nationwide
government advertising campaign reflects the traditional
broadside approach: &quot;Why Do You Think They Call It
Dope?&quot; Many of the recent NIMH posters and television spots
are along the same lines: &quot;Will It Turn You On, or Will It
Turn on You?&quot; Most &quot;model&quot; curricula for
elementary, junior, and senior high schools, even when they
present the known facts about drugs fairly, push a strongly
negative attitude toward all commonly abused drugs. The measure
of success of such programs-although few try to measure success
by any formula-is almost always assumed to be total cessation of
drug experimentation and use. </p>

<p>In the late 1960's, however, this viewpoint ran into an
embarrassing problem: no one was able to develop a factual
scientific argument proving that marijuana was harmful. This
development had its greatest impact on programs using the scare
technique, but it also undermined programs based on the premise
that telling the truth was an effective way of discouraging
experimentation. This has put education in a difficult position.
Most drug-education programs are ambivalent. They profess an
honest desire to tell the truth-but only up to a point. When
known facts run out or become controversial, as they almost
certainly do when the subject comes up, the approach reverts to
imposed value judgments, half-truths, or presumptions that the
law is right-devices easily seen through by the skeptical young. </p>

<p>Increasingly, drug experts are coming to the conclusion that
it is the goal that needs to be changed more than the technique,
and that total cessation of all drug experimentation, however
desirable in the abstract, is not a realistic goal for an
education program. Some experts feel strongly that an education
program aimed at stopping drug experimentation of every kind is
bound to fail and so alienate students in the process that they
will not listen to any of it. Drs. Thomas Ungerleider, Norman
Zinberg, and Helen Nowlis, as well as Professor Kenneth
Keniston-to name a few experts-appear to define a different goal
for drug education: to teach youths to make informed decisions
about drugs and indeed about every other kind of chemical
subtance they might ingest. This must include a concentration on
teaching elementary students a fundamental respect for the human.
body and the effects of chemical substances. </p>

<p>Teaching young people to make informed decisions on their own
about illegal drugs is admittedly a more controversial goal than
mechanically urging them to avoid all such drugs. A wholly honest
&quot;tell it like it is&quot; approach may cause a decline in
the use of heroin, amphetamines, and barbiturates, but it will
almost certainly increase the likelihood that youthful listeners
will feel more comfortable about trying marijuana and possibly
some of the milder hallucinogens. Professor Zinberg reports on a
candid talk about drugs to a Massachusetts high school. Before
the lecture, 60 per cent of the students said they would not try
marijuana; after the lecture, the figure dropped to 35 per cent.'
This is not a universal occurrence, of course. For example, a
before-and-after evaluation at a Temple University educational
conference, presenting all points of view, found that attitudes
toward marijuana shifted from favoring legalization to a neutral
position, especially among undergraduates. </p>

<p>A truly factual drug-education program might also influence
attitudes toward commercially advertised and even medically
prescribed drugs. When, for example, people discover that some
legitimate drugs directly cause more deaths annually than do most
abused drugs, they may lose faith in the argument that they
should avoid illegal drugs because there is no official quality
control or pretesting for safety. Another problem with the
factual method involves the source material to be used.
Contradictory statements of &quot;facts&quot; could catalyze a
&quot;your guess is as good as mine&quot; attitude, and this is
an area in which contradictions are common.' Nor are the opinions
of either laymen or experts always based on scientific fact.
Often the opinion comes first and the facts are chosen to fit
it.' An impartial factual approach assumes that an individual
choice will be made on the basis of medical or scientific
evidence regardless of what is forbidden by law. This is a
difficult concept for many to accept, even though some young
people from time immemorial have refused to obey a given law
partly because it is the 'Law or have engaged in -risk-taking
behavior -that appalls adults. Today's climate of individuality
intensifies the likelihood that they will make their own choices
about drugs as well. In some cases, it is precisely the fact that
drugs are illegal and risky that constitutes part of their
attraction. It may be, therefore, that the most useful
educational approach is to give young people the facts upon which
to make that choice, so that they will at least keep their
risk-taking behavior within bounds. Regardless of the educator's
views of what their attitudes should be, effective communication
requires that they be dealt with as they are. One survey of
elementary, junior, and senior high school students in California
concluded that &quot;students feel quite strongly about an
individual's right to make decisions concerning his own use of
drugs.&quot; In the senior high school sampling, 84 per cent of
the users and 76 per cent of the nonusers surveyed responded
positively to the statement &quot;Decision to Use Drugs Is a
Personal Decision.&quot;' </p>

<p>Even if one is willing to accept increased experimentation
with some drugs as the price of decreased damage from other
drugs, there are more serious problems. How, for example, can a
young child be expected to assimilate all the facts about
individual drugs and their effects upon the body and make a
reasonable choice about using them? Experimentation with
ingestion or inhalation of foreign substances is occurring from
age seven on with increasing frequency. How can so young a child
make an informed decision? Might he not lean too heavily on his
emotions, impulses, and peer-group pressure? Clearly, the
&quot;responsible decision&quot; model has its limitations, too. </p>

<p>Other goals for an education program may be identified when
those who are to be educated are involved in the selection
process. It is highly recommended by the U.S. Office of
Education's Drug Education Branch, for example, that young people
share more of the responsibility for specifying objectives. Such
a partnership arrangement tends to enhance the credibility of a
program by &quot;plugging it into&quot; the representative needs
of its target audience. </p>

<p>The unfortunate fact is that we do not know whether an
exclusively factual approach works with the very young, even to
the extent of mitigating the most dangerous kinds of
experimentations. Conversely, we do not know whether a concerted
attempt by schools and media to control the behavior of the
children by propagandizing against drugs and punishing their use
works, either, even if it is justified on the basis that the
child is not old enough to make a rational choice of his own in
so potentially harmful an area. Because of all the problems and
unknowns of the &quot;rational choice&quot; approach, relatively
few programs have adopted it explicitly, even when they concede
the problems of other methods. In general, drug-education
programs at the national, college, high school, and elementary
levels have not faced the difficult issues involved in deciding
among these goals. They have been neither realistic nor frank
with the students or themselves. In most situations, settling on
the goals that are most realistic under the circumstances and
acknowledging those goals to the target group would enhance the
credibility of the drug education program. But even more
importantly, it is necessary to articulate the precise objectives
of any education campaign before it is implemented because they
affect the way in which drug education is taught as well as the
criteria by which its success or failure is evaluated. Until the
precise aims of a program are clear to the sponsor and to the
target population, the methodology cannot be sensitively selected
and the program's effects cannot be accurately assessed. Such a
practice would also allow us to begin to determine which
techniques help to accomplish the objectives and which do not. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>TECHNIQUES OF DRUG EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS</b> </p>

<p>At present, we know almost nothing about how best to reach
students on the drug issue; nor, until recently, have we tried
very hard to find out. Only within the last few years have there
been even rudimentary attempts to evaluate some of the school
programs. Most of the pioneer efforts are very rough, and the
outcomes rarely determine, or even significantly influence, the
planning and allocation of resources. </p>

<p>Although there is now consensus that evaluation is needed, our
lack of knowledge about the effects of existing education
programs is not easily remediable. It is difficult to develop
reliable evaluation techniques for the programs, although many
methods are being tried. In some cases, students are tested
before and after a drug course to see how much of the new
information has been retained. Other surveys use attitudinal
questions about whether participants are more or less willing to
experiment with particular drugs after the program; in still
other cases, selected students are interviewed intensively in an
effort to probe deeply into their attitudes and reactions. Recent
evaluative studies test the effectiveness of several factors
simultaneously by administering varied instruments.
Unfortunately, as Dr. Marvin I. Rosen suggests, existing
&quot;methodologies [are] inadequate for the questions being
asked, and the designs of evaluation studies are inappropriate
for the answers being sought.&quot;' Evaluations are often post
hoc, rather desperate attempts to get information out of a
program that was set up without regard to the need for it. Even
when evaluation is designed into a program, it rarely includes
long-range follow-up to determine the program's effects a year or
more after its termination. </p>

<p>There are other problems. Little of the scant material that
exists on evaluation has been pulled together and published, or
even collected in one place. Valid and interesting work may exist
unknown to almost everyone. In addition, only infrequent use has
been made of the findings of educational-psychology research in
designing learning programs on drug abuse for children of varying
ages, although other areas have attempted to do so. For example,
it is reported that $8 million was spent doing preliminary
research on the psychology of learning before airing the Sesame
Street program, which teaches reading concepts to preschool
children. </p>

<p>Finally, there are institutional obstacles, and dedication to
evaluation is often more froth than reality. The primary concern
of many evaluators is that something be done, and they take a
subjective view of the quality of the effort. Program staffs fear
that objective study of their efforts will place future
activities in jeopardy or believe that they are performing a
service that cannot be measured. Some educators feel that
evaluation produces only statistical data, which they equate with
antihumanism. Program personnel often fail to specify their goals
and the means utilized to attain them. </p>

<p>Dr. Helen Nowlis pointed out in 1967 that &quot;at the present
time there is no standard or widely accepted model for planning
an effective drug-education program. This is an area that
urgently needs research, development and demonstration.&quot;'
This statement is still appropriate several years later. The
underpinnings for a rational drug-education approach do not exist
at the present time. Pronouncements abound on the kinds of
programs that should be undertaken, and model curricula are easy
to find, but hard data on the effect such programs have on
students are virtually nonexistent. Given this situation, the two
major priorities in this field are: (1) Well-designed and tested
evaluation techniques to measure the attainment of specific goals
(once they have been defined) in any school drug-education
program. Different evaluative models would measure different
goals-e.g., decreasing drug use, more information dissemination
among the student body, substitution of less harmful drugs,
rational drug use, less use in school, fewer acute health crises,
more referrals of students to treatment, more use made of school
personnel by students for advice. (2) A formal 'compilation of
what evaluation data exist, which programs have been evaluated,
what criteria have been used, and what results have been
obtained. This information should be widely disseminated to
members of the educational community as well as to those involved
in drug programming (treatment, rehabilitation, intervention). </p>

<p>In the absence of this kind of information, we can only turn
to the opinions of recognized &quot;experts&quot; in the field,
without any real assurance, however, that they are right. Yet,
there appears to be consensus (at least for the present) on the
following points: </p>

<p>The common pattern of having physical education or health
teachers set aside one unit in the curriculum to lecture on the
dangers of drugs is virtually useless. See, e.g., the Report of
the Mayor's Task Force on Drug Abuse Education in Washington,
D.C.: &quot;To this date, most current crisis-oriented programs
cater to the biases of adults, and depend on the faulty theory of
emphasizing information or lecture techniques.&quot; </p>

<p>A program must be ongoing, with the opportunity for recurrent
discussions throughout the year. Even some of the new,
well-motivated programs suffer from a &quot;crisis&quot;
approach. An evaluation of programs conducted in four high school
classes showed that &quot;short-term programs, even though very
sophisticated and intensive, may have little impact on the
attitudes of students regarding the abuse of drugs.&quot; The
study concludes that &quot;the primary value of [the] project is
that it adds a note of caution to those who would set aside a
single day for drug education and be satisfied with the
results.&quot;' Although countless &quot;one-shot&quot; programs
are sponsored nationally, there is little evidence that such
programs have any lasting effect. </p>

<p>Different approaches have to be taken for students of
different ages, cultural backgrounds, and levels of drug
sophistication. The subtle variations among particular
subcultures must be recognized. Drug education of some general
kind needs to begin in kindergarten, or even earlier, and should
focus on the specific drugs of abuse by fourth or fifth grade.
The program for teenage suburban experimenters with marijuana
must be different from the program for ghetto heroin users. Each
target group must be studied to determine what kind of message
will reach it. The information must then be structured so that it
relates closely to the students' sophistication and willingness
to identify with the subject matter. </p>

<p>There must be open and free dialogue between students and the
teacher or discussion leader in an atmosphere of tolerance for
all points of view, free of moralizing and shock reactions. </p>

<p>Use should be made of the comments and experiences of
youngsters who have actually used drugs, with confidentiality
assured. </p>

<p>From junior high school on, students should be involved in
planning and implementing the drug-education program to assure
its relevance to the specific situation in that school. Again,
the students' level of sophistication must be accurately
assessed. Predetermined curricula are to be avoided unless they
are clearly relevant. </p>

<p>Factual material must be absolutely accurate and honest. Where
research does not yet provide clear answers, this must be
admitted. Tobacco and alcohol abuse should be treated along with
illicit drugs as part of the same over-all problem. The dangers
as well as the benefits of legitimate drug use must be frankly
acknowledged where they exist. </p>

<p>The curriculum should not be a passive one, relying solely on
pamphlets, lectures, or films. There should be an emphasis on
actual experimental data that let the students see the underlying
methodology of drug research and the way conclusions are reached.
Where possible, students should view actual experimentation with
the effects of drugs on animals and, at higher grade levels,
conduct these experiments themselves. In Dr. Louise Richards'
view: &quot;The expectation is that deeper understanding of the
CNS [central nervous system] and effects of psychoactive drugs
will result in more profound respect for the hazards of
unsupervised use.&quot;' </p>

<p>Emphasis should be placed on the motivational aspects of drug
use-why people use drugs, what they hope to accomplish and what
they hope to escape, and how they can fulfill these needs in
other ways. Interviews with high school students in California
reveal a strong dislike for repetitive programs focusing on
information alone. The students greatly preferred continuing
discussions on the reasons for drug use.&quot; Again, this is a
way of actively involving the student in the learning process and
making it a two-way engagement. Equal emphasis should be given to
the reasons people do not want to take drugs. Dr. Helen Nowlis
points out that college students often seem less interested in
the legal and medical facts about drugs than in a personal,
philosophical discussion about the limits on an individual's
right to self-discovery and expression.&quot; </p>

<p>Education of any kind will have little or no impact on a
youngster who is already deeply involved with drugs. A survey of
students in nine high schools concluded that &quot;students who
have used drugs are not likely to be favorably impressed or to be
changed by viewing ... drug abuse films. In all nine schools the
pattern was the same: the students, after viewing the films, said
they were likely to continue their behavior as users or nonusers
of drugs.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>Alternative behavior patterns should be provided, for many
users frequently give up drugs for something else. The
&quot;something else&quot; varies but frequently takes the form
of intense personal experiences, often of a religious nature,
deep interpersonal experiences through the use of transcendental
meditation or yoga, participation in sensitivity groups, or
free-school activities. (See Staff Paper 6, below.) Such
alternative programs, in order to be effective, should be
attractive, easily available on a continuing basis, and organized
with advice from the student body. </p>

<p>Given this consensus, however, a fundamental dispute still
exists over whether the purely factual approach to drugs is more
harmful than helpful to young &quot;risk takers.&quot; Some
experts believe that giving specific factual knowledge reinforces
the antidrug propensities of persons not likely to abuse drugs
anyway but actually contributes to the &quot;seduction&quot; of
vulnerable high-risk groups by romanticizing the negativism that
motivates their conduct.&quot; Movies, media advertising, rock
music, underground newspapers, and commercial films that excite
interest in specific drug use transmit the nonverbal message that
users get attention and sympathy. Dr. Paul Blachley espouses a
different kind of education, focusing on underlying behavioral
responses and on why people consciously hurt themselves and those
around them. He would convey the over-all image of the
drug-abuser as a boring, weak-minded, easily &quot;conned&quot;
individual, not as a daring and reckless adventurer. But the
student survey quoted above concluded that none of the six drug
films examined lured anyone into trying drugs who had not already
done so. </p>

<p>Other studies highlight the need for additional investigation
into the effects of drug education.&quot; Studies by Gilbert Geis
(1969) and the California Department of Education (1970)
determined that short-term programs (four weeks or less)
significantly increased student knowledge about drugs and caused
more cautious attitudes toward drug use. However, several studies
conducted at the Pennsylvania State University in 1970-71
&quot;showed consistent relationships between better knowledge
about drugs and pro-drug attitudes; better knowledge and the use
of marijuana; and pro-drug attitudes and the use of
marijuana.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>A still unsettled question is whether drug education should be
integrated into a &quot;life-problem&quot; course that includes
such other subjects as sex and relations with parents and peers.
Dr. Norman Zinberg, for one, espouses the integrated model. There
also appears to be pressure toward this broader model from many
students. Even courses labeled &quot;drug education&quot; very
often take a motivational approach that examines underlying
values and behavioral problems. A comparison of eighth- and
eleventh graders in California revealed that users know less
about drugs and drug-related information than nonusers at the
same grade level. The study concluded: &quot;While the continued
teaching of factual drug information might somewhat lessen
student drug use, it could not do the job by itself, but when
combined with an affective or attitudinal approach could be of
real effect.&quot;&quot; The Coronado Unified School District
consequently led other schools in stressing the need for a
comprehensive program covering values, valuing processes
(decision-making), value orientations, and their possible effects
on human behavior. Advocates of this approach recommend its use
with parents, teachers, and students to increase mutual
understanding and the ability to cope with the problems of
everyday life. </p>

<p>Another fundamental question, especially for schools, is who
should do the drug educating. Are regular teachers or
knowledgeable outsiders more effective? All experts stress that
it must be someone the students like and trust, someone who knows
and will present the facts accurately and who feels comfortable
and free in open discussion. Few teachers in any school fit that
description. It has been observed by some outside speakers that
students' questions dramatically increased in sophistication when
the teacher left the room. In Washington, D.C., the mayor's task
force suggested selecting teachers for drug education on the
basis of a &quot;sociogram&quot; asking students to state
anonymously to whom they would go for consultation or advice on
personal problems. On the other side, several reports and
interviews have warned about the possibly insidious effect of
teachers who themselves actually promote drug use, wittingly or
unwittingly. </p>

<p>Perhaps because of the more personal level of communication
encouraged in primary grades, elementary students stand alone in
preferring the teacher as a source of information. When surveyed,
high school students usually prefer ex-addicts and medical
doctors as resource people. Ex-users were considered qualified
because of their firsthand experience with drugs. Conversely,
doctors were seen as authorities on drug effects but lost
credibility when discussing the &quot;feelings&quot; drugs
produce. Dr. Thomas Ungerleider, of UCLA, reports that, in his
experience, the most successful approach for a medical lecturer
begins with an assurance to the students that he is not there for
the purpose of persuading them to stay off drugs and does not
represent law enforcement, parents, or school authorities, but is
there only to tell them the known facts about drugs and the human
body and to answer their questions. </p>

<p>Any discussion leader must be able to validate his credentials
by showing the students that he knows the facts he states are
true. Many schools have drug-education and rehabilitation centers
run by, or with the help of, former drug users who present
programs consisting of small student group discussions. These are
often supplemented by discussions with faculty and parent groups
as well. PLACE, in Boston, is an example of a drug-information
and service center for hippies, runaways, and drug users, staffed
by graduate students and run by the youthful clients with
professional supervision. They conduct programs for local
schools. </p>

<p>The role of the ex-addict in school programs deserves special
consideration. He is the current fad of drug education, on the
theory that only one who has been there can tell about it
convincingly. There is some truth to this, but apparently
different children receive different messages. The ex-addict is
perceived by some as a self-promoter capitalizing on his drug
experience for admiration or profit. Others get the idea that it
is as easy to get off drugs as it is to get addicted, so that
there is little risk in trying them. A ghetto youth might well
surmise that, if the ex-addict had never become addicted to
heroin in the first place, he would be worse off, probably
jobless, and without the attention and respect he is now
receiving. To some, the ex-addict is a glamorous
&quot;anti-hero&quot; somewhat like a rock singer. In one
California high school, ex-addict visitors were the recipients of
phone calls from girl students seeking after school dates.
Several schools have had unfortunate experiences with ex-addicts
who are not really &quot;ex&quot; and are either pushing or using
drugs. Others are akin to religious converts, uttering rigid
opinions about all drugs, including marijuana, and denigrating
all treatment modalities other than their own. Still others turn
out never to have been serious users at all but are merely
well-versed in the jargon of the users. Reportedly, some
out-of-work rock musicians earn extra money making the school
circuit. And, disturbingly, large numbers of ex-addicts reminisce
about the actual &quot;high&quot; with an exquisite affection not
lost on their young audiences. Some ex-addicts, although off
drugs, are currently abusing alcohol. Others are prey to the same
myths about drugs as nonusers and pass misinformation on to
students. </p>

<p>All this gives the negative side of using ex-addicts, a
practice that is sometimes accepted too uncritically. But this is
not the only side. Ex-addicts can be excellent teachers, able to
speak with credibility and to relate to youngsters, although the
mere fact that they are ex-addicts does not ensure rapport. One
of the very few carefully evaluated school programs showed, for
example, that, while students liked to hear ex-addicts tell of
their experiences, they did not give them so much credence when
they lectured about drugs generally.&quot; Ex-addicts with
natural talent in relating to the young and with some training in
sensitivity and substance may make very good drug-education
teachers, indeed, and their experience may give them extra
effectiveness. A good educator who happens to be an ex-addict may
have a special and valuable feeling for the factors that lead
youths to try drugs. </p>

<p>In ghetto schools, antidrug black-militant organizations often
have a special appeal. The ghetto youngster's need for a role
model may focus on such a symbol of racial pride. Organizations
such as Blackman's Development Center and PRIDE, Inc., in
Washington, D.C., have recently entered the drug education field
and vigorously propagandize against drugs in schools, sometimes
with homemade slides of addiction horrors and appeals to racial
unity against a &quot;white man's&quot; scourge. How successful
they will be remains to be seen. </p>

<p>The difficulty with most school education programs run by
&quot;outsiders&quot; is that they lack continuity in the school
itself. The ex-addicts, the graduate students, and visiting
doctors come and go, while the students' need for information or
help may continue for months. One of the more promising
approaches is that used by a San lose high school, which released
a popular young teacher for several months to learn the drug
scene intimately by going on &quot;buys&quot; with local police,
attending court trials, working with doctors in drug clinics,
interviewing patients at treatment centers, and spending time on
the streets and in criminology labs. On his return, he took on
(apparently successfully) the combined duties of teacher and
counselor to students with drug problems.&quot; </p>

<p>Dissatisfied with past results, many school systems this year
are trying a variety of new preventive-education methods to
discourage drug abuse, involving more direction by the students
themselves. The New York City Board of Education has announced a
trial program in sixteen high schools in which pupils will design
and run their own antidrug programs. In Philadelphia last year,
selected students from seven high schools (accompanied by a
teacher) learned basic drug facts from doctors, treatment
experts, and law-enforcement officials and went on field trips.
They then went back to their own schools to initiate and run
programs of their own choice. Most of them opened counseling
services. With regard to peer involvement, there are indications
that students should be given a voice in basic approach,
curriculum content, and choice of teachers but should not be
saddled with administrative chores, which they abhor and often
perform poorly. Nevertheless, tapping the enthusiasm of
well-selected students can be beneficial in motivating the
student body to seek creative antidrug activities. </p>

<p>The notion that young people relate to their peers better than
to adults has validity but also limits. They relate only to some
of their peers. Rigid social groups exist in many schools, and
students chosen by teachers and school officials may not be the
ones to lead the group that the antidrug program hopes most to
reach. Whenever possible, some student participation in planning
and operating programs should come from the group the program is
trying to reach, whether nonusers, experimenters, or borderline
cases. The student council in an Oregon high school sought the
cooperation of ex-users and faculty in creating a youthful
&quot;Mod Squad.&quot; Teams of experienced students provided
successful peer counseling, assistance in crisis situations, and
referrals to local treatment facilities and otherwise contributed
positively to the school's educational programming. </p>

<p>There is also the &quot;role model&quot; theory that younger
children, between the ages of seven and twelve, will learn from
and relate better to older youth than to children their own age
or adults. &quot;Dope Stop&quot; in Arizona uses high school
students, trained by physicians, psychiatrists, or ex-addicts, to
counsel grades five to eight. One proposal suggests subsidizing
teenaged youth with a reputation for being &quot;in&quot; and
&quot;cool&quot; to work with younger boys against drug
involvement. NIMH drug-information officials say they are also
considering having students of different age groups prepare
education programs for the next-youngest age level. </p>

<p>A study of a junior high school drug-education program that
featured teachers and ex-addicts produced some illuminating
results. The program lasted an entire semester in two junior high
schools in the high narcotics area of the inner city, and
questionnaires were administered before and after the program as
well as in a control school using the traditional lecture method.
The results showed that teachers and ex-addicts were hostile
toward one another, resenting each other's prerogatives and
roles. Teachers resented the time spent on testing for
evaluation, and ex-addicts needed feedback on how the students
reacted toward them. The students in the experimental schools did
better on factual knowledge than those in the control schools.
Parent education efforts failed. The students thought the films
were &quot;no good&quot; and exaggerated the behavior of drug
users, and that the reading material was &quot;cut and
dried.&quot; They wanted more talking and less reading; also, to
hear the ex-addicts relate personal experiences but not to
lecture. The students did not like the personal questions on the
tests and were suspicious that their answers would not be kept
confidential. They wanted more concentration on the drugs used in
their own schools; they wanted to see samples of the drugs in
order to recognize them. </p>

<p>Discouragingly, however, there is no evidence that most of the
new programs being undertaken will be evaluated any more
systematically than the older ones have been. Until that happens,
therefore, we will not know the best way to educate about drug
abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOTAL SCHOOL INVOLVEMENT</b> </p>

<p>Once again, as has happened so often with complex social
dilemmas, the schools have inherited America's number-one
&quot;Problem cbild'-the drug-abuse crisis. At present, educators
are joining with related disciplines in defining approaches to
the problem for use in classrooms, libraries, and counseling
offices. Educational institutions have become the testing ground
for diverse preventive alternatives. It has become clear that the
fundamental areas of school involvement must be to provide
relevant educational programs from kindergarten through college
and to serve as an avenue for community action involving
students, parents, faculty, and other local elements. </p>

<p>According to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs: </p>

<p>The schools cannot by themselves be expected to rehabilitate
youth and their neighborhood environments. Sociologists and
others who have worked in the drug abuse prevention field have
pointed out that drug education is not a problem for the schools
alone. It is a community problem and requires total community
effort for its solution. The schools cannot assume the roles of
parents, clergymen, enforcement officers, physicians or
psychiatrists. But they can exercise leadership in facing a
problem that the total community, working together, can try to
remedy. This is education in its broadest and most important
sense. It is making schools relevant to their communities. </p>

<p>An initial effort must be made to formulate school policies
that are sensitive to the needs of all elements of the school
community. There is no point, for example, in expecting
&quot;free&quot; class discussions or adult cooperation when
student informers are widely used throughout the school and
teachers are required to report all suspected users to the
police. If the school intends to act as an extension of civil
authority-to investigate and turn users over to the police-it
must come to terms with the fact that its effectiveness as an
educational force will be substantially reduced. On the other
hand, no school administrator can be expected to sit idly by
while drug traffic flourishes within the school. Therefore, a
major responsibility of school authorities is to give careful
consideration to alternative choices in defining the school's
action policy toward drug use. Once established, the policy
should be clearly explained to students and their parents, as
well as to the school staff. The failure of school administrators
to communicate with students about policies that they will be
expected to obey inevitably creates mistrust of all official
advice and information. By seeking and accepting inputs from
young people and their parents in the formulation of school
policies, school officials not only open up valuable channels of
communication but make it possible to develop policies that are
relevant to the needs, interests, and aspirations of each member
of the school community. </p>

<p>Until recently, schools could do little to deter student use
of drugs, because most of them had no announced policy. More and
more, administrators are moving to establish such guidelines, for
a very good reason: Lacking established policy guidelines, a
school has no standard procedure for providing help or discipline
when a student is found with drugs. A variety of policies is
possible, and it is difficult to say in advance how much
effectiveness in one area should be traded for gains in another.
Some colleges say that what the student does with his own body is
his own business, unless it results in active disruption of
classes, threatens the safety of others, or prevents satisfactory
academic functioning. This laissez-faire policy, however, is less
likely to be acceptable at the high school level. Some schools
have opted for the policy that selling or distributing drugs is
forbidden, and that distributors will be punished while users
will be treated more leniently or ignored. Other schools refuse
to initiate disciplinary action for anything that happens off
school grounds. More cautious institutions have adopted the
theory that drug use spreads in epidemic fashion, and that it is
necessary to quarantine and isolate the carrier. They
aggressively seek out drug users through urinalysis or locker
searches and either expel the users or report them to
law-enforcement officials. Some recent court decisions have made
it difficult for school personnel to conduct searches of a
student's personal belongings, thus imposing limitations on what
a school can do to investigate possible drug dealing. </p>

<p>The optimal relationship between school policy and the law
enforcement system is difficult to determine. Some schools have
worked out cooperative agreements with law-enforcement agencies
in seeking feasible alternatives to arrest (which is viewed as a
last resort). Unfortunately, however, most school officials have
given little thought to methods of diverting student drug
possessors who need help out of the criminal process and into
treatment, as witness a booklet published by the National
Association of Secondary School Principals in 1969: </p>

<p>There is a distorted notion gaining widespread acceptance that
a school or college is a sanctuary. These institutions are a part
of society and are subject to the same laws as the rest of
society. Accordingly, the school authorities have the same
responsibility as every other citizen to report violations of
law. Students possessing or using on school premises drugs
prohibited by law should be reported to the appropriate law
enforcement officials .20 </p>

<p>John Langer, of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
advises principals to use discretion and judgment in situations
that may involve the violation of federal, state, or local laws.
He emphasizes that teachers and administrators are not
law-enforcement officers but school officials with a
responsibility to carry out school board policy.&quot; </p>

<p>Continuing lines of communication between law-enforcement
agencies and schools (such as the involvement of policemen in
teacher-training and community educational efforts, speakers'
bureaus, and community-relations programs) are often mutually
beneficial in dealing with drug issues. In several metropolitan
areas, these efforts have led to the establishment of counseling
sessions that must be attended by first offenders and their
parents in lieu of a jail sentence. A Hudson Institute study has
suggested specially supervised &quot;drug-free&quot; schools for
all students found to be using drugs. Opponents of this approach,
however, argue that isolation and expulsion will only confirm the
occasional user's alienation and result in his further
identification with deviant behavior. </p>

<p>Students frequently cited the need for a designated person in
the schools to whom they can go for information or help, assured
that their confidence will be kept. Helen Nowlis states,
&quot;Within any institution it should be made clear who will and
can guarantee confidentiality and such guarantees should be
respected.&quot;&quot; Such a person would be an
ombudsman-counselor, able to work with parents as well as
students to solve drug problems. He must be the kind of person
students normally seek out for sympathetic but sound advice. In
addition, he should have thorough familiarity with the drug-abuse
field as well as access to treatment and intervention programs,
so that he can provide referrals in acute situations. (There is
reason to believe that this type of counseling resource can be
more important for schools than traditional educational
programs.) Such a person could also advise the school on general
policies and provide drug-usage information. His expertise would
be invaluable in conducting drug-abuse education classes. </p>

<p>The ombudsman concept must be carefully considered by the
schools. Their wholehearted commitment must be assured, for
nothing could be so damaging as to invite confidences and then
not to be able to honor them. The legal problems raised when a
school official acts in the counselor's role must also be
resolved and cooperation obtained from the authorities to prevent
pressure on individuals who may not enjoy a technical legal
privilege. Because school policies frequently forbid teachers to
honor student confidences, many are hesitant to encourage
personal involvement, which may place the student in jeopardy. </p>

<p>Many believe that the ombudsman-counselor should provide his
services for other kinds of adolescent problems in addition to
those related to drugs-family, sex, alcohol, and so on.&quot;
Classroom teachers often have tremendous influence on students,
especially on those who lack parental understanding. They occupy
a more neutral position than parents and sometimes are better
able to identify behavior requiring special counseling or
referral. </p>

<p>Until now, schools have relied almost entirely on classroom
teachers to assist student drug abusers in finding help. Public
funds earmarked for &quot;teacher training courses&quot; have
rarely included guidance-counseling personnel. It is unfortunate
that schools have failed to take advantage of the position of
those guidance counselors who enjoy the trust and respect of
young people. Recently, the American Personnel and Guidance
Association began developing a national effort to train guidance
workers to deal with the complexities of drug abuse. The program
is being held in abeyance until adequate seed money can be
procured. </p>

<p>Information alone cannot always help a youthful user. The head
of a Mexican-American outreach program in Los Angeles testified
before Congress that a large proportion of youth in his area were
heavily addicted to barbiturates, but that education could not
help when there was no place in the area they could go for
medical aid in withdrawal. Teacher and guidance counselors should
provide the link between the school and treatment resources that
is now lacking in many places. If it is to reach users or
experimenters, a school education program not only must supply
information on where to go for help but also must have an
effective system for getting them there. Teachers or counselors
must know, for example, whether the student-user can receive
treatment on his own (as in California and Connecticut) or must
have parental permission before anyone can treat him (as in most
other states). School counselors should be willing to take the
initiative in getting the student to the treatment service and in
running bureaucratic interference for him. They may even have to
help make parents more sensitive to their children's drug problem
in an effort to prevent them from acting destructively. </p>

<p>On the other hand, treatment facilities in many areas far
outnumber institutions that focus on prevention. Young people who
do not use drugs have legitimate questions but find few places to
which they can turn for answers. The school counselor can act as
an effective source of information. </p>

<p>Any well-balanced school program should harness the support
and cooperation of outside community elements in providing help
to young abusers. The Office of Education's national teacher
training program challenged schools to consider community
motivation as their ultimate long-range goal. OE staff members
report that teachers were often unsuccessful in gaining the
necessary support of politicians, school board members,
principals, and parents in accomplishing this final phase of
their program. As a rule, the attitudes of the communities
precluded the exploration of innovative ways to prevent drug
abuse. What is needed, therefore, is widespread local awareness
of the need for unity in making progress-a recognition that
educational institutions are merely conduits through which
communal efforts must pass. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>OUT-OF-SCHOOL DRUG-EDUCATION PROGRAMS</b> </p>

<p>Education does not take place only in school. As Helen Nowlis
stated before Congress: </p>

<p>It is learning about drugs that should concern us today,
rather than the formal mechanisms for presenting drug
information. Information by itself is not education, education by
itself is not learning. </p>

<p>How do people, particularly young people, learn about drugs
and form their drug-related attitudes? We believe that a series
of influences help shape these attitudes: the atmosphere of the
school, as well as the factual information presented there; the
life-style at home, and the attitude of parents; peer-group
pressures; popular culture, including music, films, magazines and
nationally publicized events; personal experiences with drugs or
drug-related substances; the availability of alternative
mechanisms for carrying out certain kinds of behavior-risk
taking, wish fulfillment, etc .24 </p>

<p>Most of a youth's initial information about a subject comes
from his peers. A survey of Maryland high school students showed
that they got most of their drug information and attitudes from
peers and underground newspapers. In addition, the students most
prone to serious drug abuse are often those who are most
antagonistic to the school climate. There is general agreement
that more out-of-school programs are needed to reach those whom
the schools cannot reach. Unfortunately, antidrug programs run by
private and public organizations outside the school are of
varying quality and totally lacking in evaluation. Nevertheless,
the New York Addiction Control Commission alone spent $1 million
in 1970 on such &quot;preventive education.&quot; </p>

<p>Most prevention programs, besides lacking evaluation, are not
grounded on any hypotheses based on field observations. Dr.
Irving Lukoff, of the Columbia University School of Social Work,
believes that effective prevention programs await basic research
to discover what influences young people in heavily addicted
areas not to take drugs, why some do use drugs, and how drug use
spreads. </p>

<p>The most that can be done at this point is to categorize five
basic kinds of nonschool prevention programs: </p>

<hr>

<p><b>PEER-GROUP PROGRAMS</b> </p>

<p>Many types of teenage peer-group, antidrug programs have
emerged. The following are illustrative: </p>

<p>The members of one national group-the Smarteens-pledge not to
use drugs, wear buttons deriding drug use, and distribute posters
scorning the drug culture. The psychology is to provide support
and reinforcement for youngsters who choose not to use drugs.
Such a technique, however, merely widens the gap between the
&quot;squares&quot; and the drug users and alienates the latter
still further. Those familiar with the group admit it has its
greatest impact in middle-class suburban areas. </p>

<p>Members of Project DARE (Drug Abuse Research and Evaluation),
in the Los Angeles area, do not use drugs, but participate in the
rest of the psychedelic scene-rock music, flashy dress, crafts-so
as to show that one can be &quot;cool&quot; without being
drugged. Other activities include evaluating drug education
films, lecturing to encourage an understanding of today's drug
culture, and stimulating the involvement of youth in the solution
of community problems. </p>

<p>Two New York City ghetto high schools have experimented with a
program in which members of a black youth organization visit the
schools, assess the drug situation, and then
&quot;penetrate&quot; by mixing at the ball courts and other
student gathering places, seeking to identify student pushers and
deal with them, either through persuasion or by reporting them to
the authorities. Identified users are urged to seek treatment.
The organization itself reports a reduction in selling and usage
of drugs, but no official evaluation is obtainable. </p>

<p>Teen Challenge is a private, religion-oriented agency with
centers across the country that offer treatment to anyone over
eighteen. Its premise is that a drug user should be given an
opportunity to undergo a religious experience that can give him
the strength to overcome his destructive desires and habits. </p>

<p>Private businesses often fund programs offering alternatives
to youth. One recently financed a project involving youth groups
from Harlem and Nassau County, utilizing peer-group dynamics as
an alternative to drug abuse. Films, magazines, and educational
materials created by the students are disseminated to schools and
community organizations. </p>

<p>Several treatment and rehabilitation facilities have opened
their doors to youngsters for whom they organize extracurricular
activities. Patients in a Detroit methadone facility have
&quot;hit the streets&quot; to provide speakers, peer and family
counseling, and neighborhood projects to stimulate political
awareness and consumer education. RAP, Inc., a Washington, D.C.,
therapeutic community, encourages neighborhood children to join a
&quot;block club&quot; designed to channel energies
constructively. Tutoring services, speakers, and library
privileges are extended to members of the group. </p>

<p>Some of the more creative programs involve both drug
experimenters and nonusers in activities that seek to explore
ways youth can pursue inward and outward experiences that will
make drug use less desirable. Dr. William Soskin's Project
Community in Berkeley has such a program for 140 youths between
the ages of fourteen and eighteen. Acting on the hypothesis that
home and school have not provided sufficiently satisfying
influences in their lives, the Center seeks to create a
&quot;third force&quot; consisting of a group of peers, under
supervision, who engage in mutual activities a few hours a day.
These activities include inward meditation, body language,
poetry, and even active practical jokes for the more aggressive
members. Rap sessions and encounter groups as well as active
community projects and recreation outings complete the program.
Sympathetic counselors are always available to talk to an
individual about his problems. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FREE CLINICS AND CRISIS CENTERS</b> </p>

<p>There are a number of free medical clinics for &quot;street
people&quot; providing a range of services on a twenty-four-hour
basis-not only emergency medical or psychological help for drug
crises (bad trips and severe reactions), but also up-to-date
information on the quality and effects of drugs currently being
sold in the immediate area, long-term treatment, and referral.
Their basic purpose is not to proselytize against drugs but to
provide help when people need it most and to disseminate accurate
analyses of the risks of street drugs. In some cases, for
example, there followed a dramatic decrease in the use of
particular drugs or batches of drugs after the clinic staff
spread the word that a particular product was having bad effects
.2' Free medical clinics reach those in or on the edge of the
drug culture, and they enjoy a high degree of credibility. Most
crisis centers cater to a variety of needs, including draft,
abortion, and family counseling. These facilities sometimes offer
temporary residence for runaways and intervention with parents.
Usually, they give medical help to those with drug problems and
provide speakers and materials as well as information to other
community organizations, including schools. Some even provide
employment in crafts and work with delinquent youngsters in the
community. </p>

<p>Most clinics and crisis centers are run by the youths
themselves with professional and medical guidance. Young people
are attracted by their neutral attitude toward drug use. What
preventive effects, if any, the centers have on continued drug
use is extremely speculative, but they fill acute needs for help
in immediate health crises and for accurate information. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>&quot;HOT-LINE&quot; TELEPHONE SERVICES</b> </p>

<p>Anyone can call such a telephone service anonymously with
questions about drug reactions as well as a score of other
problems. Not infrequently, hot-line staffers are asked to locate
lost pets, give advice on domestic squabbles, and make referrals.
It is inherent in the nature of such a service that there is no
way of telling what happens to callers, or whether they make use
of the advice and information given about drugs and treatment
services, or whether, indeed, calls are legitimate. Anonymity
constitutes the service's main attraction. Ex-users often find
positive reinforcement and satisfaction in serving as hot-line
operators. Yet, there are cases where constantly talking about
drug effects has led these people back to drug use. As a rule,
however, their past drug experiences enhance their ability to
deal effectively with crisis situations. In cases of extreme
emergency, trained professionals are consulted. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AFTERSCHOOL AND INSTEAD-OF-SCHOOL PREVENTION PROGRAMS</b> </p>

<p>As of 1970, New York City's Addiction Services Agency ran
sixteen youth centers in poverty areas to discourage drug use by
nonusers or early experimenters aged nine to nineteen and
referred by parents, schools, police, or courts. Ten centers were
funded by OEO, four by NIMH, but all were to be shifted to local
and state funding. ASA was asking for money to open four more
centers in middle-class neighborhoods. </p>

<p>ASA has estimated that 80 per cent of New York City youths
over twelve have experimented with at least one drug. The
majority, however, reportedly have no deep-seated mental problems
requiring a residential therapeutic community setting. During
1970, about 500 youths were in such afterschool centers at any
one time and some 5,440 in all were served. </p>

<p>The focus is on group therapy and counseling to help the youth
make basic decisions about his values and life goals.
&quot;Disrupters,&quot; seriously disturbed youth, and heavy
opiate users are not eligible. Parent groups also operate out of
the centers, which try to work with the schools, so that teachers
too can play a supportive role. </p>

<p>Centers are open five days a week, each handling 50 youths at
a time. Youths, if attending school, come to the center in the
afternoons, generally for a period of three to six months. If
they are not in school, center activities are scheduled during
the day. Peer-group sessions, role-playing and psychodrama,
individual counseling, recreation, workshops, and seminars are
all used. An attempt is made to establish role-model
identification with staff members. </p>

<p>These centers have not, to our knowledge, been evaluated
systematically. Their aim is to create pressure against the use
of drugs. The agency's own assessment is that the centers have
had difficulty because the youths referred to them need more
supportive services than can be offered. </p>

<p>There have been recurrent proposals for outdoor work or summer
camps for drug-using youngsters. ASA would like to create one for
150-180 youths aged twelve to nineteen, modeled on Outward Bound.
(This is a program that gets youth into the country, where they
increase their wilderness skills in challenging situations, thus
increasing their sense of confidence and selfworth.)
Group-encounter sessions would be combined with regular camp
life. Dr. Gordon Heistad, of the University of Minnesota, has
experimented (successfully, he believes) with a camp model
combining drug education and regular camp life for high school
leaders. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DRUGMOBILES</b> </p>

<p>These vehicles, which follow street youth into their natural
haunts, to ball games and rock concerts, have been tried in
several cities. Generally, they feature informational exhibits
and ex-addict staffers. Counselors answer inquiries on an
individual basis and ensure anonymity. </p>

<p>Credible staff is quite difficult to retain, since trained
counselors prefer working with more stable programs. In most
cases, these mobile units end up having middle-aged discussion
leaders with good intentions but little facility in
communicating. Many young people suggest that more emphasis
should be put on honest discussions and less on
&quot;clever&quot; exhibits. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE NATIONAL MEDIA</b> </p>

<p>A perpetual dispute in the drug-education field involves the
influence of the national media on drug-abuse-prevention efforts.
What effect do they have? What effect should they have? Some who
work with young drug users believe that television is more likely
to influence them than school programs, because they relate more
sympathetically to the medium; others fear that a high powered
television campaign stressing &quot;risks, thrills, scares,
fantasies, high tragedy and antiheroism&quot; will increase drug
experimentation.&quot; Dr. Norman Zinberg points out that
television may bend growing children in the direction of seeking
experiences that transcend tangible boundaries, such as
mind-altering drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>The role played by the mass media in any comprehensive drug
education effort depends on the specific objectives of that
effort and the methods used to attain them. The current lack of
agreement on these matters, however, makes it difficult to
conceive of the ideal media program and virtually impossible to
predict the benefits to be derived from it. Nevertheless, as the
following review of present efforts will show, everybody is doing
something. </p>

<p>Between 1968 and 1970, the National Institute of Mental Health
conducted a national television campaign against drugs, featuring
spots created by the Grey Advertising Company with famous
&quot;name personalities,&quot; such as Rod Serling and the
Everly Brothers. Air time was donated on a public-service basis,
and eighteen different films were supplied to every major network
station and most independents. Radio stations also aired antidrug
messages, twelve in all. Some fourteen posters and pamphlets were
mailed out to supplement the campaign. No one knows what the
total effect was, aside from generating 22 million requests for
information. Gerald Kurtz, Director of the Office of
Communication at NIMH, has been quoted as saying that the effort,
which was specifically youth-oriented, was not expected to turn
young people away from drugs. Its real purpose, rather, was to
heighten the concern of laymen and private organizations and
create national awareness of the problem of drug abuse. </p>

<p>In 1970, a new national media campaign was begun under White
House sponsorship, based on the same untested assumption that
television can &quot;unsell&quot; drug usage. According to the
prevailing theory, peer pressure against drugs can be created to
reinforce those who have not yet tried drugs or are only very
occasional users. The approach still lumps all drugs together
under the slogan &quot;Why Do You Think They Call It Dope?&quot;
Some black reporters have criticized it as obviously a product of
the white advertising world, both in its content and in its style
of presentation. It was put together by the Compton Agency, which
worked through the Advertising Council. The new campaign started
by directing its programs to the preteen group, then moved to
high school and college audiences, then to blacks, parents, and
the military. While medical hazards are mentioned, the emphasis
is on inculcating the attitude that taking drugs is
&quot;stupid&quot; rather than on presenting factual information.
</p>

<p>Other groups have entered the media fight against drug abuse.
In February, 1971, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting began
airing eight one-hour programs entitled &quot;The Turned-On
Crisis.&quot; The series, intended for general audiences,
includes programs on several facets of the drug problem. For
those more involved in the drug problem, CPB can also provide an
in-service training program of six thirty-minute segments for
teachers and school administrators and an in-class series of
eight twenty-minute programs for junior high school youth. </p>

<p>There are many efforts to develop effective television and
radio antidrug spot ads, but whether any such device can
counterbalance everyday pressures supporting drug use is
doubtful. It has been pointed out that most teenagers listen
incessantly to the radio, while their television viewing is
sporadic, and that radio spots repeated between rock songs are
more likely to reach them than spots on television. But merely
reaching the audience is not enough; the ads must be effective.
Some stations that carry antidrug spots have complained of a lack
of good material but an abundance of poor, ineffective material.
The National Institute of Mental Health has provided funds to the
National Coordinating Council on Drug Education to evaluate radio
and television material; the results are included in a monthly
newsletter, Tune In, distributed to approximately 5,600 radio and
television stations. Included are reviews of spot announcements,
factual programs, interviews, and public-service announcements
available to the media for broadcasting. </p>

<p>A black-audience station in Woodside, New York-WWRL has
adopted a more direct approach: It asks listeners to call in the
names of pushers, which it then submits to the police; the
caller's anonymity is kept, and all tips are investigated. The
station contends that thirty-two arrests have been made in six
months as a result of this campaign. It also broadcasts a
referral telephone number for those who want help with their own
drug problems. </p>

<p>Other radio stations are beginning to use the rock sound in
communicating antidrug messages. Disk jockeys, for example, play
authentic-sounding rock tunes with lyrics describing youthful
deaths caused by overdoses or by the ingestion of poor-quality
street drugs, in the hope that the young will pay serious heed.
But some teenagers resent this attempt to make the scare approach
pleasing to the ear. </p>

<p>The subject of rock music raises another question about the
relation between national media and the drug problem. Some
observers believe that the media are better at aggravating the
problem than at solving it. Songs with so-called drug-related
lyrics were banned from the airwaves by the Federal
Communications Commission because of their alleged potential to
glamorize drug abuse. This action was vigorously opposed by
underground radio stations, record companies, and private
organizations, which castigated the FCC for exercising censorship
and imposing an &quot;establishment&quot; interpretation of music
on the general public. A booklet put out by the Justice
Department's Bureau of Narcotics, entitled Drug Taking in Youth,
declares that, &quot;Numerous entertainers whose records are
played frequently are drug advocates. Many popular songs have
hidden or expressed drug allusions. Underground FM radio stations
late at night reach many young people with 'acid' rock and their
overt or disguised messages about drug use, sources, and
availability. Rock festivals are frequently advertised through
this medium.&quot;&quot; The effects of rock lyrics on an
individual's decision to use drugs still remain a mystery,
however, clouded by the contradictory pronouncements of
government spokesmen and rock-music enthusiasts. </p>

<p>Television has also been charged with contributing negatively
to the drug problem because of its steady advertising of over-the
counter drugs. In 1969, drug manufacturers reportedly spent $13.7
million for television promotion of seventeen brands of sedatives
and stimulants alone. All types of advertising for all
proprietary drugs involved expenditures of $282 million. Messages
that are criticized for &quot;pushing&quot; over-the-counter
medication promise to solve problems and alleviate everyday
stresses. The manufacturer of a popular pain reliever supports a
successful advertising package attributing love, success,
tranquillity, self confidence, health, and so on, ad infinitum,
to its product. Another commercial selling children's vitamins
shows two youngsters floating through the sky on a magic carpet
after chewing the tablets. </p>

<p>Although manufacturers of proprietary (over-the-counter) drugs
deny the cause-and-effect relationship between advertising and
abuse, many public groups are adamant about eliminating mood drug
advertisements. The National Association of Broadcasters, for
example, has proposed content restraints and criteria for the
broadcasting of such messages. Both the FTC and HEW have been
studying the relationship between over-the-counter drug ads on
television and drug abuse. Members of Congress are also holding
hearings on advertising that urges mood alteration through
nonprescription drugs. An HEW-sponsored study concludes: </p>

<p>By and large, advertising, per se, seems to have a relatively
low level of general influence upon students, when compared to
other environmental factors such as home (parents) and school
(peer groups) . This suggests that advertising is not, by itself,
responsible for student behavior toward drugs and/or other
products, substances or activities. </p>

<p>At most, advertising operates within the context of the
student's total environment and cannot be uniquely responsible
for student values, attitudes and beliefs. </p>

<p>Even though advertising, per se, may not be considered
uniquely responsible for attitudes towards legal and illegal
drugs, the students, nevertheless, feel that it is potentially an
influencing agent, particularly on the youngest students.30 </p>

<p>The study, based on interviews with 560 fifth-, seventh-, and
eleventh-grade California students, covered drugs of all kinds,
including Compoz, Contac, Alka-Seltzer, Bayer Aspirin, as well as
Salem and Marlboro cigarettes. Students questioned after viewing
the ads expressed disbelief of the advertiser's claims, as
follows: Cornpoz-46 per cent; Salem-31 per cent; Contac-40 per
cent; Bayer Aspirin-19 per cent; Alka-Seltzer-12 per cent;
Marlboro -11 per cent. The study also found that &quot;users of
illegal drugs tend to be more receptive to proprietary drug ads
than non-users.&quot; Concluding that such ads may be a
&quot;cultural prop in the maintenance of favorable attitudes
toward drug usage among the young, the study suggested that the
industry initiate an examination of&quot; promotional programs
and more government studies of children's receptivity. </p>

<p>No formal report has been released on the FTC study.
Nevertheless, it is the view of a number of FTC staff members, as
well as some scientists and some officials of BNDD, that such a
relationship does exist in certain cases.&quot; In any event,
many lawyers are convinced that the FTC has the power to attack
many of the suspicious ads without necessarily proving the
existence of such a relationship. </p>

<p>A study by four physicians at the University of Southern
California pointed out that high-pressure advertising of
prescription drugs to physicians depends on a technique of
&quot;mystification.&quot;&quot; The ads identify ordinary human
reactions and emotions as symptoms of physical illness and then
prescribe a drug as remedy. Tofranil, an antidepressant drug, is
cited as one example. The ad suggests that parents agonizing over
a runaway daughter might be treated with the drug. The same
technique may be applied to television ads for proprietary drugs
that impel the listener to seek a drug remedy for the relief of
normal tensions arising from interpersonal relations. </p>

<p>Another example is the excessive use of over-the-counter
drugs. Richard Blum reports that those who use such drugs heavily
assert more frequently than others that medicines make a
difference in the way one feels; also, they recall having more
medicines in their childhood homes than do light users. Not
surprisingly, therefore, they are more likely to use drugs to
reduce fear, induce courage, or change mood in social
situations.&quot; Similarly, many youths learn favorable
attitudes about drugs through underground newspapers; yet, these
papers often present accurate reports about specific drug dangers
and effects. This source of information should not be ignored,
even though its ideological slant may be quite different from
that of official sources of drug education. If solid research
shows that a drug has severe toxic effects, an underground paper
may be the quickest and surest way to communicate with those most
likely to be damaged by it. For example, Washington, D.C.'s
Quicksilver Times has printed the pharmacological analyses of
street samples provided by the Washington Free Clinic as a
warning of the unreliability of certain varieties of drugs then
available. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FILMS AND AUDIO VISUALS</b> </p>

<p>The recent emphasis on school drug-education programs has
produced a receptive market for drug films and audiovisual
materials; in the past few years, the number of these teaching
devices has reached approximately two hundred. The potential
value of visual teaching cannot be disputed-it makes learning
situations more realistic and more acceptable, especially to
television-oriented youth. The problem, however, for any school
or civic group is how to distinguish between effective material
and that which is inaccurate or counterproductive. Certainly,
there ought to be readily accessible, up-to-date evaluations of
drug films by both experienced adult and student viewers,
indicating the content, level of sophistication, target audience,
and goal orientation of the films. Different reviewers may well
come to different conclusions, but the plethora of drug films now
being sold or given away makes a meaningful choice impossible in
the absence of some reasonably reliable guide. </p>

<p>The Educational Products Information Exchange, which de<br>
</p>

<p>spots and films created by young people tend to present
information that is honest and sensitive to the needs of their
peers. </p>

<p>Many evaluators criticize existing films for not conforming to
the life-styles of the viewer, for containing technical
inaccuracies, and for failing to use either black or Puerto Rican
actors or, at least, a Spanish soundtrack. It has been suggested
that students do not identify with actors or even with real
people in a strange setting, and that movies made in the
students' own locale may have more effect. Several drug-treatment
programs are planning homemade movies set against familiar
backgrounds. Such a series was made in Bedford-Stuyvesant by
local talent, under the sponsorship of the Bedford-Stuyvesant
Restoration Corporation, and was shown on New York's Channel 13. </p>

<p>Most problems, however, seem to occur once the film is in the
teacher's hands, ready for use. Fortunately, most film reports
are accompanied by remarks on how to use the materials
effectively. Previewing is the essential first step, preferably
with students as well as with adult screeners. Films should not
be shown if they fail to meet the audience's level of knowledge
and sophistication. Next, creative interaction should take place
between the audience, the educator, and the film. Students should
be allowed to give their own evaluation or to discuss their
feelings about the film's message. </p>

<p>A plethora of commercial films focusing on the youthful drug
culture has flooded the market. As is to be expected, many such
movies sensationalize and exploit the drug-abuse problem. A few,
however, present the cruel realities of drug addiction in a
sensitive manner, thus meriting their use in student and adult
educational programs. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
feels that &quot;recent films directed to youth ... initiate them
into the drug scene.&quot; </p>

<p>The emphasis on student participation has prompted a new
method-videotaping the students' own discussions on drugsthat is
being tried in many classrooms. Educators are able to gain
insights from studying the dynamics of the situation, and
students profit from observing themselves in peer-group settings
attempting to solve problems and make decisions collectively.
Outside the schools, videotapes have been used successfully in
adult training courses, especially those focusing on increasing
the participants' level of communication. For most, the
experience becomes a mirror reflecting strengths, weaknesses, and
limitations in dealing with others. Unlike the passive screening
of drug education films, live videotape replays often enhance the
ability of teachers and parents to relate to young people.
Unfortunately, however, videotape apparatus is too costly for
most schools and civic groups. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SCHOOL CURRICULA</b> </p>

<p>Paralleling the proliferation of antidrug films has been the
emergence of packaged curricula. Private businesses, state
departments of education, local school systems, publishers,
pharmaceutical manufacturers, professional associations,
consulting firms, and universities have all jumped on the
bandwagon in response to the growing demand for ready-made drug
courses. These vary tremendously in quality, content, and
approach. Some are very useful, while others are aimed merely at
exploiting the commercial market, offering little more than the
basic facts about drugs with a few suggestions about research
projects for students. The better material offers teachers
thoughtful background information on specific drugs, suggestions
for effective course presentation and teaching aids and flexible
lesson plans. </p>

<p>Such publications as the NIMH Resource Book for Drug Abuse
Education and Teaching About Drugs: A Curriculum Guide, K-12,
issued by the American School Health-Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, contain excellent background material on particular
drugs. The National Clearinghouse for Drug Abuse Information will
send, on request, eight model curricula from various school
systems, again without endorsement or evaluation of their
appropriateness for different target groups. As a total package,
the booklets provide a valuable diversity of approaches as well
as supplemental resources. A few of the education packages
encourage self-examination by both teachers and students. </p>

<p>The current emphasis on youthful self-evaluation has given
rise to techniques stressing the importance of student values in
making decisions about drugs. Those who promulgate the value
approach contend that behavior and personal values are
inseparable. Richard E. Carney believes that drug abuse can be
prevented, or at least explained, if it is viewed as an
individual's attempt to actualize his values. In one of his
studies, drug users placed significantly less value on such
categories as &quot;power&quot; as it related to participation in
student organizations, clubs, and &quot;politics&quot;;
&quot;affection&quot; and &quot;respect&quot; as they related to
their willingness to become involved in parental conferences on
important personal subjects; and &quot;skill&quot; as it related
to participation in sports and organized activities.&quot; But no
one knows how students come to hold certain values, or why some
values are more prevalent than others. This may explain the
adamant refusal of many schools to consider adoption of the
value-clarifying curriculum until more concrete data are made
available. Channels are opening up, however, and skeptical
educators are becoming more tolerant of &quot;radical&quot;
approaches to education. Several counties in Maryland, for
example, recently adopted a value-oriented curriculum package
developed by Drug Central, a division of Washington, D.C.'s
Council of Governments. As is often the case with new methods,
the Maryland teachers are in need of special training programs to
assure positive results in the classroom. At present, increasing
numbers of schools are adopting this approach and report
favorable responses from students and teachers alike. </p>

<p>Other imaginative innovations in the field are receiving
favorable support from the educational community. The Creative
Learning Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has integrated
materials available for elementary and junior high schools
focusing on problem solving and teaching younger children how to
make decisions about life and drugs. A vast array of unique
teaching aids is offered for classes, and teachers are equipped
with a comprehensive manual containing drug-abuse information,
sound medical information for use in emergencies, and suggestions
for generating group discussions. The group's services will be
broadened to include short-term programs, guides for student
counselors, preschool film strips, and materials for inner-city,
Spanish-speaking youngsters. </p>

<p>Macro Systems, Inc., has a complex package consisting of a
self-discovery kit for use by the teacher in finding out his own
position on drugs and exploring his own biases, before proceeding
to lead an objective and probing discussion among his students.
It also contains a consensus map for the classroom that enables
students to plot their own attitudes compared with those of their
peers. </p>

<p>It is encouraging to note that at least one group, New
Dimensions Publishing Company, has responded to the scarcity of
materials for minorities. This New York City firm produces books
in Spanish and English for blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican
Americans at the elementary level. </p>

<p>There are undoubtedly other good materials that we did not
happen to find. As yet, no one can prove that any particular
package or curriculum has an edge over others. There is no
present basis of comparison, since distributors rarely make
provisions for evaluation, student testing, periodical
re-evaluation, or updating of their materials, although the
Office of Education is funding efforts in the area. </p>

<p>For any curriculum, it is essential that teachers be
sensitized to the philosophy, techniques, and goals of the
materials. If the instructors fear the subject and doubt their
ability to teach it, the odds are that they will not succeed with
young people, regardless of the caliber of the materials. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>EDUCATION FOR NONSTUDENTS</b> </p>

<p>Despite massive expenditures on public drug-abuse-education
programs, there is still widespread ignorance of basic drug facts
among the population at large. For instance, a New York Addiction
Control Commission survey of 6,000 persons aged thirteen and up
found that one out of every four regarded drug abuse as among the
top four problems facing the nation. Yet, 67 per cent had no idea
what should be done about it; 60 per cent did not know what state
agencies were at work on the problem; and 50 per cent did not
know what effects heroin or amphetamines had on users.&quot; A
Gallup poll in December, 1970, showed that 64 per cent of the
adults and 39 per cent of the students interviewed thought drugs
were a serious problem in the public schools.&quot; </p>

<p>In most cases, parents, teachers, and community leaders are
more in need of accurate information about drugs than students
are. Parental responses to a student's involvement in drugs can
curb or accelerate further experimentation. It is therefore
unfortunate that most school drug-education programs have not
prepared parents to deal with the complex drug issue. For parents
need not only accurate information but also the ability to
discriminate between the effects of experimenting once with
marijuana and those of heavy involvement with drugs as well as
the ability to establish and maintain lines of honest
communication with their children. Thus, to begin with,
school-education programs should include a parent component.
Several sessions could be designed to encourage adult
participation and interaction with groups of young people.
Community information and education programs sponsored by private
and public organizations could also serve to reach and inform
parents. Even more importantly parents need a place to go for
specific help when they find drug abuse in their own family. As
noted in a newspaper article, &quot;This is sheer panic that
simply cannot wait. If advice is not quickly available, fear,
anxiety, rage or protectivism takes over. If action is taken
during the panic and without advice, irrevocable damage may be
done to the sick victim as well as to the total family structure
and relationships.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>As a general rule, parent &quot;help&quot; programs should
impart sympathy and counseling together with facts. The guilt,
fear, and anger parents are likely to feel when a family drug
crisis occurs should be channeled into constructive action
through effective self-help programs. Parents of drug-dependent
children can also help each other. It is often beneficial to talk
to someone else who has been through a family drug crisis in
trying to approach the situation calmly and objectively. No one
is better prepared to provide this assistance than those parents
who have been forced to deal with their own children's abuse of
drugs. Opinion varies concerning the value of involving parents
in group discussions with their own children. Some planners
insist that direct family interaction is always
counterproductive, while others advocate the confrontation of
familial problems after the initial ice-breaking session. </p>

<p>New York's ASA runs programs for parents and relatives of
serious drug-users and for community residents worried about the
problem in their neighborhood generally. Several school programs
(as in Nassau County, New York, and in Los Angeles) also run
special sessions for the parents of children enrolled in the
schools. In some, parents participate with youngsters (not their
own) in group discussions on why young people use drugs. There
are, of course, a multitude of drug-information programs run by
civic groups, eager to involve parents. (In Miami, for instance,
about two dozen organizations have drug-abuse education
programs.) Many parent-oriented programs focus too heavily on how
to recognize the symptoms of drug usage and may provoke needless
confrontation between parent and child. Many are not prepared to
help in actual cases. Until very recently, most urban centers had
no place where parents could go for balanced personal advice
about what to do when they suspected, or discovered, their child
was using drugs. </p>

<p>Experts do not agree on how a parent should react when
confronted with a drug-abuse crisis. They all begin by urging the
parent not to panic but differ markedly on what should be done in
coping with the crisis. Some suggest that the parent compel the
child to seek treatment, even by threatening to throw him out of
the house. Others counsel the parent to be patient and
understanding in an effort to get at the underlying problems. Dr.
Paul Blachley suggests that relatives of a drug user be told that
&quot;bailing him out&quot; encourages continuation of dependence
and drug use and advises that they not be accessory to the
problem.&quot; Sidney Cohen, former director of NIMH's drug
program, advocates a middle course, urging parents to demonstrate
an attitude of &quot;I love you and I will help you, but I won't
support you if you persist in behavior that I believe to be
detrimental to you.&quot;&quot; He further advises that these
decisions must be made on an individual basis, depending on the
drugs involved, the child's age, and his willingness to seek help
voluntarily. </p>

<p>Of course, other adults who come into contact with youth need
accurate information on drugs-especially teachers, counselors,
policemen, and doctors. How much information is needed has yet to
be assessed. Nevertheless, NIMH recently funded the Bureau of
Social Science Research to study the knowledge levels of
professionals who have contact with the drug scene in Baltimore
and San Francisco. The study will focus on eleven occupational
groups, including policemen, probation officers, pediatricians,
general practitioners, psychologists, social workers, teachers,
school administrators, and counselors. Results should cast some
light on the level of knowledge in the various professions, as
well as on prevailing attitudes, and should indicate methods of
upgrading levels of education. </p>

<p>The current emphasis is primarily on training teachers,
especially through the Office of Education. But other youth
workers deserve attention as well. The National Coordinating
Council on Drug Education points out, with a note of lament,
that, in 1971, half of the administration's funds for drug-abuse
education were spent on teacher training. In contrast, New York
City's ASA would put primary emphasis on a training institute to
prepare a &quot;virtual army of skilled addiction
specialists&quot; to interact with drug-prone youth within the
framework of existing institutionsschools, churches, recreation
programs, settlement houses, block associations, and other
groups. </p>

<p>To enhance the effectiveness of local efforts, the National
Coordinating Council on Drug Education has put out a manual for
community action-Common Sense Lives Here-that sets out a process
whereby interested community people can define their community
drug problem and work together to solve it. Not a &quot;how
to&quot; manual, the pamphlet, together with an accompanying
film, encourage each community to mobilize its own resources and
seek the local causes and cures for increasing drug use before
attempting to formulate a plan of action. It advocates federal
planning grants for communities to finance this preparatory
process. (It is possible that such grants could be made under
Title I of the 1970 Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.) Also,
it cautions against rushing into any major educational effort
until the nature of the local problem is clearly perceived and
adequate support has been gained. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SPONSORS OF CURRENT EFFORTS</b> </p>

<p><b>THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT</b> </p>

<p>A number of federal agencies participate in
drug-abuse-education programming, but only five have a
substantial involvement the National Institute of Mental Health,
the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Office of
Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and
the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. Their expenditure
levels and basic activities are described in Staff Paper 5. </p>

<p>There is general agreement among these primary agencies that
their present system of program development and funding is
piecemeal, uncoordinated, and inefficient. It involves various
agencies independently supporting different drug-abuse programs
without regard for the resulting duplication of effort and wasted
resources. Ongoing programs, too, are poorly evaluated or not
evaluated at all. Consequently, the agencies have reached a dead
end. They are finding it virtually impossible to judge the
success of programs or even to design cost-benefit analyses
without comprehensive assessments. Only one fact is certain:
Millions of dollars are being spent. just how effectively funds
are being used is still unknown. </p>

<p><b>STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS</b> </p>

<p>Virtually every sizable community in the country now has at
least one public or private drug-abuse prevention and education
program. The quality of these efforts varies from one area to
another, depending, for example, on the flow of funding
information from Washington, the attitudes and concerns of local
citizens, the fiscal condition of the locality, and the number of
agencies active in prevention programming. State education
administrators agree that there are too many crash programs
concentrating on drug education in isolation; that there is not
enough coordination of effort where many agencies are in the same
field; that there is too much attention to medical and legal
factors and not enough to social and psychological factors; and
that, finally, there is too little an attempt to relate specific
drug use to the &quot;drug culture,&quot; and too much reliance
on one-way education (i.e., handouts, lectures, films, and
speakers). </p>

<p>States also suffer from a lack of support from school
administrators and local political structures. The National
League of Cities/U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National
Association of Counties are responding by planning educational
programs beamed at local office holders. </p>

<p>This chaotic situation is further complicated by the
innumerable commercial firms entering the field, putting out an
avalanche of gimmicks as well as legitimate drug-education
materials, along with model school curricula, films, and cartoon
books. State planners have been inundated by the tide of
mass-produced course materials and usually have been unsuccessful
in sorting the good from the bad. </p>

<p>Different agencies in different states provide drug education
funds in response to the variety of laws. A 1970 compilation by
HEW of drug-abuse education programs supported by state education
agencies shows that twenty-one states have legal requirements for
school drug (and alcohol) education and are &quot;complying&quot;
with them. Four other states have programs in all educational
districts, despite a lack of legal requirements. In eleven states
and Puerto Rico, some, but not all, districts have school
programs. A parallel survey of drug programs supported by state
health authorities, conducted by NIMH in 1970, found that
twenty-two states had such health-related programs, and sixteen
more had them in the planning stages. </p>

<p>A major problem at the state level is lack of effective
coordination. Most states are plagued by a lack of cooperation
between existing programs, by unnecessary overlap and duplication
of effort, and by an insufficient flow of information from the
grassroots level to the legislature to stimulate effective
policies and leadership. A few states, such as Arizona,
California, and now Florida, have statewide councils to
coordinate and give direction to public and private agencies in
the field. California alone has 300 community-based drug-abuse
programs, all of which have sprung up in the past two years. New
York City has 47 identifiable drug-education programs, and New
York State has Community Narcotics Education Centers in sixteen
localities, manned by professionals, as well as 57 local
narcotics-guidance councils to coordinate local programs. </p>

<p>To eliminate the fragmentation that exists among the states, a
National Association of State Drug Abuse Coordinators was
organized recently. Since it is still in the organizational
stages, however, its impact remains uncertain. </p>

<p><b>PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS</b> </p>

<p>A plethora of professional organizations, social-welfare
associations, charitable volunteer organizations, and other
groups also conduct community education programs. Few, if any, of
these programs have been evaluated with regard to their impact on
a target population or their record of accomplishing specific
goals. They rarely assume an action-oriented role, preferring
instead simply to disseminate educational brochures and
audiovisuals. Their programs all look rational and successful on
paper, but no one has any real notion of their effectiveness,
except, perhaps, for a pervasive feeling that nothing they have
done so far has made much difference. In fact, they are often
criticized for jumping into the drug field without first asking
for experienced advice on what their role ought to be. Also, the
huge sums of money they expended on mediocre printed materials
would, according to people involved in delivery of service
programs, be better spent on the treatment and rehabilitation of
addicts. </p>

<p>On the other hand, some private groups do make successful use
of low-key approaches in performing unique and valuable services.
Several minority professional associations, for example, sponsor
clinics that provide dental care for addicts and support halfway
houses that offer counseling, job placement, and training to
hard-core, youthful drug abusers. Undergraduate chapters of black
fraternal organizations educate members of their campus
communities, while their graduate counterparts initiate the
involvement of local groups in educational programs and
&quot;action&quot; workshops. Another case involves student
professionals who spend their summer months working in
interdisciplinary teams, providing improved health-care delivery
(including drug treatment and related legal services) to
inner-city residents. Finally, several organizations whose main
focus is drug abuse not only encourage research and conduct
training sessions for professionals but offer free consultation
to people setting up treatment centers. </p>

<p>Inherent in the structure of national groups is a widespread
network for the dissemination of materials and information. These
expansive communication mechanisms are frequently used to support
legislative reform efforts and to provide information to the
media and the public on the subject of drugs. </p>

<p>Federal money is not being spent to evaluate ongoing
educational programs. As the National Coordinating Council on
Drug Education has testified: </p>

<p>There is a danger from continued massive education programming
without first taking the time to evaluate what has been done,
what needs to be done, and what can be done. Unexamined and
unevaluated information and education programs are certainly no
answer; and it is safe to say that in some instances they may be
as harmful in the long run as no program at all .44 </p>

<p>Most private efforts are limited, and many are local in scope.
A few, however, are important forces nationally. With public
attention being focused on the drug-abuse problem, increasing
numbers of national drug organizations have begun to emerge, and
many of them project coordination as their main function. The
most inclusive of these is the National Coordinating Council on
Drug Education, formed in 1968 as a coordinating group for public
agencies and private organizations involved in drug-abuse
education. The Council's philosophy emphasizes rational
approaches to drug-related issues. Any interdisciplinary
regional, state, or local organization whose purpose relates to
drug education is eligible for membership. National organizations
wishing to cooperate with NCCDE in achieving its goals may also
join. At present, most members are white, middle-class
organizations, although there are a few black groups, again
primarily middleclass. Federal agencies are assured of the
Council's cooperation. The National Coordinating Council has been
financed by government contracts, private foundation funds,
contributions from private industry, and donations from its
members. </p>

<p>NCCDE has been quite independent despite its government
funding. It refused to join in National Drug Abuse Prevention
Week because it felt that such one-shot crash campaigns were
useless; it criticized the national advertising campaign; and it
filed suit against the Federal Communications Commission,
challenging its ban on rock music. Whether it will continue to
receive government support is doubtful. </p>

<p>The Student Association for the Study of Hallucinogens (STASH)
is an independent, nonprofit group run by the students
themselves. It publishes the Journal of Psychedelic Drugs,
provides reprints, issues a bibliography on hallucinogens and
other drugs, and holds regular conferences on drug abuse and
related problems; it has a good (and computerized) library
containing 90 per cent of all the literature in English on
marijuana and hallucinogens and has compiled a directory of
drug-information groups. STASH is objective and scientifically
oriented and, for the sake of credibility, will not accept any
government money. It expects, in time, to support itself totally
from membership and publication fees. </p>

<p><b>BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY</b> </p>

<p>The increasing extent of drug use in industry began to be
recognized during the last year by management and personnel
officials. Nationwide interviews with 6,000 workers in the
automobile industry recently compiled by the Alliance for Labor
Action found that about 46 per cent of the workers interviewed
who were under thirty years of age had used drugs at least
once.&quot; Of approximately 222 major businesses surveyed about
drug abuse among blue-collar workers and alcoholism among
executives, nearly two-thirds saw drug abuse as a major
industrial problem, either now or in the immediate future, and 53
per cent had already discovered some form of drug abuse in their
organization.&quot; </p>

<p>The existence of drug abuse in a business creates serious
problems for an employer. It is legitimate for him to consider
whether the employee's behavior on the job endangers other
workers or consumers, or even the image (or profits) of the
business. He can also be encouraged to understand the underlying
problems that may have led to the drug use, to help the user find
treatment, and to allow him to continue to work under
supervision. Although most businesses still maintain a &quot;find
them and fire them&quot; policy, an increasing number of
executives realize that they cannot find and do not wish to fire
all employees who use drugs. Such employers are instituting
education programs in an effort to wean employees away from drugs
and to teach management how to recognize serious drug problems
and channel workers to helping agencies when necessary.&quot; </p>

<p>Business must also be involved in another urgent problem
providing employment opportunities for ex-addicts who are in or
have completed a treatment program. Long-term rehabilitation
requires that an ex-addict be able to find a job. Governmental
and social-service agencies can contribute greatly to this-the
Vera Institute and the City of New York are pioneering the
employment of patients who are in treatment in specially
supervised work projects-but real progress will depend upon the
tolerance and assistance of far-sighted employers. More
experimental work is needed, of course, to determine the
problems, possibilities, and legitimate expectations of
employment programs. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>

<p>This examination of current drug-education efforts indicates
that additional money is not the most urgent requirement.
Creative individuals are needed to act as catalysts for the
growth, testing, and support of creative educational approaches.
Evaluation is vital, as is a climate that encourages the
translation of research findings into action. Educational
programming must respond to differences among addicts in
ethnicity, age, and mental set. Finally, concerted efforts to
clarify goals, drug knowledge, and institutional responsibilities
are essential. </p>

Prescribing Psychoactive Drugs,&quot; 169, Science 438 (1970).
The authors cite examples of such statements as follows: </p>

<p>1. &quot;The epidemic of drug abuse is rapidly becoming a
national emergency. Part of the responsibility for this must be
borne by the drug industry, radio and television. just as
cigarette commercials made smoking romantic, manly, relaxing,
smart, and 'in,' drug advertising has helped'turn on' our
civilization, especially our youth. We are constantly bombarded
by people on television with an easy solution to any of our
troubles, most of it half truth or lies. The continuous selling
of drugs on television and radio must be stopped. All drug
advertising should be prohibited from the mass media, a small
step toward regaining our children.&quot; (Letter from Robert A.
Levine, M.D., to the editor, 282 New England journal of Medicine,
pp. 1378-79 [1970].) </p>

<p>2. &quot;Our technology provides us with highly potent
synthetic materials and through the mass media means to inform
any person who can read, listen, or look about these dangerous
substances. In this situation it is all too easy for anyone of
any age who does not like the way he lives to try a drug'high'in
search of a mystique of esoteric meaning, of euphoria, or of
oblivion.&quot; (Stanley F. Yolles, M.D., &quot;The Drug
Phenomenon,&quot; NS10 journal of American Pharmaceutical
Association, p. 403 [1970].) </p>

<p>3. &quot;Our culture and communications media teach children
that one solves almost all problems by 'turning on@-drugs for
headaches, constipation, sleeplessness, 'nerves,' and for
whatever other maladies beset us.&quot; (Allen Y. Cohen, Ph.D.,
&quot;Inside What's Happening: Sociological, Psychological, and
Spiritual Perspectives on the Contemporary Drug Scene,&quot; 59
American journal of Public Health, pp. 2090,2093 [1969].) </p>

<p>4. &quot;The impact of mass media advertising . . . tends to
create a psychological dependence upon drugs as a palliative for
the strains and stresses of contemporary society.&quot; (Dr.
Donald C. Brodie, Drug Trade News, June 15, 1970, p. 8.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">HISTORY OF TREATMENT <br>
</font></p>

<p>The beginnings of our current narcotics problem go back over a
century. As many authors have noted, the United States had a
large number of opiate addicts in the period between the Civil
War and the passage of the Harrison Act, which limited the
availability of drugs, in 1914. These addicts were primarily
white, female, rural, lower to lower-middle class, and
middle-aged.' They regularly injected morphine or took morphine
or opiated patent medicine orally. Opiates were freely available
from the local pharmacy, so they were not criminals. </p>

<p>Some of them did not even know that they were addicted to
narcotics. Patent medicines were not always labeled, and the user
may have known only that he felt sick when he did not take a
particular medicine, not realizing that the problem was
withdrawal from the medicine itself. Most were knowingly
addicted, of course, and addiction was a matter of great
individual concern. Physicians had developed many different
&quot;cures&quot; between 1856 and 1914, and the effort continued
thereafter. In 1928, Dr. Charles Terry and Mildren Pellens, after
reviewing these efforts extensively, stated: </p>

    <p>. . . for the most part, the treatment of this condition
    has not emerged from the stage of empiricism. The various
    methods described in general indicate that the basis of the
    majority of them is merely the separation of the patient from
    the drug. Very few of those who have described the details of
    treatment have given a rationale for their procedures but
    rather have outlined dogmatically the adoption of certain
    measures whose primary object is the withdrawal of the drug
    and have stated or left the reader to infer that the
    completion of the procedure brings about cure <font size="1">.2

</blockquote>

<p>True to the spirit of the age, there were also numerous patent
medicine &quot;cures&quot; available, some of which were
themselves laden with opiates. </p>

<p>It is difficult to recapture the dominant attitudes toward
addiction during this period. Terry and Pellens cite contemporary
sources contending that addiction was a vice, a physical disease,
a moral perversion, a product of neurotic inheritance, or a
result of morphine poisoning.' Much of the debate is cast in
terms of virtue and vice, and it is hard to tell what these terms
meant to the participants. On the whole, however, the arguments
are remarkably similar to those used in current debate about
addiction. </p>

<p>While there was no consensus on the nature or causes of
addicrecognized as a significant publiclegislative action
developed. The Act in 1914 changed the problem opiates were to be
controlled and than freely available on the open market. </p>

<p>It is not clear what response the lawmakers expected from the
medical establishment. They may have expected doctors to keep on
supplying existing addicts while avoiding the creation of new
ones; they may have expected doctors to force addicts to give up
their habit by refusing to prescribe narcotics; they may not have
thought about it at all. In any event, at passage of the Harrison
Act, the country had at least 200,000 to 300,000 opiate addicts
who were now cut off from their normal sources of supply and
unable to receive drugs except through physicians. </p>

<p>One result was predictable, although not necessarily
predicted: Physicians were deluged with addicts seeking drugs.' A
survey conducted by a Treasury Department committee in 1918 that
reached 31 per cent of the physicians in the United States found
that they had 73,150 addicts under treatment. Treatment, the
committee believed, meant supplying drugs.' In addition to, and
partly in replacement of, private physicians, more than 40
maintenance clinics were opened from about 1918. Most were
sponsored by cities. </p>

<p>Whatever the lawmakers may have thought about the nature of
addiction, the law enforcers considered maintaining existing
addicts on opiates unacceptable. This group believed that, once
the drug was removed and the addict had gone through withdrawal,
he should have no further problems. Rufus King has given some
examples of this view: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>the medical conclusion, propounded as not open to question
    [was] that drug addiction was a correctable and curable
    condition, viz. the following preface to the Prohibition
    Bureau's Regulations: &quot;It is well-established that the
    ordinary case of addiction will yield to proper treatment,
    and that addicts will remain permanently cured when drug
    addiction is stopped and they are otherwise physically
    restored to health and strengthened in will power.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, a small but strident segment of the medical
    community went even further than the authorities ... In 1921
    a member of the American Medical Association's Committee on
    Narcotic Drugs, purportedly speaking officially for the
    Association, was quoted [as saying]: &quot;The shallow
    pretense that drug addiction is a disease which the
    specialist must be allowed to treat, which pretended
    treatment consists in supplying its victims with the drug
    which has caused their physical and moral debauchery .... has
    been asserted and urged in volumes of literature by the
    self-styled specialists.&quot;,,<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To people with this mental set, the maintenance clinics served
no useful purpose; they simply prolonged the addictive state
instead of curing it. If one assumes that abstinence is
relatively easy, then drug maintenance does appear to be the
equivalent of drug pushing. The government put severe pressure on
the clinics, and the last one was closed in 1923.' </p>

<p>At the same time, a very tough policy toward physicians was
maintained. The Narcotic Division of the Treasury Department
arrested or threatened 14,701 persons registered to dispense
drugs under the Harrison Act in 1918, 22,595 in 1919 and 47,835
in 1920.' Between 1914 and 1938, 25,000 doctors were arrested for
supplying opiates, and 5,000 of them actually went to jail.'
Those doctors who maintained that addiction was more complicated
than what the official view held, and who advocated maintenance,
were purged from the field. </p>

<p>It is tempting today to condemn this enforcement policy as
both cruel and ineffective. It was certainly cruel, but its real
effect will never be known. To begin with the most elementary
question, no one knows whether the policy of closing off
legitimate sources of supply decreased the total number of
addicts. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics has estimated that the
number of addicts declined from 200,000 at the time of the
Harrison Act in 1914 to 118,000 in 1930, 60,000 in 1936, and
20,000 in 1945. Dr. Alfred Lindesmith has pointed out that these
estimates are improbable, since they depend on the proposition
that new addicts were not being recruited to replace those who
died or quit the habit. if this were true, the average age of
addicts would have risen as the population aged. In fact, the
average age declined steadily throughout the period, and the
other demographic characteristics of the population also changed,
so there must have been substantial recruitment. Lindesmith
reached no firm conclusion on absolute numbers, but pointed out:
&quot;Since the range of estimates of the addicted population at
present is at least as great as it was before 1914, one can make
out a case for any trend one chooses by judiciously selecting the
estimates.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>One can argue that the policy worked fairly well for the
addicts of the early part of the century, who were 60 per cent
female, 90 per cent white, rural rather than urban, and middle or
lower-middle class rather than impoverished. By 1945, the addict
population was about 85 per cent male and only 75 per cent white,
a substantial change in character. Since then, the addict
population has remained about 85 per cent male and become
steadily younger as well as more minority-group-concentrated. In
New York City, for example, the Narcotics Register shows 47 per
cent of the addicts to be black, 27 per cent Puerto Rican,&quot;
and 26 per cent white. During the last two or three years,
addiction has been spreading back into the middle class, but this
is not a marked trend as yet. Clearly, the population of the
1910's and 1920's did not replace itself, and this could be
judged a successful result of sorts. </p>

<p>By any account, a hard core of addicts remained after the
closing of the clinics. During the 1920's, they were largely
ignored, and treatment for opiate addiction disappeared for a
decade. Then, in 1935 and 1938, the Public Health Service clinics
in Fort Worth and Lexington were opened, largely because of
problems created by addicts in the prisons. The basic theory of
treatment remained unchanged since the earlier period-if an
addict could be separated from his drug for a time, he could be
counted as cured. It was generally believed by this time that the
horrors of withdrawal were so great that few real addicts would
undertake it on their own, but that a few months at one of the
clinics would see them through withdrawal and allow them to
recover. Once they went back to the community, it was presumed,
they would never want to go near the drug again because of their
fear of withdrawal. </p>

<p>Subsequent studies have indicated that the PHS clinics did not
work very well.&quot; This was not generally recognized at the
time, however, and there was another hiatus in the development of
new treatment techniques until the explosion of urban addiction
in the 1950's and 1960's. During the latter part of this period,
several new methods came into being in response to the obvious
inadequacies of the old ones. </p>

<p>Synanon, founded in 1959, became the precursor of a line of
therapeutic communities that emphasized the psychological
component of readdiction and tried to restructure the addict's
character. During the next decade, many such communities were
founded across the country. The apogee of the movement was
probably reached in New York City's Addiction Services Agency
between 1965 and 1968. At the same time, civil-commitment
programs more or less on the Lexington model were applied on a
large scale by California starting in 1961 and by New York State
and the federal government starting in 1967. </p>

<p>In 1964, Dr. Vincent Dole pioneered in the use of methadone, a
synthetic opiate substitute for heroin. Methadone maintenance has
grown rapidly in the last few years, and, as of 1971, it is the
technique into which most new money is going. </p>

<p>Contemporaneously with methadone, researchers at Lexington in
1965 began experimenting with the use of antagonists-drugs that
block the effects of opiates without themselves being addictive.
This method, however is still experimental, has a great many
problems, and is not yet an operating modality. </p>

<p>At present, the dominant treatment modalities are therapeutic
communities, civil commitment, outpatient abstinence, and
metbadone maintenance. A large number of hybrid programs,
however, have developed in response to the concern over addiction
during the late 1960's. Some are explicitly multimodal, utilizing
all the major techniques. There are also detoxification programs
that simply take an addict through withdrawal, often using
methadone but sometimes not; there are also crisis intervention
centers, and programs that supply very small doses of methadone
on demand. Many community organizations have become active in the
field, with operations of all types and combinations. </p>

<p>For purposes of clarity, this paper imposes more order on the
field than exists in practice. Methadone receives by far the most
detailed analysis. In part, this is because methadone treatment
is expanding very rapidly, and thorough analysis is therefore
especially important. It is also due to the fact that, since
methadone maintenance has been in the hands of physicians and
scientists who believe in records, evaluation, and research,
information on these programs is more readily available.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">GOALS OF TREATMENT <br>
</font></p>

<p>The apparent goals of treatment are obvious. Society wants the
addict to stop using heroin and committing crimes and, instead,
to find a job, stabilize his personal life, generally improve his
character, and become a useful and productive citizen. Analyzing
programs in terms of these objectives presents a series of
problems, however. The first is mechanical, although important:
It is extremely difficult to get good information on the results
of programs in terms of these or any other measures of success. </p>

<p>The second is more subtle. Even when information on treatment
results can be obtained, it tends to focus on whether the patient
has stopped using heroin. This represents in part a moral
judgment that this is the most important goal of treatment and in
part the belief that abstinence is a valid proxy measure of the
achievement of the other objectives. Historically, there has also
been a tendency to believe that treatment has failed if an addict
subsequently uses narcotics for any length of time whatsoever, on
the assumption, perhaps, that any relapse automatically means
total relapse. </p>

<p>Increasingly, experts have become aware that this
concentration on abstinence is questionable. While abstinence is
to some extent a proxy for the other possible benefits of a
treatment program, it is not completely accurate. The many facets
of the addicted life-style are not totally inseparable, and,
equally important, they need not all be treated at once. After
treatment, an addict might hold a job, support a family, refrain
from criminal activity -and still go on occasional benders of
drug use. Or, he might continue to commit crimes, but fewer than
before. His physical health might be improved even if nothing
else were changed. It is also possible for a program to have a
reverse effect. It might, for example, eliminate opiate addiction
at the price of alcoholism, a dubious bargain. </p>

<p>In short, there is a range of possible benefits and adverse
effects that can be produced by treatment programs. Different
programs attach different importance to each; conflicts of value
are inherent in comparisons of effectiveness. Since such
questions are not easily resolvable, an objective examination of
treatment programs should, ideally, use varying measures rather
than only two categories-success (total abstinence) or failure
(anything else) . Abstinence, stabilization on methadone (or, in
fact, stabilization on heroin), employment, decreased criminal
conduct or non-criminal conduct, support of a family, improved
physical health and psychological functioning-any of these
outcomes represents at least partial success for a treatment
program and should be so regarded. </p>

<p>Despite the strong reservations about using abstinence as a
measure, this paper repeatedly uses freedom from drug use as the
major criterion of the success of treatment programs. While
evaluation of even this factor is fragmentary, it is far more
common than evaluation in terms of other possible measures.
Anyone trying to analyze program results has to use it as a proxy
or refrain from any judgments at all, and it is sufficiently
important to be of use. It should be emphasized, however, that
good multifactor evaluation might drastically change many of the
conclusions contained here. </p>

<p>The third problem is even more fundamental. No one knows
whether the goals of treatment as set forth in the beginning of
this section are realistic or even desirable. Since no one knows
why people become narcotics addicts, no one knows either how to
make them stop or what will happen to them if they do stop. For
example, NIMH officials recently stated that about 25 per cent of
the addict population are people who suffer from depression and
chronic anxiety, another 25 per cent are hedonists who like to
get intoxicated, and the rest are psychopaths who need immediate
gratification and are not particular about how they obtain
it.&quot; Other researchers have also concluded that there is no
one addict type, and that addiction can serve as a functional and
adaptive characteristic for people with different types of
psychic problems. </p>

<p>Yet, there are also a number of researchers who, denying this
stress on psychopathology, contend that people are inducted into
drug use through peer pressure and that large numbers of addicts
may not suffer from severe psychopathology. The argument can be
made that whatever characteristics addicts appear to have in
common are forced upon them by the requirements of sustaining the
addiction once it exists. Still another view is that addicts do
have psychological problems but that these are in many cases no
more severe than those shown by many nonaddicts. If one conducted
a mental-health survey of the population from which most addicts
are drawn, one might discover as many symptoms of mental disorder
among the nonaddicts. Finally, some argue that heroin itself
causes a metabolic change in the body that makes it difficult to
cease being an addict. Thus, one can become addicted casually and
then be unable to rid oneself of the addiction no matter what
therapeutic techniques are brought to bear. 14 </p>

<p>Treatment programs have disparate philosophies on these
questions. Some, though by no means all, methadone programs
assume some physiological basis of addiction. Most therapeutic
communities probably assume a character disorder that can be
helped by group therapy. Some outpatient abstinence programs
assume that addiction may be an almost accidental event for many
addicts, and that they can be helped with minimal intervention.
But these assumptions are not constant within any modality, and
almost all spectrums of opinion exist in each. </p>

<p>In short, there is no uniform theory of addiction and no
adequate description of the addict population. Further, addiction
has spread rapidly in recent years, and we know less about the
new population than we do about the old. And we knew little
enough before. </p>

<p>The difficulties these factors create in judging treatment
programs are obvious. We do not know what expectations are
realistic or desirable. We do not even know for certain that it
is good for addicts to stop taking drugs. Some programs may be
better for certain types of addicts than others, but we are not
sure what types, or whether the programs are attracting the type
with which they do best. </p>

<p>All the figures given in this paper are gross figures-the
programs are judged by effects on the total number of people who
were involved without any breakdown of results for different
hypothetical subgroups of the addict population. The conclusions,
therefore, are tentative, at best. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>ABSTINENCE PROGRAMS <br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">DETOXIFICATION<br>
</font></p>

<p>The most straightforward way to help a heroin addict is to
detoxify him-reduce his daily heroin intake to zero and see him
through withdrawal. The addict can be maintained on an inpatient
basis without any drugs for the five-to-ten-day period necessary
for primary withdrawal symptoms to disappear; or he can be
treated with tranquilizers but not opiates; or methadone can be
used to decrease his opiate dosage gradually until he is
drugfree. </p>

<p>Detoxification services are offered in many places and modes
across the nation-in hospitals, therapeutic communities, free
clinics, and government programs. There is no way of learning how
many addicts receive them each year. </p>

<p>Detoxification has several clear benefits for both the addict
and society. Even if the addict does not intend to stay off
drugs, it reduces his habit and decreases its cost. This spares
him the hassle and society the crime costs of his addiction for
some period, even if only a few days, after the process is
complete. For some addicts, it is also a step toward
rehabilitation. After repeated failures to remain detoxified,
they become ready for other modalities. </p>

<p>On the whole, however, it is not clear that detoxification
itself contributes greatly to the achievement of long-term
abstinence. One program that used methadone in decreasing doses
found that 74 per cent of the patients either did not finish the
withdrawal program or relapsed to drug use within 48 hours after
leaving it. Another, which effects withdrawal without opiates,
found that only 10 per cent successfully completed the
withdrawal, and almost all of these soon relapsed.&quot; The New
York Narcotic Addiction Control Commission has estimated that
only 24 per cent of those who receive detoxification without
other services &quot;remain drug-free for any length of
time.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>The Haight-Ashbury Clinic in San Francisco has been
experimenting with outpatient withdrawal, utilizing analgesics
but not opiates. It reports the results with 450 patients: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>56 per cent dropped out before they were clean and were
    lost to follow-up for at least two weeks; 5 per cent of these
    resumed their habit, 22 per cent were in treatment, and the
    rest were apparently not known. 12 per cent had decreased
    their habit to &quot;chipping&quot; no more than once a week.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>5.5 per cent had been clean for one month or more. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>38 per cent were lost track of after only one clinic
    visit.&quot; <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This population differs from the standard drug-addict
population because it includes individuals who are basically
middle class and who began using heroin after being involved in
the San Francisco speed scene; many have not been addicted for
long. No one knows whether this population is harder, or easier,
to work with than the more familiar ghetto populations. Other
program examples could be cited-some better and some worse-but
the general picture remains: Detoxification does have some
benefits, but it is primarily a service for the drug user who
needs a respite and a short-term way of protecting society
against crime rather than a long-term treatment for addiction. As
such, it is valuable, especially for anyone who believes that
addicts should be treated more humanely than they are at the
present time and that bandaids can be valuable things. But
expectations should not be too high.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>CIVIL COMMITMENT <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In theory, civil commitment is the nonpunitive incarceration
of an addict for purposes of rehabilitation. This method of
treatment was started in the 1930's at the Lexington and Fort
Worth hospitals, where the programs were part voluntary and part
coercive. In the 1960's, civil commitment was applied on a wider
scale, first in California then in New York. Subsequently, the
federal government started using civil commitment as an
alternative to imprisonment through the Narcotic Addict
Rehabilitation Program. Dr. John Kramer has traced the
relationship between the earlier programs and the massive
investment of the 1960's: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The roots of these commitment laws can be traced to the
    federal narcotics hospital in Lexington. In recounting the
    initial expectations for that institution Isbell writes . . .
    &quot;Drug addicts were to be treated within the institution,
    freed of their physiological dependence on drugs, their basic
    immaturities and personality problems corrected by vocational
    and psychiatric therapy, after which they would be returned
    to their communities to resume their lives. It seems to have
    been tacitly assumed that this program was the answer and
    would solve the problem of opiate addiction. Within a <font
    size="2">year it was apparent this assumption was wrong . . .
    a more adequate treatment program [required]: (1) Some means
    of holding voluntary patients until they had reached maximum
    benefit from hospital treatment. (2) Greater use of probation
    and parole. (3) Provision for intensive supervision and
    aftercare. . . . Isbell goes on to say that the reasons why
    these problems were not solved were complex. &quot;In 1961
    the California Legislature enacted laws establishing a
    commitment program for addicts which was designed to
    accomplish those objectives recommended but never carried out
    at Lexington.&quot;18</font> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is generally thought that the programs started in the
1930's were almost total failures. Between 1935 and 1964, there
were 87,000 admissions to the two centers, of which 63,600 were
voluntary and 23,400 were federal prisoners. Of the voluntary
patients, 70 per cent left against medical advice. A series of
studies of addicts released from the abstinence facilities found
that up to 90 per cent of those followed up relapsed into drug
use within a few years.&quot; </p>

<p>As is true of almost every other aspect of the field, this
conclusion is debatable. Recent research has suggested that it
may exaggerate the failures. Dr. John O'Donnell points out that
all the studies had problems with data collection and with
categorization of those addicts who could not be found. He also
questions the assumption that any relapse-any use of drugs-should
be regarded as a failure, an assumption that was made by several
of the studies. As has been pointed out, an addict may become
basically abstinent, even though he does relapse a few times;
and, even if he relapses regularly, he may spend more time off
drugs than he would have without the treatment. This is also a
net social gain. </p>

<p>O'Donnell uses the following example. If one has 2,000
exaddicts in a two-year study (a total of 4,000 man-years) and
defines relapse as a two-week period of heroin use at any time,
then a 90 per cent relapse rate could mean that anywhere between
69 and 3,600 of the 4,000 man-years were spent in a state of
addiction. That is, 90 per cent of the addicts could have
relapsed for exactly two weeks each, or, at the other extreme, 90
per cent could have relapsed for the entire two years, or
anything in between.&quot; The social and individual consequences
of these polar possibilities are very different. </p>

<p>The revisionist approach to the Lexington experience has
caused many observers to soften their adverse judgments somewhat.
Most still believe that it was not effective with very many
addicts but concede that the question probably cannot be answered
definitely. The data that would allow methodologically acceptable
studies are lost. This does not seem to bother anyone too much,
however, because the Lexington population drew heavily from rural
white populations, and the exact results would be of marginal
relevance to our present situation. </p>

<p>The three programs that were started in the 1960's built on
the Lexington model, although they tried to improve it. They
appear to have been started because addiction was either
increasing or becoming more visible, and was thus becoming a
political problem. In 1961, there was simply no treatment
modality available except civil commitment, and even by 1966 it
did not appear that there was any clearly better alternative.
Under pressure to do something, state and federal authorities
picked up the only available model, apparently on the premises
that: (1) The failures of the Lexington program were due in part
to the fact that the duration of treatment was too short (six
months or a year) ; (2) Improved vocational and counseling
services would be helpful; (3) Some careful studies had indicated
that better supervision in the community after release would
improve the success rate; 21 (4) Civil commitment would at least
get addicts off the street. </p>

<p>The California program, instituted in 1961, provides for
commitment on court order in lieu of sentence or prosecution.
Voluntary commitment and commitment by relatives are also
possible, but over 90 per cent of the inmates are there
involuntarily, after conviction. In fact, the program is
structurally and functionally very similar to imprisonment. The
main center, in Corona, California, is a maximum-security
facility under the direction of the Department of Corrections.
There are armed guards and barbedwire fences, and most of the
personnel are corrections workers. The minimum institutional stay
is six months, and the average is about 14 months. After leaving
the institution the addict is required to undergo a three-year
period of &quot;community aftercare,&quot; which is essentially
&quot;parole.&quot; During this time, he follows the same regimen
as ex-felons, with the additional requirement of regular
urinalysis testing and group counseling. Violations of
t1parole&quot; can and, in the case of relapse to drug use,
usually do mean return to the institution. Attempted escape from
the institution and serious parole violations are felonies in
themselves. </p>

<p>The facility does provide inmates with a modified form of
encounter-group therapy, based on the hypothesis that drug use is
a symptom of aberrant personality patterns which must be changed.
However, a study of the program's results concluded that the
program was interpreted by addicts and professional visitors as
more punitive than therapeutic. Whether one were released
depended in large part on how well one played the game at group
sessions. This was not conducive to the honesty that real group
therapy demands. </p>

<p>Evaluation showed that between 1962 and 1964 there were 1,209
persons on release status at some time. At the end of the year,
only 35 per cent were still in good standing and only 16 per cent
maintained this status after three years. The majority who fail
in aftercare do so for drug use, &quot;poor adjustment,&quot;
failure to report in, or new arrest. During the first year, 56
per cent were detected using drugs and 20 per cent convicted of
new crimes. In the three-year period, 81 per cent had been
suspended from release status at least once. The usual pattern
for the inmate consisted of periods spent in the facility
followed by periods of abstinence in the aftercare phase, and
then return to the facility in Corona. As a result of this
pattern, inmates who would have been serving a felony sentence
(70 per cent) actually spent less time &quot;incarcerated,&quot;
while those who were guilty of misdemeanors (16 per cent) were
&quot;incarcerated&quot; longer than if they had served an
ordinary prison sentence. No later results seem to have changed
this pattern. Felon addicts who receive no therapy while in
prison do as well as or better than California Rehabilitation
Center addicts while on parole.&quot; </p>

<p>The New York program, adopted several years later, differs
somewhat in conception.&quot; Like California, New York provides
for commitment in lieu of sentence or prosecution, for voluntary
commitment, and for commitment by relatives or other persons,
such as school officials or prosecuting attorneys. Unlike the
California system, New York's system is under the direction of an
independent Narcotic Addiction Control Commission (NACC) and has
a mental-health orientation involving the use of professional
mental-health personnel. NACC is also more committed to research
and community aftercare programs. </p>

<p>New York's total program, by far the largest in the United
States, has spent $475.3 million in the last four years,
including its investment in methadone and therapeutic communities
as well as in civil commitment. The direct annual investment in
the civilcommitment program appears to be at least $50 million
out of a total budget of $88.5 million. As of the end of 1970,
NACC had 10,764 addicts in its own facilities, and another 10,419
were in facilities accredited or funded by NACC. These population
figures were not broken down by modality.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the dominance of a mental-health approach and
professionalized therapy, the emphasis on security and remote
institutions has apparently produced a penal atmosphere at many
of the NAOC facilities. Recreational and entertainment facilities
appear to be lacking, and life in a NACC institution has been
described as a dreary round of a few hours in a classroom or
workshop, some time in group meetings led by civil servants, and
the rest of the time watching television or loafing. The peer
pressures, ex-addict, encounter-group leadership, and meaningful
work assignments needed to create an effective therapeutic
environment are absent.&quot; The program has been subject to
some fierce attacks, as in the 1970 New York gubernatorial
campaign, when one candidate claimed that in three years NACC had
spent $345 million and cured 120 addicts.&quot; It is difficult
to know whether all of these accusations are justified. But it is
equally difficult to find disinterested observers who contradict
them. </p>

<p>NACC officials state their results fairly carefully. In June,
1971, the research director testified that &quot;a relatively
small number of people&quot; had been processed through the
entire civil-commitment procedure (the three to five years), and
that, of those who had gone all the way through, 25 per cent
&quot;are currently abstinent, according to a physical
follow-up.&quot; Another 25 per cent had either recertified
themselves to NACC or had entered other treatment programs. The
rest (50 per cent) were in jail as a result of new drug-related
offenses or had returned to drugs.&quot; This statement does not
reveal how many addicts had completed the program, how many were
able to drop out or escape in some way, or what level of
functioning the abstinent addicts were maintaining. The
population is referred to as &quot;small.&quot; </p>

<p>The federal NARA program of civil commitment for addicts
includes three separate programs. Title I provides for addicts
charged with violating federal laws (nonviolent crimes only). In
lieu of prosecution, the addict can be committed to a three-year
treatment period involving both institutional and aftercare
treatment facilities. Admissions under this title have been few.
Between July, 1967, and June, 1970, only 207 persons were
examined and 179 accepted, although a case load of 900 per year
had been anticipated. The main reason seems to be a general
disinterest by U.S. Attorneys.&quot; </p>

<p>Title II offers treatment in lieu of sentencing for addicts
convicted of federal crimes. This program is administered by the
Bureau of Prisons, which provides facilities for treatment within
regular penal institutions. The time of incarceration is not to
exceed ten years, and - the addict can be released to aftercare
services after six months. Only about 375 addicts are currently
being serviced under this title.30 </p>

<p>Title III provides for voluntary commitment by addicts who are
not involved in criminal proceedings. The commitment is for a
period of three years, most of which is spent in aftercare
facilities. The term of the institutionalization itself is to be
determined by the patient's progress but is not to exceed six
months. </p>

<p>Until recently, Title I and Title III patients were sent to
the Lexington or Fort Worth facility, under the Surgeon General.
(Fort Worth has now been transferred to the Bureau of Prisons and
will no longer be used for addiction treatment.) Title III
patients receive their initial evaluation at Lexington, but many
are channeled into community or state programs funded by NARA
grants and contracts. The Lexington facility is the most open of
the institutions and has a more relaxed policy toward escape or
attempted escape. The primary treatment methods employed are
detoxification, counseling, and some work and recreation therapy.
They have begun an experiment with a small therapeutic community
(Matrix House) but require a longer time commitment for patients
in this program. </p>

<p>The initial evaluation determines whether the addict is
suitable for treatment. The rejection rate is about 55-60 per
cent. The grounds for rejection are not clear. Some officials
claim that suitability is based on an assessment of
motivation-whether an addict has sufficient self-control to be
able to function in a relaxed and open environment, and, if not,
the availability of other types of treatment facilities. Another
view is that decisions on suitability are made on the basis of
objective criteria, such as current legal status, criminal
record, age, employment, history, prior drug experience, and
mental state. </p>

<p>In a study of the first 27 months of operation under the new
Act (1966-69), about 2,000 addicts were tested at Lexington. As
of September 30, 1969, there were 802 Title I and Title III
patients on an aftercare status; 26 per cent had been recommitted
to the institution for aftercare violations, and 5 per cent had
been discharged. As of March, 1971, 2,000 patients were in the
civil commitment program, of whom 1,300 were in aftercare. Of the
2,000, 60 per cent were white. Average age was in the late
20's.&quot; In June, 1971, the Director of NIMH stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the civil commitment program, a study of 1,200 patients
    who were in aftercare in 1970 showed that approximately 85
    percent were employed, 70 percent were not arrested and spent
    no time in jail during that period, 35 percent were in
    self-help therapy, and 33 percent were pursuing their
    education. Patients who had been [in] aftercare for 3 months
    or more were, on the average, drug-free 80 percent of the
    time. A similar statement can be made regarding the heroin
    use of patients who were in the community treatment programs.
    As you know, many patients during the treatment of their
    addiction may abuse drugs other than heroin occasionally,
    such as cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, or barbiturates. Of
    the patients in the civil commitment program who had been in
    aftercare for 3 months or more, 60 percent were not abusing
    any drugs. The same is true of patients who had been in the
    community treatment program for 3 months or more. Of the
    patients who are in the civil commitment aftercare phase, we
    know that 60 percent do not become readdicted during their
    first year in aftercare. Of the remaining, 25 percent do
    abuse some drugs or become readdicted and require further
    hospital treatment. About 15 percent were dropouts <font
    size="1">.32 <br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to know what to make of these results. Even
allowing for selectivity in acceptance into the program, they are
far better than the New York or the California experience would
have led one to expect. Since the detailed studies on which this
statement is based are not available, one can only reserve
judgment. </p>

<p>The Bureau of Prisons has analyzed initial results from its
care of inmates committed under Title II of NARA. As of the end
of 1971, 896 inmates had been examined for program eligibility,
and 70 per cent (630) had been accepted. The program had released
414 inmates to aftercare after an average institutionalization of
15 months, and 297 (72 per cent) of these were still active. The
other 28 per cent had &quot;violated or absconded.&quot; Over
five thousand months of &quot;successful aftercare&quot; had been
accumulated, but the meaning of that term as used in the report
is unclear.&quot; </p>

<p>Many drug experts believe that programs of civil commitment
offer little more than custodial care in a predominantly penal
setting. Counseling and therapy, when employed, are imposed on
the patients by the staff and are of questionable value.
Apparently, most addicts are committed as an alternative to
criminal prosecution or sentencing, and view commitment as such.
Most do not appear to be motivated toward inner change, and those
that do succeed might succeed equally as well in a voluntary
community program. In addition, civil commitment is expensive. It
requires secured facilities, around-the-clock guards, and large
staffs. (Cost estimates for all three of the large programs are
$10,000 to $12,000 per year per addict while the addict is in the
institution. It is not clear whether this represents full costs,
including capital expenditures, or operating costs only.) In
spite of these costs, the chief function of civil commitment
seems to be nothing more than to keep the addict out of
circulation for intermittent short periods. </p>

<p>The NARA information cited above seems to indicate that civil
commitment for a limited term followed by aftercare is more<br>
</p>

<p>promising than this conclusion suggests. The California
program was structured in somewhat the same manner-although with
a more open law-enforcement orientation-and it may be that it
shows worse results than NARA because it was more carefully
evaluated and the patients were more carefully controlled. A
definite answer to this will have to await more detailed
information on NARA. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">THE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY <br>
</font></p>

<p>&quot;Therapeutic community&quot; (TC) is a generic term used
to describe an institution that attempts to treat the addict by
dealing with the underlying causes of his addiction. The basic
concept of the TC modality, as of the civil-commitment programs,
is that addiction is the result of psychological problems, and
that intensive therapeutic techniques utilized within the
structure of a residential community can restructure the
character and personality of the addict to the point where he no
longer needs to use drugs. Although heroin addicts constitute the
major part of the TC population, most TC's service users of
nonopiates as well. As of mid-1970, there were probably 40-50
therapeutic community programs in the country with approximately
4,000-5,000 residents.&quot; </p>

<p>The growth of therapeutic communities is in some ways as much
a quasi-evangelical movement as a drug-treatment modality, and it
is difficult to describe them without distorting the views of at
least some of the participants.&quot; The flavor of this modality
can be partly conveyed by tracing some analogies and intellectual
roots. First, there is a parallel between the TC and Alcoholics
Anonymous. Synanon, the original addict-oriented TC, was founded
in 1959 by an ex-alcoholic as a treatment program for alcoholics
modeled after AA. It drifted into treatment of opiate addicts
largely by accident. Many of the TC's retain some of the basic AA
characteristics-the concept that there is no such thing as an
ex-addict, only an addict who is not using at the moment; the
emphasis on mutual support and aid; the distrust of mentalhealth
professionals; and the concept of continual confession and
catharsis. However, the TC has extended these notions to include
the concept of a live-in community with a rigid structure of
day-to-day behavior and a complex system of punishment and
rewards. </p>

<p>The rise of the TC also parallels the rising popularity of
group therapy generally. Encounter groups, support groups, and
marathon sessions are as prevalent in the &quot;straight
world&quot; as in the TC's, and the many differences in
group-therapy methods that exist outside exist in the TC's as
well. One reason for the frequent confusion about the different
TC's is that they reflect the many variations in approaches to
group therapy. </p>

<p>The growth of TC's has occurred at the same time as the growth
of interest in communes, and some TC's have an element of the
commune in them-the residents are rejecting a dishonest world in
favor of a better way of life. Synanon, for example, has
residents who have never been addicted to anything but who prefer
the Synanon life-style. Dr. John Kramer has referred to Synanon
as &quot;the third community,&quot; different from the drug-using
community and the &quot;square&quot; community. He points out
that there is a fundamental difference between Synanon and many
of the TC's in that &quot;the Synanon ideal is to retain members
in the group indefinitely and to expand steadily, drawing in more
and more members, squares as well as addicts. Other TC's differ
in that they do expect their members to re-enter the square
community. &quot;3r The past decade has seen a movement toward
community action and a rejection of services furnished
exogenously. Community control is a familiar slogan, and the
beliefs that only the poor know what the poor want and only
blacks can help blacks are also common. To some extent, TC's
reflect this movement. Many of them have adopted the view that
the nonaddict does not really understand the problems and world
of an addict and therefore cannot contribute as an ex-addict can.
Since addicts are often poor and black as well as addicted, this
concept is a powerful force. </p>

<p>Finally, the quasi-evangelical aspect of the TC creates an
interesting, although certainly not documented or provable,
situation. The addict may be replacing his addiction to heroin
with an &quot;addiction&quot; to being an ex-addict and to the
encounter therapy. The philosophy of the TC becomes a religion
for the addict. It is something to believe in and a message to
spread to his fellow addicts in the world. The &quot;religious
fervor&quot; involved exists in varying degrees. In Dr. Kramer's
words: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It has been undiplornatically stated that religiornania is
    a cure for narcomania. This observation is valid,
    particularly if one defines religiomania broadly as the
    devout acceptance of clearly defined tenets of a faith and
    its principles of behavior, and persistent participation in
    its prescribed rituals. The faith and its practice will
    usually encompass all the life activities of the communicant
    and in its practice he will have the opportunity for both
    penitence and ecstasy. Obedience is part of it as is the
    sense of being an accepted member of the congregation,
    however lowly, and thus possessing an attribute not possessed
    by anyone outside the sect. The requirements can be fulfilled
    not only by formal fundamentalist religious groups such as
    Teen Challenge but by such an organization as Synanon and
    other programs which have been modeled on it.37 <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of structure and program, some common features of
TC's can be identified, despite wide individual variations. Most
have three identifiable phases to their program. The first of
these is a testing for admission; the addict must show the
genuineness of his desire to become drug-free. In some places,
the addict must become drug-free on his own and remain so for a
given period of time before he is admitted. In some, he must work
in a storefront center for a time, showing the proper attitude.
Others do not require abstinence in advance and will have a
patient detoxified on methadone or go through withdrawal after
formal admission. In some TC's, an addict is put through an
encounter session with present residents to test his dedication. </p>

<p>The methods vary, but at some point early in the process every
TC tests the candidate's motivation. As might be expected, there
is a high loss rate at this point, although numbers are difficult
to find. The different entrance procedures must be kept in mind
in evaluating TC's, because they can obviously make a substantial
difference in the statistical records of the program. A community
that does not formally admit addicts until they have passed
stringent tests is likely to show a higher success rate than a
community that does its weeding out after formal admission.<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever the form of testing used, relatively few addicts pass
it. In most TC's, somewhere between 50 per cent and 90 per cent
of the applicants are rejected or quit at this initial stage.
Once admitted, the addict enters a treatment ladder. The program
of treatment is usually highly structured and extremely rigid,
with an enforced system of rewards and punishments. The resident
starts at the very bottom of the ladder, with little freedom, no
responsibility, and the lowest types of tasks. As he proves
himself, he begins to acquire more freedom, better jobs, and
increased responsibility. This period of treatment lasts at least
a year and is characterized by clearly marked stages in status.
The emphasis is usually on confronting the addict with the
immaturity of his past behavior and his need to learn responsible
patterns of dealing with the world. Group therapy is emphasized,
and the encounters can be extremely rough. It is part of the
ethos, however, that the motives behind the encounters are
concern and love rather than hostility. </p>

<p>Finally, the resident arrives at the re-entry phase. During
this period, he begins to have a life outside the community
again-he takes educational courses, spends weekends with his
family, works, etc. When he has established a stable pattern
outside the community and is considered responsible by the
professional staff and/or peers, he may be discharged. (At
Synanon, there is no re-entry phase. Family life, education, and
work are all incorporated into the community. To Synanon
community members, the straight world outside the community has
not changed, and the pressures and problems that resulted in
their addiction in the first place are still there. Return to the
outside means return to heroin addiction, alcohol, or whatever
drove them in.) </p>

<p>A major problem in evaluating therapeutic communities is the
difficulty of ascertaining facts. Even a matter so rudimentary as
the costs involved is a matter of dispute because of differences
in calculating capital and operating costs, treatment of welfare
expenditures that go to support the community, allocation of
funds from different government agencies, appraisal of donated
goods and services, and simple lack of records. Costs range
anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 per year per resident. </p>

<p>Even more difficult to assess is the result of the effort,
since little careful evaluation has been done. One multimodal
program analyzed the &quot;split rate&quot; from the TC component
of its program. They found that, of 122 entrants, 40 per cent
left within three weeks, 50 per cent within seven weeks, and 85
per cent within one year. A TC that appealed mainly to white,
middle-class residents found that, during one year, almost 700
persons entered the program, 535 left voluntarily, and 23 were
expelled. Of those who left, 175 came back. The program graduated
38 residents during the year. Of 113 graduates of the program
over a four-year period, 13 had relapsed to drug abuse. Of the
remaining 100 graduates, 25 were employed in the subject TC, 51
in other addiction programs, and 19 in the community at large;
five were unknown .18 These are only fragments, because there is
very little hard information on the results of TC's. In part this
is because evaluation is expensive and difficult and many
organizations do not have the money to spend on it. Also, some
program operators oppose evaluation on philosophical grounds-they
believe that what they are doing is humane and valuable and that
their work is demeaned by attempts to judge it in quantitative
terms. They may also believe that evaluation has negative effects
on the program. If it shows many failures the residents will come
to believe that they, too, will fail, and the prophecy will be
self-fulfilling. </p>

<p>Finally, there are sound bureaucratic reasons for avoiding
evaluation as much as possible. All the preliminary and anecdotal
indications are that, while a few people are helped greatly by
TC's, an overwhelming majority are not. In the hard competition
for government drug-treatment money, evaluation might well hurt
the TC's more than it would help them. The incentive to permit
evaluation, let alone fund it, is minimal. </p>

<p>Looking at all the available evidence and the impressions of
experts in the field, it is hard to escape the conclusion that
TC's are, at best, good for a very limited number of drug
addicts. As a rough guess, considering the initial rejection
rates, the split rates, and the relapse rate, it would be
surprising if careful evaluation showed that more than 5 per cent
of those who come into contact with the program are enabled to
lead a reasonably drugfree, socially productive life. </p>

<p>There is also a major question about the type of addict for
whom the TC is the proper solution. Some experts believe that the
TC works best for the sociopath who is tough enough to take the
encounters but not for those with less serious psychological
problems or those who are the least alienated. Other experts have
different categorizations. </p>

<p>The TC's may have advantages in dealing with particular
subgroups of addicts, however. Although exact population
breakdowns are seldom available, it is generally recognized that
the mean age of the residents is lower than that of either
addicts in the methadone programs or the total addict population.
This could mean that the TC is especially attractive to young
addicts, but this is not certain; the same result would ensue if
it were less attractive to older addicts. It may also be
effective with multidru'g users or with young experimenters, but
this has also been unproved. </p>

<p>In terms of any national program of treatment of heroin
addicts, it is difficult to see a major role for the TC, simply
because the success rate is too low and the cost too high to make
an important impact on the problem. At the same time, most drug
experts, when they discuss the necessary elements of a
comprehensive drug-treatment program, include a therapeutic
community, but whether this is based on a genuine belief in its
utility, on the hope that utility might be demonstrated, or on
simple politics is unclear. In the long run, it may turn out that
the TC is much more interesting outside the drug context than
within it. By setting itself the task of rehabilitating drug
addicts-a notoriously hard group to rehdbilitate-the TC movement
may have destined itself to look bad. The real contributions that
such methods might make to improvements in the condition and
functioning of more tractable populations are easily lost sight
of by appraisers who are concerned with the drug problem. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="1">OUTPATIENT ABSTINENCE <br>
</font></p>

<p>Many programs have a component that treats outpatients and
attempts to get them to abstain from heroin use. Of 142 programs
covered by an NIMH survey, only 23 were for inpatients only, and
only 43 of the 142 engaged in methadone maintenance; therefore,
at least 76 were operating some form of outpatient abstinence
program. </p>

<p>These programs differ as much as or more than the therapeutic
communities. The major components are community outreach to find
people who need help; group and individual therapy of various
types; vocational and social counseling; intervention with
authorities, employers, or schools on behalf of the patient;
vocational training and education; and family counseling. The
programs emphasize these elements in varying degrees, of course,
and most probably do not offer a complete range of services.
Another variable is the intensity of the patient's involvement
with the treatment center. Some are halfway houses, where the
patient spends the whole day and goes home only at night. At the
other extreme are agencies that have only one or two sessions
with a patient or that are more or less social centers. Most
programs are, of course, between these extremes.&quot; </p>

<p>This method of treatment is not based on any constant
theoretical beliefs. Some people believe that addicts suffer from
underlying character disorders and can be changed only through
heavy involvement in therapy. Others believe that helping with
the immediate problems of the patient will enable him to help
himself. Still others are desperately trying to fend off the
total catastrophe that may overwhelm the patient if he does not
receive aid. </p>

<p>Very little evaluation of these programs has been done, and
there are no reliable data on the results. Most observers believe
that the attrition rates are very high, the number of patients
who remain drug-free is small, and the impact on such areas as
employment and criminal activity is minimal. Dr. Robert DuPont,
Director of the Washington, D.C., Narcotic Treatment Agency, has
found that only 15 per cent of the patients who selected NTA's
abstinence program remained in it for six months, although those
who did remain did well.&quot; A -D.C. Department of Corrections
study of the performance of abstinence patients in NTA facilities
(all of whom had been referred to NTA by the Department of
Corrections) came out with somewhat better results: 50 per cent
of 165 referees were failures after six months. If
&quot;escape&quot; was removed as a category of failure, then the
failure rate was only 25 per cent.&quot; Programs connected with
the criminal-justice system usually have the spur of return to
jail if the patient fails, of course. </p>

<p>The Office of Economic Opportunity enlisted a contractor to do
a thorough evaluation of eight OEO-funded projects; but the
data-collection problems were great, and it was impossible for
the evaluators to reach any meaningful judgments.&quot; OEO is
now trying again, but the results have not yet been published. </p>

<p>In general, the conclusions for these programs are about the
same as for the therapeutic communities and the detoxification
centers: They help a few people a great deal and more people to
some degree, but the failure rates are very high. They have a
considerable cost advantage over the therapeutic communities
because they do not need extensive and expensive residential
facilities. Their over-all, long-term contribution to the drug
problem is in some doubt. The major imponderable is the extent to
which changes in the addict population may invalidate pessimistic
conclusions drawn from past experience. Addiction may have spread
to people who are not so intractable as the groups on which these
conclusions are based. They might become abstinent with the help
that can be given by the outpatient facilities. </p>

<p>Most important is whether these programs have an impact on the
juvenile who is dabbling in the drug scene but has not yet become
a confirmed addict. This is the target population for many such
programs and would seem to be the area in which they have the
most to offer. At present, the answer is an enigma. Some of the
conclusions reached and questions raised in 1969 by Judith Calof
of New York's Community Service Society are still valid: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Voluntary treatment agencies have always emerged in
    response to the neglected needs of segments of the community.
    In the addiction field, there are still grave unmet needs.
    For one, the number of school-aged addicts has been growing,
    while voluntary and public agencies continue to concentrate
    on the older addict. Are special techniques needed for
    reaching and treating this young age group?... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A major unmet need is addiction prevention. Do voluntary
    treatment agencies have a major contribution to make in
    prevention? Could their coordinated efforts succeed in
    identifying and reaching those most vulnerable to this
    disease? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The limited success of the voluntary treatment agencies
    should not be interpreted as failure, but should be viewed in
    long-range terms. Pioneering means trial and error, with
    inevitable setbacks and frustrations, but it reveals the
    assessment of a situation. Voluntary treatment agencies have
    already demonstrated the enormity of the addiction problem
    and the immense difficulties in rehabilitating heroin
    addicts. The results of their dedicated efforts should serve
    as a learning against unrealistic expectations. Their
    experience can prevent catastrophe in a massive government
    program, and refusal of the public to allocate further funds
    for treatment .43 <br>
    </p>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><i>METHADONE MAINTENANCE <br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">CHARACTERISTICS OF METHADONE<br>
</font></p>

<p>Methadone is a synthetic opiate. For purposes of understanding
its use in the treatment of heroin addiction, its most important
characteristics are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>It is a substitute for heroin, in that it will prevent an
        addict from having or feeling withdrawal symptoms if he
        replaces his usual drug with methadone. </li>
    <li>Unlike the heroin available in this country, it is
        effective when taken orally. </li>
    <li>If the dosage is sufficient (the exact level depending on
        the addict's level of tolerance to heroin), the methadone
        will block the action of heroin, so that the addict
        receives no euphoric effect if he tries heroin. At lower
        doses, methadone will not block this effect of heroin,
        but it will suppress the &quot;narcotic
        hunger&quot;-described by Dr. Jerome Jaffe as a
        &quot;felt sense of physical abnormality&quot;-that an
        addict feels without his drug. </li>
    <li>The effective action of methadone is about 24 hours, as
        opposed to about six hours for heroin. Thus, it needs to
        be taken only once a day. </li>
    <li>When taken orally in constant doses, methadone does not
        produce a euphoric effect. </li>
    <li>To date, no significant deleterious side effects have
        been reported.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>THE PROGRAMS</b></font> </p>

<p>Starting with a 1964 experimental project sponsored by the New
York Health Research Council and conducted by Drs. Vincent Dole
and Marie Nyswander, programs that maintain addicts on methadone
have grown steadily. Despite some differences in theory and
practice, in all maintenance programs an addict receives a dose
of methadone every day, either at a clinic or, if he has proved
himself, at home. He may also receive ancillary services-group or
individual therapy, individual or family counseling, vocational
rehabilitation, employment services, use of social center
facilities, and medical and dental care. The extent and quality
of these varies greatly, but almost all programs provide
something. </p>

<p>There are wide variations in the modes of operation of
methadone programs.&quot; For example, a study of 47 methadone
programs found that 27 programs used ex-addicts on the staff,
while the others did not; 6 had inpatients only, 19 had
outpatients only, and the rest had both. Only 8 of the 47
provided chemotherapy without any group work. </p>

<p>Table 3-1 lists the types of service offered by the 47
programs in terms of the numbers of programs and the per cent of
the total sample offering the service.<br>

<p>a Drug-free detoxification is not a feature of the methadone
program. <br>
</p>

<p>More detailed statements obtained from 25 of the methadone
maintenance programs showed that 14 favored narcotic-free
rehabilitation as the ultimate goal, and only 11 favored
prolonged maintenance. Also, 18 preferred high-dose
administration (50-180 mg.) and 7 preferred low-dose (20-40 mg.).
Not surprisingly, there was a correlation between preference for
narcotic free rehabilitation and preference for low doses. </p>

<p>The precise number of persons now in methadone-maintenance
programs is not known. At the Third National Methadone Conference
in November, 1970, Dr. Vincent Dole estimated that there were
then about 9,000 people on methadone maintenance in the United
States and Canada .4' This estimate was based on a<br>
variety of inputs, including discussions with the manufacturer of
methadone. It was in rough accord with the numbers of patients
recorded in publications by the major projects and was probably
fairly accurate. </p>

<p>Growth has been quite rapid, however. The NIMH treatment
directory listed 44 methadone-maintenance programs as of 1968-69,
and many of these had small patient populations. As of April,
1970, 64 programs had acquired or applied for Food and Drug
Agency authority to use methadone for maintenance, although not
all of them were in operation. At that time, the best estimates
were that between 50 and 60 programs were actually
operating.&quot; By June 1, 1971, the FDA had given permission to
257 sponsors representing 277 methadone-treatment programs, some
of which included several clinics. Of these, 185 programs were in
institutions and the other 92 were private. The number of
programs now in actual operation is not known.&quot; </p>

<p>The FDA estimated, in June, 1971, that there were 20,000 to
30,000 people on methadone maintenance at that time. Dr. Bertram
Brown Director of NIMH, testified at the same hearings that
20,000 was probably the best estimate.&quot; As of December,
1971, the FDA has doubled its estimate again. It now believes,
according to Dr. Elmer Gardner, that there are between 40,000 and
50,000 patients on methadone maintenance. </p>

<p>Costs. Costs of methadone programs are hard to determine. Many
figures are given, but it is never clear whether all costs (such
as plant and equipment or the value of volunteer help, for
example) are included. As a rough estimate, the cost of the
programs is between $500 and $2,500 per patient per year,
depending on a number of factors. </p>

<p>Methadone itself is not an important cost, since it can be
procured for about $.05 per day per addict. </p>

<p>Controlling and administering the methadone is a significant
cost, since it requires a staff. </p>

<p>Determination and preparation of individual doses are
significant, since determination requires physician time,
preparation requires careful work by a pharmacist, and keeping
track of individual doses takes staff time. Whether individual
doses are more effective therapeutically than standardized ones
is an open question. </p>

<p>All programs use urinalysis to test the patients' use of
heroin and other drugs. This costs $1 to $3 per test, depending
on the frequency, the laboratory, and the number of samples
tested. Obviously, this is a significant cost element: Testing
three times a week at $3 per test would cost $468 per addict per
year. There are some ways of avoiding these costs through random
testing, which is effective for some purposes. There may also be
cost-reduction possibilities for the tests themselves. </p>

<p>The method by which an addict is initially switched from
heroin to methadone makes a large cost difference. If the addict
is switched to methadone as an inpatient in a hospital (as was
done for most of the patients in the Dole-Nyswander project, for
example), each addict admitted may cause $200 to $1,400 for
initial hospital expenses. </p>

<p>Physical plant and facilities obviously make a difference in
costs. </p>

<p>Legal requirements are important. To the extent that
jurisdictional law requires that elaborate information be
obtained and records kept, the costs are increased. </p>

<p>Any research component adds expenses. </p>

<p>The level of ancillary services is important. An effort to
supply group therapy, counseling, vocational or educational
rehabilitation, and other services-all of which require high
staff-to-patient ratios-will increase expenses substantially.
Many of the public statements on costs regard this as the major
variable involved. While most programs pay lip service to the
need for these services, careful evaluation of the extent to
which they influence the success or failure of the program is
only beginning. </p>

<p>The rate of expansion of a program makes a significant
difference in average cost. An addict will probably require more
services and control in his first year than later, when he is
stabilized in a new life-style, so that a new or expanding
program should show higher average costs than a static one. </p>

<p>These variations account for the wide range of the basic cost
estimate. At present, $500 per addict per year seems about the
minimum for a program that uses standardized dosages, outpatient
induction, fairly cheap urinalysis, and no services except those
supplied by the addicts themselves. A reasonable estimate for a
program with individual doses, some inpatient induction, frequent
and expensive urinalysis, and many ancillary services is $2,000,
although, of course, the cost for each patient stabilized in the
program would be much lower.&quot; This figure could be raised
almost without limit by the provision of more extras, of course,
a phenomenon sometimes referred to by program operators as the
danger of &quot;Taj Mahalism&quot;---providing very elaborate
services to a few addicts rather than minimal effective services
to many. </p>

<p><i>Population Characteristics.</i> Because of regional
differences the demographic characteristics of the over-all
methadone population are hard to describe. The patient population
of the Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program (MMTP) in New York
City, for example, is about 40 per cent black, 19 per cent Puerto
Rican, 40 per cent white, and I per cent Oriental. This breakdown
compares with the ethnic breakdown of the New York City Narcotic
Registry, which, as of December, 1969, was 47 per cent black, 27
per cent Puerto Rican, and 26 per cent white.&quot; The Santa
Clara County (California) Methadone Program reports a patient
population of 55 per cent Mexican American, 6 per cent black, and
39 per cent white.&quot; Other programs also exhibit ethnic
breakdowns' indicating that methadone maintenance appeals to
minority-group addicts. The Washington, D.C., program, for
example, is 95 per cent black.&quot; The ethnic composition of
any methadone project is probably not too dissimilar from that of
the local addict population of comparable age, although it may be
skewed slightly toward overrepresentation of white addicts. </p>

<p>Methadone has not had similar success in attracting younger
addicts. Although the minimal age required for admission to most
programs is 18, the mean age of the patient population is usually
between 30 and 35. In addition, the average length of addiction
for the patient population on methadone is 10 to 15 years,
although most programs require only two years, and some now
require only one. There are reports, however, that the mean and
median ages and length of addiction are now falling.&quot;
Unfortunately, no treatment method has been developed that
attracts the majority of young addicts. Most members of this
group do not seem to be sufficiently disenchanted with either the
life-style or the effect of heroin to seek treatment of any type,
or are as yet unconvinced that they are truly hooked. </p>

<p>Results. Most methadone programs have made an effort to
evaluate their effect on the patients. The criteria employed
usually follow those developed to evaluate the MMTP in New York
-remaining in the program, employment, freedom from drug use,
decrease in crime, and willingness to accept help for personal
problems. </p>

<p>The New York program is not only the largest but also the best
evaluated over time. Consistently, the evaluation committee,
headed by Dr. Frances Gearing of Columbia University's School of
Public Health and Administrative Medicine, has found the program
successful with a large percentage of the addicts. The findings
of the evaluation, as of October 31, 1970, are as follows: &quot;
</p>

<p>Population. Most of the patients had been selected under
criteria that required them to be 20 years old, have a five-year
history of addiction, display no serious psychiatric problems,
and have no addiction to drugs other than heroin. Although in
1969 the requirements were reduced to age 18 and two years of
addiction, this had little impact on the age distribution of the
treatment population because of the waiting time. The mean age at
admission remained about 33-higher than the 27.9 mean age of the
addicts on the New York City Register. Whites had a mean age at
admission of 31, blacks of 35, and Puerto Ricans of a year in
between. </p>

<p>Retention. A total of 4,376 patients had been admitted since
the inception of the program in 1964. Of this group, 3,485 (80
per cent) were still in treatment at the time of evaluation. The
others had left voluntarily or had been discharged because of
excessive use of other drugs or alcohol, death, incarceration, or
antisocial or generally uncooperative behavior. Of the 2,424
originally inducted on an inpatient basis, 74 per cent were still
enrolled. Of the 1,952 who had been admitted directly as
outpatients, 88 per cent were still enrolled. (This group had not
been in treatment as long as the others, since outpatient
induction was started only in 1968. They were also a selected
group.) </p>

<p>Special studies of three 500-patient cohorts have been done.
One of those covered the cohort for 21 months, one for 33 months,
and one for 48 months. About 23 per cent of each cohort had been
discharged by 21 months after admission, 34 per cent of two
cohorts by 33 months after admission, and 42 per cent of one
cohort by 48 months after admission. </p>

<p>As is shown by the cohort studies, the commonly cited
80per-cent success rate is misleading. The statistic includes a
large number of addicts who have been in the program for a
relatively short period and does not fully reflect the attrition
over time. For example, the total admissions, as of October 31,
1969, were 2,325. As of October 31, 1970, they were 4,376. Thus,
the data for the latter date included 2,051 patients who had been
in treatment for less than one year, and half or more of these
may have been in for six months or less. (The cohort studies show
that the attrition rate during the first six months is about 10
per cent, and over the first year it is about 16 per cent.)
Maintenance of the over-all average of 20 per cent attrition is
therefore dependent on continuing expansion of the program. </p>

<p>There is another side of this argument, however. MMTP has
fairly strict standards for behavior and drops people for
violation of those standards; a large proportion of those listed
as failures were therefore dropped by the program (they
themselves did not want to leave). A study of 138 terminations
found the following causes: 55 </p>

<p>Involuntary terminations 81.2% </p>

<p>Uncooperative behavior 17.4% </p>

<p>Antisocial behavior 7.2 </p>

<p>Unreachable psychopathology 7.2 </p>

<p>Drug abuse 8.7 </p>

<p>Alcohol abuse 10.9 </p>

<p>Arrested 15.2 </p>

<p>Medical disability 2.2 </p>

<p>Death 12.3 </p>

<p>Voluntary terminations 15.9 </p>

<p>Voluntary discharge 14.5 </p>

<p>Loss of contact 1.4 </p>

<p>Administrative terminations and unknown 2.9 </p>

<p>Administrative .7 </p>

<p>No information 2.2<br>
</p>

<p>One can question whether a methadone program should terminate
patients for all of the causes given. Even if the patient has
serious problems remaining, the program may have substantial
beneficial effects. One can argue that the only patients who
should be counted as failures are those who drop out voluntarily.
If this criterion is applied to the 500-patient cohort that had a
42 per cent attrition rate over 48 months, and if we assume that
only 15.9 per cent of these dropouts were voluntary, then only 34
of 210 dropouts would be counted as failures. By this standard,
the MMTP may claim that it has a ' t least partial success with
93.2 per cent of all addicts who are admitted to the program. </p>

<p>Again, this is not totally satisfactory, for several reasons.
For example, it is difficult to know how to categorize those who
die or are discharged for medical disability. Some of the
voluntary patients moved to programs in other cities. Some
patients who were expelled might have dropped out voluntarily at
a later time. Thus, 93.2 per cent may be unrealistically high.
But it does show that a 42 per cent termination rate over four
years probably understates the value of the program somewhat. </p>

<p>To sum up, if one adopts MMTP's own standards on the retaining
power of methadone, the common figure of 80 per cent success errs
on the high side. If, however, one argues that those standards
are too stringent, excluding too many patients who are receiving
worthwhile benefits from the program, the 80-percent figure may
be too low. (it should be noted that the same problems exist in
assessing the effects of nomnethadone programs. They are just
more obvious in this context.) </p>

<p>Employment. For the group that stayed in the program,
employment rose markedly. About 26 per cent of the men were
employed when they entered. This figure rose sharply to about 57
per cent and 66 per cent for those in the program six and twelve
months, respectively, and then rose more slowly to about 78 per
cent for those in the program for 48 months. Because of
attrition, this percentage rise represents a much smaller
absolute rise in employment. Out of a cohort of 100 entrants, 26
would be employed. After four years, 58 members of the cohort
would still be in the program, of whom 45 (78 per cent of the 58)
would be employed. So, out of any group of 100 entrants, only 45
would be employed after four years. </p>

<p>Criminal Activity. For the group that stayed in the program,
criminal activity apparently decreased. In the three years before
admission to the program, the methadone patients had 120 arrests
and 48 incarcerations for every 100 man-years. In the four years
after admission, they had 4.5 arrests and 1.0 incarcerations. </p>

<p>A group of detoxification patients studied for purposes of
comparison showed 131 arrests and 52 incarcerations per 100
person years in the three years prior to detoxification and 134
arrests and 63 incarcerations for the four years after
detoxification. A separate study of 912 patients admitted over a
four-and-a-half year period showed a 90-per-cent drop in criminal
convictions.&quot; </p>

<p>Drug Use. While most patients test the methadone blockage a
few times while on methadone, none had returned to regular heroin
usage while still in the program. About 8 per cent have problems
with chronic alcohol use and 10 per cent with continuing use of
amphetamines, cocaine, and barbiturates. </p>

<p>Fate of Dischargees. A Gearing Committee study of 281
expatients six months after discharge had the following findings:
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Left</i> <i>Discharged</i> <i>Total</i></font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>voluntarily</i> <i>for cause</i> <i>discharge</i></font>

</p>

<p><font size="2">Total N (90) (472) (562) <br>
</font></p>

<p>Two other studies have produced similar results. </p>

<p>Previous evaluations of MMTP have been criticized on the
ground that the original selection criteria (since eased, as we
have noted) picked only those addicts most amenable to treatment.
Another criticism is that the ambulatory induction program has
required that the applicant have either a job or a family. This
may also select the strongest candidates. Finally, the fact that
there is a waiting period may also operate to select patients who
are most amenable to treatment. The Gearing evaluations through
1970 do not include any analysis of attrition rates from the
waiting list or any comparison of those who enter treatment and
those who drop off the list. </p>

<p>These criticisms seem at first glance to have weight. There
are several compelling arguments that they do not, however. Dr.
Carl Chambers, Research Director of the New York Narcotics
Addiction Control Commission, headed a study that utilized
single-factor analysis to compare patients who stayed in the
program and patients who did not. He found that continuing in the
program was not related in any statistically significant way to
the patient's sex, marital status, multiple abuse of drugs, abuse
of alcohol, ethnicity, education, age at onset of heroin use, or
number of prior treatments. Continuing in treatment was
marginally related to conviction history, in that there was a
significant difference between those with three or more
convictions and those with two or fewer. It was related to the
length of abuse of narcotics, in that 90 per cent of those who
had abused five or fewer years and only 77 per cent of those who
had abused more than five years remained in treatment for two
years. There was a relationship to the employment status of the
patient at time of admission-88 per cent of those who were
employed and 77 per cent of those who were not remained in
treatment for at least two years. The item with the greatest
predictive power was the number of convictions-the fewer the
number, the greater the chance of remaining in treatment.
Combinations of these characteristics do have some predictive
value. For example, the Chambers study concluded that a patient
with seven or more convictions who had no marketable employment
skills was least likely to remain in treatment two years (55.6
per cent of these did remain), and that a patient with few
convictions and no multiple drug or alcohol problems was most
likely to remain in treatment (95.8 per cent).&quot; </p>

<p>In short, the original admission criteria may exercise some
influence on the success rate as measured by retention, but it
seems to be minimal. Some admissions criteria, such as the four
years of addiction, would operate against success. Others, such
as freedom from severe psychiatric problems (which would probably
result in a higher percentage of employed addicts than the number
in the population at large), would operate in favor of success.
But none seems to be very important. </p>

<p>Some special studies indicate that problem groups of patients
do respond to methadone, although not quite so well as the normal
groups. Of 269 patients on probation or parole-a group that would
be especially difficult to work with-72 per cent remained in the
program in good standing.&quot; Even more convincing is the fact
that the Dole-Nyswander results have been replicated by reputable
researchers in other places. At the National Methadone
Conference, sponsored by NIMH and the National Association to
Prevent Addiction to Narcotics, a succession of researchers from
different parts of the country recited results comparable to,
though usually not quite so good as, those achieved by the Dole
Nyswander program. Results have been generally good no matter how
few the restrictions placed on patient characteristics.&quot; </p>

<p>Interpreting these reports is complicated by the fact that,
while the basic criteria remain fairly constant, there are
variations in the exact methodology of evaluation-in the extent
to which information from addicts is verified independently, in
the frequency of urinalysis, in the relations between the police
and the program (in some places, for example, the police may
cooperate with methadone treatment by not prosecuting addicts in
the program except for very serious crimes), in the sampling
techniques used, and in the definition of retention. In addition,
some programs use outside evaluation teams, and some rely on
internal information systems or on special studies done by their
own staff. At present, no two major programs have been thoroughly
evaluated by the same team of outside experts, although the
Columbia group that evaluated the MMTP will probably also
evaluate the Narcotics Treatment Agency in Washington, D.C. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the basic consistency of results is quite
impressive. Although we may not yet know exactly how good
methadone maintenance is, its essential efficacy is as well
established as anything in this field can be. It is now generally
acknowledged that methadone is medically safe, acceptable to many
heroin addicts, effective, and administratively feasible for
large-scale programs.&quot; Clearly, methadone should not be
regarded as a miracle cure. The majority of program operators
believe that most addicts on methadone try heroin a few times,
partly out of curiosity as to whether the block works, partly
because of the desire for euphoria. Judging a program in terms of
whether an addict ever relapsed might well make it appear to be a
failure. Methadone addiction avoids the large swings and
demanding schedule of heroin addiction, thus making it easier for
an addict to hold a job and support his family, but it is likely
to take months for an addict to revamp his life-style into a new
pattern. Underlying psychological problems remain, except for
those caused by the demands of heroin addiction itself. Addicts
tend to abuse some other drugs, such as amphetamines and alcohol,
to about the same degree that they abused them while on
heroin.&quot; </p>

<p>From society's point of view, the most important of all the
evaluation criteria is remaining in the program. An addict who is
using methadone is not continuing either extensive heroin use or
heroin-seeking behavior, and his criminal behavior will probably
be reduced because he does not need the money to purchase the
drug. He is not spreading hepatitis contracted from infected
needles by selling his blood to hospitals.&quot; He is not trying
to sell heroin because he needs money for a fix. He is not
hanging out in a shooting gallery or on the street serving as a
role model for the neighborhood adolescents. And he is not
helping to provide the mass market for heroin that makes
investment in its importation and distribution economically
attractive despite the risks. It should be emphasized, however,
that the addict will still have the criminal skills he has
learned and may choose to use them to support himself. In such
case, the decrease in crime would be the difference between the
amount needed to support the habit and the addict and that needed
to support the addict alone. Some patients may continue to commit
crimes at the same level as before, using the extra money to
raise their standard of living or to build up a nest egg.
Criminal activity, according to several experts, declines slowly,
over a period of a year or more.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">BASIS FOR THE SUCCESS OF METHADONE </font></p>

<p>The expansion of methadone maintenance has been based on
empirical evidence of its utility, not upon any solid
understanding of the pharmacological reasons for its success.
While, obviously, this success is due to its nature as an opiate
and long-acting substitute for heroin, an understanding of the
nature of addiction itself is missing. It is not known whether
methadone is more effective than other modalities because
addiction has physiological components that only another opiate
can offset or because of factors rooted in the psychology of
addiction. </p>

<p>The issues concerning possible physiological components of
addiction can be stated succinctly: </p>

<p>Are some persons physiologically vulnerable to heroin, in the
sense that it causes physical changes in them that it does not
cause in &quot;normal&quot; people? </p>

<p>Are there inherent physiological factors that make some people
seek heroin-is there some pre-existing felt physical need that
does not exist in most people? </p>

<p>Does taking heroin cause a permanent or long-term
physiological change in the addict that makes him crave the drug
after he becomes abstinent? </p>

<p>Does heroin addiction create a physiological change that makes
an ex-addict particularly vulnerable to stress after he becomes
abstinent? </p>

<p>There is no clear answer to any of these questions. Yet, most
scientists would be inclined to think that the answers to at
least the first two are &quot;No.&quot; Dr. Vincent Dole, in the
past, has hypothesized that narcotics addicts may have an
inherent neurological vulnerability to the drug, but recently he
seems to have modified his view.&quot; The second two questions
are the subject of debate among experts. Dr. Dole does seem to
think that opiate addiction causes a metabolic change in the
addict that, in turn, causes drug hunger. Whether he thinks this
change is permanent or only fairly long lasting (i.e., well
beyond the period during which overt withdrawal symptoms are
present) is, however, unclear.&quot; In either event, giving
methadone to an addict, iti Dr. Dole's view, simply corrects the
metabolic imbalance that has already been caused by his heroin
addiction. In this sense, he believes the analogy between
methadone for an addict and insulin for a diabetic is valid.
Others are skeptical.&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. William Martin has hypothesized a more elaborate
physiological model. In his view, an opiate such as heroin or
methadone causes a metabolic change that makes the user more
vulnerable to stress.&quot; An addict may become abstinent, but
stress will trigger a physiological reaction that makes him crave
the drug again. Furthermore, this effect may increase with
continued or increased doses of opiates. Thus, when an addict is
maintained on a methadone dosage higher than his prior heroin
dosage, as is true in many programs, the underlying physical
problem is aggravated. This, in turn, makes it even less likely
that he will ever be able to become totally abstinent. Dr. Martin
is uncertain whether the opiate-induced change is reversible. </p>

<p>Which, if any, of these theories are correct is obviously an
important question. A finding that there is an inherent
neurological vulnerability or that addiction causes an
irreversible or long-term metabolic change that induces drug
hunger, either inherently or as a response to stress, would have
important consequences for law enforcement, treatment, education,
and research. </p>

<p>To reiterate, the metabolic theories are far from proved at
present. They may turn out to be wrong, or it may develop that
there is a physiological change that is reversible over a period
of months or years. Such a finding would pose very difficult
public policy problems, because methadone might be prolonging and
aggravating a physical condition that could be reversed if an
addict could endure abstinence from opiates for some period that,
in practice, most addicts cannot endure. </p>

<p>There are other hypotheses about the reasons for the success
of methadone maintenance that are alternatives or supplements to
the metabolic theory. Some of these are as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>To some extent, abstinence symptoms may be a conditioned
    response to environmental factors. In turn,
    self-administration of heroin is a conditioned response to
    the existence of these symptoms, in that for the addict it
    has been a successful way of eliminating them in the past.
    (There are reports, for example, of men who have been in
    prison and &quot;clean&quot; for years experiencing
    withdrawal symptoms upon return home.) By blocking the effect
    of heroin, methadone extinguishes the reinforcement for its
    self-administration <font size="1">.61 </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heroin has a short duration of action and involves wide
emotional swings, from euphoria after administration to the
threshold of withdrawal six hours later. The rapidity of this
cycle forces a totally drug-oriented existence on the addict. If
he does not concentrate on procurement of the drug to the
exclusion of virtually everything else, he is not going to have
it when he needs it. Methadone, with its twenty-four-hour action
and gentler swings, allows the addict the luxury of thinking
about something besides drugs. </p>

<p>Methadone programs, with or without supporting services, gives
the addict a good deal of psychological support. The staff is
concerned with his well-being and is giving him a medicine in
which they have obvious confidence. Medical practice has long
known that this placebo effect is important. </p>

<p>Heroin addiction imposes a structure and purpose on the
addict's life-getting the drug. Daily visits to the methadone
clinic may provide comparable structure. </p>

<p>The life-style and personal associations of an addict provide
great pressures to relapse after a period of abstinence. An
abstinence program located where the addict will not live in the
future (e.g., Lexington) does nothing about this problem, because
the addict does not build up an alternative life-style and
alternative associations and will probably return to the old ones
after release. Methadone protects him from heroin while he builds
new patterns of behavior and loses touch with the addict culture.
In this view, after new patterns have been developed, it might be
possible to withdraw the addict from methadone because his
altered environment would not put pressure on him to relapse. </p>

<p>There is some evidence that a substantial number of addicts
-perhaps as many as one-third-&quot;mature out&quot; of addiction
when they reach their 30's and 40's. Some of the patients who do
well on methadone may come from this group.&quot; </p>

<p>Studies have indicated that monitoring an ex-addict is an
important factor in keeping him off drugs.&quot; The crucial
ingredient of methadone treatment may be not the methadone per se
but the urinalysis. Addiction to methadone is necessary only to
force the patient to come to the program. </p>

<p>At present, one can do little but note these differences; one
cannot know how these vary in validity for different addicts or
groups, or, in some cases, even how they could be researched. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="1"><b>ISSUES CONCERNING </b>METHADONE <br>
</font></p>

<p><i>Dosage Level. </i>The first question about dosage levels is
how much methadone should be given to an addict. Most people have
a general preference for administering the least amount
consistent with success. This is based partly on moral feelings
that one should give as little of an opiate as possible and
partly on a desire to minimize unknown side effects or metabolic
disruption. The problem is to determine this minimum level. </p>

<p>The general rule of thumb is that a daily dose of 100 mg. will
block any effect of heroin for almost all addicts. Most programs
administer a maximum of 180 mg., although a few may go as high as
300 mg. in selected cases. A program that administers 80 mg. or
more is probably aiming at a blockage dose. A lower dose will not
block the effect of heroin-an addict can achieve euphoria if he
tries. However, the lower dose will block the narcotic hunger and
thus remove some of the pressure for heroin use. For most
addicts, a dosage of 40 or 50 mg. is enough to eliminate this
craving, but an even lower dose may be enough if the addict has a
light habit. </p>

<p>In the early methadone programs, it was apparently assumed
that any addict who found that he could break the block would do
so, and that the higher, blocking doses were necessary. In the
last few years, some experiments have been made comparing the
efficacy of high and low doses. Dr. Avram. Goldstein, at the
Santa Clara County Program, maintained three groups of randomly
chosen addicts on blind doses of 30, 50, and 100 mg.,
respectively. (Blind dosage is not discussed with the patient,
who is not aware of how much he is receiving.) The addicts
receiving the lower doses did tend to use heroin more often
during the first month, but by the third month in treatment there
was no significant difference among the groups in either heroin
use or retention in the program.&quot; Dr. Jerome Jaffe, of the
Illinois Drug Abuse Program, has done similar research with
roughly equivalent results. For the first month or so, the
highdose group has a higher retention rate; thereafter, the two
groups do about the same in terms of retention, employment, and
arrest rates. Dr. William Weiland came to the same con clusions
after similar experiments in Philadelphia with groups of 52
patients on 50 mg. of methadone and 52 on 100 mg. for a period of
60 days.&quot; There are few dose-related side effects. </p>

<p>These results suggest that suppression of the narcotics hunger
may be more important than the blockage effect, at least for
motivated addicts. The results are only suggestive, however,
because the time spans involved in these experiments are limited,
and it is not known what the results of a more extended
experiment might be. The results might also be different if the
populations involved were younger or less motivated. Drs. Dole
and Goldstein, among others, regard these experiments as very
interesting. The low dose does mean that some addicts will drop
out in the initial stages who might have been retained with a
higher dose. In addition, it exposes the patient to the medical
risk of relapse. Given these known costs and risks, and given the
lack of any solid reason to believe that a 100-mg. dose is in
some way more harmful than 50 mg., some doctors are reluctant to
use a low dose. The major reason for doing so is that it
minimizes leakage into the community from patients who take their
methadone home, minimizes side effects, and safeguards somewhat
against unknown side effects or long-term effects. </p>

<p>Some programs use doses even smaller than those described
above, but none has been scientifically evaluated. Colonel Hassan
Jeru Ahmed, of the Blackman's Development Center in Washington,
D.C., claims to give a number of addicts as little as 5 mg. per
day with good success. Without controlled experiments, it is hard
to know whether his opinion is accurate. Theoretically, such a
dose might suppress the hunger in an addict with a very low
habit, or there might be some placebo effect involved. Since
Colonel Hassan's aim is abstinence rather than maintenance, this
might also be a method of slow detoxification. </p>

<p>A second issue about dosage involves expense. Most programs
have assumed that the specific dose should be tailored to the
individual addict and therefore give doses of anywhere from 25
mg. to 180 mg., depending on the individual. From the standpoint
of administrative efficiency, this is costly. To work with a few
standardized doses would allow programs to treat more addicts
with the same expenditure. Dr. Goldstein has done an experiment
to determine whether the individualized dose is really more
effective and has concluded that it is not.&quot; To test this,
he used a blind dosage procedure. (This procedure not only is
necessary for research on dosage but also has substantive
benefits as well. The most important of these may be that the
&quot;dosage game&quot; is part of the addict's life style of
&quot;conning,&quot; and eliminating it contributes to over-all
rehabilitation.) An initial dose of 30 mg., increased by 10 mg. a
day until final stabilization at 100 mg., was equally effective
for all patients. </p>

<p><i>Ancillary Services. </i>Most program operators declare that
ancillary services are a vital part of methadone treatment. Group
and individual therapy, job training, job placement, family
counseling, medical and dental care, and education are all
regarded as crucial to the process of helping addicts make the
adjustment to a new life-style once they have broken the heroin
habit. MMTP, for example, provides extensive services, which is
one reason the total cost is estimated at about $2,000 per year
per patient. (The cost for each patient who has finished the
induction stage is about $1,000 per year.) In its evaluation
reports on MMTP, the Gearing Committee always emphasizes the
importance of services.&quot; Dr. Jaffe, whose Illinois Drug
Abuse Program also offers services, agrees. In particular, he
believes that the techniques and group procedures developed in
therapeutic communities are helpful in stabilizing addicts on
methadone because they create an environment in which patients
not only can be relieved of narcotics hunger but also can begin
to develop attitudes that may be useful to them in achieving
social rehabilitation. </p>

<p>There are some programs that operate with a minimum of extras,
however, and their success rate does not seem markedly lower than
the others'. In New Orleans, most addicts are treated in private
clinics and pay about $10 per week.&quot; The program has limited
ability to finance additional facilities. The Santa Clara County
Program, which also operates at a cost of about $10 per addict
per week, is equally limited in its services.&quot; About 10 per
cent of the patients receive psychiatric help outside the
program, and there is some vocational counseling. There is also
some group work by the patients themselves without professional
involvement. Since the initial retention rate of the Santa Clara
County Program is relatively close to that of the MMTP,
additional ancillary services might contribute little as compared
with their costs. (An important aim of the program has been to
study this question.) The Santa Clara Program did include a
vocational counselor, which many observers feel is the most
important single service that can be offered. It also emphasizes
peer-group therapy as a key to rehabilitation.&quot; Drs. Jaffe
and Dole have experimented with giving methadone without services
to people on waiting lists. Preliminary results from MMTP are
good.&quot; </p>

<p>Although one could easily find widespread agreement that
ancillary services would be clearly desirable if they were free,
one seldom finds any explicit analysis of the cost/benefit
aspects of the issue. The key fact is that, as long as the supply
of addicts holds out, a minimal program can treat many more
patients than an elaborate one at any given level of expenditure.
A program costing $500 per year per addict, with a retention rate
of only 50 per cent, can treat more people than a program costing
$2,000, with an 85-per-cent success rate. With $1 million, for
example, the cheaper program could treat 2,000 addicts for a year
and would retain half of them. The more expensive one could treat
only 500 addicts, even though it would retain 425 of them. The
economic advantages of the cheaper program are even greater when
the comparative outputs are analyzed over time. Still, assuming a
limited budget and an unlimited supply of addicts (and, at
present, almost all methadone programs have waiting lists) , each
type of program will be losing its failures and retaining its
successes. After some period, each would have a success rate of
100 per cent, because only the successes would remain; but the
$500 program would be maintaining four times as many addicts for
the same amount of money. </p>

<p>This analysis holds even for gross differences in success
rates. Since, as New Orleans and Santa Clara show, the actual
differences may be limited, or even nonexistent, the case for the
cheaper program is even stronger. Any city with a large addiction
problem and limited funds should probably choose a methadone
program with minimal services rather than full ones. The
principal argument against this conclusion is that services might
make a crucial difference for the hard-core addicts, and that
this is the population that causes most of the crime. But, while
it is true that addicts with long criminal records are less
successful on methadone than are others, it has not yet been
proved that the services make a crucial difference for this
group. In addition, the proposition that society should condemn
four treatable people to addiction in order to treat one other
addict who is causing more trouble is a hard moral position to
defend. It might be better to put the hard-core addict on heroin
maintenance and treat the others with methadone. </p>

<p>Another argument sometimes used in support of extensive
services is that society should spend the money necessary to give
full treatment to all addicts, thus obviating the whole question
and avoiding the need for moral choices. In the practical world,
however, everyone knows that the cities are in financial trouble
and have tremendous demands on their limited resources. It is
neither possible nor desirable to give narcotics addicts a prior
claim to limited public resources that might otherwise be spent
on education, health, welfare, or countless other pressing areas.
The best model may be one in which the patients are encouraged to
develop their own services, with the expensive ancillary services
targeted on the hard-core. </p>

<p><i>Outpatient Induction. </i>The MMTP originally inducted
patients into the methadone program by putting them in the
hospital for a week or two during the transition from heroin to
methadone. Because this is expensive, and because the limited
number of available hospital beds imposes a constraint on the
number admitted to the program, there has been much interest in
ambulatory induction. Starting in 1968, MMTP has adopted such a
program for some of its patients. As of 1971, about 1,952 of its
4,376 patients had been admitted in this fashion. Preliminary
data indicate that rates of attrition are almost identical
whether patients are inducted as inpatients or outpatients. After
24 months, about 72 per cent of each group remains.&quot; This
figure is not entirely valid because of the special
characteristics of the ambulatory group. Having a job or family
was a requirement for admission to the ambulatory component, and
79 per cent of admittees were employed or in school. Whether a
patient is employed, as we have seen, is a statistically
significant predictor of whether he will remain in treatment. </p>

<p>Other programs have also used ambulatory admission with
consistently good results, and the effectiveness of this method
is no longer in doubt.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Withdrawal. </i>Eventual withdrawal from methadone rather
than perpetual maintenance is regarded as a goal by drug experts
-in part because of a moral feeling that people should not and do
not need to be drug-dependent; in part because of a desire to
free the addict from his ties to the clinic; in part because of
the wish to minimize any unknown long-term effects of opiates on
the human body. </p>

<p>At present, it is uncertain whether withdrawal is possible. In
a study of 350 patients who withdrew from the MMTP, Dr. Dole
found that &quot;narcotics hunger&quot; returned in almost all
individuals immediately after they ceased taking the methadone,
whether their withdrawal was voluntary or involuntary. Since this
is a somewhat special populations high proportion were treatment
failures-the results are not conclusive, although they are
suggestive that withdrawal may be difficult. Dr. Dole has also
found in blind experiments that a patient stabilized on methadone
and free from drug hunger may have a return of drug dreams if his
medication is withdrawn. He believes that, for most addicts,
maintenance has to be a permanent way of life. It is important to
note, however, that the return of &quot;narcotics hunger&quot;
does not automatically mean a return to heroin use; some
individuals are able to live with the hunger without returning to
drugs. But hunger does make successful abstinence substantially
more difficult.&quot;' </p>

<p>Dr. Jaffe believes that withdrawal from methadone can be
successfully accomplished, although his work in this area has not
yet been extensive. In a study of 53 patients in active
treatment, he found that 29 per cent had voluntarily withdrawn
from methadone but remained affiliated with the methadone units,
either participating in group therapy or transferring to
therapeutic communities or aftercare systems. Not all those
observed on withdrawal remained abstinent, although some patients
observed after six months had been able to do so. Dr. Jaffe seems
to feel that continued therapy techniques are helpful in
maintaining abstinence.&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. Avram Goldstein has done experiments showing that the
methadone dosage can be reduced without discomfort to the patient
if it is done slowly at a weekly reduction rate of no more than
10 per cent. Withdrawal from a moderate methadone stabilization
program would then require about six months.&quot; But follow-up
results are not yet in. </p>

<p>Although the results to date are ambiguous, it seems certain
that substantial experimentation with withdrawal from methadone
will be undertaken. Some black activists, in particular, are
strongly opposed to the concept of permanent maintenance and will
accept methadone programs in their communities only if they are
seen as intermediate-term therapies with the ultimate goal of
abstinence. Dr. Beny Primm, of Addiction Research Treatment
Corporation in New York City, for example, told us that his
explicit goal is to get everyone off methadone and into a
drug-free state. Dr. Goldstein has also suggested that methadone
treatment should be thought of as &quot;methadone temporary
support rather than methadone maintenance, with its implication
of life-long medication.&quot; An addict could join the program,
become stabilized on methadone, eventually taper off slowly and
become drug-free, but be able to return to methadone if the urge
to take heroin became overwhelming.&quot; Ultimate determination
of the possibilities of withdrawal must await determination of
the metabolic-change issue. Meanwhile, the only way to find out
if withdrawal is possible is to try it. Since we do not know why
methadone works, there is no way of telling <i>a priori. </i>Some
programs have reported an unexpected phenomenon that might be
called &quot;the 20-mg. barrier.&quot; The patient undergoing
withdrawal does well until the dose is reduced to about 20 mg. At
this level, there is a sudden increase in physical complaints and
heroin usage.&quot; What this means for permanent withdrawal is a
question that needs study. </p>

<p><i>Benefits to the Addict. </i>Methadone maintenance is
sometimes criticized on the ground that it is society's way of
dealing with the addict crime problem without regard to the
addict himself. This view is especially strong among so-called
militant black groups. On the whole, however, the idea that
methadone sacrifices the addict for the sake of society does not
seem valid. Although many communities adopt methadone programs in
an attempt to solve their crime problem, the program results
showing increased productivity and family stability of the
patients suggest that they themselves benefit from the changed
life-style and reduced crime as much as or more than the
community at large. Since most programs operate primarily on a
voluntary basis, the patients themselves must prefer methadone to
the addicted life. Even when an addict is coerced into treatment
by law enforcement, simply staying in treatment is a vote against
the former life-style. </p>

<p>Finally, even if one were to concede the truth of the
criticism, the logical rejoinder would be &quot;So what?&quot;
There is no good reason for society to tolerate crime simply
because the criminal is a heroin addict when it can eliminate the
crime by forcing him to switch to being a methadone addict. It is
not as if one could choose between methadone and an equally
effective but more expensive alternative: The other alternatives
do not appear to work so well. Even if they did, it would be
difficult to argue that addicts deserve priority in allocating
scarce public resources that could be devoted to the general
welfare of the groups in society that furnish most of the
addicts. In general, to the extent that the criticism represents
the truth of the situation, its use as a criticism seems based on
wishful thinking rather than sound analysis. Its proponents wish
there were another, equally effective treatment method or wish
that public resources were unlimited. </p>

<p>If the metabolic theories of addiction should prove accurate,
the issue will become more acute. Dr. William Martin, for
example, poses the issue as the &quot;medical dilemma of
methadone maintenance, namely, the creation or continuance of a
serious medical disorder, physical dependence, in order to
decrease antisocial behavior.&quot;&quot; If this dilemma is a
real one, all the choices would be unpleasant. The nation could
legalize heroin or move to a massive system of heroin
maintenance, but this would pose exactly the same moral problems
as administering methadone. It could continue to keep heroin
illegal and prosecute addicts for crimes committed to obtain it
while refusing them methadone, but this seems both morally wrong
and politically impossible. It could declare that addicts are not
responsible for crimes committed to obtain heroin because of the
physical duress involved. This would necessitate either heroin or
methadone maintenance, however, since no one can be given such a
license to steal without some counteraction by society. Despite
the problems stated by Dr. Martin, methadone seems the best
choice. </p>

<p><i>Methadone and the Law-Enforcement System. </i>Some program
operators are strongly opposed to the development of close
relations between methadone maintenance and the law-enforcement
system. In their view, a coercive system that forces an addict to
accept methadone as a condition for probation or parole is an
intolerable violation of civil liberties. Others, with equally
strong opinions, disagree. They believe that the realistic choice
lies between having the addict on methadone and having him in
jail, and that the authorities will not often impose a methadone
requirement on a man who would otherwise have been released. In
this view, accepting treatment set by courts or parole boards
gives addicts an option that would not have been available
otherwise. All agree that participants in the methadone program
should avoid becoming informers for the law-enforcement system.
Because of the need to maintain the confidential doctor-patient
relationship, patients should not be reported by the treatment
agency for violations of probation or parole. </p>

<p><i>Methadone and Causes of Addiction. </i>Addiction is often
seen as a sociopsychological disorder, stemming from basic
personality defects. In this view, it is useless and wrong to
treat addiction by administering methadone without, at the same
time, treating the underlying disorder. A better way to approach
the problem is to deal with the basic pathology; when this is
done, freedom from drug use will follow naturally. As stated by a
Manhattan probation officer: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>My<b> </b>objection to the methadone program . . . is
    predicated on the observation that while the drug methadone
    removes the physical craving for the other opiates it
    nevertheless fails to combat in any way or deal with the
    various emotional or other difficulties that permitted the
    individual to initially become and remain involved with
    drugs. Since the drug problem has, so to speak, been
    eliminated, that basic problem has not been dealt with; that
    of the inadequate, ineffective person unable to cope with the
    reality of his situation. In essence, an aspect, the symptom,
    has been treated not the entire individual, with the result
    that they then frequently resort to other avenues of escape
    including amphetamines, barbiturates, wines, and liquor, or
    they begin to manifest serious forms of instability.88<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most proponents of methadone would readily agree that
methadone <i>per se </i>does not cure any personality disorders
that might cause addiction. (Not all would; it is entirely
possible that the opiates constitute an effective treatment for
certain as yet undefined psychic states.&quot;) Those who do
agree would respond to the basic criticism as follows: </p>

<p>No consistent pathology has been found. No psychiatric
diagnosis can be shown to apply to all heroin addicts or even to
a majority of them. Thus, while addicts tend to be depressive,
they are not so depressive as neurotic nonaddicts. While some
addicts are schizophrenic, 80 per cent to 90 per cent are not.
Some are psychopathic, but the great majority are not. In short,
no satisfactory explanation of the psychological roots of
addiction has been found, much less developed to the point where
it is operationally useful for treatment purposes's </p>

<p>The view that an underlying pathology is responsible is an
assumption rather than a proved fact. One can construct equally
plausible theories that experimentation is caused by exposure and
normal psychological processes, and addiction is caused by
physiological factors. Dr. Dole, for example, believes that the
observed common characteristics of addicts are simply those
forced on them by the nature of the life-style required to
maintain a heroin habit. Other experts also believe that, even
for addicts with marked problems, it is the addiction that causes
the problems rather than vice versa. </p>

<p>Even granting the argument that pathology is at the root of
addiction, it is easier to work on underlying causes with an
addict who is on methadone and free of drug hunger and the heroin
life-style. </p>

<p>Again granting the argument that pathology is at the root of
addiction, the success rates in attempting to cure such
pathologies-especially among the socioeconomic groups that
furnish most of the addicts-are not very high. Thus, one has no
realistic choice except to accept the second best solution of
methadone maintenance, which has very great benefits for society
and for the addict, even though it is not a complete cure. </p>

<p>Perhaps the best summary has been given by Dr. John Kramer,
discussing the psychopathology of addiction generally, not just
methadone: </p>

<p>It is generally conceded that traditional psychiatric
techniques have not been useful in the management of opiate
dependence. In a psychoanalytic frame of reference symptoms are
considered to be the behavioral or somatic representations of an
underlying intrapsychic conflict. Once the conflict is resolved
or reduced to manageable proportions, the symptoms will diminish
or disappear. </p>

<p>This conceptual model fails to account for two different
issues, either or both of which may play a role in people who
abuse drugs. First, though intrapsychic determinants may play a
part in whether a person uses drugs, other circumstances such as
drug availability, subgroup attitudes, peer pressures, and plain
chance are very often more important. In other words, in some
individuals, there may be no serious underlying conflicts, though
there may be considerable conflict with the community. Second,
whatever the original determinants of drug use may be, the
symptom, dependency on drugs, can become so central an issue that
it, so to speak, assumes a life of its own, and even solving the
underlying conflicts may have no influence on the drug dependence
itself. An analogy may be drawn with a depressed person who in an
attempt at suicide breaks his neck and becomes paraplegic.
Psychotherapy may relieve his depression but will not restore
function to his legs. </p>

<p>Because drug use has been invested with such great importance
in our society (an importance it did not always have) it is
assumed that the intrapsychic events which cause, or contribute
to it, are of equal magnitude. Hence the view, that since drug
use potentially subjects the person to such serious consequences,
the psychological problem he has must be equally big. Experience
with drug users does not validate this view. Some do indeed have
clearly definable psychiatric problems, but many do not. Where it
is sought, some subtle psychiatric defect can always be found, as
has been the case with addicts. Further investigation may clarify
this question. In the meantime a functional approach, handling
the symptoms, educating and giving practical assistance as well
as offering psychotherapy in selected instances seem desirable.91
<br>
</p>

<p>Multiple Drug Use. If a heroin addict is involved in the use
of other drugs, methadone will do nothing about that use. There
is evidence, however, that methadone patients do not increase
their use of other drugs-a charge that has been made-although
they do tend to maintain it at about the same level. The Santa
Clara County Program found that, both before and after going on
methadone, about 20 per cent of the patients overused alcohol, 5
to 10 per cent used amphetamines, 45 per cent used marijuana, and
30 per cent used nothing. The only significant difference was
that 20 per cent abused barbiturates before going on methadone,
and only 6 per cent did so afterwards.&quot; Since barbiturates
create a dangerous addiction if used too much, this is an
important shift. </p>

<p>We know of no other before-and-after study of drug use by
patients on methadone. A recent study of multiple drug use by
heroin users, however,&quot; supports Dr. Goldstein's conclusion
that the use of other drugs does not increase. A sample of 422
heroin users were asked whether they had used certain drugs more
than six times. The per cent who had done so were: marijuana-86
per cent; cocaine-47 per cent; barbiturates-34 per cent; and
amphetamines-33 per cent. (They were also questioned about other
drugs, not recounted here.) In general, it had not been thought
that multiple use among heroin addicts was as high as this, and
there may have been some tendency to assume that multiple use
among methadone patients was a new pattern for them rather than
the continuation of an old one. </p>

<p>Leakage of Methadone. As more large methadone projects come
into existence, it is reasonable to anticipate that some of them
will be lax in their control of methadone, permitting leakage
into the community at large. Several possible consequences of
such a development cause concern. First, there is a fear that the
drug will become available in an injectable form that is an
acceptable, if not a totally satisfactory, euphoric substitute
for heroin. Secondly, the availability of even oral methadone
will create a new group of addicts. Thirdly, nonaddicts,
particularly children, may take methadone and die. </p>

<p>These fears have a sound factual basis. Indeed, methadone can
already be bought on the street in any major city, although it is
unclear whether the source is diversion from the programs or
independent manufacture. The major concern is injectable
methadone. Many addicts regard it as a very good drug, and it
could result in a substantial addition to the present addiction
problem. This is probably a controllable problem, however.
Methadone can be mixed with Tang or some other substance before
dispensation (as is true in almost all programs at present), so
that it is suitable for oral administration only. More important,
the drug companies have developed a methadone disk that requires
a large volume of water for it to dissolve. This makes it
difficult, although not impossible, to inject.&quot; </p>

<p>The second concern, the leakage of oral methadone, is more
crucial. The rapid expansion of methadone programs is highly
probable. With this will inevitably come carelessness about staff
and about control of methadone. If there is a market for the
drug, there will also be some corruption. It will be surprising
if there are not some major scandals involving the diversion of
methadone from treatment programs. </p>

<p>In some ways, leakage may not be very important. While there
are some methadone addicts who are not involved in treatment
programs, oral methadone is not so euphoric as heroin, and few
current heroin addicts would prefer it to heroin as a
euphorogenic. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that methadone addiction is
physically more harmful than heroin addiction, and, if the
methadone is pure, there is good reason to think it less harmful.
There is substantial evidence to the effect that methadone
addiction is psychologically less harmful than heroin addiction.
In general, while a few addicts might make oral methadone their
drug of choice, it is probable that the major market for illegal
methadone will consist of addicts who are on do-it-yourself
methadone maintenance, who tide themselves over with methadone
when they cannot get heroin, or who want the euphoric effects of
heroin only occasionally. In these cases, both society and the
addict are better off if they can get methadone to substitute for
heroin. </p>

<p>There is some possibility that methadone will make addicts of
persons who would not otherwise have become addicted. Heroin has
two major defects that may exert some deterrent effect on
potential experimenters: It often contains dangerous impurities;
and it is not effective when taken orally. On the whole, however,
it seems unlikely that these factors are very influential. For
those who might not like to inject a drug, heroin can also be
snorted. (This is, in fact, the usual method by which neophytes
take the drug.) The impurities point might be valid, but it is
difficult to believe that anyone willing to get into the general
life-style of addiction is going to be deterred by the marginal
additional disadvantage of impure drugs. It does seem likely,
however, that, as methadone becomes increasingly available, it
will be used as the drug of initiation by persons who would
otherwise have tried heroin. </p>

<p>More difficult to accept are the overdose deaths that are
already starting to occur-most poignantly, among children who
find and drink methadone-laden Tang. Recurrences could be
prevented by insisting that methadone patients keep methadone in
a locked box outside the refrigerator. The drug will keep a week
without refrigeration, so that this is perfectly feasible.&quot;
Noninjectible methadone could also be given in a tablet form that
is too large and bitter for children. </p>

<p>Other deaths occur among people who use methadone to achieve
euphoria. Because methadone is slower-acting and longer lasting
than intravenous heroin, even a veteran heroin addict may take
methadone, decide that the drug is not having an adequate effect,
take more, and overdose when the peak comes two or three hours
later. Self-education within the drug subculture might keep such
incidents to a minimum. But some deaths will occur, and it is
reasonable to expect that the more methadone available, the more
deaths it will cause. </p>

<p>The only effective answer to this argument is to point to the
large number of heroin deaths caused by overdose, disease, and
infection and to the other deaths caused by addict-committed
crime and by such practices as the sale of infected blood by
addicts. Almost certainly there will be an over-all decrease in
opiate-related deaths as methadone replaces heroin in the
community. </p>

<p><i>Side Effects.&quot; </i>A number of possibly undesirable
side effects of methadone have been hypothesized, ranging from
impotence to damage to the bones and teeth. So far, clinical
studies have found no evidence of birth defects and no indication
of physical damage. Drowsiness is a frequent complaint of program
initiates, but this is a natural consequence of an increase in
the opiate dose and disappears as the addict develops tolerance
for the new level. Some addicts continue to complain of the loss
of libido, but the best evidence is that, for most, sexual
performance is better when they are on methadone than when they
are on heroin. In short, although it cannot be stated
categorically that there are no serious side effects, clinical
investigation so far has failed to find any. To date, however,
research has concentrated on possible physical effects; there do
not seem to be detailed studies of the effects of methadone on
intellectual or motor functioning, and we do not know how
methadone affects a wide range of important functions, from
problem-solving ability to the ability to operate a car or often
complex machinery. Since methadone is a powerful tranquilizer, it
may well have effects in these areas. It is also possible that
tolerance to tranquilization develops, as may be indicated by the
disappearance of excessive drowsiness.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">THE FUTURE OF METHADONE </font></p>

<p>It is virtually certain that methadone maintenance will
increase rapidly in the next few years. While many observers have
reservations, the cost/benefit and cost/effectiveness advantages
of methadone have become obvious. Since the relationship between
addiction and crime has been widely publicized, political
pressures to do something about crime are great enough so that
the government will probably support methadone, and vigorously. </p>

<p>While the federal subbureaucracies involved-the National
Institute of Mental Health, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, and the Food and Drug Administration-have never been fond
of methadone maintenance, its social and political advantages
should now be obvious enough to induce large scale federal
funding in the near future. Most informed observers regard the
Administration's proposal to create a Special Action Office on
Drug Abuse Prevention and to increase funding dramatically as
confirmation of this. At this writing, the Food and Drug
Administration is on the verge of liberalizing the rules under
which methadone is approved for use. </p>

<p>As the programs expand, several issues in addition to those
already discussed will become important: </p>

<p><i>Administrative Problems. </i>There are clear differences
between operating small, experimental programs and operating mass
programs. Such issues as the extent to which ancillary services
should be supplied, the extent of monitoring through urinalysis,
high doses versus low doses, standardized doses versus individual
ones, and control of leakage will arise over and over. In
addition, there will be the problems of recruiting and training
staff common to any expanding area. At present, there are not
enough people experienced in methadone programs to double or
triple current programs. One can expect a period of raiding of
existing programs (with a consequent decline in their
effectiveness) and increasing use of less qualified and less
dedicated people. The difficulties of hiring good staff will
compound the leakage problem. It will also create pressures to
use the cheapest methods available. Most of the higher costs of
the more expensive programs are caused by the increased staff
required for added services; if the trained staff to provide
these services is simply not available, they either will not be
provided or will be done poorly. Analysis of the impact of these
services is therefore urgent. </p>

<p><i>Community Problems. </i>As noted, some black militants are
opposed to methadone maintenance because they regard it as a
device to keep the black community &quot;drugged and
enslaved.&quot; Many of the rumors of side effects are also
believed. These fears can be countered as long as there appears
to be a possibility that methadone maintenance leads to
abstinence; but, if experiments indicate that this is not a
reasonable hope, the situation may become more difficult. This is
not the type of problem that is amenable to rational solution, or
even advice. Methadone-program operators, however, can do at
least three things to meet the challenge: </p>

<p>1. Maintain close contact with various elements of the
community, to explain what they are doing and why it is good for
the addict and the community. </p>

<p>2. Provide facilities to ensure that any methadone patient who
wants to try to become totally drug-free will receive the best
possible support for his effort. </p>

<p>3. Involve the community in the staffing and administration of
the project. </p>

<p>Since these are all good policies irrespective of any militant
reaction against methadone, programs should follow them whether
or not they foresee any problem. Some program operators believe
that the fear of adverse community reaction is exaggerated and is
likely to decrease over time. The area in which the addict lives,
after all, bears the crime costs and the risk of a spread in
addiction. As a methadone program becomes operational, the
surrounding community comes to appreciate it, and strong
opposition dissolves. Dr. Robert DuPont, of Washington's Narcotic
Treatment Agency, has told us that methadone patients become the
best missionaries in the community. </p>

<p><i>Long-acting Methadone. </i>The effect of the methadone used
at present lasts only about 24 hours. Drug companies have been
experimenting with a drug (acetylmethadol) that will last up to
three days, and it is expected that this will become generally
available soon.&quot; This will have several significant effects
on methadone maintenance. It will cut costs by reducing the
expense of preparing and administering the drug. It will also
make it more difficult for the patient to skip his dose and try
heroin. Another effect may be to allow the patient greater
mobility and weaken the ties between the patient and the program.
In the view of some, this will be a good thing because it will
enable the patients to lead a more nearly normal life. Others
speculate that it will be counterproductive, in that the routine
daily visit provides an important element of structure in the
patient's life and has positive therapeutic benefits. There is no
way of resolving this dispute <i>a priori.</i> </p>

<p><i>Changing Patterns of Addiction. </i>There is consensus that
the primary reason addicts volunteer for methadone programs, or
stay in them once assigned by the law-enforcement system, is that
they are tired of the life-style of an addict, with the constant
need to make a connection, the strains of criminality, the jail
time, and the risk of infection and death. Participation in a
methadone program and abstinence from heroin become a more
attractive choice. Whether he procures methadone on the street or
through a clinic, as long as it is cheap he can maintain his
opiate habit at low cost and then occasionally obtain the desired
euphoria by skipping the methadone and using large amounts of
heroin. Since the data from existing programs indicate that many
addicts do use heroin occasionally-anywhere from 10 to 50 per
cent, depending on the program and length of time in
treatment-this may already be a common pattern. </p>

<p>This problem presents a difficult choice to program operators.
To eliminate this last increment of drug use might require
expulsion of addicts for occasional heroin use. This would
certainly return some patients to the addicted life, with all the
social and personal costs involved. If an addict is adjusting
well in other ways, this cost is not justifiable. Eliminating the
last vestige of heroin use in such a case is essentially a
meaningless concession to moralism. </p>

<p>There is a more serious question involved, however. There is
no way of knowing the extent to which the negative aspects of the
addicted life have a general deterrent effect that keeps people
from experimenting with heroin. Clearly, almost anyone exposed to
heroin is also exposed to the addict community generally and
knows the risks involved in becoming addicted. It -is possible
that the existence of large methadone programs would indicate to
some portion of the nonaddict population that they could attain
the euphoria of heroin without having to adopt the life-style as
a whole, and they might find this option more attractive than
either abstinence or full-scale heroin addiction. Present
evidence indicates that there may be a curious gap of belief in
people who become addicted to heroin. They know full well that
the drug is addicting and that the life-style is terrible, but
they do not doubt their own ability to handle the drug without
becoming addicted. For all we know, the unattractiveness of the
life-style may be exercising a potent deterrent effect on others
who are curious but more realistic about the danger of becoming
addicted. Opening up the methadone choice might make these people
more willing to run the risk. Since we know little about the
causes of addiction and even less about deterrent effects, we do
not know whether this is a matter for real concern. If it turns
out to be an important phenomenon, it will create some painful
public-policy choices. </p>

<p><i>Total Size of Methadone Programs. </i>A final question
concerns the portion of the addict population that is amenable to
successful methadone treatment. Any figure is only an educated
guess based upon the observer's estimate of the total number of
addicts, observations about the results of existing methadone
programs, and judgments about the criteria of success. </p>

<p>Official U.S. Government calculations seem to agree that 25 to
33 per cent of the addicted population will be helped by
methadone.&quot; This estimate may well be too low; some program
operators have estimated that their methadone programs drew
almost 50 per cent of the addicts in an area within a year or so
after beginning operations.&quot;' Considering that many addicts
believe street rumors adverse to methadone, and that one would
not expect any program to reach its full potential right away, an
estimate of 50 per cent probably represents a more realistic, but
still conservative, figure, if one assumes that
&quot;success&quot; means &quot;derives substantial benefit from
methadone maintenance.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><i>ANTAGONISTS</i> </p>

<p>Antagonists are drugs that prevent opiates from having any
effect if the antagonists are administered before opiate
injection and that precipitate withdrawal if administered after
injection. The possibility of using these drugs as a major
treatment modality has intrigued researchers for the last six
years, but at present the antagonists remain experimental.&quot;'
</p>

<p>There are two basic antagonists currently in use for the
treatment of heroin addicts, cyclazocine and naloxone, but an
excellent survey by New York's Health Services Administration
noted that there might be several hundred others already in
existence, as yet untested.&quot;' The most important
characteristics of these drugs are as follows: </p>

<p>Cyclazocine produces unpleasant side effects, such as nausea
sweating, a drunken feeling, anxiety, and hallucinations, but
tolerance to these effects does develop. Naloxone does not appear
to have significant side effects. Cyclazocine is effective when
taken orally and has a duration of action of 12 to 24 hours.
Naloxone is effective when taken intravenously but is relatively
ineffective when taken orally. There does not appear to be any
information on subcutaneous administration, though presumably it
would be less effective than intravenous but more effective than
oral administration. Small doses of an antagonist are effective.
Thus, 4 mg. of cyclazocine will block the effects of 15 to 25 mg.
of heroin for one day. Naloxone is even more powerful if used
intravenously: 1 mg. will block the effects of 25 mg. of heroin
for ten hours. (Taken orally, it requires 200 mg. to block the
effects of 25 mg. of heroin for six hours.) Cyclazocine has
addictive qualities, in that an abstinent user will show some
withdrawal symptoms. Users do not crave the drug even when they
are in withdrawal, however. Naloxone does not have addictive
properties. The antagonists do not reduce the &quot;drug
hunger&quot; felt by the opiate addict. </p>

<p>Most experimentation to date has been done with cyclazocine,
largely because the short duration and ineffectiveness of oral
naloxone makes it an unsuitable candidate for mass treatment. </p>

<p>The NIMH Addiction Research Center is now experimenting with a
new antagonist, EN-1639A. It is two to three times more potent
than the other two, is effective orally, and has a longer
duration of action than naloxone <font size="1">.103</font> </p>

<p>Besides the mechanical problems of dosage and delivery, there
are several major problems in using the antagonists as a
treatment modality. Because they do not eliminate the &quot;drug
hunger,&quot; the patient is constantly tempted to miss his dose
and take heroin. As the HSA paper points out, the fact that
addiction to the antagonist itself is minimal means that it is
possible for him to do this. A methadone patient is tied to the
program by his addiction; an antagonist patient is not. Because
of this problem, and also because of the short duration of action
of many possible antagonists, a major search is under way for a
capsule that could be implanted in the patient to release the
drug slowly over an extended period. It is likely to be some time
before success is achieved, however.&quot;' The civil-liberties
questions involved are also substantial. </p>

<p>Two apparent disadvantages may be due to the experimental
nature of the programs. So far, the costs have been high ($3,000
to $5,000 per addict per year), partly because of the need for
inpatient care common to all experimental programs and partly
because of the scarcity and high price of some of the drugs. The
success rate so far is hard to calculate, but, at best, it has
been about 40 per cent over all, judged by the criterion of
remaining in the program.&quot;' However, some of the failures
may reflect the fact that dosages had to be worked out and
supportive services developed. Future experiments may do better.
One can, of course, argue the opposite-that future, larger
projects will be less successful because the Hawthorne effect of
participating in a new experimental program will be gone. In
addition, there is some evidence that the success rate for
outpatients may be considerably lower than for inpatients. </p>

<p>It is as yet unproved that the antagonists will ever be a
useful treatment modality. Nor is there any reason at present to
believe that the side effects of any antagonists would be less
adverse than those of methadone. It could easily turn out to be
the reverse, with the antagonists having more serious adverse
effects. If an addict is going to be dependent upon long-term
chemotherapy, there appears to be no reason at present for
preferring that he be dependent on an antagonist rather than on
methadone. </p>

<p>Under some theories of addiction, the antagonists could be
useful adjuncts to treatment. If one takes the view that it is
important to extinguish reinforcement of the desire to use
opiates, the antagonists may turn out to be successful. One can
also argue that the use of an antagonist, combined with
supportive services, would force the addict from the addicted
life-style and give him an opportunity to forge a new one.
Finally, and probably most important, is the possibility that use
of an antagonist might turn out to be the only practical way an
addict on methadone can become abstinent. If research should
ultimately show that opiate use does create a drug hunger that
persists for a long period after obvious withdrawal is complete,
then antagonists might be developed that would help the addict
survive this period without readdiction. Dr. William Martin has
found that secondary withdrawal symptoms persist in animals for
at least six months after withdrawal from opiates. If the drug
hunger is such a symptom, and if it persists in humans in similar
fashion, there is at present no way for an addict to leave a
methadone program without enduring six months of craving opiates.
As is obvious from the failure rates for abstinence programs, few
manage to do this. If an antagonist could prevent relapses from
leading to readdiction during this period, it would be
valuable.&quot;' </p>

<p>Dr. Martin is cautious about the antagonists. He states only
that, if the research goals are achieved, &quot;I believe that
certain motivated addicts can be benefitted by this approach. . .
. [They] may find a role in the treatment of the juvenile
experiment. <font size="4">Others are more enthusiastic, and
suggestions of mass inoculations are occasionally heard. The
wisdom of such ideas is questionable.<br>
</font></p>

<p><i>MULTIMODAL PROGRAMS<br>
</i></p>

<p>Several programs now contain components of all the different
modalities. The Illinois Drug Abuse Project (IDAP), in Chicago,
the Narcotics Treatment Administration, in Washington, D.C., and
the New Haven Mental Health Center, for example, include
methadone, therapeutic communities, detoxification, abstinence,
and supportive services for all types of patients. The Community
Mental Health Center'in New Haven has an experimental naloxone
group as well, and IDAP at one time tried cyclazocine on some
patients. While the approach is promising, rigorous comparison of
multimodal and unimodal programs has not yet been done, and one
can only set forth the present arguments for and against the
multimodal approach. </p>

<p>The arguments in favor run along the following lines: </p>

<p>Most observers believe that different programs work best for
different addicts, although the typologies are not worked out and
no tool has predictive value at present. If a program has several
modalities, an addict can readily transfer from one to another if
he or the staff feels that his performance could be improved by
the change. In addition, failure in one modality does not mean
total failure, because the addict can try another with minimal
delay. </p>

<p>Different modalities attract different types of addicts.
Therapeutic communities, for example, may have more appeal to
younger addicts; methadone, to older. Differences in age,
education, employment, or criminality may also be significant.
But the modality that attracts an addict may not be the one in
which he will ultimately do best. Combining the modalities makes
one an intake center for each of the others, to the benefit of
all. </p>

<p>In some cases, the modality to which an addict applies is an
accident of geography and personal contacts. Centralized
administration can make this choice more rational and productive.
</p>

<p>Each modality has something to contribute to the others. The
group-therapy techniques and intense environment of the
therapeutic community may help methadone patients by encouraging
them to become abstinent or by improving their understanding of
the factors that led them to addiction. They may also have an
impact on abuse of other drugs by methadone patients. Conversely,
TC residents and other abstinent patients may benefit from
knowing that there is a back-up program if they do not succeed in
remaining abstinent. </p>

<p>A multimodal program will find it easier to develop new
strategies for the treatment of addiction. For example, it may be
possible to have patients who are basically abstinent but receive
low doses of methadone if they feel the craving for drugs is
about to overwhelm them. This could be a particularly important
technique for teenagers. It would be difficult to operate such a
program in connection with any single modality, because both the
administrative structure and the ambience would be against the
experiment. </p>

<p>Politically, it is advantageous to combine the modalities, so
that they will stop fighting each other and unite to get more
support from the government. </p>

<p>The primary arguments against multimodal programs are as
follows: </p>

<p>Most of the benefits to be gained from eliminating accidental
assignment, allowing rapid reassignment, and experimenting with
new programs may be achieved just as well by better
administration and coordination of separate modalities. </p>

<p>Multimodal programs have the basic problem that they transmit
contradictory messages to the patients. The ethos of most such
programs is that abstinence is superior and that methadone
patients, while not so bad as heroin addicts, are definitely
second-class. This lack of psychological support makes it more
likely that the methadone patient will fail. It may also make it
difficult for a patient who is not doing well on an abstinence
program to change to methadone-he may leave treatment entirely
rather than accept what be and his peers view as a demotion. If
such an attitude does not pervade the project, the reverse
problem may occur: The abstinent patient may not see why he
should endure drug hunger while others are receiving methadone. </p>

<p>In this view, faith is a very important part of every
modality. The evangelical nature of the TC has been discussed,
for example, and it may be a necessary part of the therapy. Part
of the success with methadone may be due to the fact that
patients come to believe that they have a metabolic disease and
are going to receive a medicine that will help them. In short,
mixing different modalities may undermine all of them by
confusing the patient about the expectations and possibilities of
the program. </p>

<p>Resolution of this issue must await further research that
explicitly compares the success of the different components of
multimodal programs with that of comparable techniques used
alone. </p>

<p>Since multimodality is a growing trend, such evaluations
should be performed soon.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><i>HEROIN MAINTENANCE <br>
</i></p>

<p>One treatment modality that is not used in the United States
at present is maintenance of addicts on heroin or morphine. While
many, perhaps most, observers react negatively to the idea, there
are good reasons for trying it on an experimental basis. The
major argument in favor is that heroin maintenance might attract
two important groups of addicts: those who do not succeed on
methadone maintenance and those who do not volunteer for it in
the first place. If this were the result, addiction-related crime
would be decreased, because the costs of the heroin habit would
be eliminated and, as a benefit to the addict, the chances of
infection, overdose, and imprisonment would be lessened. In
addition, since remarkably little is known about the etiology of
addiction or the effects of heroin, controlled clinical
experimentation with heroin maintenance would allow some
important questions to be studied. It is also possible that
heroin maintenance would break the market for heroin and remove
the impetus for expansion caused by the high profits of illegal
distribution. (The English experience, described by Edgar May in
Staff Paper 7, is, of course, instructive.) </p>

<p>The most important objections to heroin maintenance are as
follows: </p>

<p>The administrative expenses would be high. If the drug were
administered in clinics, it would have to be made available about
four times a day. Also, because heroin is relatively ineffective
orally, medical personnel might be required to give injections to
ensure a sterilized procedure. Both factors would increase
expenses. If the English system were adopted and the heroin were
dispensed from pharmacies on prescription, it would be difficult
to control the dosages, track the patients, secure the heroin,
and avoid infection and disease. Because of heroin's sharp peaks
and short duration of action, it may be a difficult drug on which
to find and maintain a constant dosage even if the patient
desires stabilization. There is always physical pressure on the
patient to increase his dosage. To make this problem worse, a
maintenance program would draw addicts who were not willing to
give up the effort to attain the euphoria of heroin. Thus, they
might take their maintenance dose, buy more on the street, and
then demand that the clinics maintain the new, higher dosage.
While there may be a pharmacological ceiling beyond which the
drug has no additional euphoric effects, this is not definitely
known. Addicts on heroin maintenance might quickly reach levels
of 100 to 200 mg. of heroin per day, a dose higher than that of
almost all present addicts. The physical effects of this dosage
are not known. Many members of the black community would oppose
heroin maintenance, interpreting it as a scheme to keep the black
community tranquilized and quiet or as an indication that society
is concerned only with the crime caused by addiction, not with
the addicts themselves. Still others, who believe that continuing
use of heroin causes long-term organic damage, might regard
heroin maintenance as a form of mass murder. </p>

<p>The high doses that would tend to prevail in such a program
would tranquilize addicts and make them function ineffectively.
This would make rehabilitation efforts impossible. </p>

<p>Heroin maintenance might draw patients away from methadone,
thus transferring them from a program with proved effectiveness
for rehabilitation to one that is probably counterproductive in
terms of reformation of the addict's life-style. </p>

<p>The existence of heroin maintenance would remove an important
deterrent to experimentation with heroin-the obvious degradation
of the addicted life. </p>

<p>These objections have force. It seems doubtful that society
would wish to move to a large-scale heroin-maintenance program at
the present time, especially if doing so would undercut
methadone. However, there are limitations on the effectiveness of
methadone and on the extent to which it can eliminate the
addiction problem. If, for example, only 50 per cent of the
addicts are helped by methadone, the country may be left with a
sizable addiction problem even after methadone has reached its
full potential. Despite the problems, it is likely that heroin
maintenance will begin to receive serious consideration. It would
be wise to start accumulating solid knowledge on its workings and
effects, and on the validity of the objections to it, before
proposals for large scale programs make the matter urgent. There
will not be time to do so afterwards. Careful experimentation is
desirable.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><i>TREATMENT OF USERS OF NONOPIATES <br>
</i></p>

<p>Treatment of users of the amphetamines, barbiturates,
hallucinogens, and cannabinols has two distinct aspects. The
first is (,crisis intervention&quot;-emergency assistance to
those who are suffering from adverse effects of drugs. The second
consists of longterm programs designed to prevent future drug
use.<br>
</p>

<p>CRISIS INTERVENTION <br>
</p>

<p>Overdoses of opiates and barbiturates constitute a medical
emergency, and death results unless steps are taken
quickly.&quot;' For other drugs, the adverse effects are more
psychological than physical-usually the user is having a severe
mental disturbance as a result of the drug and needs
psychological support until the body clears the drug from the
system.&quot;' </p>

<p>Until recently, users of nonopiates suffering from adverse
effects of drug taking had nowhere to go except hospital
emergency rooms. Most users were reluctant to do this, both
because hospitals often felt compelled to report the illegal drug
user to the authorities, and because emergency-room personnel
treated them demeaningly. In addition, drug users came to believe
that the treatment received in hospitals was not very helpful. In
fact, the reaction of the medical personnel tended to intensify
and prolong the user's own panic. In the words of one observer,
&quot;Modern medical science can keep a panic reaction going for
about five days.&quot; The hospital use of strong tranquilizers
is regarded by experienced drug users and drug-treatment doctors
as unnecessary and possibly damaging. Chlorpromazine, the usual
drug given, has strong side effects... and is unpleasant in its
psychoactive characteristics.&quot;' </p>

<p>Free clinics, manned by interested professionals, experienced
youths, and volunteer doctors, have sprung up in many cities. The
Haight-Ashbury Clinic in San Francisco seems to have been the
prototype. The Langly Porter Youth Drug Unit at the University of
California is another. It is not known how many there now are,
but it is probable that every large city has at least one, some
have several, and the movement is spreading rapidly to suburban
communities. </p>

<p>The treatment provided to drug users on a &quot;bad trip&quot;
consists primarily of &quot;talking down&quot; the patient, which
can be done by peers who have had similar experiences.
&quot;Quiet rooms&quot; for such &quot;talk downs&quot; have been
recommended as a component for all emergency medical centers that
treat youthful drug users. The patient is not left alone and is
constantly reassured about who he is and where he is.
Establishment of verbal contact with the patient is recommended,
and there is little or no use of tranquilizers. When
tranquilizers are used, chlorpromazine is the most common, given
either orally or, preferably, intramuscularly, which avoids
adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. Experimentation is going on
using short-term barbiturates instead. As of 1970, the Berkeley
Free Clinic claimed to have given only three tranquilizing
injections to &quot;freakouts&quot; since the clinic began; the
rest were talked down. </p>

<p>Heavy amphetamine users and barbiturate addicts present
different detoxification problems. The barbiturate addict needs
to be withdrawn from his addiction under a carefully supervised
medical regimen in an inpatient hospital setting, for the
withdrawal process itself is life-threatening.&quot;' Heavy
amphetamine users are apt to suffer from paranoia, sometimes
leading to violence; they need a quiet recovery room away from
strangers whom they may consider enemies. They often shy away
from hospitalization for fear of arrest. </p>

<p>Treating soft-drug users for adverse reactions is an important
health measure to prevent possible deaths, suicides, or bizarre
and self-destructive behavior. Since most facilities that perform
this service do not have a follow-up capacity, there is no way of
telling how many patients return to drug use and how many abandon
it after experiencing adverse reactions. The treatment process
itself is not concerned with abstinence but with the immediate
problem. Many of the patients seen in these clinics are only
occasional experimenters or sporadic-users. </p>

<p>Before the drug legislation of 1970, there was no basis for
federal funding of these crisis clinics. The law now provides
that HEW can make grants for such partial services to drug users.
Some of the clinics are not enthusiastic about federal backing,
fearing that it will lead to greater conformity in approach and a
decreased ability to utilize ex-drug users in new roles. Federal
or state governments might also impose bureaucratic standards on
staff training and facilities without contributing enough money
to meet the costs of these requirements. There is also a fear
that government backing will turn away some clients. <br>
</p>

<p>LONG-TERM THERAPY <br>
</p>

<p>While the crisis centers provide necessary emergency services,
it is unlikely that they have much permanent impact on drug
users. There is therefore a movement to expand the centers to
include programs that will have some effect on the drug-using
behavior of patients. As a result, the crisis centers are
beginning to offer long-term therapeutic help as well as
emergency services. </p>

<p>This expansion is not limited to the treatment of drug users.
Most clinic staff members view drug problems as only one aspect
-and not always the most serious-of human malfunctioning for
which help should be provided. For example, the Center for
Special Social and Health Problems in San Francisco, according to
its descriptive materials, is concerned with drug abuse, sexual
problems, violence and hatred, compulsive gambling, suicide,
management of death and dying, crime and delinquency, inability
to manage finances, obesity, and insomnia. While this list is
more ambitious than most, it illustrates the general trend
toward, broadening the scope of the crisis clinic. In a way,
these organizations are becoming privately run community
mental-health centers. </p>

<p>The techniques and operations of these programs are about the
same as those of the therapeutic communities and outpatient
abstinence programs. Since, at present, there is no chemotherapy
for soft-drug use, no treatment comparable to the methadone
movement is possible. The basic problem with nonaddictive soft
drugs is that continued use reflects the user's desire to keep
taking them or a psychological dependence on them, which can be
even more difficult to deal with than a physical craving. As one
study points out, &quot;Student drug users are, as a group,
knowledgeable about the undesirable effects of drug abuse. In
general, it is not difficult for most student drug abusers to
stop. The issue is to get them to want <font size="1">to
Stop.11113</font> </p>

<p>While some soft-drug users are in TC's, the majority of those
receiving help are in some form of outpatient program, usually
the same programs described in the section on outpatient
abstinence for opiate users. Often, the patients themselves are
the same. A number of heroin addicts use other drugs as well, and
youthful drug users are increasingly experimenting with heroin as
one of several drugs they try. Whether it is possible to sustain
a pattern of sporadic heroin use without becoming addicted is as
yet uncertain. The &quot;speed culture&quot; in the
Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco has produced some
evidence that speed users, who first use barbiturates to ease the
&quot;crash,&quot; soon learn that heroin is an even smoother way
to achieve this purpose. Eventually they may abandon speed
entirely and become heroin addicts. It is possible that a pattern
of multiple drug use that includes heroin is an intermediate step
toward full addiction.&quot;' It is even more difficult to
determine the success of these programs with soft-drug users than
with narcotics addicts, in part because most experts believe that
youths who become heavily involved with cannabis and
hallucinogens do not usually stay involved for a long period of
time.&quot;' This fact, of course, increases the difficulty of
evaluating the impact of any drug program, because abstinence is
a poor indication of the program's effect. </p>

<p>Some work is going on in the area of chemotherapy. An effort
is now being made to find antagonists to some of the more common
drugs. Researchers tentatively claim to have found a drug that is
an antagonist to amphetamines, although it has not yet been fully
tested, and some work is being done on antagonists to LSD.
However, it is not clear whether these drugs, when and if they
are perfected, will have a significant impact on drug use, since
soft drugs are taken without the spur of physical necessity.
Unless a policy of forced implantation is followed, the drug user
will always have a choice about taking the antagonist, and in
most cases the choice would probably be to continue drug use. </p>

<p>There are, however, two hypotheses under which the antagonists
might be useful. The amphetamines appear to be physically
addictive to a limited extent, and this could exert some pressure
on the amphetamine user to continue his use.&quot;' An antagonist
might prevent the constant renewal of this physical dependence
and give the user's body a chance to become free of it. Secondly,
if one adopts a conditioning theory of drug use, an antagonist
would eliminate the reinforcing effect of gratification from drug
use and might in time extinguish the conditioned response of
taking drugs. </p>

<p>One of the most carefully evaluated methods of decreasing soft
drug use is transcendental meditation. A Harvard Medical School
Study gave questionnaires to 1,950 subjects who had been
practicing transcendental meditation for three months or more. Of
these, 1,862 completed the questionnaire. The decrease in drug
use was quite striking. The study says: </p>

<p>Following the start of the practice of transcendental
meditation, there was a marked decrease in the number of drug
abusers for all drug categories. . . . As the practice of
meditation continued, the subjects progressively decreased their
drug abuse until after practicing 21 months of meditation most
subjects had completely stopped abusing drugs. For example, in
the 6-month period before starting the practice of meditation,
about 80 percent of the subjects used marijuana and of those
about 28 percent were heavy users. Aftel practicing
transcendental meditation 6 months, 37 percent used marijuana and
of those only 6.5 percent were heavy users. After 21 months of
the practice, only 12 percent continued to use marijuana and of
those most were light users; only one individual was a heavy
user. The decrease in abuse of LSD was even more marked. Before
starting the practice of transcendental meditation, 48 percent of
the subjects had used LSD, and of these subjects about 14 percent
were heavy users. In the 3 months following the start of the
practice of meditation, 1 1 percent of the subjects took LSD
while after 21 months of the practice only 3 percent took LSD.
The increase in the number of non-users after starting the
practice of meditation was similar for the other drugs: non-users
of the other hallucinogens after 21 months of the practice rose
from 61 to 96 percent; for the narcotics, from 83 to 99 percent;
for the amphetamines, from 70 to 99 percent; and for the
barbiturates, from 83 to 99 percent.117 </p>

<p>As the researchers point out, these correlations are not proof
of causation. &quot;Involvement in other kinds of
self-improvement activities may also lead to decreased drug
abuse. The motivation to start meditation may have influenced the
subjects to stop drug abuse. The subjects in the present study
may have spontaneously stopped, continued, or increased taking
drugs independently of transcendental meditation.&quot;&quot;' </p>

<p>Despite these necessary caveats, the results are striking,
especially in an area in which, as the study delicately points
out, &quot;Existing programs for the alleviation of
[non-narcotic] drug abuse usually involve education as to the
dangers of the effects of drugs and sometimes provide personal
counseling or psychiatric care. The efficiency of these programs
has yet to be established.&quot;' (Staff Paper 6<b>, </b>by Dr.
Andrew Weil, deals with meditation and other nonchernical means
of achieving altered stages of consciousness.) <br>

<hr>

<p><i>CONCLUSION<br>
</i></p>

<p>Few solid conclusions emerge from this morass of conflicting
information. It is clear that methadone is a helpful treatment
modality, but just how helpful is not yet known. It is equally
clear that its almost inevitable expansion will create new
problems, some of them predictable and some of them totally
unexpected. Not much can be said about the other treatment
modalities and concepts. Those who favor them have not yet proved
their case, but neither have those who are skeptical. On the
whole, it seems probable that they will turn out to have only
marginal effectiveness as drug-treatment methods, although they
may have possibilities as a part of the more general
human-potential movement. The basic problem is that we lack any
solid theory or understanding of the nature and causes of
addiction. As researchers have repeatedly pointed out, for most
drug users the drugs are functional and adaptive mechanisms.
Society cannot make long-term progress toward developing more
effective treatment mechanisms without grasping and accepting
this fact. At present, however, we have little choice but to
proceed empirically.<br>

addict receives about as much rehabilitation as the criminal
prisoner with about as much result-the recidivist rate for
addicts is much higher than for criminals. Moreover the
rehabilitation centers are run like prisons. There are guards,
most of whom receive training for prison work-one guard for every
two inmates, recalcitrant addicts are beaten and placed in
isolation on reduced diets; inmates are sexually abused; there is
no separation of the young from the old. The few rehabilitation
programs that do exist are staffed by instructors and therapists
who have received little or no training. For the 5,000 or so
inmates in the 14 separate institutions there are only 4
psychiatrists, 16 psychologists, and 78 teachers and vocational
instructors. The prison-like atmosphere has caused a large
percentage of the addicts to try to escape. [Health Policy

But, at the Second National Methadone Maintenance Conference, Dr.
Dole was asked: &quot;Apart from any psychological factors or
emotional factors, is there a metabolic irregularity which causes
a craving for drugs in the first place or does the metabolic
irregularity come after the use of drugs or both?&quot; His
response was: &quot;This is a very important question for which I
have no adequate answer. I can only guess. My opinion is that a
heavy exposure to heroin induces the metabolic changes. According
to this theory, the abnormal drug craving in man, like the
induced drug seeking behavior in animals, is a result of exposure
to narcotic drugs and not the original cause of the
addiction.&quot; <i>Second Meth. Conf., pp. </i>359, 370.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">65. Dr. Dole seems to lean toward the idea that

<p align="center"><font size="5">The Economics of Heroin </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Production * Policy Options: What Can Be Done *
Distribution * Consumption<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This paper applies economic analysis to the
heroin market and to the effect of alternative government
policies on this market. The principal concern is supply, but
some discussion of demand is included because the effects of
public policy on the supply of drugs cannot be adequately
analyzed without some knowledge of the effect on demand of
changes in price, risk, and availability. The analysis must be
considered tentative. Accurate information on the economic
aspects of all drugs of abuse is scarce, that which exists is
frequently unreliable, and conclusions are often suspect. This
paper is no exception.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Much of the data used were taken from two
studies: (1) <i>The World Opium Situation </i>(October, 1970), by
the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) Intelligence
Staff; and (2) <i>Economics of Heroin Distribution </i>(1970), by
Mark Moore. While these papers contain the most extensive
economic research available in this area, the information is not
unimpeachable. This is not because of deficiencies in the
studies-which are excellent -but because of the inherent
difficulty of gathering accurate information on illegal
enterprises or consumers of illegal commodities.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The BNDD staff paper is the result of an
extensive survey of opium production and consumption throughout
the world. The paper provides considerably more data, in terms of
both quantity and quality, than are available from the United
Nations or from other publications. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to verify this information through other sources, nor
does it appear that it will be possible to do so in the near
future.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Moore paper provides a macroeconomic
analysis of the heroin distribution system, as well as
considerable interview data on daily expenditures of addicts and
sources of funds. The data are not derived from sufficiently
large samples to allow precise estimates, but they do indicate
rough orders of magnitude. Other data derived from interviews
with BNDD staff members or U.N. publications are subject to the
same general weaknesses. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>PRODUCTION<br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">SOURCES OF SUPPLY <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The production and distribution of opiate
narcotics at the international level are complex and
little-understood matters. The crisis of heroin addiction that
has afflicted the United States in recent years has obscured the
fact that the growing of opium is an age-old, legal occupation in
many areas of the world. Heroin addicts in the United States
consume only a very small amount of the total quantity of opiates
produced worldwide. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
estimates that 10,000 to 12,000 pounds of heroin are sufficient
to supply the entire addict population in the United States for
one year.' Since, as is generally acknowledged, ten pounds of
opium are required to manufacture one pound of heroin, only
100,000 to 120,000 pounds of opium are needed for illicit heroin
use in the United States about 2 per cent of the estimated world
production </font><font size="1">.2</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Of the opium used by the U.S. heroin market, 80
per cent comes from Turkey, 15 per cent from Mexico, and 5 per
cent from the Far East.' These are not precise figures, however,
but assumptions rather generally derived from heroin seizures and
knowledge of the international illicit drug-import routes.'
Moreover, several recent developments may change the sources of
supply for the U.S. market. On June 30. 1971, President Cevdet
Sunay of Turkey decreed that all poppy cultivation and opium
production in that country will be forbidden beginning in the
fall of 1972. Until that time, licit opium production will be
limited to only four provinces and strictly policed. How well
this policy will be enforced, and what ultimate effect it will
have on heroin use in the United States, cannot as yet be
determined. However, already there has been considerable
speculation that the Far East supplies a greater amount than was
thought previously. The tighter controls now being imposed by
Turkey and the increased contacts between the U.S. and Southeast
Asia caused by the Indo-China War have shifted the sources of
supply somewhat.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Raw opium itself is produced from the poppy
plant <i>(papaver somniferum-the </i>sleep-bearing poppy), which
consists of a thin main stalk, three to four feet tall, with
several egg-shaped pods on top. Between June and July, the poppy
blooms, and, 10 days later, when the blossoms lose their petals,
the pods are ready for the opium resin to be extracted. Incisions
are made in the pods, and a milky fluid oozes out. At the end of
the day, this substance is scraped off the pods by hand. It later
hardens into a brown gum and is pressed into cakes of raw opium.
The amount of opium produced from a poppy crop will increase if
this process is repeated once again, as in Turkey, or several
times, as in India, but the morphine content will be reduced with
each lancing.'</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many factors affect the opium yield per
acre-the quality of the soil, the temperature, rainfall, the
quality of the seedirriga-tion, fertilization, and crop rotation.
Intensive cultivation and a great deal of labor are required to
produce opium, particularly during harvest, when the pods must be
incised and the raw opium collected by hand, but labor is also
needed during the growing season to thin the poppy plants. It is
estimated that between 175 and 250 man-hours of labor are
required to produce 1 kilo of opium.6 Because of this
labor-intensive production process, poppies tend to be raised
only where labor is abundant and relatively inexpensive; but
there seems no clear reason, given a different set of relative
prices for labor and capital, that a more capital-intensive
process could not be employed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most poppy cultivation occurs in a zone
stretching from central Turkey through Iran, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, India, Burma, Laos, Thailand, and southern China, with
the greatest concentration in India and Southeast Asia. Poppy
cultivation is legal in India, Turkey, the U.S.S.R., and Iran.
Turkish licit poppy acreage was reported to be 29,600 acres in
1970.1 According to U.N. figures, India has at least 86,500 acres
planted.' Iran, which abolished the production of opium from 1956
to 1968, planned 29,600 acres of poppy cultivation for 1970. In
addition, roughly 30,000-32,000 acres each are believed to be
planted in the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and
negligible amounts of licit opium are produced in Yugoslavia and
Japan.'</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">According to figures reported to the United
Nations by producing countries, the total licit world production
of opium is 1,0601,085 metric tons, or approximately 40-45 per
cent of the total produced. India is by far the world's largest
licit producer of opium, with a reported 750 metric tons in 1968.
Turkey and the U.S.S.R. each contribute 115-120 metric tons of
licit production. An estimate of 75-100 metric tons was made for
Communist China, based on expected medicinal needs for its
population. The estimated totals for licit and illicit production
are presented in Table 4-1.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Licit opium is used primarily in the
manufacture of medicinal opiates. Legal morphine production
currently amounts to approximately 150 metric tons per year-a
substantial rise from around 85 metric tons per year in the
mid-1950's. This growth is due chiefly to the rising demand for
codeine, but a small portion of the licit opium is used for
opium-maintenance programs in India, Pakistan, and Iran.<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00005.gif" align="bottom" width="1294"
height="1119"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The world's illicit production of opium is
estimated at 1,2501,400 metric tons annually.10 The principal
concentration of illicit production is in the Burma-Laos-Thailand
region, which <br>
</font><font size="1">produces an estimated 700-750 tons. The
Afghanistan-Pakistan area produces another 250-300 tons of
illicit opium, and </font><font size="2">the </font><font
size="1">illicit output of Turkey is estimated at 100 tons.
Illicit cultivation of the plant also occurs in parts of Mexico,
South </font><font size="2">America, and North Africa, although
the amounts produced there are negligible. While some illegal
acreage is planted in Turkey, most of the illicit opium there is
diverted from the yield on legal acreage. On the other hand, all
the opium produced in Afghanistan, Burma, Laos, and Thailand and
part of the outputs of India and Pakistan are derived from
illegal acreage. About 40 metric tons of illicit Turkish
production was thought to enter Iran in 1970; the remainder is
exported to Western Europe and the United States.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Southeast Asian countries consume most of
their own opium, but some is shipped to Hong Kong for use there
and for distribution throughout the Far East. A small amount,
perhaps one or two metric tons, is shipped to the United States,
although this figure has probably risen recently. India also
consumes the major part of its illicit production; and, although
some of the Afghanistan-Pakistan production is consumed
internally, approximately 200 metric tons is thought to enter
Iran. Iran is the largest consumer of illicit opium in the world,
with an estimated 350,000 opium and heroin users. In 1969, Iran
began controlled production of opium in order to maintain its own
addicts.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>YIELDS, MARKET PRICES, AND
INCOMES<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Income from poppy cultivation is affected by
the opium yield obtained, the morphine content of the raw opium,
and the current licit and illicit market prices. The reported
yields per acre in 1969 for four countries are presented in Table
4-2, but, since these are government figures provided by the
local farmers, both yields and acreage are probably understated.
This is undoubtedly the case for the crop yields in Turkey and
Pakistan. Turkish yields are closer to 13.4-14.2 pounds per acre,
with the nonreported amount diverted to illicit traders.&quot;
Opium yields are estimated at 8.6-28.6 pounds per acre in
Southeast Asia&quot; (probably closer to the lower figure&quot;),
and the Soviet Union reports yields of 27.5-32 pounds per
acre.&quot;<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00006.gif" align="bottom" width="1290"
height="592"><font size="1"><b> <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Prices for opium vary with quality. The
morphine content of Turkish opium, reportedly the highest in the
world, varies from 9 to 13 per cent, while in other producing
countries the morphine content varies from 4 to 12 per cent.
Prices to farmers for raw opium are presented in Table 4-3.
Because of its quality, the prices for Turkish opium are the
highest, with the exception of the Iranian price, which is
supported by the government in order to discourage diversion to
illicit traders. The licit prices are determined by the world
market price: the price at which the national opium monopolies
can sell to pharmaceutical companies. In Turkey, the illicit
price varies with the yield of the current year's harvest, the
season, enforcement efforts, and the demand for Turkish opium
from other countries, particularly Iran. The illicit price in
Iran is extremely high because of the strict enforcement of laws
against illicit trading.<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00007.gif" align="bottom" width="1299"
height="657"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The absolute income per farm from opium
cultivation is greatest in Turkey, but the percentage of total
farm income accounted for by opium increases as one moves
eastward. In the late 1960's, there were an estimated 70,000
farms producing opium in Turkey. If 120 tons are sold by these
farms at the licit price of $11 per kilo 0 kilo=2.2046 pounds)
and 100 tons on the illicit market at $25 per kilo, the gross
income from opium amounts to $3,820,000, or $55 per farm. This
amounts to roughly 5-10 per cent of farm income in Turkey. In
India, roughly 200,000 farms earn $70-75 from poppy cultivation,
or 15-20 per cent of average total income per farm. Since the
income figures include income-in-kind (food, clothing produced on
farm), the income from opium provides an even higher percentage
of cash income than we have indicated. Opium is probably the
principal source of farm income in Burma, Laos, and Thailand;
cultivation is said to be concentrated in areas controlled by<b> </b>guerrilla
insurgents, who transport much of the output to Hong Kong and use
the proceeds for arms purchases.','</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Licit production of opium is of minor
importance even in India and Turkey. India earned roughly $6-7
million for exports of 530 metric tons in 1968, compared with
total export earnings of $2 billion. Indian farmers earned
approximately $7.7 million on production of 700 metric tons.
Turkish exports of 120 metric tons yield approximately $1.7
million, less than 0.3 per cent of total exports. Turkish
production is also very small in relation to national income of
$9 billion. On the other hand, opium sales are undoubtedly of
great economic importance to the producing regions of Burma,
Laos, and Thailand. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>POLICY OPTIONS: WHAT CAN BE DONE<br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Policies designed to attack the heroin problem
at the source of supply devolve into two basic alternatives: (1)
the purchase of entire opium crops, or (2) direct controls on
production. Each of these proposals has problems difficult to
surmount at present.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">PRE-EMPTIVE BUYING <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The first alternative would be for the United
States to purchase the total output of opium from those countries
that supply the heroin entering its borders. The administrative
simplicity of this proposal makes it appear deceptively
attractive. In time, however, pre-emptive buying would
necessarily involve purchases of both licit and illicit
production in all countries where opium is currently grown. The
U.S. offer price would have to be raised above the maximum price
illicit traders are willing to pay; otherwise, the farmer would
have an incentive to sell to the higher bidder. If the offer
price is less than the illicit price, leakages into the illicit
market would probably result, and the policy would therefore have
little effect on the supply of opiates sent to the United States,
especially since the amount is so small relative to total world
production. And, seemingly, the illicit trader would be willing
to increase his offer price substantially, because, given the
large markups at each stage of the distribution system, the price
of raw opium has relatively little effect on the ultimate retail
price in the United States (see Table 4-4). (For example, if the
current price to the farmer for 10 kilos of illicit opium is
$250, and the retail street price for I kilo of heroin is
$264,900, then raising the farm price 100 per cent would raise
the retail price only .09 per cent.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A pre-emptive buying policy would become very
costly, because opium producers would have a clear incentive to
increase their outputs, and other farmers would have a similar
incentive to begin substituting opium for other crops. Eugene
Rossides, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement and
Operations, has gone on record as strongly opposing any concept
of pre-emptive buying. He told a congressional committee that
&quot;it would simply stimulate production and it would take away
the responsibility of each nation to handle the problem as part
of the international community.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Moreover, without strict administrative
controls, this policy would not only increase production in all
countries currently producing opium but might induce other
countries whose climate is suitable to begin production in the
hope of sharing in the windfall.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If this policy were directed at only one source
of supply, such as Turkey, it would not prevent traders from
obtaining illicit supplies in other producing countries. The
100,000-120,000 pounds of opium used by the U.S. market could be
grown in an area of, at most, 11.2-23.2 square miles and thus
could easily be absorbed in another producing region.&quot; In
fact, some experts believe that 35 pounds of opium could be
produced on a single acre of land if a capital-intensive process
were employed under controlled circumstances. -If this proved
true, -generally, only 4.55.4 square miles would be needed to
supply the entire U.S. market. Consequently, a pre-emptive buying
policy, in the long run, could result in a change of location for
the source of U.S. supply with little or no effect on the
addiction problem.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Pre-emptive buying within an individual country
might prove effective in dealing with an internal addiction
problem if coupled with strict limitations on acreage and illicit
importation. Iran, for example, has discouraged export to illicit
markets in other countries by purchasing its entire internal
opium crop at a very high price, restricting production to
certain designated areas, and strictly enforcing its laws against
illicit markets. The legal opium purchased by the government is
used by the state-run addict maintenance program, in which 50,000
individuals are registered. The potential expense is one problem
with the high-support-price approach. If nearly all Iran's
300,000-400,000 users and addicts entered the program, the cost
would rise dramatically. Furthermore, even with severe penalties
against smuggling and illicit trading, Iran still experiences
difficulty in trying to prevent the importation of opiates. Some
success has been reported in eliminating illicit supplies from
Turkey, but imports from Afghanistan and Pakistan have not been
halted. The mid-1970 price in Iran for Afghani opium was well
below the licit price, despite intensive law-enforcement efforts.
It seems that the heavily armed mountain tribes operating out of
both Afghanistan and Pakistan have not as yet been deterred by
either the border authorities or the death penalty on smuggling.
On the other hand, the price of illicit Turkish opium in 1970 was
as high as $400 per kilo in Tehran-six to seven times the
government support price.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As the Iranian example shows, the success of a
pre-emptive buying policy, even if accompanied by administrative
controls, depends on whether government can effectively exert its
will over the producing regions. In fact, most of the world's
opium supply is produced in areas where little political control
exists. Administrative controls themselves are difficult to
enforce, as we shall see. Therefore, because of the size of the
world market relative to U.S. heroin consumption, the high
elasticity of supply, and the difficulty of control, it is
unlikely that a policy of pre-emptive buying could be successful.
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">DIRECT CONTROLS</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The application of administrative controls
alone is the other basic alternative to reduce opium supplies.
This involves restricting the acreage on which opium can be grown
and maintaining a low official price. A low official price may
reduce the illicit price, at least in the short run, and thereby
discourage illegal planting and crop diversion. Certainly, taken
by itself, a low official price will not induce new production.
But the most salient feature of direct controls is increasing the
risks of illicit trading and consequently reducing the
profitability.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Practically, however, continuous enforcement of
direct controls is both difficult and costly, and the necessary
resources available to most producing countries are quite
limited. Especially in countries with weak central governments,
controls present severe administrative problems. All countries
with an illicit trade lack adequate numbers of both trained law
enforcement personnel and motor vehicles. Given the low wages in
public-service jobs and the large profits in the opium trade,
corruption of government and police officials is a widespread
problem in most countries and is likely to continue. The bribes
that illegal importers are willing and able to pay are
considerably higher than the amounts officials are currently
accepting for inaction or nonenforcement of the law. Widespread
social acceptance of opium use in many rural areas of Pakistan,
Afghanistan, India, Burma, Laos, and Thailand is another
difficulty that makes enforcement of controls for the benefit of
an outside country appear especially burdensome. In Turkey, where
there is reportedly little opium use, controls have been
extremely unpopular because of both the loss of an important
source of farm income and the rising anti-American sentiment.
While limitations on local financial resources could presumably
be eased by American aid, the administrative and political
difficulties severely limit the possibility of successful
controls.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If, however, the desire and resources to do so
were present, controls could probably be applied successfully in
certain individual countries. Communist China and Iran
successfully eliminated production in the 1950's. Turkey has
restricted legal acreage of poppy cultivation to 29,652 acres
from 103,782 acres in 1960. In the process, illegal production
may have been somewhat reduced, because illicit Turkish opium is
believed to come principally from larger than declared yields on
legal acreage.&quot; Turkish officials seem committed to their
pledge to enforce a ban on all poppy cultivation by the fall of
1972. The chances of this policy's success will be discussed
later.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The major problem in curtailing opium
production is that most of the world's supply is produced in
areas where no national control exists. The lack of control is
virtually complete in the producing regions of Burma, Laos, and
Thailand. Areas that are largely controlled by tribal groups are
responsible for opium production and distribution in Pakistan and
Afghanistan. Therefore, it seems likely that attempts to control
or abolish opium production in Turkey would have little effect,
as illicit traders turned to these areas for supplies. Indeed,
the recent changes in Turkey do not seem to have caused any
decrease in total U.S. imports of illegal opiates.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Still another difficulty is that of restricting
opium production in one country when neighboring countries do
not, or cannot, restrict production. After twelve years of
prohibition, Iran returned to limited production, because its
addicts were purchasing illicit opium from Turkey, Pakistan, and
Afghanistan.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Even in Turkey and India, control systems have
failed to halt the cultivation of illicit opium. Turkish farmers
make written declarations to the government of their licensed
acreage and expected kilogram yields, selling the surplus to the
illicit market. In 1969, for example, Turkish officials collected
116 tons of licit opium from poppies in eleven provinces. But in
1970, when nine provinces were allowed to produce, only 60 tons
were turned in. Presumably diversion accounts for some of the
difference. Some illicit production in Turkey has occurred from
unlicensed acreage, but this is relatively easy to discover if
sufficient efforts are made, since the poppies have a long
growing season and are easy to detect, especially from the air.
In India, on the other hand, the illicit opium output is produced
principally on unlicensed acreage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Direct controls might be more effective if they
were combined with crop substitution, subsidies for production of
other goods, or direct payments for not growing poppies. But crop
substitution is unlikely to be successful, since it is difficult,
if not impossible, to find crops that yield as high a return per
unit of land as opium. For example, attempts to substitute a
high-yielding Mexican wheat in Pakistan failed because the crop
provided a return per acre roughly half that of opium, assuming
opium is sold at official prices.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In Turkey, there has been a sound agricultural
reason that crop substitution is difficult. Apart from
low-income-producing grains, the poppy is the only autumn-sown
crop and is not easily replaceable by the higher-yielding spring
crops, such as cotton, maize, sugar beets, tobacco, or melons.
The opium produced is important to the small farmer, not only
because of the amount of income gained, but also because it is
harvested before the grain and therefore provides expense money
for the main harvest. Furthermore, the harvest of opium occurs in
a period when the farmer has little else to do and can spend his
time on the lancing of the poppies and collection of the opium.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Subsidies for production of alternative crops
would certainly be required if the substitute crops provided less
income than opium. The cost of producing a unit of a substitute
crop would be reduced by a subsidy, and the transfer payment from
the government would allow the grower to increase production and,
in the process, bid resources, land, and labor away from other
crops, including opium. Because these inputs would become more
expensive, the cost per unit of producing opium would increase.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">However, if demand for opium in this particular
national black market is relatively insensitive to changes in
price, opium production would be little reduced, and little
reduction in farmer income would result. A higher subsidy would
be necessary to raise the relative return on the alternative
crop. If the demand for opium varies with price,&quot; perhaps
because of the availability of opium from other sources or
synthetic opiates, then the subsidy would probably reduce much of
the country's production.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Clearly, subsidies for output of other goods
could be set high enough so that the output of opium in a given
country could be greatly reduced. This may come, however, only at
great expense to the government or to the United States, if the
latter sponsors the program. The same types of administrative
problems that exist in the crop-purchase proposal are repeated
here.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Basically, it may be difficult to determine how
much of the production of the subsidized crop is actually land
diverted from opium.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Similar administrative problems would result if
governments made payments to producers for not growing opium,
since it would be difficult to determine how many farmers who do
not grow opium now would demand payment. In 1972, when Turkey's
complete prohibition on poppy cultivation goes into effect, the
government plans to pay farmers on the basis of the value on the
international market of their whole opium crop sold the previous
year to state officials. But, if only those who were originally
&quot;licensed&quot; to produce are given payments, and no
payments go to those who planted illegal acreage, there is no
incentive for these growers to cease producing opium, nor is
there an incentive for nongrowers to resist the urge to produce.
Furthermore, to be effective, payments must exceed the return on
output sold illegally. Since the illicit price of opium is
extremely low relative to the retail price of heroin in the
United States, it could rise greatly without much effect on the
final price to the addict. Therefore, payments would have to be
extremely high to be effective and would make the program very
costly. Thus, it also seems unlikely that a policy of direct
controls on opium production, even if combined with crop
substitution, subsidies for production of other goods, or direct
payments for not growing opium, could be completely successful.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">General economic development in poppy-growing
areas may eventually reduce the relative profitability of this
crop. The usual process is for technological innovations in
agriculture to increase the productivity of fanns to the point
where large surpluses of labor develop. Migration of labor to the
cities occurs because of the availability of employment and
public services. As industrial development increases the demand
for labor, real wages rise, and capital-intensive production
processes become more desirable. If no capital-intensive method
of cultivating opium can be found, then the return on poppy falls
relative to other goods and opium cultivation is greatly reduced.
Clearly, this ignores changes in the demand for opium; moreover,
it is, at best, a long-run solution. This situation may
eventually develop in Turkey but is not likely for a very long
time in the East. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>DISTRIBUTION<br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Several books and articles have described the
system ky which opium is transformed into heroin and imported
into the United States. They are all in substantial agreement,
possibly because the primary source of information on the subject
is the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the case of Turkish opium, growers either
withhold part of their output or plant illegal acreage.
Small-scale entrepreneurs gather opium from the farms in
relatively small quantities and deliver it to syndicates in or
near Istanbul. At this point, the opium is transformed into
morphine, which cuts the volume by 90 per cent. This process
formerly took place in Syria. but as relations between Syria and
Turkey have deteriorated in recent years, border controls have
been tightened and the morphine labs moved to the Istanbul area.
From Istanbul, the morphine is transported overland through
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia or by ship to its destination in southern
France, where covert laboratories refine the morphine into
heroin. (One theory is that some of the heroin labs are located
in trucks and are thus mobile and difficult to detect.) Once
refined, the heroin is smuggled to the United States through New
York, Montreal, or some other large port. According to some
sources, shipments are also being sent to the U.S. via South
America through a Southern port.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">MARKET <b>STRUCTURE <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The best available outline of the domestic
heroin distribution system, at least for New York City, was
developed by Mark Moore of the Hudson Institute.&quot; His
outline relies, in turn, on earlier analyses by John Casey and
Edward Preble&quot; and information from the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Moore suggests that heroin passes through six
levels of distribution: the importer, the kilo-connection, the
connection, the weight dealer, the street dealer, and, finally,
the juggler or pusher. Table 4-4 shows the outline of the system
and includes estimates of the prices and value added to the
heroin at each level. Before reviewing the operation of the
specific segments of the system, it is important to discuss the
over-all market structure of the business. The key questions here
are: How tight is vertical organization? How competitive is the
system at the various levels? How much increase in risk would be
required to make it unprofitable for large operators to stay in
business? <br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00008.gif" align="bottom" width="1289"
height="1968"> </p>

<p><font size="2">For many years, conventional wisdom held that
the heroin business was monopolized by organized crime, perhaps
by the Mafia. BNDD now seems to believe, probably as a result of
recent arrests of South Americans at relatively high levels, that
10 or 12 large wholesalers with varying degrees of connection to
organized crime now control the distribution process in the
United States.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It seems clear that many economic principles
operating in society at large must also apply to illegal
enterprises,&quot; since the business of supply and distribution
of illicit drugs is presumably subject to the same general
economic laws, and responds to the same general set of
incentives, as prevail in more open industries. There are, of
course, some crucial differences caused by the fact of illegality
and also by the moral problems associated with dealing in many of
these drugs-for example, the need to minimize the risk of
detection of the origin of the distribution system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Hudson monograph argues that the objective
of the industry is to maximize profits within the constraint of
the risk of arrest and imprisonment, and that this objective is
most likely to be attained if the industry is organized into
several small distribution units separated vertically from one
another, if higher levels in the system are monopolized, and if
lower levels are competitive with some elements of market power
(monopolistic competition). The small distribution units in the
heroin industry are separated from one another by restricting
information at one level about the identity and activities of
other levels. Risks are limited by close supervision and
discipline of employees, thus reducing the probability of
information leaks, and by the fact that penetration of one level
will not result in penetration of another. The primary
disadvantage of small, separate distribution units is their
inability to adjust to large changes in demand; suppliers end up
with either excessive or deficient inventories.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Moore argues that a monopoly could most
efficiently perform the functions required of the high levels in
the distribution network. The top levels in the system must: (1)
restrict the total supply of heroin to maintain high market
prices, (2) regularly and reliably supply an amount of heroin
fairly close to the realized demand, (3) manipulate supply
conditions above them with a minimum of explicit planning and
negotiation, and <b>(4) </b>adjust to errors in supply with a
minimum of negotiation and activity. A centralized organization
would be more effective in handling each of these problems. A
monopolist can restrict the total supply, allowing high prices
throughout the system. In addition, he is in a position to have
an efficient ordering policy, thus successfully accommodating
uneven deliveries and lead time. Agents can be coerced into
holding inventories or resupplied when short of heroin. Tight
control can be maintained over the circulation of information.
Finally, a monopolist can maintain a monopoly position in
relation to producers.. thus reducing lead times, unevenness, and
quality deterioration.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In contrast, a competitive market would be less
likely to ensure a smooth, restricted supply, adjusting to errors
in a discreet, efficient manner. In a more competitive situation,
it is more difficult to pool shipments or parcel out uneven
deliveries of heroin. With many suppliers at the top, there are
more transactions, more explicit negotiations, more occasions of
short supply or large inventories, more information circulating
freely-and thus a greater probability of arrest. A monopoly,
therefore, is logically the most efficient type of organizational
structure at high levels.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But a successful monopoly requires the
existence of some type of leverage or barrier to entry, such as
(1) special knowledge unavailable to others, (2) total control
over some vital raw material, or (3) total control over the
market as to make the cost of entry prohibitive, especially if
entry requires a large fixed investment. It is doubtful that any
of these considerations applies to the heroin traffic. The
knowledge required to refine opium into heroin is certainly not
difficult to acquire. It is also doubtful that the knowledge of
methods of conducting illegal activities-such as smuggling-is so
limited as to allow any firm to maintain a monopoly. There are no
substantial fixed costs other than the investment in an
information system, needed to offset the high level of risk in
the trade. However, the difficulty, and thus the cost, of
developing such an information network may be a formidable
barrier to entry.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Trusted personal relationships with Turkish or
French syndicates may have put some organizations in a monopoly
position for Turkish opium. However, it would be in the interest
of the Turkish or French firms to sell to as many importers as
possible, forcing them to bid against each other and thus raise
the price of heroin. A firm desiring to enter the business
should, therefore, be able to establish the necessary
connections.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is possible, of course, that the suppliers
are not profit maximizers; they may not wish to accept increased
risks for the sake of increased profits. Instead, after
establishing an acceptably low level of risk, they may seek to
maximize profits within this constraint. Such an approach would
sacrifice many of the benefits of competition among buyers
because of the need to limit the number of people who know the
supplier's identity. (This factor also operates as a barrier to
entry at other high levels of the distribution system.) If the
barriers to entry in the market for Turkish opium are too great,
however<b>, </b>a potential importer could go to Hong Kong,
Bangkok, Karachi, or Saigon.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, as noted, trying to erect a barrier to
entry by attempting to control the raw material does not seem
feasible. The U.S. market relative to total world production is
simply too small to prevent other supplies from becoming
available. Also, the retail product is homogeneous and easily
divisible, making it difficult to hoard.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">However, for an illegal business, there are
additional techniques of monopolization. Violence is the most
likely method of securing market control; illegal operators can
readily hire agents or firms willing to kill quietly and
efficiently. If a heroin-distribution monopoly became established
early and acquired both a large organization and a sophisticated
information system, it could make it extremely dangerous for a
rival to compete. First of all, it might have the key advantage
of knowing who is trying to enter the business before its own
prior presence can be discovered. Since rivals would find it
difficult to purchase a comparable intelligence service secretly,
this acts as an important barrier to entry. Another way of
enforcing monopoly of an illegal product is to control the use of
legal force-corrupting police officials to serve one's own ends.
An effective use of corrupt police would be to have one's rivals
eliminated via arrest; sufficient arrests would satisfy the
public and allow the police to refrain from attacking the
monopoly itself. It is in the interest of the police, in turn, to
eliminate competition, protecting the source of their payoff
money while appearing to be effective law enforcers. The
symbiosis between criminal enterprise and elements in law
enforcement is well known and has occupied many investigatory
commissions without being eliminated.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A firm could also obtain police cooperation
without police corruption. If one organization has better
intelligence than any other, and better intelligence than the
police, it could simply inform the police of the competing ring
and possibly provide the evidence necessary to break it up.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The BNDD believes that 10 or 12 large wholesale
operations exist in the United States today. Thus, the potential
barriers to entry have apparently not been strong enough to allow
any one firm to enforce a monopoly. The system has probably
developed into an oligopoly or cartel, with each firm maintaining
a type of monopoly control of firms below it in the lower
distribution levels. It is not clear what agreements, if any,
exist among these firms with respect to prices or market areas,
but the risk of detection may limit the mobility of distributors
between top-level suppliers, thus allowing firms at the top to
maintain vertically integrated supply systems.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">At lower levels in the system, there are many
competitive suppliers, strict monopoly being impossible because
of the difficulty of disciplining customers. At these levels,
most customers are addicts who are highly motivated to maintain
relations with as many suppliers as possible. Low level suppliers
are arrested much more frequently than those in higher levels,
because they deal more often and more openly. Thus, relationships
between consumers and suppliers are constantly breaking up and
beginning again. Furthermore, addicts are always trying to break
into the lower levels of the system, and, given the small amount
of trust, skill, and capital needed, personnel and organizations
change rapidly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nevertheless, some elements of monopoly control
remain. Information is often unavailable to consumers, thus
restricting the number of markets in which they can buy. Also,
addicts find it useful to restrict their purchases to dealers who
consistently provide a high-quality product and who give them
lower prices as loyal and trusted clients. Thus, limited
information and product differentiation maintain elements of
monopoly advantage even for suppliers at low levels. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">COSTS AND PROFITS <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Existing analysis of the economics of each
segment of the heroin industry is fragmentary because of the
nature of the business. The best available analysis is again that
of Moore, and most of the comments in this section are derived
from his model of the system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For the importer and kilo-connection at the
higher levels of the distribution system, the operating
costs-principally wages and inventory finance costs-are estimated
to be a much greater percentage of value added than at lower
levels (50-55 per cent versus 30 per cent). Importers need
skilled employees for the smuggling process and periodically
require large amounts of capital to finance transactions with
producers and processors. Kilo connections have relatively large
wage costs because of the elaborate organization needed for
exchanges and maintaining inventories as well as disciplining
lower-level suppliers. Financing costs are also high at this
level because of the need to store inventories for uncertain
periods of time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Operating and finance costs are more moderate
for connections. Although they need to employ agents to develop
new markets, discipline customers, dilute heroin, and make
deliveries, there is a much faster turnover of inventories at
this level. The rate of turnover minimizes financing, but
connections may be forced to accept it from sources higher in the
organization. Weight dealers, street dealers, and jugglers are,
for the most part, self-employed; inventories are turned over
quickly, and individuals at these levels rarely have financing
problems.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In contrast to operating costs, expenditures
for bribes as a per cent of value added appear to increase as one
moves from high to low levels (2 per cent versus 5 per cent). At
the importer and kilo-connection levels, well-placed bribes can
secure considerable immunities at relatively low costs. Expenses
for bribery increase at the connection level, because they are
more vulnerable to arrest, engaging in a relatively more visible
activity. They must also frequently make payments to other
criminal organizations for &quot;protection.&quot; Weight
dealers, street dealers, and jugglers become even more vulnerable
to extortion and will also have to pay rather large bribes (as a
per cent of value added) to law-enforcement agencies.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits are great at each level of the
distribution network but decrease as a per cent of value added at
lower levels of distribution. Gross profits include (1) a
financial return equal to what could be made in the firm's next
best alternative line of business (its opportunity cost), (2) a
return to compensate for the risk of arrest and incarceration,
and (3) a return to monopoly power.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The kilo-connection at the top level of
distribution is probably the single most powerful component in
the system. At this level, gross profits are high and are
maintained by a large degree of monopoly power. Economic theory
suggests that the firm's profits must be at least as high as the
return from other attractive illegal opportunities, such as
loansharking or gambling. While risk-the probability of arrest-is
relatively low, the combination of monopoly power and high
opportunity costs makes profits at this level high. For the
importer, profits are probably less than those of
kilo-connections. His risks are low, because, being high on the
ladder, he is difficulty to identify. Opportunity costs are low,
because, with the substantial investment in building his
information network, an importer can make more money dealing in
heroin than he could make elsewhere. Some monopoly power exists
because the personal-relations network operates as a barrier to
entry, but this is probably limited by the encouragement by
kilo-connections of free-lance importers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Gross profits of connections are less than
those of the two upper levels. The restricted access to
information about operations allows some degree of
monopolization, but risks become greater as visibility increases
and the police become more successful at arrest and conviction.
At this level, opportunity costs are low because of the large
investment in personal relations, which are not valuable unless
the connection is engaged in the heroin trade. Connections can
accept lower profits, and still find the business more profitable
than alternatives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The remaining levels are characterized by
relatively high risk and low opportunity costs. All three levels
of<b> </b>operation are -relatively visible, have relatively high
arrest rates, and thus require adequate compensation for risks
incurred. On the other hand, opportunity costs are low because
few operators on this level have the skills required in other
types of enterprise. At the weight dealer level, a small degree
of monopoly is maintained, because access to information is
limited. At the street-dealer and juggler levels, monopoly
profits are minimal.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Analyzing operating costs and profits at each
stage of heroin distribution carries important implications for
law-enforcement policy. In summary, if a firm's costs are high,
and it has little monopoly power or attractive income-producing
alternatives, it may be quite easy to increase the risk enough so
that the firm leaves the industry. If these conditions do not
hold-if profits are high and protected by monopoly, or if few
good alternative profit opportunities exist-the firm might well
absorb the cost of the increased risk. These factors largely
determine the outcome of possible law-enforcement strategies. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">EFFECTS OF -POLICE -PRESSURE</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Increased police pressure on the distribution
system can clearly increase the risks' and operating costs of
those involved. Evidence does not show, however, that any one
firm is large enough or monopolistic enough so that its
destruction or neutralization would have an important impact on
the total distribution system and thus on heroin use at the
street level. During the last few years, the arrest of even major
distributors and traffickers has had no significant impact on the
price or availability of heroin. On the international level, for
instance, in the first six months of 1971, BNDD participated in
the arrest of 113 major traffickers outside the United States,
seizing large quantities of drugs in the process. Federal
officials face an almost impossible task of trying to stop the
smuggling of drugs at the border. About 250 million people enter
the country every year. Approximately 65 million cars and trucks,
306,000 planes, and 157,000 ships entered in 1970.&quot; If this
were not enough,<b> </b>customs officials state that, on an
average-size ship arriving at the Port of New York, there are
30,000 places where heroin can be hidden. Domestically, the
situation is not much different. A study of the undercover unit
of the New York City police narcotics division revealed that, in
1970, agents made 7,266 buys of narcotics that resulted in 4,007<b>
</b>arrests. However, only 4.97 pounds of highly adulterated
heroin were seized in these actions, at a total cost of $91,197,
and with no appreciable effect on heroin distribution citywide.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In such a situation, law enforcement must rely
on the indirect effects of general deterrence rather than on
direct disruption. But it is far from clear how firms operating
in the field regard a successful attack on another firm.
Possibly, such an attack will cause them to reassess their own
risks and assume that they are in greater danger than they
believed before. On the other hand, it may be that existing firms
will simply assume that the destroyed operation was incompetent
or lacking in security and see no need to reassess their own
risk.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To the extent that police are successful in
increasing a distributor's probability of arrest, one would
expect the chain to lengthen as each supplier attempts to deal
with fewer buyers and places more distance between himself and
the street. Suppliers would invest more time and absorb greater
operating costs in designing more complex delivery systems to
better conceal their activities. The risk involved in holding
inventories would cause suppliers to hold less in reserve, thus
increasing the time and complications involved in arranging
purchases and sales. However, police pressure might also increase
a monopoly's hold on the system. A monopoly can absorb the
increased risks more easily and is also likely to be better
protected. Markets might become even more centralized. Because of
higher costs and lack of competition, prices could be expected to
rise.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For all these reasons, it seems clear that law
enforcement can raise the price of heroin. The effects of higher
prices, and thus the ultimate impact of law enforcement, are
uncertain. They depend heavily on how total demand reacts to the
changes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">One hypothesis is that demand is inelastic,
that an addict is dependent on heroin and will try to maintain
his level of consumption regardless of price. If this is so, then
law-enforcement policy will have little effect. The added costs
of greater risks will be shifted to consumers, and the revenues
of the industry will increase. So will the social costs of the
activities addicts engage in to support the habit. (A logical
question is why firms are not already maximizing profits-that is,
if prices and revenues could be raised before the increased cost
was incurred, why did this not, in fact, take place? This may be
due to concern with public reaction. Higher heroin prices cause
higher crime rates, which increase the public's demand for strong
policy measures against the heroin traffic. Therefore, firms may
attempt to maximize profits, given the -constraint of maintaining
a low level of risk. This calls for keeping prices low enough so
that the crime needed to support it remains
&quot;tolerable.&quot; Competition might also play<b> </b>a
part.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A second theory is that demand is elastic, that
a price rise does cause a disproportionate decrease in
consumption. If so, then the suppliers would have to absorb the
increased cost of higher risks or raise the price and accept a
decline in total revenues.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">While it is commonly believed that the
addictive nature of heroin causes the demand for it to be
inelastic, it might, in fact, be elastic, for two reasons: First,
the development of methadone during the past few years has
created a low-cost alternative for addicts that did not exist
before. Secondly, over the last thirty years there has been a
substantial long-term rise in the price of heroin relative to the
price of other consumer goods. This may have produced a situation
in which most addicts are maintaining their habit at the highest
price level they are able to support. If the price increased
further, these addicts would have no choice except to decrease
the quantity of heroin used, because they would be unable to
raise their income enough to meet the new cost.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the demand is elastic, a law-enforcement
policy could be effective. If the price of heroin increased and
methadone was necessarily substituted, the social costs of
addiction, including crime, would decrease. If addicts chose to
adapt by using less heroin for the same cost, however, the crime
costs would not be decreased. It could be argued, on the other
hand, that increasing the cost of being an addict hastens the
time when the addict voluntarily leaves the addicted life.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The firm attempting to maximize profits,
subject to the constraint of maintaining a low level of risk, may
choose to absorb the risk as increased operating costs rather
than attempt to shift it to the consumers. This, of course,
results in a lower rate of return and reduces the attractiveness
of heroin distribution. In the heroin business, the gross profits
of a firm (revenues minus operating costs) must be at least equal
to the return the firm could earn in an alternative investment
(its opportunity cost).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits that exceed opportunity costs can be
considered a return to a monopoly position or compensation for
risk. Gross profits must exceed opportunity costs by at least
enough to compensate the firm for the risks it undertakes. If
gross profits, less opportunity costs, exceed the compensation
required for risk, the firm will stay in the business.
Alternatively, if gross profits, less opportunity costs, are less
than the return required for undertaking risk, the firm will not
be willing to absorb the risk and will leave the industry.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Risk for an illegal firm can be viewed as equal
to the probability of punishment, as the firm perceives it, times
the cost of certain punishment to that firm. The cost of certain
punishment is equal to the amount the firm would be willing to
pay to avoid </font><font size="1">it.26</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The probability of punishment can be affected
by public policy and by the firm's own actions, because it
depends on the probability of being apprehended and successfully
prosecuted. Changes in the criminal-justice system are essential
if high-level distributors are going to be put out of business.
These include more sophisticated training of police personnel,
higher salaries to lessen the temptation of bribes, and higher
budgets for purchasing information. In reality, law-enforcement
agencies have been unable to raise the level of risk anywhere
near what would be required to make this criminal enterprise
unprofitable. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The cost of the expected punishment to the
illegal operation can also be influenced by changes in judicial
procedures and increases of sentences. Currently, many defendants
in narcotics cases forfeit bail, become fugitives, and, if
apprehended, are more likely to be tried for violating the
conditions of bail than for the original charge. If convicted,
this means a lesser sentence. The economic cost in such a
case-the amount the offender would pay to avoid detection-should
be equal to the amount of bail, plus the probability of being
arrested while. at large, times the penalty for jumping bail.
This cost would be increased if a change in public policy raised
the amount of bail or the penalty for violating its conditions </font><font
size="1"><b>.21 </b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">On the other hand, the probability of
punishment can be reduced if the illegal operation spends more on
bribes and devising elaborate, less conspicuous pickup and
delivery systems. If increased amounts are spent to reduce risks,
however, the illegal firms reduce their gross profits at the same
time. A firm will expend these sums if in doing so it can keep
its gross profits (minus opportunity costs) above the 'cost of
escaping imprisonment. If it is impossible, through further
spending, to reduce the expected risk below gross profits, less
opportunity costs, firms will leave the business. Alternatively,
firms could limit sales to trusted buyers, thereby reducing
revenues and gross profits but also reducing the chances of
getting caught.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">According to Moore's analysis of the
distribution hierarchy, gross profits are considerable at every
level. However, for the kilo-connection, high-yielding
alternatives are the greatest, and it is possible that monopoly
at this level could be broken. BNDD appears to believe that the
monopoly has already been broken, and that the industry is now
operating as an oligopoly with ten or twelve firms. But,
conceivably, an oligopoly or cartel could develop techniques for
supplying the total market as efficiently as a centralized
organization. If satisfactory agreements can be reached, the
amount of explicit communication necessary to guarantee avoidance
of frequent shortages or surpluses would be minimal. However, the
market becomes more unstable with a cartel, because there is
always an incentive for one firm to increase its sales at the
expense of another. If one firm does try to improve its position,
the others are likely to follow. If all try to do so, oversupply
develops, attempts to expand the market increase, prices decline,
and profits fall. In the process, higher levels of the
distribution system become more visible to the authorities, and
the probability of punishment increases. A kilo-connection may
then find one of his high-yielding alternative opportunities more
attractive and leave heroin distribution. Thus, there is always
some incentive for the police to attempt to infiltrate the
network at higher levels. Arrests made at this level reverberate
through the system, making arrests easier at all levels.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is far from clear, however, that such a
public policy is altogether sound. While it could have a high
payoff in terms of seizures of heroin and arrests, it would lead
to considerable market expansion and increased heroin
availability. The elimination of monopoly would permit the
entrance of new firms; a competitively organized industry will
always provide more goods at lower prices than will a monopoly.
Market expansion would occur if lower prices increase the demand
for heroin, and, in fact, this may be occurring. Two very large
seizures by BNDD in May and June of 1970 reportedly had no effect
on price. No panics occurred following the seizures, as one would
expect, and the short-term trend over the year was one of
declining prices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Theoretically, the best allocation of police
power is at the levels of the distribution hierarchy, where the
incremental gains from their actions (in terms of reduced social
costs) are equal to the incremental costs of the enforcement
efforts. This clearly requires employment of more resources at
some levels than at others. While the payoff from attempts to
infiltrate higher levels may be large, this policy is also very
expensive. And, again, it is possible that such a policy would
lead to a larger, less organized trade. Use of police resources
at lower levels has less potential for large payoffs but is less
costly. It is much easier to interrupt the heroin traffic at the
retail level, because firms engage in more transactions,
concealment is more difficult, and information is more available.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">On the other hand, risks must be increased
considerably before it becomes no longer profitable for low-level
operators to remain in the industry, because their opportunity
costs are low-i.e., they probably could not earn nearly so much
doing something else. Police are continually eliminating these
low-level operators through arrest, but, given the high profit
potential, others still find it worthwhile to enter the business
because of their low opportunity costs, mistaken perceptions of
the probability of punishment, or the low value placed on being
incarcerated for a given period. In addition, most street dealers
and pushers are themselves addicts. Being in the business keeps
them near the source of supply, giving them an income sufficient
to finance their own consumption and enabling them to buy their
own drugs wholesale.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Clearly, if heroin demand becomes relatively
elastic at some point as prices rise, the police could eventually
be successful in eliminating the industry. However, to accomplish
this, it is probable that society would have to allocate an
extraordinary amount of law-enforcement resources. Society might
prefer to reduce the industry to the &quot;optimum&quot; size,
where the costs imposed by heroin use are just equal to the
additional cost required to reduce it further.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>CONSUMPTION</i></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The consumption of heroin imposes costs on the
rest of the community, because most purchases are financed
through criminal acts such as theft. Because of these involuntary
redistributions of existing wealth, the community spends
resources to prevent crime and to apprehend, try, punish, and
rehabilitate criminals. This includes private expenditures on
locks, alarms, lights, and security guards and public
expenditures on police, courts, and correctional systems. To the
extent that these human and material resources would be employed
elsewhere in the absence of heroin addiction, they are properly
counted as costs of addiction. Social costs also include the
medical expenses and foregone productivity of individuals injured
in crimes and the lost productivity, medical expenses, and
premature deaths of addicts. Finally, one must also include the
fear and anxiety, avoidance of normal activity, disruption of
community life, and use of less efficient and more expensive
modes of transportation that are unquantifiable but nonetheless
very real costs of crime and drug addiction. This section
examines the direct cost of heroin consumption and estimates the
amount of crime required to finance it.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The most elementary question in determining the
direct costs of heroin consumption is the total cost of the
heroin consumed that is, how much money do addicts need to
support their addiction? But this calculation depends on several
unknowns: the number of addicts, the average number of days per
year heroin is consumed, and the average cost of heroin per day,
with an adjustment for the amount of heroin &quot;earned&quot;
from profits on sales to other addicts.&quot; This information is
essential for determining the magnitude of the problem and the
benefits from any investments designed to control or reduce it.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">THE ADDICT POPULATION <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The actual number of heroin addicts in the
United States is unknown and probably can never be determined
precisely with present techniques of estimation. Addicts become
known to officials only through death, arrest, or participation
in treatment programs. It is difficult to estimate the size of
the addict population from the number of deaths or arrests,
because each of these figures depends on other variables as well
as sum totals. For example, the ratio of addict deaths to addict
population will vary not only with the number of addicts but also
with the probability that a decedent will be medically identified
as an addict. Similarly, the frequency of addict deaths from
overdose will vary with sudden changes in the concentration of
pure heroin in the local supply. The ratio of addict arrests to
number of addicts can vary with the intensity of police efforts
in certain areas. The ratio of addicts in treatment to total
addicts can vary with the addicts' perception of the value of
treatment or the short-term availability of heroin.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because of these difficulties, most estimates
of the addict population are mere guesses. However, there are two
methods that may ultimately prove useful, although both have
pronounced weaknesses at present. One is the &quot;Baden&quot;
formula, developed in New York City by Dr. Michael Baden of the
Medical Examiner's Office, and frequently applied elsewhere. New
York is unique in having a register of local heroin addicts as
reported by medical and police sources. The formula was computed
by comparing the number of addicts on the registry to the number
of overdose deaths and the number of deaths among persons named
on the register.&quot; Baden found that 50 per cent of the heroin
addicts who die are on the Narcotic Addict Register. On this
basis, he estimated that the total addict population numbers
about twice the registry total. In 1968, for example, the New
York Register had 42,500 addicts listed; it was therefore
concluded that the total addict population was approximately
85,000.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This method has several problems, of which its
originators were well aware and are quick to acknowledge. They
were seeking a way of making a quick estimate of the total
population that would be more adequate than the register alone
without incurring expenses for research time. (It is ironic that
Dr. Baden is sometimes castigated for defects that he was the
first to point out.) First, it is assumed that addicts who are on
the register have the same probability of dying as those who are
not. If registered addicts are heavier users and thus more
susceptible to disease, such as malnutrition and hepatitis, they
would have a higher probability of dying. On the other hand, if
addicts not on the register are less experienced users they may
be more likely to die of overdose. Either, both, or neither
hypothesis could be correct, and it is impossible to determine
the net effect.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Secondly, since the register is cumulative over
a five-year period, some on the list will no longer be addicts
because of successful treatment, abstinence, or incarceration. To
the extent that this is the case, the estimate will exceed the
actual total by twice the size of the error in the register.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Third, the probability that an addict is listed
on the register is, in part, a function of his age and length of
addiction. A thirty year-old addicted for ten years is more
likely to be listed than an eighteen-year-old addicted for one
year. A sophisticated application of the technique requires at
least an age breakdown, and possibly other distinctions as well.
Baden himself works with such distinctions, but others who use
the method often do not. Serious difficulties develop when
officials attempt to use the Baden formula in other cities or at
other points in time. Statistical analysis of one set of
circumstances is rarely transferable to different situations. In
other words, heroin addicts in different places, for whatever
reasons, probably do not die at the same rate. Furthermore,
differences in diagnostic method change the probability of a
decedent's being identified as an addict. For example, in
Washington, D.C., during the eighteen months preceding July,
1970, diagnostic drug screens were performed on only 6.3 per cent
of all autopsied deaths; during the last six months of 1970, drug
screens were performed on 51 per cent of all autopsied
deaths.&quot; This frequency can also vary between cities, and a
small variance, when using Baden's formula, would change the
estimated population greatly, because the number of addicts who
die in any given year is likely to be only 1-2 per cent of the
total register.&quot; And New York has by far the best register
of any city.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs has
developed a somewhat similar approach in estimating the total
addict population. It multiplies the number of known users who
could be rearrested by the ratio of total heroin arrests to the
number of known users included in these arrests.&quot; On the
basis of this method, BNDD unofficially estimates that there are
at present 315,000 addicts nationally.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This method also has several problems. First,
known addicts are voluntarily reported to BNDD by local police
departments. Reporting practices can vary considerably with
locality, as can intensity of enforcement efforts.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Secondly, the probability of any addict's being
arrested in period 2 is assumed to be the same regardless of
whether he had been arrested in period 1. This hypothesis is
unproved. It may be that addicts already known to the police are
heavy users and commit more crimes or are under greater
surveillance. Therefore, the probability of their rearrest would
be greater, and the estimate of the total addict population would
be less than the actual. On the other hand, if the addicts
unknown to the police are younger, and therefore more recently
addicted, the probability of their arrest may be higher, because
younger addicts tend to commit riskier crimes, such as robbery.
In this case, the estimate would be too large.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Thirdly, it is difficult to determine the
number of addicts reported in period I who remain active users
and are therefore eligible for arrest during period 2.
Statistical adjustments must be made for the probability that a
known user will be in jail during period 2, will die, will become
abstinent spontaneously, or will be in a treatment program. BNDD
has thus far adjusted satisfactorily only for the probability
that an addict will be in jail.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some of the problems involved in these
adjustments are shown by the difficulty of estimating the
probability of death. BNDD made its adjustments on the average
probability that any individual over twenty-five will survive to
the next year. But the mortality rate for addicts is undoubtedly
higher than that of other individuals of the same age. On the
other hand, there may not be many addicts over forty, and thus
the mortality rate as originally calculated was biased upward by
calculating an average probability for all individuals over
twenty-five. Without knowing the true mortality rate, it is
difficult to make the proper adjustments to the estimates.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Some addicts do mature out of addiction as they
age, but the number is not known. Even active addicts may have
weeks or months of abstinence, but again no numbers are
available. Work on these problems is going on, and the results
will probably reduce the estimate below the present 315,000.
However, since reports from various urban areas indicate that the
number of addicts is still increasing, we will use alternative
estimates of 250,000 and 350,000 for the total addict population.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Some officials make a &quot;best guess&quot;
estimate and then attempt to test the reasonableness of the
figure by comparing it with the total population. For example,
the Narcotic Treatment Agency in Washington, D.C., has a
population of 95 per cent black, 85 per cent male, and 85 per
cent between the ages of fifteen and thirty four. Assuming that
the addict population not in treatment has the same
characteristics, one can make an estimate of the penetration of
addiction into the total population with these characteristics.
If there are 15,000 addicts in Washington, 10,296 are black males
between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four. According to 1970
Census data, there are a total of 83,158 black males between
fifteen and thirty-four in Washington, D.C. Thus, 12.1 per cent
of this population is addicted under the assumption of 15,000
addicts, and 8.2 per cent is addicted under the assumption of
10,000 addicts. The problem with these projections is that 8.2
per cent and 12.1 per cent seem equally 'reasonable&quot; If an
estimate approached 25 per cent or 30 per cent of a given
population, one would suspect exaggeration. Penetration
projections appear to have little value except as very rough
assessments.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">DAILY EXPENDITURES FOR HEROIN </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Addicts vary in the amounts of heroin they
consume per day and the per cent of time spent actively using the
drug. Some addicts can afford to increase their habits as their
tolerance to the drug grows; others cannot. There is also great
variance in vulnerability to arrest and incarceration as well as
in the frequency of &quot;vacations&quot; from addiction in
hospitals or treatment facilities. These periods of treatment
also serve to reduce the size using interviews with ex-addicts
and police, developed a breakdown of the addict population of New
York City.&quot; From their data, presented in Table 4-5, one can
estimate that an average addict is an active user 70 per cent of
the time, or 255 days per year per addict.<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00009.gif" align="bottom" width="1311"
height="1179"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The frequently quoted estimates of the daily
costs of supporting an addiction are often exaggerated. Many are
derived from interviews with addicts who regard large habits as
status symbols and commonly overstate the level of their own use.
In general, the amounts of heroin consumed by addicts vary
widely, and reports of these amounts are unreliable. To say that
an addict has a $50 habit does not mean that he will spend this
sum day after day. Ideally, an addict would like to use as much
heroin as he needs to &quot;get high.&quot; In fact, however, the
increasing difficulty of obtaining the necessary money to pay for
increasing dosages imposes an upper limit on most addicts'
habits. But if an addict cannot consistently obtain large enough
dosages of heroin -to get high, he can use smaller amounts
without feeling acute withdrawal symptoms. In effect, the habit
size of a long-time heavy user is often not at the level of
euphoria but only at a level sufficient to suppress withdrawal or
to keep the withdrawal mild. Moreover, while there are many
addicts with expensive habits, there are also many addicts in the
early stages of dependence whose habit requires only $10-15 per
day. These factors should be kept in mind when interpreting any
estimates of the total cost of addiction.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The price, and quality, of heroin needed by an
addict determine his cost per day. Retail prices were obtained by
BNDD -for December, 1970, for several U.S. cities, and are listed
in Table 4-6. The considerable variation in price is probably due
to differences in local supply and demand, risks taken by
suppliers, and, probably, nonrandom buying procedures. The
unweighted average price-except in Chicago, where it is
extraordinarily high for unknown reasons-is about $0.55 per
milligram.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The average quantity used per day is probably
about 55 milligrams of pure heroin.&quot; At $0.55 per milligram,
this results in daily expenditures of approximately $30 per day
for the average addict, representing the amount paid on the
street by the addict who buys solely for his own consumption.
Some earn their heroin through services rendered as a distributor
of heroin-i.e., pusher; thus, the price paid by the ultimate
consumer includes the payment for that service. Heroin
&quot;earned&quot; in pushing, therefore, means that fewer
addicts have to steal from the community, or that some percentage
of the addict population supports the rest by theft,
prostitution, or legitimate work. The Hudson Institute study
estimated that 45 per cent of the heroin consumed is used by
those involved in its distribution and profit from its sale. If
other factors remain the same, the total social cost of heroin
addiction will be less if the percentage of consumed heroin
&quot;earned&quot; from pushing is increased.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A rough estimate of the annual cost of heroin
purchases can be made using the information presented in the
preceding pages. The assumptions are that (1) addicts spend 70
per cent of the <br>

</font></p>

<p><font size="1">SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR HEROIN PURCHASES</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The high cost of heroin requires most addicts
to resort to crime to finance their habits. Estimates of the
various sources of funds for the support of heroin addiction can
be made with data obtained by the Hudson Institute from
ex-addicts in New York City. As discussed previously,
approximately 45 per cent of the heroin consumed by the addict
population is obtained by selling heroin. This does not mean that
45 per cent of all addicts are pushers but that 45 per cent of
the heroin used by addicts is obtained in exchange for services
rendered in the distribution network. The remainder of the addict
population finance their own habits and those of pushers by
various means, including robbery, burglary, shoplifting,
prostitution, and legitimate work. Most addicts employ a
combination of means, legal or otherwise, in their constant quest
to obtain funds.&quot; The breakdown of sources of funds
presented in Table 4-7 was developed from the Hudson material.
These figures represent the funds used to purchase the 55 per
cent of heroin consumed that is not financed by rendering
services in the distribution network.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is assumed that shoplifting, burglary, and
larceny yield real property, and that pickpocketing, robbery, and
confidence games yield cash. Therefore, the total property stolen
in these crimes can be roughly divided into 80 per cent real
property and 20<b> </b>per cent cash.&quot; It is assumed that
real property is fenced at one-third its value, so that an addict
must steal, on the average, property worth $2.60 to obtain $ 1.00
with which to finance his habit.&quot;<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00011.gif" align="bottom" width="1337"

<p><font size="2">The data needed to estimate the funds obtained

<p><font size="1">Number of addicts (N) 250,000; 350,000</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>CONCLUSION<br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="1">The economics of heroin distribution has been
examined for whatever assistance such analysis may bring to
future policy considerations. Can heroin use be curbed? Can it be
eliminated? What are the most efficient methods of attacking the
problem?</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">In the marketing of any product, there are two
sides to a transaction-supply and demand. Our examination has
shown that public policies dealing with the production of opium
and the domestic distribution of heroin-the supply side-will
never be completely successful in eliminating heroin use in the
United States and the consequent street crime. Indeed, past
reliance on law-enforcement measures has accompanied an epidemic
growth of the heroin-addict population. It is ironic that our
national policy, by resorting almost exclusively to criminal
sanctions to </font><font size="2">eliminate addiction, has bred
a thriving illegal market that can be sustained only by criminal
activity.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two factors primarily impede public policy
designed to suppress the supply of heroin. First, the amount of
opium needed to supply the demand for heroin in the United States
is only a minute portion of total world production. It is
probably impossible to curb all opium production, licit and
illicit, everywhere in the world. Secondly, the profits earned in
domestic distribution are so great that it is unlikely the risks
can be raised high enough to force dealers out of business. As
one former distributor has stated: &quot;If you put me away,
somebody else is going to stand in my spot.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Clearly, more effort and greater resources must
be spent to curb the demand for heroin. For example, more addicts
must be treated and rehabilitated. Education to prevent drug
abuse must be expanded and made more meaningful. Finally, the
environmental factors that breed and sustain addiction must be
more successfully attacked. John Ingersoll, Director of the
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, has stated before a
congressional committee that law enforcement is the first-aid
agency of society. It is not the curative, not the doctor, and it
doesn't eliminate causes of these problems. Our society has
gotten itself into an unfortunate state of affairs regarding
drugs because it has assumed that by passing laws and enforcing
them, the problem will go away.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">So it seems to me that while you can expect
law-enforcement agencies to do the first-aid work, if you want a
cure, then we have got to go back to the basic causes and find
out what can be done from that end. We have to look to improved
and increased rehabilitation programs. We have to find out more
about drugs and why people use them, knowing of the debilitating
consequences </font><font size="1">.42 <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">No policy, of course, will. be successful if it
addresses only a part of the problem. There appears to be, for
instance, a causal relationship between strict law enforcement
and the number of addicts in treatment programs. If the
probability of arrest is increased, more addicts are induced to
enter treatment. Conversely, if more hard-core addicts enter
treatment programs, pushers must seek out new, less reliable
clientele; they become more visible and thus more vulnerable to
arrest. Development of an effective policy combining efforts to
suppress supply and inhibit demand for heroin necessarily
involves close scrutiny of the economic system and the relative
benefits and costs of various alternatives. In choosing between
policy alternatives, cost-benefit analyses can illuminate the
probable reduction in the social costs of addiction to be derived
from one policy as compared with another. If our public monies
are to be spent efficiently, it is imperative that such choices
be illuminated by full-scale studies of this nature. <br>

</i></font></p>

<p><font size="1">1. BNDD Staff. Interviews, November, 1971. This
assessment is based on two other estimates: the total number of
addicts in the United States, and the quantity of pure heroin
consumed by each addict per day. The accuracy of these estimates
will be analyzed later. But just one year ago, BNDD believed that
only 5,000-6,000 lbs. of imported heroin was sufficient to supply
the U.S. market. The current estimate should be interpreted
accordingly; the actual total is probably somewhat less than
10,000 lbs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">10. It is extremely difficult to estimate
illicit production and consumption. Except for Turkey, illicit
production estimates were made on the basis of domestic
consumption. Some allowance for exports is included but is
probably subject to error. The BNDD staff considers the estimates
to be accurate within a confidence interval of 20 per cent.</font>

opium is often adulterated with seed, leaves, and other foreign

<p><font size="1">17. These figures are approximate. In fact, the
necessary land area could be considerably less, depending on the
number of total addicts and the opium yield per acre. The
11.2-23.2 square-mile estimate is obtained from the data in Table
4-2. For example, if the yield per acre is assumed to be 8.07
Ibs. (the approximate reported yield in Turkey), then the area
required to produce 100,000 and 120,000 lbs. of opium is
approximately 19.4 square miles and 23.2 square miles,
respectively. (If 1 acre yields 8.07 lbs., then 12,391.5 acres
will yield 100,000 lbs. This acreage is approximately 19.4 square
miles.) On the other hand, if the true Turkish yield, as
suspected, is approximately 14 Ibs. per acre, then the area
required to produce 100,000 and 120,000 lbs. is approximately
11.2 and 13.4 square miles, respectively.</font> </p>

</font></p>

<p><font size="1">34. Moore, <i>op. cit., </i>note 21, p. 66.
These estimates were made on the basis of a relatively small
number of interviews and should not be interpreted strictly.
However, this table provides the best available information on
these aspects of addict behavior.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">35. This estimate, while lower than several
others, may still be too high. First, the Hudson Institute
average of 55 milligrams includes an estimate that large-habit
dealers (I 1 per cent of the total user population) use 180
milligrams per day. While heroin dealers might have the income to
maintain such a large habit, it seems unlikely that they could be
active entrepreneurs and at the same time use such quantities of
the drug. The Hudson estimate was also derived from interviews
with addicts, who reportedly exaggerate estimates of use. So,
too, there may be less than 10 mg. of pure heroin per bag. 36.
The amount of funds obtained from each of three alternative
sources of funds (property crime, prostitution, legal sources)
can be estimated with the following equation:</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">C=365 [ U -d) NTX (af +b+w) where d, N, T, and
X have the same meaning as in the equation in footnote 28.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="1">C --the gross -amount uf -funds ubtained
-annually -from various -sources -for heroin purchases;</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">a=the proportion of funds spent on heroin that
comes from property crime;</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">b= the proportion of funds spent on heroin that
comes from prostitution; c=the proportion of funds spent on
heroin that comes from legitimate sources-i.e., work, public
assistance, family, or friends;<br>
<img src="img00016.gif" align="bottom" width="1263" height="1934">
f =the factor by which the amount stolen must exceed the amount
yielded by a property crime. (A stolen good must be transferred
from the thief to a fence to a final consumer. The thief receives
only a fraction of the market value of the good. To obtain a
given target yield, an addict can be expected to steal a given
amount, depending on the fencing discount, and the proportion of
value stolen that is property and not cash.) <br>
The amount of money annually spent by addicts for heroin can be
estimated with the equation in footnote 26. </font></p>

<p><font size="1">The cost to victims of property crime committed
by addicts can be estimated by this equation: <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Cv = </b>365 [ (I - d) NTX (af)</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">where C, =cost to victims of property crime.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="1">37. These estimates are also weakened by the
interview technique em-<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">ployed and thus should not be considered a
precise reflection of addict behavior.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">38. The value of property stolen cannot be
counted totally when the costs to society are added. Some
percentage of the value of goods stolen accrues as a type of
subsidy to people who, knowingly or unknowingly, purchase stolen
goods because the price they pay is significantly below the
market price. This factor reduces the cost of crime to all
society by the value of real property stolen multiplied by the
reduced resale value (the fencing discount).</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">However, in ascertaining how large an
adjustment to make, it is difficult to compare the utility of
gains to the purchaser with the utility of the losses to the
victim-is it greater, less, or the same? In addition, from the
point of view of the community, the loss to the victim may be
given more weight than the gain to the ultimate consumer. The
item may, in fact, lose &quot;value&quot; because it is a stolen
good. Objectively, although a stolen television set may still
operate as well as before, the purchaser may feel that it is
worth less than the market value because of the risk of holding a
stolen good.<br>

<p><font size="1">40. The net annual addict income from property
crime can be estimated</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">by the following equation: <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">PC= 365 [ (1 - d) NTXa]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Comprehensive, reliable information on federal
expenditures on drug-abuse programs is difficult to obtain. No
detailed program budget describing the allocation of federal
resources in this area has ever been made public or possibly even
compiled. Although both the Office of Management and Budget and
the Council on Executive Reorganization have made efforts to put
together information, the results have been closely held. The
figures used in this paper are based on budget requests and
amendments, accounts of congressional hearings and other
documents issued by the government, and interviews with
government officials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The accuracy of this information is sometimes
suspect. Government cost accounting has never been known for its
rigor, and, since drug abuse is now receiving high-priority
attention at the highest levels of government, there is an
incentive for agencies to find a drug-abuse rationale for
programs that may have only a peripheral relationship to the
field.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There are also technical problems. The Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, and the Social and Rehabilitation Service
of HEW all award block grants to states and cities. (Block grants
are funds that can be used for any specific projects chosen by
the recipients within a given area of activity.) It is only after
the close of the fiscal year that the portion of these funds
spent for drug abuse can be determined. For these programs there
is no information on fiscal 1972 at the present time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">On June 17, 1971, President Nixon announced a
new drug abuse program, including a supplemental budget request
of $155,655,000 for fiscal 1972. Shortly thereafter, the
President stipulated that there was to be a 5 per cent.
across-the-board -reduction in government personnel as part of
the anti-inflation effort. Some federal agencies are still unsure
which of these directives will take precedence.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There are obvious differences among budget
requests, congressional authorizations, appropriations, and
actual expenditures; however, these distinctions are not made
consistently in this report. Generally, appropriations are used
for fiscal 1970 and 1971 and budget requests are used for fiscal
1972, but some amounts are agency allocations within larger
appropriations. Usually, the figures are fairly close to the
actual amounts that were or will be spent for the activities in
each year. However, in some areas, such as research, expenditures
may lag somewhat behind appropriations.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some agencies, such as the Department of
Defense and the Internal Revenue Service, have specific funding
allocations for drug abuse activities in fiscal 1972, but did not
have such allocations in fiscal 1971.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because of these problems, some of the figures
given here represent judgment and estimate rather than certain
fact. <br>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>TOTAL FEDERAL EXPENDITURES <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Table 5-1 shows federal expenditures for fiscal
years 1970, 1971, and 1972 broken down by agencies. Table 5-2
shows the same expenditures broken down by functional categories.
Table </font><font size="1">5-3 shows </font><font size="2">the
requested budget for fiscal </font><font size="1">1972 </font><font
size="2">before and after the President's supplement request.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">As the tables indicate, the government will
spend about $417,601,000 on drug-abuse activities in fiscal 1972,
almost double the amount spent in fiscal 1971. Several agencies
that could not provide a breakdown of funds spent in fiscal </font><font
size="1">1971 </font><font size="2">could do so for fiscal 1972.
To avoid undue exaggeration of the increase, we have made rough
estimates of the fiscal 1971 totals.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Table 5-4 compares the project estimate of the
fiscal 1972 </font><font size="1">budget with the latest
available official government estimates.' The Project's figures
are higher. The difference can be attributed to a number of
factors, but probably the most influential is that the data for
our estimate were compiled in September and October, 1971, rather
than in June, and thus the agencies had </font><font size="2">more
time in which to survey their activities. This seems especially
important for the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.<br>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>FEDERAL ACTIVITIES <br>
</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">LAw </font><font size="1">ENFORCEMENT
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Four federal agencies have law-enforcement
responsibilities: the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD) and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA)
in the Department of justice; and the Bureau of Customs and the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the Treasury Department. In
fiscal 1972, these agencies will spend $115,822,000 enforcing
laws against the illegal importation, manufacture, distribution,
and possession of narcotics and dangerous drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As the product of a 1968 merger between the
Treasury Department's Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare's Bureau of Drug
Abuse Control, BNDD has the widest mandate. It is primarily
responsible for most of the federal government's national and
international police operations. BNDD also works with state and
local officials on cases of major importance to the total
illegal-distribution system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During fiscal 1972, BNDD will receive
$66,689,000.' This will represent a doubling of its
appropriations in two years. Personnel has increased almost as
rapidly-from 1,465 in fiscal 1970 to 2,319 in fiscal 1971 to
2,718 in fiscal 1972. The number of actual agents has also
increased from 884 in 1970 to 1,437 in 1971.' (Data for fiscal
1972 are not available.) Over 90 per cent of BNDD's money, or
$61,971,000, will be spent on law-enforcement activities in 1972 </font><font
size="1">.4</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">BNDD's principal predecessor, the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, was often accused of over concentrating its
efforts against users and street dealers of narcotics and not
being seriously concerned with the higher levels of distribution.
In 1970, BNDD claimed that it had reversed this policy and was
concentrating its efforts on the higher levels of the marketing
structure. Appearing before a House Appropriations subcommittee
in March, 1970, Director John Ingersoll stated:</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">The new operational plan is a systematic
approach to developing prosecutable cases and obtaining
convictions on specifically identifiable individuals and groups
who are responsible for most of the illicit drug traffic in this
country.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">The shift in emphasis of federal narcotic and
dangerous drug law enforcement from the addict, abuser, and small
time street peddler to the important illicit traffickers and
illegal supply sources will undoubtedly result in fewer total
arrests. But those made should have a greater impact on the
supply of narcotics and drugs available for distribution to the
consumers in this country than a larger number of less
significant arrests.,5 </font></p>

<p><font size="1">Statistics on BNDD's output confirm this shift
in policy to some extent. One would expect that such a change
would result in fewer arrests per agent because of the increased
investigatory work required. Table 5-5 shows that this appears to
be the case.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Consistent with this shift in priorities, BNDD
has begun analyzing the distribution systems for the various
drugs and identifying organizations and individuals involved. The
agency claims that so far it has identified nine principal and
129 secondary international drug-distribution systems and has
immobilized 870 of the 2,150 individuals identified as having
major importance in them.' For several years, there has been a
conflict between BNDD and the Bureau of Customs over operations
in foreign countries. In February, 1970, President Nixon declared
that BNDD would be the accredited agency &quot;in dealing with
foreign law-enforcement officials on narcotics questions. This
announcement apparently resolved the dispute.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">During the last two years, there has been a
major expansion of BNDD's foreign operations. The Bureau had 13
foreign offices in fiscal 1969, 16 in 1970, and 28 in 1971.
During these three years, the number of agents assigned to
foreign posts rose from 26 to 27 to 6111 Of the 50 new agents
requested in the original 1972 budget, 15 will be assigned to
foreign offices, and new offices will be opened in South America
and the Far East.' From President Nixon's supplemental budget
request, $1 million will be allocated to BNDD for international
training and technicalassistance activities.&quot; <br>

</font></p>

<p><font size="1">One of the chronic difficulties of law
enforcement in the drug field is corruption, and the old Federal
Bureau of Narcotics had a substantial problem. In the words of
Attorney-General John Mitchell: </font></p>

<p><font size="1">There was considerable lack of integrity on the
part of many of the agents of predecessor organizations. . . .
Some of them have been indicted. Others have had administrative
procedures instituted against them, and a lot of them have left.
I believe that it is being overcome.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="1">However, because there is so much money in the
drug trade, internal corruption will undoubtedly continue to be a
problem. Indeed, the pursuit of higher-level (and richer)
traffickers will increase the stakes and the temptations. So far,
BNDD has not been involved in any major scandals-a considerable
accomplishment. <br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00022.gif" align="bottom" width="1265"
height="948"> </p>

<p><font size="1">The Bureau of Customs is responsible for the
prevention of smuggling. In fiscal 1972, the Customs budget for
antidrug activities will be $40.5 million, $15 million of which
will come from the supplemental budget request.&quot; Customs
officials state that </font><font size="2">they will actually
spend about $52 million in this area during fiscal 1972. This
estimate is based on a performance-measurement system that uses
random time-sample analysis to determine the allocation of effort
of Customs personnel. Based on this same measurement system,
Customs estimates that $31,600,000 was actually spent on antidrug
activities during fiscal 1971.1' The results of Customs activity,
as measured by the quantity of material seized and the number of
arrests made, is shown in Table 5-6.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For all categories except dangerous drugs, the
quantity of material seized in fiscal 1971 exceeded that of the
previous year, with heroin and cocaine showing the most dramatic
increases. Customs officials say that about 5 per cent of their
seizures are made as a result of tips and 95 per cent as a result
of &quot;cold searches'@--situations in which suspicions were
based on conduct at the time of entry rather than on advance
information.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration
(LEAA) was created in June, 1968, under Title I of the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. Its stated purpose is to
offer &quot;large scale financial and technical aid to strengthen
criminal justice at every level throughout the
nation.&quot;&quot; LEAA is thus a major link between federal
funds and technical expertise and state and local narcoticslaw
enforcement. The major types of financial aid to states and
cities are as follows:<br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00023.gif" align="bottom" width="1263"
height="711"> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Planning grants-allocated to states
according to population for the creation of statewide,
comprehensive law-enforcement improvement plans.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Block-action grants-allocated to states
according to population to carry out specific improvement plans.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">3. Discretionary action grants-awarded at
LEAA's discretion for anticrime programs, with emphasis on
special aid to cities.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Some information on drug-abuse expenditures is
available for the block-grant and discretionary-grant programs.
Some of the planning funds are undoubtedly spent in this area as
well, but the amount is not obtainable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Block-grant funds awarded to state governments
are normally spent in accordance with the comprehensive
law-enforcement improvement plans formulated by the recipient.
The amount allocated to drug-law enforcement in part reflects the
judgment of the states as to the severity of their drug-abuse
problems. The discretionary-grant program represents LEAA's own
allocation of resources to antidrug activities. The agency
emphasizes attempts to improve upon interjurisdictional
law-enforcement techniques, particularly in metropolitan areas
where city-suburban cooperation is important. To some extent, it
seems to try to fill a gap left by BNDD, as that agency now
focuses increasing attention on national drug-trafficking systems
rather than on smaller local groups.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1971, the states allocated $3,172,879
of block-grant funds to 26 programs designed to improve
law-enforcement techniques and efforts, and LEAA used $2,713,206
of its discretionary funds.&quot; Information on the funding
levels for LEAA-financed, drug-abuse programs during 1972 will
not be available until after the close of the fiscal year, since
the grantees of the block grants do not have to file detailed
reports until then. LEAA has not, apparently, analyzed the
comprehensive plans to provide any prediction. Nor has the agency
yet finalized its own plans for the discretionary-grant program.
(In the tables we have presented, it is assumed that
LEAA-financed, antidrug expenditures will remain constant in
1972.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Internal Revenue Service has long had a
more general law enforcement role, in that tax laws are
frequently used against organized crime and other special
offenders. Undoubtedly, the IRS has spent money on investigations
and prosecutions related to drug abuse in the past. However, the
$7,500,000 proposed for IRS in President Nixon's supplemental
budget represents the first funds clearly earmarked for this
purpose. The money is to be used to hire 541 new auditors and
investigators and to pay the incidental expenses of their
investigations.&quot; (The 5 per cent reduction in government
personnel has thrown this plan into uncertainty.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other federal agencies are involved in law
enforcement to a limited extent, as described below.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The President's supplemental budget contained
the first specifically identifiable funds for drug-abuse-related
activities in the Department of Defense. It is not yet possible
to determine the proportion of these funds that will be used for
enforcement purposes, but it will probably be small. The
Department already has its own enforcement system for violators.
(The tables in this chapter do not include any estimate for
Department of Defense law enforcement.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During fiscal 1971, the Department of
Agriculture conducted an experimental marijuana-eradication
program in eleven Midwest counties. The cost of this project
($55,000) was assumed by BNDD. It has not been determined whether
this program will be expanded or dropped in fiscal 1972, or, if
it is continued, which agency will fund the program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The federal government is also placing
considerable emphasis on foreign crop eradication. In fiscal
1970, the Agency for International Development (AID) gave $1
million to Mexico to buy three light planes, five helicopters,
remote sensing equipment, and chemicals and other eradication
equipment. Similar grants totaling $627,000 were made in 1961 and
1965, without apparent effect.&quot; It is not clear whether
additional sums have been spent since, but it seems probable.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Similar emphasis is placed upon persuading
Turkish farmers to substitute other crops for opium. According to
government officials, both loans and grants tied to this purpose
have been made, and BNDD has stated that in 1970 AID had $3
million to spend on it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In 1971, major U.S.-Turkey agreements were
made, whereby Turkey would phase out opium production over the
ensuing years.&quot; No monetary <i>quid pro quo </i>has been
publicly announced, but presumably it is substantial. More
recently, on September 28, 1971, the State Department signed a
U.S.-Thailand Memorandum of Understanding that will make U.S. aid
available to Thailand for the purpose of controlling drug traffic
in that country.&quot; Again, no funding level has been
announced.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The United Nations has established a Fund for
Drug Control, supported by voluntary contributions from
governments and individuals. Before the Fund came into being, the
United States pledged an initial contribution of $2
million.&quot; Presumably, this has been paid, but it is not
clear which agency paid it or whether it is an annual
contribution. In the tables, it is allocated to StateAID for
fiscal 1971 contributions to international organizations. It has
not been annualized.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is difficult to know how to handle these
assistance funds. To carry them at zero is clearly an error, but
any specific number is a guess. A recent newspaper report stated
that the total cost of the program in Turkey would be $35 million
over four years, and that the United States would pay $20 million
of it.&quot; Project staff believe it likely that the United
States will also absorb at least part of the other $15 million in
some form, and that cost overruns are always possible. Given all
the uncertainties, we have estimated State-AID expenditures at
$10 million per year, starting in fiscal 1972. This is probably a
little conservative. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">TREATMENT <b>AND </b>REHABILITATION
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The principal federal agency concerned with
treatment and rehabilitation is the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) within HEW, which operates four types of
drug-treatment programs.&quot; For three of these
programs-community Assistance, NARA inpatient, and NARA
aftercare-funding levels are known: they were $42,445,000 for
fiscal 1971 and will be $99,798,000 for fiscal 1972. Under the
fourth program, the Community Mental Health Centers Act, drug
users are only one of a number of categories of people treated,
and an accurate calculation of expenditures cannot be made.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The Community Assistance Program has expanded
dramatically in recent years. From a budget of $3.1 million in
fiscal 1970 and $21.3 million in fiscal 1971, it has grown to
$76.8 million under the revised fiscal 1972 budget. In his
supplemental budget request, President Nixon asked for $67
million more for NIMH than was contained in the original budget;
of this, $49.8 million will be channeled into the Community
Assistance Program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The increased emphasis on the Community
Assistance Program reflects NIMH's belief that it is most
effective and efficient to treat addicts in their home
communities rather than in a central isolated facility. Treatment
is not confined to any one method. Different centers use
different approaches or combinations of approaches. The modality
chosen for any particular center is the result of the community's
suggestion and NIMH's ratification.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During fiscal 1971, 13,258 patients were
admitted to the 23 operational centers. NIMH estimates that about
10,000 remained enrolled. At the very end of fiscal 1971, 22
additional centers were funded; these did not accommodate any
patients during that year but will add substantially to the total
capacity in fiscal 1972. As funding more than triples in fiscal
1972, it is reasonable to expect even more increases in the
number of operational centers and enrolled patients.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of
1966 (NARA), NIMH operates both inpatient and aftercare civil
commitment facilities. Originally, there were two central
inpatient facilities, one at Lexington, Kentucky, and the other
at Fort Worth, Texas. These facilities were generally underused,
and now, consistent with the emphasis on community treatment,
NIMH has dissociated from Fort Worth and is in the process of
opening a series of smaller, geographically dispersed incare
service facilities. The central facility at Lexington will remain
operational and will serve patients for whom no local facilities
are available. At present, about 700 people are in the inpatient
phase of civil commitment. The second phase of civil commitment
is community aftercare on an outpatient basis. NIMH has
contracted for these services with 144 different community
programs. These units are generally small. Together, they serve a
population of about 1,250. The treatment at each of these centers
is determined by NIMH personnel.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Under the Community Mental Health Centers Act,
NIMH is funding some 450 centers designed to treat people with
basic psychological problems. Many of these centers handle
drug-abuse treatment under this general mandate. Information is
not available on the number of drug users served by these centers
or the amount of money involved. (No estimate is made in the
tables.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Social and Rehabilitation Service (SRS) of
HEW, also funds rehabilitation programs through grants to state
vocationalrehabilitation agencies. In fiscal 1971, an estimated
$1,915,000 was spent for 1-000 &quot;rehabilitations,&quot; and,
in fiscal 1972, SRS expects to spend $3,093,000 for 1,600
&quot;rehabilitations.&quot; The criterion for rehabilitation is
the ability to secure and maintain employment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because of the increased focus on drug-use in
the military, the Veterans Administration is accelerating its
drug-rehabilitation program. In fiscal 1971, the VA inaugurated
its first five drugabuse treatment units. Originally, the VA had
planned to open 13 more centers in fiscal 1972 and another 14 in
fiscal 1973. However, the President's supplemental budget request
included $14.1 million to enable the VA to open all 27 new units
this year.&quot; Each of these units will be located in a VA
hospital and will accommodate approximately 15 inpatients. The
primary treatment modality will be methadone maintenance, with
patients inducted for four to six weeks in the hospital and then
continued on an outpatient basis. VA officials say that they
expect to treat about 6,000 patients under this program during
fiscal 1972.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As of July 1, 1971, the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO) had 20 active grants budgeted at $12.3
million.&quot; OEO concentrates its treatment and rehabilitation
activities on programs for young drug users and assistance to
community groups. OEO funded treatment modalities range from
therapeutic communities to methadone maintenance. Some of the
projects also include an education component, but it is not
possible to extract the amount of money spent by OEO for this
purpose. For fiscal 1972, OEO has requested $18 million for
drug-abuse-related expenditures. The neighborhood health-center
concept would receive increased attention under this plan,
according to OEO.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some Model Cities funds from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development have been used to operate
drug-treatment and rehabilitation centers. Because the funding
mechanism is the block grant, the only information available from
HUD is on fiscal 1971 expenditures-no accurate estimate can be
made for fiscal 1972. The majority of these treatment and
rehabilitation programs are directed toward young users. Services
at the different centers range from outpatient counseling to
comprehensive inpatient care. In fiscal 1971, there were 21
treatment and rehabilitation programs run in 13 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands at a
total cost to HUD of $9,343,000.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Job Corps, part of the Department of Labor,
will spend $200,000 in fiscal 1972 on three drug-demonstration
projects. &quot;The purpose of the . . . projects is to develop
effective program models for man-power training programs to
prevent and control drug misuse by disadvantaged
adolescents.&quot;&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Total LEAA expenditures for treatment and
rehabilitation in 1971 amounted to just over $16.6 million. LEAA
estimates that it allocated over $4.5 million of its own fiscal
1971 discretionary funds to treatment and rehabilitation
programs, and the states spent $12.1 million of the block-action
grants for similar purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">LEAA officials say that the funding rationale
is the relationship between drugs and crime. The medical and
psychological needs of addicts must be treated to eliminate their
criminal acts. These treatment and rehabilitation programs
contain a strong crime-prevention component, most observable in
the treatment and rehabilitation centers run for predelinquent
addicts. Treatment varies from the use of antagonist drugs to
therapeutic communities, and many of the centers offer both
inpatient and outpatient clinical care.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Bureau of Prisons runs two similar
treatment and rehabilitation programs. First, under Title 11 of
the Narcotics Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA), inpatient and
aftercare treatment are provided. The budget for fiscal 1972 is
$2,118,924. The program has the capacity to treat 600 inpatients
for an average of 18 months apiece. The actual population in
treatment, as of August, 1971, was about 375.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Bureau of Prisons does not dispense any
maintenance drugs. Rehabilitation programs center on educational
and vocational training, individual, group, and family
counseling, and &quot;milieu therapy.&quot; The Bureau also runs
a &quot;para-NARA&quot; program, which serves drug-dependent
persons who, for one reason or another, do not qualify under NARA
Title 11. This program, operationally similar to NARA, will be
budgeted at $655,955 in fiscal 1972, and the five centers will
eventually treat a total population of 250. Four of the centers
are now operational, and 104 people are enrolled. The fifth
center is about to inaugurate operations with an initial
population of 39. These figures are exclusive of the Fort Worth
facility, which the Bureau of Prisons has just recently taken
over from NIMH. It is expected that this facility will increase
NARA and para-NARA capacity by only 200. The additional budgetary
allotment required was not available.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The President's supplemental budget request
included the first large-scale identifiable funds for Department
of Defense drugabuse activities. The total request for the
department was $34,255,000, but a functional breakdown of this
budget is not available. The Army will receive $19,699,000, the
Navy $3,231,000, and the Air Force $11,295,000. Of the Army's
funds, $18.2 million will be channeled into a new program-the
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program. The
objectives are defined as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prevention of alcohol and drug abuse</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Identificaton of drug abusers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Detoxification of drug abusers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Rehabilitation of drug abusers, either short
term in Army facilities or long term under the Veterans
Administration</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Suppression of illegal drug distribution</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Collection of statistics and dissemination of
information</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">How much money is to be allocated for each
objective is not known, but it is likely that the primary
emphasis will be on treatment and rehabilitation. The Navy and
the Air Force will establish similar programs, funded,
respectively, at $2.8 million and $11.1 million. The remainder of
the DOD funds will probably be used for research.&quot;<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><b>RESEARCH<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The National institute of Mental Health is the
principal vehicle for government research on drug abuse. As
concern about the problem has mounted, so has the NIMH
drug-research budget. The growth curve is shown in Table 5-7,
prepared for the House Select Committee on Crime by the director
of NIMH. Probably the most important of the &quot;other
divisions&quot; mentioned in the table is psychopharmacology,
which is concerned primarily with the use of drugs in the
treatment of mental illness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The supplemental budget presented by the
President in June, 1971, increased the total amount for
drug-abuse research in fiscal 1972 to $30.7 million. The
allocation of this amount is not known.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">NIMH research covers a variety of drugs,
including marijuana and the opiates, amphetamines, barbiturates,
and hallucinogens. In fiscal 1970, the only year for which we
have figures, the distribution was as follows:<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Drugs</i> <i>$ in millions</i></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Barbiturates 5.3</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Opiates 3.8</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amphetamines 2.8</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Marijuana 2.3</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Hallucinogens 1.8</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other .3<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">TOTAL </font><font size="2">16.3<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This total is higher than the total shown in
Table 5-7, which notes only $15.6 million for 1970. Probably the
material presented to Congress is correct, and the information in
the breakdown by drugs represents preliminary estimates.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug research draws on the disciplines of
chemistry, pharmacology, sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and
epidemiology, alone or in combination. There are no breakdowns by
discipline, but NIMH does have a basic categorization of the
areas within which it makes grants and contracts:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Systematic, controlled evaluation of
currently promising treatment-program techniques</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Development of treatment agents/devices for
use in the treatment of drug dependence</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. Clinical studies of the effects of treatment
drugs and abuse drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Surveys and instrument development to
determine incidence, prevalence, and patterns of drug abuse:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">a. among students</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b. among other groups (hippies, psychiatric
patients, etc.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. New York City Narcotic Addict Register</font>
</p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2">Psycho-sociological studies of drug abuse
        and the abuser to determine the motivation for use,
        environmental influences, effects on personality,
        characteristics of drug-using subculture, etc. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">6. Legal aspects of controlled drugs to
        explore alternative types of legal control systems</font>
    </li>
</ol>

<p><font size="2">7. Genetic studies to determine effects of
drugs on chromosomes and offspring:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a. marijuana</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b. LSD</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. amphetamines and barbiturates <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">8. Use of animal models for studies of abuse
potential of drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9. Exploration of mechanisms of action of drugs
on the brain at the biochemical, neurophysiological, and
behavioral levels:<br>
a. opiates</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b. marijuana</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. amphetamines and barbiturates</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">d. LSD</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">10. Improved chemical methods for systematic
and reliable detection of drug abuse</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11. Chemical studies of plant alkaloids to
determine presence of hallucinogenic properties; to determine
geographic origin of opium</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">12. Development of methods/preparation of
natural and synthetic marijuana</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">13. Development of materials/methods for
campaign on prevention and education of drug abuse</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">14. Training</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">15. Fellowships and scientist development
awards. 31</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many of these categories include only a small
number of projects.</font> </p>

<p><img src="img00025.gif" align="bottom" width="1296"
height="437"> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Addiction Research Center (ARC) in
Lexington, Kentucky, budgeted at about $0.8 million per year, is
NIMH's major facility for intramural drug research. It has two
major functions -the investigation of the addiction potential of
various drugs before they reach commercial channels, and the
development of antagonists to opiates. Basic research into the
nature of drug action, abuse, and dependence is not a primary
function, although ARC has some highly respected researchers who
have done distinguished work in these areas.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the last two years, there has been a major
push to do research on marijuana. The total expenditure has gone
from $1.5 million in fiscal 1969 to $2.8 million in fiscal 1971.
Fiscal 1972 data are not available. Much of the past expenditure
($1.1 million in fiscal 1971) is done on contract, a procedure
&quot;utilized by the NIMH when it is important that the
government define precisely what needs to be done, how it shall
be done, and what the product will be.&quot; Between 1968 and
1972, NIMH did not use contracts for research in any area of drug
abuse except marijuana.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Social and Rehabilitation Service, also a
part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, plans to
allocate approximately $400,000 for research in fiscal 1972. The
bulk of this money will be used to investigate techniques by
which the vocational and social services performed by this agency
may be better utilized to facilitate therapeutic programs
designed for young drug abusers </font><font size="1">.14</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug
Abuse was officially established on March 22, 1971, for a
two-year period. It has a dual purpose: First, it is currently
analyzing the marijuana situation and will, in March, 1972,
recommend any desirable modifications of public policy. During
its second year, the Commission will explore some of the broader
aspects of drug usage under a mandate to investigate the causes
of drug abuse. The budget for fiscal 1972 is estimated to be
about $1 million, allocated entirely to general expenses and
research.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The President's supplemental budget allocated
$2.1 million to the Agricultural Research Service of the
Department of Agriculture. The money will be used to develop
techniques to detect and destroy illicitly grown
narcotic-producing plants without causing adverse ecological
effects.&quot; Two other federal agencies, LEAA and BNDD-both
within the Justice Department-conduct research programs,
primarily to improve law-enforcement techniques.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">LEAA research funds come from the block-action
grant and discretionary-grant programs discussed above and from
programs conducted by LEAA's National Institute of Law
Enforcement and Criminal justice (NILECI).&quot; During the past
two fiscal years, the funding levels for research and education
were as follows: <br>
</font></p>

<p><img src="img00026.gif" align="bottom" width="1284"
height="410"><br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">Figures for fiscal 1972 are not yet available.
The discretionary grants program has not been finalized, and most
states have not yet submitted their plans for the fiscal 1972
block-action grants. In the tables, we assume that the funding
will remain the same as in fiscal 1971.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">LEAA-funded research has emphasized two project
areas: investigation of possible relationships between drug use
and aggressive behavior and crime, and evaluations of
LEAA-funded, community-based treatment and rehabilitation
projects. It can be expected that LEAA research programs will
retain this thrust in fiscal 1972.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">BNDD research is limited to projects directly
related to law enforcement, such as the abuse potential of
particular drugs or the market characteristics of the
drug-distribution system. In fiscal 1971, BNDD had a research
staff of 20 and a total research budget of $1,383,000. For fiscal
1972, BNDD originally asked for a research budget of $1,467,000;
the increase, however, would have covered only the cost of
annualization of positions, and would not have resulted in any
additional activities.&quot; The President's supplemental budget
allocated an additional $2 million to BNDD &quot;for development
and implementation of new technology for detection, surveillance,
communications and automatic data processing as tools in the
enforcement of drug laws.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">Other federal agencies are conducting research
into nonlawenforcement aspects of drug abuse. For the most part,
however, the following programs are limited in scope and
peripheral to the central goals and purposes of the agency
involved.</font> </p>

<p><font size="1">The Job Corps has budgeted $120,000 for a
national drug survey of 16 Job Corps centers in fiscal 1972, to
obtain information </font><font size="2">about knowledge,
attitudes, and patterns of drug use among different subcultural
groups of Job Corps enrollees.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Department of Transportation has been
conducting research on the effects of drugs on drivers and
driving. DOT says that in fiscal 1972 it will spend an estimated
$250,000 on the following studies:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Incidence of drugs in people admitted to a
university clinic after auto accidents</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Investigation of a sample of 1,000 fatally
injured drivers for drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Incidence of drugs in drivers who are not
involved in accidents</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Simulation studies of drug effects</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A study of the driving record of heroin addicts
before and after addiction and while on methadone </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1972, the Veterans Administration
plans to spend $250,000 for a general research program concerned
primarily with the biological and behavioral aspects of drug
addiction and to be conducted in Veterans Administration
hospitals.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
investing a limited amount of funds in drug-abuse-related
research. A budget breakdown is not available, but the agency
estimates that these projects will consume four and a half
man-years of time in fiscal 1972. Two of FDA's most important
activities in this area are reviewing methadone-treatment
programs for medical soundness and reviewing proposals to market
methadone as a proven rather than an experimental drug.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, part of the Department of Defense's
supplemental budget will be used for research activities. The
Army will get $1.5 million for research, development, testing,
and evaluation in fiscal 1972; the Navy and Air Force will be
given lesser. amounts.&quot; Information on specific projects is
not yet available.<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="1">EDUCATION, PREVENTION, AND TRAINING<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is not always possible to distinguish
sharply between this category and other categories. For example,
funds for BNDD programs to educate local law-enforcement officers
are included under law enforcement; treatment and rehabilitation
programs undoubtedly include some money for training the
agencies' own workers; and the line between prevention and
enforcement is not always clear. Programs in this section include
the following types of activity:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Efforts to alert the general public to the
drug-abuse problem and to explain its scope and significance</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Efforts to reach actual or potential drug
abusers and to explain the effects and dangers of drug abuse</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Programs to train education workers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">NIMH programs to train rehabilitation workers
(because of the scope of NIMH rehabilitation programs, the
training activities are sufficiently large to warrant separation)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Information services for persons interested in
the drug field</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1971, the Office of Education (CE)
budgeted approximately $6 million for drug-education programs. Of
this, $2 million was allocated to state departments of education
to train educational personnel. The other major OE endeavors in
fiscal 1971 were 26 community programs, 11 drug-education
projects initiated by local school districts, and 20
college-based pilot programs initiated and operated by students
primarily for fellow students but sometimes with a
community-outreach component.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For fiscal 1972, the Office of Education
originally requested a budget of $6 million to continue existing
programs.&quot; As a result of a supplemental request, however,
OE will receive $13 million for drug-abuse-related programs. The
major new undertaking will be a training program called
&quot;Help Communities Help Themselves&quot;: Eight regional
centers will be inaugurated to train community people on how to
develop and maintain community education and information
programs; in the first year, OE hopes to train about 2,500
people. This project will cost about $6.5 million.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">For fiscal 1972, NIMH has budgeted $2,571,000
for public information services, a nominal increase over the
fiscal 1971 amount of $2,563,000. Part of this money will be used
by the National Clearinghouse for Drug Abuse Information, which
answers general inquiries for information by sending out NIMH
brochures and fact books. More specific requests are answered by
information specialists, who send out reprints of published
articles. The Clearinghouse has also developed a fairly
comprehensive standard bibliography as well as a computerized
information system that lists, indexes, and abstracts published
articles in the field and conducts searches in response to
individual requests.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The NIMH and the Department of Defense and
Justice are cosponsoring a special advertising campaign designed
to counteract peer pressure to use drugs. This campaign, in the
second of three years, has an annual cost of $150,000 equally
divided between the sponsors.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1972, NIMH will spend $6.9 million on
training, compared with $2.1 million budgeted in fiscal 1971.
Part of this increase will be absorbed by the expansion of a
program to develop educational materials and to train lawyers,
ministers, and others who spend part of their time working with
drug-dependent persons.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Office of Economic Opportunity has awarded
a $420,000 grant for fiscal 1972 for the inauguration of a
National Training Institute in Washington, D.C., to provide six
months of intensive training for former addicts working on local
projects, with follow-up training, if necessary.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In fiscal 1971, $3,066,000 of HUD's Model
Cities funds were used for 37 programs in the area of education,
prevention, or training. Within this broad category, the states
have programmed many diverse projects. Some have used their funds
to develop curricula for drug-education programs in the schools;
others have funded workshops for teachers and counselors; still
others have directed their efforts toward the general community.
At least one program has been run for law-enforcement officers.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The job Corps, within the Department of Labor,
will spend $40,000 in fiscal 1972 to develop, collect, and
distribute educational material deemed appropriate and relevant
to the job Corps population.&quot; This project will also help
Job Corps staffs improve their understanding of the problems of
drugs and drug abusers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">BNDD also operates a public-education campaign.
In fiscal 1971, this division was staffed by 26 people at a cost
of $1,215,000. The education division responds to requests from
the general public for information on the drug problem and
preventive programs. This division also provides materials and
films upon request and arranges for speakers for national, state,
and regional programs. In fiscal 1971, BNDD personnel made 1,500
speeches to an estimated audience of 150,000. They also made 191
radio and television appearances. These figures represent
significant declines from the preceding year, apparently the
result of a policy decision to place highest priority on
addressing groups of people capable of establishing ongoing
drug-prevention programs rather than the public at' large. In
fiscal 1972, this division will again consist of 26 people but at
a cost of $1,251,000. This budget increase, however, will cover
only annualization of positions.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">LEAA estimates that approximately $20.2 million
of its fiscal 1971 funds were spent on education, prevention, and
training, more than was spent in any other drug-abuse category.
The major objective of LEAA's program is &quot;to provide
students and adults with the knowledge necessary to make
intelligent decisions concerning the personal use of addicting or
habituating drugs and other harmful substances.&quot; LEAA has
developed the concept of a &quot;concerned community&quot; that
must be made aware of the nature and magnitude of the problem
before it can respond. The agency stresses four programs:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Coordination of local and state public
education and information programs to attain maximum
participation and efficiency </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. Implementation of health-information
programs in every school at the earliest feasible grade level</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">3. Development of educational programs,
seminars, and work-</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">shops designed to provide accurate information
for adults</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Predelinquent counseling services through
the use of neighborhood information centers.&quot; <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The funding level of these programs in fiscal
1972 is not yet known.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">THE SPECIAL ACTION OFFICE<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In his special message to the Congress on June
17, 1971, the President proposed the temporary establishment of a
Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention accountable
directly to the President. Pending congressional approval, the
President, through an executive order, instituted the position of
Special Consultant for Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to fulfill,
to the extent legally possible, the duties of the proposed
Special Action Office. Under this revised organizational plan, it
would become the responsibility of the Special Action Office to
coordinate and direct all the drug-abuse activities of the
various federal agencies, with the exception of those dealing
with the problems of law enforcement.&quot; The President has
requested $3 million in fiscal 1972 for the staff and
administrative costs of the Special Action Office.&quot;<br>

that 500 kilograms of marijuana per day go from Mexico to the
United States. This comes to about 400,000 pounds per year. An
average price of $25 per pound F.O.B. Mexican border does not
seem unreasonable, based on many sources of information. The
exact figures depend, of course, on one's estimate of marijuana
use and average price. A case can be made for almost any figure

<font size="2">The Pharmacology of Consciousness-altering Drugs</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Altered States of Consciousness, Drugs, and
Society <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>THE PHARMACOLOGY OF
CONSCIOUSNESS</i>-<i>ALTERING DRUGS <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The single most important fact to emerge from
research on consciousness-altering drugs in this century is that
individual responses to them result from set and setting as much
as from the drug itself. Occasionally particular combinations of
set and setting completely reverse the &quot;pharmacological
action&quot; of a drug as described in a text on pharmacology.
For example, with proper suggestion and in a restful setting,
amphetamines can produce sedation. Drug, set, and setting,
therefore, appear to be interdependent in shaping drug responses;
no one factor seems vastly more determining than any other.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">This principle is logical enough. No
physiological event takes place without a corresponding event in
the central nervous system. Therefore, every &quot;bodily&quot;
response is actually a psychosomatic response. In the case of
medical drugs like digitalis and atropine, no one is very much
interested in the psychic component of response, so that we have
come to think of these substances as producing constant
physiological responses (although there is still enough variation
from patient to patient to make their clinical administration a
ticklish business). In the case of &quot;psychoactive&quot; drugs
like heroin and LSD, the psychic component of response becomes
the focus of attention; but, because we do not understand it
according to present models of consciousness, we try in vain to
make these drugs, too, fit our simplistic conceptions of
pharmacology. How nice it would be if we could derive a method of
predicting an individual's response to a psychoactive drug from
purely pharmacological considerations. But we cannot do so.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Two upsetting conclusions follow from this line
of reasoning: First, it is impossible to talk meaningfully about
the effects of psychoactive drugs, except by reference to their
effects on specific individuals on specific occasions; and
secondly, pharmacology is not a useful approach to understanding
the effects of these drugs either on individuals or on society. A
pharmacologist, of course, would disagree with me, but his view
of things would be as biased in its own way as that of the
law-enforcement officer who favors continued efforts to stop
people from using drugs by means of the criminal law. Most of
what is written about LSD and heroin in pharmacology texts is
meaningless in this sense: It says nothing about what will happen
to you if you take LSD at eight o'clock tonight; gives you no
power to help me if I come to you for assistance in breaking a
heroin habit; and is quite irrelevant to any considerations of
what the United States ought to do about the continuing increase
in negative use of these drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">What we need is a new science of consciousness,
based on subjective experience rather than on objective
physiology. The materialistic psychology that has dominated
Western thought about consciousness is no longer adequate to the
task of explaining the mind in terms that are useful to us. (An
especially galling aspect of the drug problem for the medical
profession is that psychologically ignorant users of drugs appear
to have more practical information about their effects than
doctors have.) I predict that, from an experiential viewpoint,
many unifying principles of drug states will become visible. In
the pharmacological model, there is some unity; for example,
alcohol, barbiturates, and minor tranquilizers are grouped
together as sedative-hypnotics-a useful grouping, because it
alerts us to the danger that drugs like chlordiazepoxide
(Librium) and meprobamate (Equanil) produce a dependence
resembling dependence on alcohol. But pharmacology offers no clue
why the psychological changes of a marijuana high have much in
common with those of an LSD trip, or why heroin users may be able
to satisfy their need for a certain experience by inhaling
nitrous oxide, a general anesthetic.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the following pages, I will review briefly
what is known and what is not known about the major
pharmacological classes of psychoactive drugs-briefly, because,
in view of the limited usefulness of this scheme of
classification, it is not worth discussing, except at the most
general level. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Alcohol and the barbiturates are associated
with stubborn forms of drug dependence, marked by relatively
constant, doserelated physiological changes, some of which become
irreversible over time. These changes include tolerance (probably
the clinical correlate of the induction of degradative enzymes in
the liver) and withdrawal (a syndrome that persists until
metabolism readjusts to its predrug state). Unlike narcotics,
alcohol and barbiturates cause life-threatening reactions when
they are withdrawn from addicted persons. Chronic use of
sedative-hypnotics is associated with structural damage to the
nervous system; this association is stronger than for any of the
other classes of drugs discussed below. Alcoholism is
particularly associated with chronic liver disease, possibly
because alcohol is directly toxic to liver cells. Barbiturates
are often implicated in accidental selfpoisonings, because
tolerance to the lethal dose does not develop as fast as
tolerance to the hypnotic dose. The minor tranquilizers have been
promoted as anti-anxiety agents, but they behave just like mild
sedative-hypnotics.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most persons use sedative-hypnotics to reduce
anxiety by substituting a &quot;high&quot; state of consciousness
that permits sleep, relaxation, or the mild disinhibition valued
in certain social encounters.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These drugs are associated with dependence
because (1) they do not affect the source of anxiety; (2) the
development of tolerance encourages more and more frequent use;
(3) their use in our culture is strongly linked to destructive
(especially self destructive) behavior patterns; and (4) people
in our society do not know how to make use of altered states of
consciousness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacological model of- these drugs
offers no hope of cure or prevention of dependence on
sedative-hypnotics. It can, however, offer treatment of acute
toxic episodes and withdrawal reactions. It seems unlikely that
elucidation of the exact metabolic derangements underlying
dependence will open the way to any pharmacological means of
intervening in the course of the disease.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nothing important is known about the action of
these drugs on the mind. Since their major action is depression
of neurological activity in the central nervous system, it has
been assumed that the &quot;paradoxical stimulation&quot;
observed with low doses (the high that precedes the stupor of
alcohol intoxication) is the result of inhibition of inhibitory
brain centers (which are conveniently postulated to respond to
lower doses). However, some researchers have suggested that low
doses may have direct excitatory action on nerve cells. That this
kind of debate should still be going on in 1970 suggests how far
we are from understanding conscious experience in physiological
terms. (If alcohol intoxication were looked at by an experiential
science of consciousness, it might turn out that the high is not
causally related to the drug, which might be a pure depressant,
after all.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is ironic that we have chosen our one
sanctioned intoxicant from this class of drugs. In no other class
is pharmacological action (in this case, on liver and nerve-cell
metabolism) so clearly related to long-range physiological
deterioration.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">NARCOTICS<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Like sedative-hypnotics, narcotics are central
depressants that produce stubborn dependence. Unlike
sedative-hypnotics, they are not directly associated with
long-range physiological damage or life-threatening withdrawal
reactions. Tolerance to narcotics develops faster than tolerance
to sedative-hypnotics; hence, visible dependence develops faster.
Because narcotics are illegal, their use is much more bound up
with antisocial, negative, and, often, self-destructive behavior.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Addiction&quot; to and
&quot;withdrawal&quot; from narcotics have become stereotypes in
the public mind, but reality does not often conform to these
conceptions. Far from being a physiological constant, dependent
on dose and frequency of administration of a drug, the physical
craving for narcotics is very much a matter of set and setting.
Some individuals, when they find tolerance appearing, work out a
method of spacing injections of heroin so that they never become
really &quot;hooked,&quot; even though they use the drug
regularly for years. (The number of such persons is unknown but
may be greater than the number of hooked addicts; they often lead
stable lives and may never come to the attention of groups
concerned with narcotics.) Other people seem not to be able to
handle the development of tolerance and quickly go on to
experience strong physiological dependence. Similarly, withdrawal
reactions from narcotics are strongly shaped by
nonpharmacological factors. In a supportive setting with strong
positive suggestion, a heroin addict can undergo comfortable
withdrawal with no medication other than aspirin.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Narcotics do not affect the primary reception
of pain or other sensory stimuli; rather, they alter secondary
perception. A person in pain, given morphine, might say,
&quot;The pain is still there, but it doesn't bother me.&quot; In
other words, the pain is perceived through an altered state of
consciousness. Pharmacological research on narcotics has been
unproductive. In the first place, no real success has been
achieved in separating the analgesic and addicting properties of
this class of compounds. Secondly, the metabolic changes
accompanying narcotics dependence are beyond our present
understanding; even if they were understood, there is no reason
to think our difficulties with addiction would be any fewer.
Thirdly, no purely pharmacological method of controlling
addiction has come along.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The problems associated with heroin (death from
overdose; hepatitis; crime; mental and physical deterioration)
appear to have no causal relationship to the pharmacological
action of the drug. Rather, they correlate better with features
of the social context in which heroin exists in our country. In
fact, the discrepancy between pharmacology and experience is best
illustrated by phenomena accompanying dependence on drugs of this
class.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="1">AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED DRUGS <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Drugs that stimulate the central and
sympathetic nervous systems include the amphetamines (a chemical
class), several drugs that are chemically but not
pharmacologically distinct from the amphetamines (like
methylphenidate-Ritalin; and phemnetrazine-Preludin) , and
cocaine. These drugs cause the release of norepinephrine from
adrenergic nerve endings. Tolerance to them develops very
quickly, but withdrawal from them, although sometimes a
psychological ordeal, has few physiological accompaniments in
contrast to withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics or narcotics.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Little is known about the neurological
consequences of chronic, heavy use of amphetamines. Speed freaks
who take enormous doses of amphetamines intravenously develop a
paranoid psychosis that looks suspiciously organic and may be
correlated with depletion of the body's stores of norepinepbrine.
(It may just as well be correlated with the prolonged wakefulness
induced by these drugs.) To date, there is no firm evidence of
actual neurological deterioration resulting from any of these
drugs, including cocaine. Although low doses do not change eating
behavior in most people (contrary to the claims of
pharmaceutical-industry advertising), very high doses do shut off
the hypothalamic hunger center and can result in severe
malnutrition. The high incidence of hepatitis among amphetamine
users has led to speculation that the drug may be directly toxic
to liver cells. (If this hepatitis is, indeed, chemical, it may
also be due to a common contaminant of black-market methadrine.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Until recently, amphetamine dependence was
considered less serious than narcotic dependence, because it was
&quot;Iess<b> </b>physiological.&quot; In fact, however,
amphetamine dependence is more serious, because it is inherently
less stable. When a person begins to use a tolerance-producing
drug, he must soon face the problem of trying to stabilize his
use in order to keep his life from being disrupted. More than any
other class of drugs, the amphetamines foil a user's attempt to
reach equilibrium with his habit, because they induce such
powerful and unrelenting tolerance. Consequently, users develop
erratic patterns of use, such as &quot;spree shooting&quot; and
alternation with barbiturates and, eventually, with heroin. The
high correlation of amphetamine use with impulsive and violent
behavior is consistent with this pharmacological instability.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Abusive oral use of diet pills may be
associated with serious psychological problems but is not
accompanied by the physical changes associated with intravenous
use.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">HALLUCINOGENS<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Hallucinogens stimulate the central and
sympathetic nervous systems (some are simple derivatives of
amphetamine) but, in addition, induce perceptual changes and the
kinds of mental states associated with trance, mystic rapture,
and psychosis. Except for the visual hallucinations (in
particular, the everchanging, geometric patterns seen on
surfaces), most of these effects are common in altered states of
consciousness unrelated to drugs. The hallucinogens differ from
one another only in duration of action and in relative prominence
of stimulant versus psychic effects. Pharmacological research
tells us little more about them than about the amphetamines; it
offers no satisfactory explanation for the effects of
hallucinogens on consciousness. No one takes these drugs
frequently enough to get into pharmacological trouble with them.
(Tolerance is so rapid that regular consumption is impractical;
you can't stay high on LSD for too long at one stretch.)
Therefore, the pharmacological body of data is quite irrelevant
to our understanding of the difficulties people get into with
hallucinogens. Also, there is no indication that use of these
drugs is associated with physical damage of any kind, in either
short- or long-term use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most bad trips on hallucinogens are
nonpharmacological panic reactions. Others are nonspecific toxic
psychoses-overdose reactions that disappear when the drug wears
off.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1">MARIJUANA<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marijuana differs from the hallucinogens in two
ways: It does not cause hallucinations, and it is not a
stimulant. In fact, marijuana has virtually no significant
pharmacological actions, which probably accounts for its
popularity. It provides a high with minimal physiological
accompaniment, so that people who are anxious about it can easily
pretend to themselves that they have done nothing to their bodies
or minds. For the same reason, it is useless to study marijuana
in the pharmacological laboratory, because there is no
physiological handle on the phenomenon under consideration.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Except for the possibility of lung disease
related to chronic inhalation of the drug, there is no evidence
that marijuana is physically harmful in short- or long-term
usage. No other drug is like marijuana in having so few
physiological effects. For this reason, it seems wise to think of
marijuana as a class unto itself, no more closely related to the
hallucinogens than to the sedative hypnotics. Its unique chemical
structure is consistent with this idea.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">TOXINS, </font><font size="1">GENERAL
ANESTHETICS, AND SPECIAL SUBSTANCES</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Persons who enjoy the altered state of
consciousness called delirium (actually, a nonspecific response
of the brain to a toxin) will occasionally induce it by inhaling
volatile solvents and petroleum distillates such as glue.
Repeated use of defiriants appears to be correlated with
structural damage to the central nervous system. In addition,
petroleum distillates are frequently toxic to the liver,
especially when taken with alcohol. Delirium is characterized by
confusion, disorientation, and hallucination; it is sometimes
called &quot;acute brain syndrome&quot; or &quot;toxic
psychosis,&quot; and it can also occur in response to overdoses
of any of the classes of drugs mentioned above, including
marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">General anesthesia is an altered state of
consciousness induced by a heterogenous class of chemicals, some
of which (ether and nitrous oxide) are occasionally taken for
nonmedical purposes. It is instructive to reflect that no
satisfactory theory has been proposed thus far to explain general
anesthesia in pbarmacological or neurophysiological terms, even
though millions of persons have been put into this state under
close observation. Because the psychic phenomena of general
anesthesia can be reproduced nonchemically (by hypnosis, for
example), it is tempting to speculate that this altered state of
consciousness, too, would be better understood from the point of
view of subjective experience rather than from the point of view
of objective pharmacology.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug users who are deprived of their usual
drugs sometimes resort to special substances like nutmeg and
morning-glory seeds to get high. Many natural products of very
diverse pharmacology have been so employed, and it seems likely
that set and setting determine whether they produce pleasant
altered states of consciousness, sickness, or, indeed, no effects
at all.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>ALTERED STATES OF
CONSCIOUSNESS,</i></font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>DRUGS, AND SOCIETY <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The general thesis of this paper is that drug
experience can be understood only if it is viewed as an altered
state of consciousness rather than as a pharmacological event. A
subthesis is that this approach will make it possible for society
to reduce significantly the problems now associated with the use
of psychoactive drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">All of us experience occasional states of
consciousness different from our ordinary waking state.
Obviously, sleep is such a state. Less obviously, perhaps, are
daydreaming and movie watching unusual modes of awareness. Other
distinct varieties of conscious states are trance, hypnosis,
psychosis, general anesthesia, delirium, meditation, and mystic
rapture. In our country, until recently, there has been no
serious investigation of altered states of consciousness as such,
because most Western scientists who study the mind regard
consciousness as annoyingly nonmaterial and, therefore,
inaccessible to direct investigation. Their research has focused
on the objective correlates of consciousness instead of on
consciousness itself. In the East, on the other hand, where
nonmateriality is not seen as a bar to direct investigation, much
thought has been devoted to altered states of consciousness, and
a science of consciousness based on subjective experience has
developed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would make sense to study all forms of
nonordinary consciousness together, because they seem to have
much in common. For example, trance, whether spontaneous or
induced by a hypnotist, is in many ways simply an extension of
the daydreaming state in which a person's awareness is focused
and directed inward rather than outward. Except for its voluntary
and purposeful nature, meditation is not easily distinguishable
from trance. Zen masters warn their meditating students to ignore
makyo-sensory distortions that often take the form of visions
seen by mystics in rapturous states or hallucinations similar to
those of schizophrenics. And, curiously, the state of being high
on drugs shares many characteristics with these other forms of
altered consciousness, regardless of what drug induces the high.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It is my contention that the desire to alter
consciousness is an innate psychological drive arising out of the
neurological structure of the human brain. Strong evidence for
this idea comes from observations of very young children, who
regularly use techniques of consciousness alteration on
themselves and one another when they think no adults are watching
them. These methods include whirling until vertigo and collapse
ensue, hyperventilating and then having another child squeeze
one's chest to produce unconsciousness, and being choked around
the neck to cause fainting. Such practices appear to be
universal, irrespective of culture, and present at ages when
social conditioning is unlikely to be an important influence (for
example, in two- and three-year-olds). Psychiatrists have paid
little attention to these common activities of children. Freud,
who did note them, called them &quot;sexual
equivalents&quot;-which they may be, although that formulation is
not very useful for our purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As children grow older, they soon learn that
experiences of the same sort may be had chemically-for instance,
by inhaling the fumes of volatile solvents found around the
house. General anesthesia is another chemically induced altered
state of consciousness that many children are exposed to in their
early years. (The current drug-using generation was extensively
tonsillectomized, by the way.) Until a few years ago, most
children in our society who wanted to continue indulging in these
states were content to use alcohol, the one intoxicant we make
available legally. (Incidentally, there are some good reasons
that alcohol may not be a wise choice for sole legal
intoxicant-apart from its devastating medical effects.) Now,
large numbers of young people are seeking chemical alterations of
consciousness through a variety of illegal and medically
disapproved drugs. It is possible to see this change as primarily
a reaction to other social upheavals-and, certainly, much has
been written about the social causes of drug use. It may be more
useful, however, to consider what many drug users themselves say:
They choose illegal drugs over alcohol in order to get better
highs. There is no question that social factors influence the
forms of drug use in a society, or that changes in patterns of
use of intoxicants go along with major cultural upheavals, but we
must remember that every culture throughout history has made use
of chemicals to alter consciousness.* Instead of looking for
explanations of drug taking in a foreign war or in domestic
tension, therefore, perhaps we should pay more careful attention
to how we allow people to satisfy chemically their innate drive
to experience other states of awareness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most societies, like our own, are uncomfortable
about having people go off into trances, mystic raptures, and
hallucinatory intoxications. Indeed, the reason we have laws
against possession of drugs in the first place is to discourage
people from getting high. But innate, neuropsychological drives
cannot be banned by legislation. They will be satisfied at any
cost. And the cost in our country is very great, for, by trying
to deny young people these important experiences, we maximize the
probability that they will obtain them in negative ways-that is,
in ways harmful to themselves and to society.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Why are altered states of consciousness
important? Primarily because they seem to be doorways to the next
stages of evolutionary development of the human nervous system.
We commonly assume that a major division of our nervous system
(the autonomic system) is involuntary-beyond our conscious
control -and that this leaves us open to many kinds of illnesses
we can do nothing about (for example, cardiovascular diseases).
Yet, hypnotized subjects often show an astonishing degree of
autonomic control, to the extent of developing authentic blisters
when touched with cold objects represented to them as being red
hot. And Yogis frequently demonstrate voluntary control of heart
action and blood flow that astonishes physicians; they themselves
ascribe their successes to regular periods of meditative effort,
asserting that there is no limit to what consciousness can effect
through the &quot;involuntary&quot; nervous system. In addition,
creative genius has long been observed to correlate well with
psychosis, and much of the world's highest religious and
philosophic thought has come out of altered states of
consciousness.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">At the very least, altered states of
consciousness appear to have potential for strongly positive
psychic development. Most Americans do not get the chance to
exploit this potential, because their society gives them no
support. The prevailing attitude toward psychosis is
representative. We define this experience as a disease, compel
people who have it to adopt the role of sick, disabled patients,
and then ply them with special kinds of sedatives that we call
&quot;antipsychotic agents&quot; but that simply make it hard for
them to think and to express their altered state of consciousness
in ways disturbing to the staffs of psychiatric hospitals. The
individual learns from early childhood to be guilty about, or
afraid of, episodes of nonordinary awareness and is forced to
pursue antisocial behavior patterns if he wants to continue
having such episodes. Negative drug taking has become a popular
form of this kind of behavior.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I implied earlier that alcohol may not fulfill
the need for alteration of consciousness as well as other drugs.
Like all psychoactive drugs, it does induce a high with positive
potential. (A vast body of prose, poetry, and song from all ages
testifies to this &quot;good side&quot; of alcohol.) The trouble,
however, is that an alcohol high is difficult to control; in
drinking, one slips easily into the dose range where the effects
become unpleasant (nausea, dizziness, uncoordination) and
interfere with mental activity. Marijuana, on the other hand,
maintains a &quot;useful&quot; high over an extremely wide dose
range and allows a remarkable degree of control over the
experience. But, as with other drugs, set and setting determine
the effects of marijuana by interacting with the drug's<b> </b>pharmacological
action. Unfortunately, current social factors create strongly
negative sets and settings, thus increasing the likelihood that
users will be drawn into the negative side of consciousness
alteration instead of being encouraged to explore its positive
potential. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">By focusing our attention on drugs rather than
on the states of consciousness people seek in them, we develop
notions that lead to unwise behavior. Users who think that highs
come from joints and pills rather than from their own nervous
systems get into trouble when the joints and pills no longer work
so well (a universal experience among regular consumers of all
drugs) : Their drug use becomes increasingly neurotic-more and
more frequent and compulsive with less and less reward. In fact,
this misconception is the initial step in the development of drug
dependence, regardless of whether the drug is marijuana or
heroin, whether it produces physiological dependence or not. And
dependence cannot be broken until the misconception is
straightened out, even though the physiological need is
terminated. (Hence the failure of methadone to cure addicts of
being addicts.) By contrast, a user who realizes that he has been
using the drug merely as a trigger or excuse for having an
experience that is a natural and potentially valuable element of
human consciousness comes to see that the drugged state is not
exactly synonymous with the experience he wants. He begins to
look for ways to isolate the desired aspect of the chemically
induced state and often finds that some form of meditation will
satisfy his desire to get high more effectively. One sees a great
many experienced drug takers give up drugs for meditation, but
one does not see any meditators give up meditation for drugs.
This observation has led some drug educators to hope that young
people can be encouraged to abandon drugs in favor of systems
like the transcendental meditation of Maharishi Mahesh. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Society labors under the same delusions as
dependent users. It thinks that problems come from drugs rather
than from people. Therefore, it tries to stop people from using
drugs or to make drugs disappear rather than to educate people
about the &quot;right&quot; use of drugs. No drug is inherently
good or evil; all have potential for positive use, as much as for
negative use. The point is not to deny people the experience of
chemically altered consciousness but to show them how to have it
in forms that are not harmful to themselves or to society. And
the way to do that is to recognize the simple truth that the
experience comes from the mind, not from the drug. (Once you have
learned from a drug what being high really is, you can begin to
reproduce such state without the drug; all persons who accomplish
this feat testify that the nonpharmacological high is superior.)
Ironically, society's efforts to stop drug abuse are the very
factors causing drug abuse. There really is no Drug Problem at
all, rather a Drug-Problem Problem. And it will continue growing
until we admit that drugs have a positive potential that can be
realized.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Many non-Western societies have experimented
with this alternative. The primitive Indian tribes of the Amazon
basin, for example, make free use of drugs but have no problems
of abuse. That is, although these groups use a multitude of
hallucinogenic barks seeds, and leaves, no one takes the drugs to
express hostility toward society, to drop out of the social
process, to rebel against his parents or teachers, or to hurt
himself. These Indians admit that their world contains substances
that alter consciousness; they do not try to make them go away or
to prevent theiruse. They accept the fact that people, especially
children, seekout altered states of consciousness. And, rather
than attempt to deny their children experiences they know to be
important, they allow them to have them under the guidance of
experts in such matters, usually the tribal shamans. Recognizing
that drugs have potential for harm, the shaman surrounds their
use with ritual and conveys the rationale of this ritual to his
charges. Furthermore, the states of consciousness induced by
drugs in these remote areas are used for positive ends, and are
not just lapsed into out of boredom or frustration. Some drugs
are used only by shamans, for communing with the spirit world or
for diagnosing illness; others are used by adolescents in
coming-of-age rites; still others are consumed by the whole tribe
as recreational intoxicants on special occasions.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I am not suggesting that we return to a
primitive life in the jungle, but I do think we have much to
learn from these Amazonian peoples. One reason we are so locked
into wrong ways of thinking about drugs is that no one can see a
goal worth working for, only problems to work against. The Indian
model is an ideal -not something to be substituted overnight for
our present situation, but something to be kept in mind as the
direction to move toward. Let me list the three chief features of
this ideal system as proposals for our own society:<i> <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>1. Recognition of the importance of altered
states of consciousness and the existence of a normal drive to
experience them. </i>There is a considerable lack of
enlightenment in scientific circles concerning the nature of
consciousness, in both its ordinary and its nonordinary forms,
and there would doubtless be resistance from the professional
community to these propositions. But, because consciousness is,
above all, a matter of inner experience, most laymen are quite
willing to accept these ideas. Many adults have simply forgotten
their childhood experiences with altered states of consciousness
and recall them vividly as soon as they try to. Therefore, I
think the possibilities for re-education are good.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As thinking about drugs moves in this
direction, society will become less and less inclined to try to
frustrate the human need for periods of altered awareness, so
that the role of the criminal law in this area should diminish.
At the same time ' there may be a culmination of the present
efforts of younger scientists to bring the study of altered
states of consciousness into the &quot;respectable&quot;
disciplines and institutions. A very great body of information
exists on these states; it simply needs collecting and arranging,
so that we can begin to correlate it with what we know
objectively about the nervous system.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>2. Provision for the experience of altered
states of consciousness in growing children. </i>Rather than
drive children to seek out these states surreptitiously, we must
aim to do as the Indians do: let children learn by experience
under the watchful guidance of an elder. &quot;Drug
education&quot; in the United States means thinly disguised
attempts to scare children away from drugs. True education would
let those who wanted to explore consciousness do so without guilt
and with adult support and supervision. Such explorations should
include drug experience, because drugs are legitimate tools for
altering awareness. Because they have a potential for negative
use, they cannot be used wantonly but must be used in certain
prescribed ways, at certain times, and for certain purposes.
Thus, we must develop a &quot;ritual&quot; for drug experience
analogous to the Indian tribal rituals. We will also need analogs
of the shamans-persons who, by virtue of their own experience
with altered states of consciousness, are qualified to supervise
the education of the young.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>3. Incorporation of the experience into
society for positive ends. </i>It is not enough that we come to
tolerate alterations of consciousness. We must put them to use
for the good of individuals and society. We have come to think of
drug experience as an escape from reality; but, if it is so in
our society, we have made it so. People who can openly and
purposefully spend time away from ordinary consciousness seem
superior when they function <b>in </b>ordinary consciousness.
They are healthier, both physically and mentally; they lead more
productive lives; and they can become numerous enough to
constitute a great natural resource in any society. In addition,
they may be utilizing their nervous systems to their fullest
potentials goal most of us are far from reaching.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">To these three aims, I would add a fourth, not
derived from the Indian pattern:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>4. Encouragement of individuals to satisfy
their needs for altered consciousness by means that do not
require external tools. </i>Any tools used to alter
consciousness-not just drugs-tend to cause dependence, because
they delude people into believing that the experience comes from
them rather than involuntarily from within the mind. To guard
against this tendency, therefore, we must educate people and not
try to do away with the tools. Our goal should be to train people
to live safely in a world where there are things with potential
for both harm and good, to show them that inimical forces can be
changed into friendly ones. To do this, we should not try to
shield young people from things that may harm them; they must
learn by experience. Perhaps it is possible to convince
adolescents that meditation is better than drugs as an approach
to altered consciousness, but they will not believe it unless
they have been through drug experience and seen its limitations
for themselves.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">I will conclude by affirming my belief that
this system is a real possibility and not a hopeless,
unattainable ideal. As such, it is well worth working toward. The
first step need be nothing more than to stop what we are now
doing to prevent us from reaching the goal. And that is nearly
everything we are doing in the name of combating drug abuse.<br>

Great Britain<br>

</p>

<p> <font size="2">Background * The Clinics * Law Enforcement *
Research * The Statistics * Results * Personal Observations<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">After a decade of spiraling narcotics
addiction in England, the trend was reversed in 1970. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The British narcotics problem admittedly is
minor when compared with that of the United States. England had
never counted more than 3,000 narcotics addicts; estimates in the
United States range from 150,000 to 250,000. However, while
American drug experts warn of a continuously growing number of
addicts, Britain's Home Office recently reported a drop of almost
8 per cent, the first since the drug problem became a serious
national concern.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The slowdown had already begun in 1969, when
the annual increase of addicts was held to a trickle, one year
after the government tightened its narcotics policies by limiting
the prescribing of heroin to staff physicians of government-run
drug clinics. Previously, any general physician was permitted to
prescribe heroin. Until the clinic system had been operating for
a year, the number of narcotics addicts in England doubled every
-sixteen months. The reversal of this trend has been accompanied
by a significant drop in new addicts. In 1968, a total of 1,476
previously unknown cases were reported. In 1969, the figure was
1,030, and by 1970 it had dropped to 711.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These encouraging figures, however, concern
only a part of the British drug-abuse problem, albeit the
toughest and the one over which there is the most public concern.
But addicts and abusers of amphetamines and barbiturates are not
included in this count. Furthermore, there is a far greater and
increasing army of marijuana and hashish users, for which there
is no accurate tally.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But, while the latest statistics may give the
English drug scene a more optimistic appearance than it deserves,
the bizarre anecdotes that have been published in both the
English and American press may have colored the past picture with
more despair than is justified.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the twitching kaleidoscope that is
Picadilly Circus, the scene is as harsh and distorted as the
electric letters that flash their spasmodic messages from high
about the throng. The pallid young addicts, staggering out of
doorways to panhandle enough for a fix, casting furtive glances
at passersby while pills or other drugs are exchanged . . . a jab
of a needle in the toilet of the Underground ... a hypodermic
protruding between the toes of a grimy, infected foot . . . a
spurt of fresh blood on a soiled shirt . . . a young girl
collapsing in a doorway after taking a barbiturate injection.
It's all there and more.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These scenes may have become part of the
tourist attractions of London's Times Square, but they don't
reflect accurately the addiction problem in England. Although it
is risky to offer findings in the complex and often-disputed
field of drug addiction, some basic trends are clear:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin addiction is no longer the major
&quot;hard&quot; drug problem in England. The rising tide of new
heroin addicts has been stopped and, in fact, has significantly
receded. The quantity of heroin prescribed in government clinics
continues to decline. Methadone is the most frequently used drug
in England today and is replacing heroin. But the drop in heroin
is not fully matched by the rise in methadone. New addicts tend
to be addicted to methadone rather than heroin, but the number of
newcomers addicted to anything is smaller than in previous years.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone maintenance generally is not
practiced in England as it is in the United States, in that far
more English addicts inject methadone than take it orally.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">British hard-drug users often are polyaddicts,
injecting a variety of drugs, obtained both legally and
illegally. The most recent craze is the injection of
barbiturates, a particularly damaging habit that has raised the
concerns of all those working in the British drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the backbone of the English drug
program is the government-sponsored clinic, where addicts obtain
free drugs, the phrase &quot;British clinic system&quot; is
misleading. There is very little system to the clinics beyond the
fact that they all prescribe narcotics. Clinics vary widely in
services offered, treatment approach, staff, and facilities.
Nevertheless, the clinics are credited widely with curbing the
heroin problem, while the degree of their contribution to the
problem of methadone addiction is debated. Furthermore, clinics
are considered to have had an impact on improving the total
hard-drug picture, but evidence for this generally is subjective
rather than objective and statistical.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although there is some black-market activity
in all drugs, it appears to be on neither a major nor a very
professional scale. No one interviewed claimed that there was a
vast, hidden opiate-addict population supplying itself from the
black market.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No one in England saw any correlation between
drug addiction and a rise in crime.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Finally, the commonly held view in the United
States that heroin addiction automatically turns the user into a
completely antisocial, unproductive misfit is simply not shared
in England. Many English addicts hold regular jobs. Estimates of
employment of all known addicts range from 40 to 50 per cent.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">But perhaps to find the most glaring
difference between the two countries, you have to go back to the
hurlyburly of Picadilly Circus. There, in a locked cabinet on a
medicine shelf at Boots the Chemist, which attracts a
disproportionate number of addicts because it is open all night,
you can find heroin tablets in small bottles. A printed-in-red
retail price list says:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin 100 tablets 18 S.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At the 1970 rate of exchange, this is $2.16.
On New York's streets, the retail price for the same amount of
heroin can run as high as $1,000.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">BACKGROUND<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unlike the United States, England has
consistently treated drug addiction as a medical problem. Even
while moving toward more restrictive policies in the drug-abuse
field, the nation has never wavered from this medical point of
view. &quot;The addict should be regarded as a sick person, he
should be treated as such and not as a criminal, provided that he
does not resort to criminal acts,&quot;' said the Brain
Committee, which formulated the first significant changes in the
country's drug laws seven years ago.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Hard-drug abuse in England, also unlike the
United States, became a problem only in the last ten years or so,
as Table 7-1 clearly indicates. In 1954, the first year
nationwide heroin statistics were available, there were only 54
identified heroin addicts. The majority of the 335 known drug
addicts that year, a total of 179, were addicted to morphine, and
most were women. Also, the majority of these addicts had become
addicted after receiving a narcotic to relieve pain related to a
lengthy illness. Among the few nontherapeutic addicts, a high
proportion were doctors and nurses 'who had experimented with
narcotics and subsequently became hooked.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Today, of course, the numbers, the reasons for
addiction, and the average addict age (see Table 7-2)<b> </b>have
all changed. For example, only 2<b> </b>per cent of the reported
addicts in 1968 were classified as therapeutic. Among heroin
addicts that year, 32<b> </b>per cent were under twenty years of
age. Men outnumbered women by more than 3<b> </b>to 1.<br>

<p> <font size="2">England differs from the United States again
in that its addicts today are not as a rule from disadvantaged
families, are not members of minority groups, and do not
&quot;turn on&quot; to blot out the economic dispair of the
ghetto. <b>&quot;On </b>the contrary,&quot; says Dr. David V.
Hawks, <b>a </b>key staff member of the Addiction Research Unit
of London's Institute of Psychiatry; &quot;those notified in the
1960's were often construed as 'middle class dropouts' whose
addiction, far from being explicable in terms of some material
disadvantage, appears to have been motivated by the deliberate
rejection of middle-class norms <b>and </b>opportunities.&quot; <br>

<p> <font size="1">* Beginning with 1969, this figure includes
addicts to heroin and/or methadone.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">SOURCE: Drugs Branch, Home Office.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="img00028.gif"><font size="1"> </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This does not mean that the poor have escaped
heroin addiction. They have not. But they aren't-by any count-in
the majority.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The basic guidelines for Britain's drug-abuse
policy were established in 1926, a dozen years after America
passed the Harrison Act, which set the stage for the U.S.
addict-criminal doctrine. A committee chaired by Sir Humphrey
Rolleston, a prominent English physician, turned the problem over
to doctors and steered it away from the police. The Rolleston
committee said that doctors should be allowed to prescribe
narcotics to wean patients off these drugs, to relieve pain after
a prolonged cure had failed, and in cases where small doses
enabled otherwise helpless patients to perform useful tasks and
lead relatively normal lives.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Rolleston Committee's findings were the
basis of British drug policy for almost forty years. They were
reaffirmed in general in 1961 by the Interdepartmental Committee
on Drug Addiction, chaired by Sir Russell Brain. However, the
addiction statistics began to move upward, the Brain Committee
was reconvened, and a second report was issued on July 31, 1965.
It recommended the first significant restrictions on the
prescribing of heroin and cocaine.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The report succinctly stated the motivation
and fears behind England's drug policies and their sharp
differences with those of the United States: </font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We have borne in mind the dilemma which faces the
    authorities responsible for the control of dangerous drugs in
    this country. If there is insufficient control it may lead to
    the spread of addictionas is happening at present. If, on the
    other hand, the restrictions are so severe as to prevent or
    seriously discourage the addict from obtaining any supplies
    from legitimate sources, [they] may lead to the development
    of an organized illicit traffic. The absence hitherto of such
    an organized illicit traffic has been attributed largely to
    the fact that an addict has been able to obtain supplies of
    drugs legally. But this facility has now been abused, with
    the result that addiction has increased.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">The Brain Committee recommended the following
changes:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. &quot;All addicts to dangerous drugs should be notified
    to a central authority.&quot; (This authority later became
    the Chief Medical Officer of the Home Office.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. &quot;To treat addicts a number of special treatment
    centers should be established, especially in the London
    area.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>3. &quot;There should be powers for compulsory detention
    of addicts in these centers.&quot; (This recommendation later
    was rejected by the Minister of Health.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>4. &quot;The prescribing of heroin and cocaine to addicts
    should be limited to doctors on the staff of these treatment
    centers.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>5. &quot;It should be a statutory offence for other
    doctors to prescribe heroin and cocaine to an addict.&quot;<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">The government accepted these recommendations
and incorporated them in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1967. In
February, 1968, the compulsory notification of addicts went into
effect. By April of that year, heroin and cocaine prescribing was
restricted to doctors in the newly created treatment centers. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">During the almost three years that passed
between the committee's report and the effective date of its
recommendations, harddrug addiction soared. From 1964, the latest
year for which a full year's statistics were available to the
committee, to 1967, heroin addicts alone increased fourfold, from
342 to 1,299. A year later, the heroin-addict figure reached
2,240.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The committee's concern that
&quot;insufficient control may lead to the spread of
addiction&quot; was more than confirmed. Although it is unjust to
blame the British medical profession alone for the sharp rise in
addiction, the fact is that general over-prescribing and the
activities of a few medical charlatans fueled the craving for
heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some addicts were receiving prescriptions from
general practitioners for as much as 20 or more grains of heroin
a day (1,200 milligrams). Very few addicts used that amount
themselves (a dosage, incidentally, that would kill almost any
American adult). Most beneficiaries of overprescribing doctors
sold their surplus and, of course, addicted others. What is
surprising is that the Disciplinary Committee of the General
Medical Council, the policing arm of the British medical
profession, permitted this situation to continue as long at it
did.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The problem of overprescribing doctors, with
strong hints that their conduct was ethically questionable, was
discussed in print as early as 1965 in the public report of the
Brain Committee:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>From the evidence before us we have been led to the
    conclusion that the major source of supply has been the
    activity of a very few doctors who have prescribed
    excessively for addicts. Thus we were informed that in 1962
    one doctor alone prescribed almost 600,000 tablets (6 million
    milligrams or 6 kilos) of heroin for addicts <font size="1">.3
    </font>The same doctor, on one occasion, prescribed 900
    tablets (9,000 milligrams) of heroin to one addict and three
    days later prescribed for the same patient another 600
    tablets (6,000 milligrams) &quot;to replace pills lost in an
    accident.&quot; Two doctors each issued a single prescription
    for 1,000 tablets (10,000 milligrams).<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Overprescribing was so extensive during the
years after the Brain Committee report and before the opening of
the clinics that pure, British-manufactured heroin was readily
and relatively inexpensively available on the black market, where
imported, illicit heroin was virtually unknown. While prices for
all consumer products rose during this period, black-market
heroin-the overprescribed surplus-held the line against inflation
and stayed at one pound sterling a grain. This meant that, for
$2.40 a day, an addict could support a heroin habit. (Today,
incidentally, British manufactured heroin is both relatively
scarce and expensive on the black market, with a sixfold increase
to six pounds, or $14.40 a grain.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One psychiatrist, reviewing the years
immediately preceding the opening of the clinics, felt that
general practitioners were overprescribing to such an extent
that, for every two addicts receiving prescriptions, at least one
other was maintaining his habit from these supplies. Another
psychiatrist believed that about a third of the reported addicts
were not <i>bona fide </i>addicts at all but were merely sometime
heroin users who conned doctors into issuing regular
prescriptions that they would then sell.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But a few doctors clearly had not been
sweet-talked by addicts into writing too-generous prescriptions.
They had purposely turned the narcotics problem into a lucrative
enterprise with the simple stroke of a pen. They wrote
prescriptions for pay-at a going rate of one pound to two pounds
per script. These were the junkie doctors whose names can be
found in almost every London clinic's case records.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One of them, a dermatologist with a passion
for gambling, ended his prescribing days issuing orders from a
taxi parked in front of the Baker Street Tube Station. He was
nabbed on a technicality-failing to keep proper narcotics
records-spent a short period in jail, and finally had his license
to practice revoked by the General Medical Council after numerous
complaints of his activities from druggists and Home Office
officials. Another was reported to have issued prescriptions to
140 addicts with a daily average of 6 to 8 grains at the height
of his narcotics enterprise. He is also without a medical license
today. He went to jail for conspiracy to commit murder.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While no one knowledgeable about the English
drug scene will say that the nation would not have had a
hard-drug problem had it not been for overprescribing doctors and
outright charlatans, there is consensus that overgenerous
prescriptions, whatever the doctor's motivation, helped
significantly to create the chaotic drug scene that the
government clinic program was expected to remedy.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">THE CLINICS<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, a monthly average of 1,154 drug
addicts obtained government-paid-for heroin and/or methadone and
a little cocaine from clinics scattered throughout England and
Wales. Recently, the clinic figures have remained relatively
stable, fluctuating by fewer than 100 addicts every month. The
number of new addicts registered with clinics dropped from a
monthly average of 66 to 41 in 1971. (See Table 7-3.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nevertheless, it is risky to conclude that
this relative stability in clinic enrollment reflects containment
of drug addiction in England. Some clinics appear to have set a
quota of addicts and simply do not accept, or cannot accept, more
because of staff or</font><font size="1"> facility limitations.
The slow reduction in new addicts, however, is a hopeful sign.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="img00029.gif"><font size="1"> <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">There are 14 clinics in London, which has four
fifths of the country's addicts. Elsewhere, an addict may obtain
drugs at 13 special facilities or at some 42 hospital outpatient
departments These are prepared to service an occasional addict as
part of their regular outpatient program.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The special clinics vary in every conceivable
way-in type of </font><font size="2">facility, size of patient
load, size of staff, treatment approach, and prescribing
philosophy. There is no central authority over the clinics to
provide specific guidelines for staffing or determine treatment
or prescribing policies. Because of this, it is a mistake to
refer to the English &quot;drug clinic system.&quot; There is no
common &quot;system&quot; beyond the fact that addicts may obtain
heroin and methadone from government-supported clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Each clinic director is doing &quot;his own
thing,&quot; based on his own particular approach to drug
addiction. He works with the facility, staff, and budget he was
able to get from his own hospital and Regional Hospital Board,
the governing body that supervises medical care for a given area.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">These various approaches have not been
evaluated comparatively for cost or effectiveness. The addicts,
however, are usually in agreement about which are the
&quot;best&quot; clinics in a less than scientific rating system,
which might be called the &quot;Santa Claus&quot; scale. It ranks
candidates on their drug-prescribing generosity.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The lack of central direction is the result
not of careless management but rather of design. Americans often
have the impression that the British National Health Service is a
monolith that dictates everything from aspirin dispensing to
appendix removing, but the fact is that the government's Ministry
of Health has approached physicians both within and outside of
the National Health Service with the circumspection of an
impresario dealing with a diva.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">After the government accepted most of the
second Brain Committee recommendations and prepared the necessary
legislation to implement them, the Department of Health and
Social Security issued a memorandum to Regional Hospital Boards
and hospital governing groups.' The Ministry directed its memo
particularly at mental hospitals and psychiatric departments of
general hospitals. As a result, today the clinic directors are
psychiatrists, most of whom follow a general psychiatric practice
in addition to their interests in the drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Health Department memorandum included a
list of the known addicts in each Regional Hospital area. Since
most addicts were in the London area, it asked city hospitals
with psychiatric departments to plan for drug clinics. At the
same time, the Health Department asked hospitals to set up
inpatient beds for withdrawal treatment and to assess addicts who
would obtain their drugs as outpatients for the required dosage.
Today most clinics have such beds available to them.
Significantly, the &quot;how&quot;<b> </b>of operating clinics
was not described.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The decision to supply an addict with drugs
and whether to seek to substitute other drugs, the assessment of
dosage, and the method of supply rest with the clinician. It is
to be expected, however, that where possible, the dosage will be
determined by assessment during inpatient observation and that
this will usually be offered, though continued treatment cannot
be made conditional on acceptance. [This in-hospital assessment
is rarely done today, and it is clear that most clinic directors
reject this Health Department &quot;expectation.&quot;] The
organization of services will depend on the method of supplying
drugs that is adopted by clinicians. It is, however, desirable in
any area that there should be a fairly uniform approach;
otherwise, the organization of services and the sharing of the
load will be obstructed because addicts will gravitate to those
clinics where they think drugs are easiest to get. While direct
administration of drugs by the medical staff of the treatment
center is not excluded, supply by the hospital or by retail
prescription is likely to be more generally practicable.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinics have certain statistical reporting
obligations, both to the Health Department and the Home Office.
There is an exchange of views and information among clinic
directors and other medical staff members at periodic meetings
called by the Health Department. A department official told me
that these meetings generally are held every two months, but the
records show that such sessions are usually held on an irregular
basis. Minutes of the meetings indicate that not all clinics are
represented at every meeting and not every clinic director
attends regularly. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">FACILITIES<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The differences between clinics is apparent
from inspection of their physical facilities. In the naval-base
city of Portsmouth, the clinic is in a large general hospital
tucked behind a door marked &quot;Dental Waiting Room.&quot; In
East London, the center is in its own building on the grounds of
a mental hospital. In the Denmark Hill area, it is part of the
hospital's general outpatient department.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If you visit St. Giles Clinic in the Church of
England Community Center, you are reminded of an Alec Guinness
movie. Dr. James H. Willis, a young psychiatrist, holds court
resplendent in a white medical coat, seated behind a large wooden
table in a room marked &quot;Lecture Hall.&quot; He is flanked by
two pianos and a bass fiddle. Above and behind his head, a brass
plaque reads: &quot;The trustees of St. Giles Center gratefully
acknowledge the generous support given by the Rotary Club of
Camberwell.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is doubtful that the Rotarians would rush
to support the effort now going on in the lecture hall. It is
lack of such support that has prevented Dr. Willis from using a
new $192,000 building specifically constructed for his drug
clinic by the two hospitals and the Regional Hospital Board
sponsoring it. The building, which includes eight single rooms
for inpatient assessment, stood empty for more than a year after
it was completed. Public protest -exploited by local
politicians-forced the hospital to rescind its decision to bring
young addicts into the middle-class neighborhood of St. Giles.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In his churchly retreat, Dr. Willis has no
facilities even for basic medical examinations, and patients
leave urine specimens in the center's men's room. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">STAFFING<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A most basic difference among clinics is in
the kind and size of staff that operate them. One of the most
significant contrasts is between St. Clement and Lambeth Hospital
Clinics. The staffing patterns are as follows:<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <i><font size="2">LAMBETH </font></i><font size="2">(96
active patients) <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors:</font> </p>

</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 1 </font><b><font size="1">1/2 </font></b><font
size="2">days a week</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I psychiatric intern 1 </font><font size="1">1/2
</font><font size="2">days a week</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Social workers:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nurses:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">10 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secretary: 1<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The nurses at St. Clement function like social
workers: they counsel patients and make home calls both to
patients and to their families, relatives, or close friends.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Lambeth Clinic, run by Dr. Thomas H.
Bewley, a wellknown author of medical articles on the English
drug scene, is far closer to the English clinic prototype.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The besieged Dr. Willis at St. Giles,
incidentally, was even worse off when it came to staffing. With
75 active patients and 64 inactive patients, the clinic included
three doctors, two full time and another one-third time. Although
there were two slots for social workers, both were temporarily
empty. Dr. Willis has no nursing help. His only other assistance
comes from a secretary and a hospital porter, who acts as
factotum around his piano-flanked emporium.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement, in terms of staff time for the
addict, is clearly exceptional. It was originally intended as a
day hospital where an addict would come for the entire day,
returning to his home only at night. The original staffing
pattern was retained when the clinic was turned into what can be
described more accurately as a day center that addicts of the
clinic may or may not attend. There is a ping-pong table, art
classes, and a &quot;fixing room&quot; where addicts can inject
themselves. Individual and group therapy sessions also are held
in the day center.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among all London clinics, the amount of
social-work time provided to addicts varies from 475 hours per
week (St. Clement) to none, according to a questionnaire filled
out by the clinics themselves.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Because of the difference in staff time
between St. Clement and Lambeth, the addict's relationship to
these clinics is vastly different. At St. Clement, each social
worker and nurse has about ten cases. They know each addict by
his first name, and the easy, relaxed relationship that comes
with familiarity is evident. One addict, for example, came in to
show his nurse pictures of his recent wedding and to thank her
for her congratulatory telegram.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At Lambeth, the lone social worker, who
provides twenty hours a week, has a caseload of 30 addicts out of
the 96 active with the clinic. Of the 30, she estimated that she
has what she called <i>&quot;a </i>deep relationship&quot; with a
half dozen. &quot;They get a good half hour a week.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Of the clinic's work, she said: &quot;We're
containing it, regularizing it a bit; but, we're not treating it.
I think I do first aid a lot.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At St. Clement, staff members were slightly,
but not much, more encouraging. Not only did this clinic
represent the most concentrated staff effort with addicts, but
its patients resemble American ghetto addicts more closely than
any other London group.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement is a 128-bed mental hospital in
East London, an area that in terms of income and class-but not
color-can be compared to New York's Harlem or Bedford-Stuyvesant.
The addiction clinic of St. Clement serves patients from the
surrounding neighborhoods, the bleak row houses that bring to
mind a Charles Dickens novel. Eighty per cent of St. Clement's
addiction clinic customers are East End boys; the other 20 per
cent come from the far more affluent middle- and upper-class West
End.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While an estimated 10 per cent of the East End
population is colored (i.e., Negro, Indian, Pakistani), only one
of the clinic's 100 patients is half-Negro. This appears to
reflect accurately the fact that in England few
&quot;colored&quot; are involved with narcotic drugs.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic is located on the hospital grounds
in a separate pre-fah building constructed especially for this
use at a cost of 14,000 pounds, or $33,600. The annual operating
cost for salaries and drugs is estimated by its director to be
about the same amount.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Psychiatrist John Denham is both clinic
director and head of the St. Clement Hospital. Much of the
day-to-day operation of the clinic fell on Dr. Margaret Tripp,
the full-time psychiatrist who served at the clinic from the
summer of 1968, when it opened, to 1971.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Neither Dr. Denham nor Dr. Tripp makes any
grand claims for the clinic, even though they, and it, have
received considerable publicity in U.S. media (Look magazine,
various television and radio networks). Dr. Denham has a thick
file of letters in response to this publicity requesting
permission to visit and interview him. He does not trade on this
notoriety.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As is true of virtually all other clinics, St.
Clement's heroin dispensing is dropping monthly-from 214 grams in
March, 1969, to 73 grams in May, 1970. Methadone, both ampoules
for injection and oral, has increased at St. Clement, but not in
proportion to the drop in heroin. Dr. Denham attributes this
heroin reduction to the use of methadone, to more conservative
prescribing, and to greater expertise among clinic doctors. He
readily admits to the confusion that apparently hit every clinic
in the opening period of 1968. &quot;A drug addict presented
himself and said he needed six grains of heroin a day. We knew he
could do with two, but that he would settle for four. It was as
haphazard as that.29</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The same kind of candor is evident in a paper
published by Dr. P. H. Connell, another of the early pioneers in
drug-addiction control in England.' Reporting on 107 narcotics
users attending a London clinic between March, 1968, and
February, 1969, Dr. Connell acknowledged that some of these
patients had become addicted to drugs by the clinic.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">REGISTRATION<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How do you begin obtaining free drugs?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some of the addicts interviewed are convinced
it is getting harder to get on the rolls. Some say that, for a
new addict to get on, be has to buy black-market narcotics for a
while and then show wicked withdrawal symptoms.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors discount the severity of these
statements but acknowledge that they are getting more
conservative. Interclinic monthly heroin and methadone
prescription quantities are distributed among the clinics, and
this may have developed a touch of competition to stay in the
range of low prescribers. At St. Clement, for example, a monthly
graph is kept showing its standing against the all-London
average.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors agree that identifying an addict and
prescribing the correct quantity of drugs is the toughest part of
their jobs. They use words like &quot;haggling&quot; and
&quot;bargaining&quot; sessions to describe the difficulties of
deciding how much an addict should receive.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Health Department's suggestion of
in-hospital assessment before prescribing to addicts generally is
not part of the procedures of the London clinics. An occasional
applicant may be sent for observation for several days, but this
is the exception and not the rule.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In Portsmouth, however, Dr. Ian Christie will
not accept a new patient unless he agrees to three days of
hospitalization to determine the kind and size of his habit, or,
for that matter, if indeed he has one.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In London, addicts arriving at a clinic for
the first time, or to reapply, usually are given at least two
interviews. The first may be with a nurse or social worker and
the second with a clinic psychiatrist. After acceptance, addicts
generally report once every week to their psychiatrist or social
worker. Some are requested to come in several times a week, while
others, who may be more stable, are permitted to report every two
weeks.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Before acceptance, one, and sometimes several,
urine tests are scheduled, usually two or more days apart.
Drug-positive urine tests play a key role in the decision-making
process.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Urine tests, incidentally, are not regularly
scheduled for every addict after he has been accepted by a
clinic. Their frequency varies from clinic to clinic. At St.
Giles, Dr. Willis formerly demanded only sporadic urine tests.
Now, however, every patient gives a sample at each clinic visit.
In other clinics, it appears that tests are made when there is
some suspicion of other than clinic-prescribed drug use.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A key step in the preacceptance interview
procedure is the completion of a form outlining the addict's
biography, his drug history, and his physical characteristics.
This is sent to the Home Office, where it is compared with the
master list of registered addicts. The procedure helps to
identify previously unknown addicts and to prevent duplicate
registering at two or more clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Have addicts succeeded in getting on the rolls
of two different clinics? Yes, but how many or how often is
difficult to document. At St. Clement, Dr. Denham does not
remember a case where the Home Office check produced duplicate
registration. However, he does recall an incident indicating that
the problem is real. Not long after the clinic opened, a boy,
while stoned, told his fellow addicts that he was obtaining drugs
from two clinics. This came to the attention of the staff, and a
nurse was sent to the clinic closest to St. Clement. Seven
addicts were identified as St. Clement boys and five others
confessed to duplicate registration. At the time, this
represented 12 per cent of the St. Clement caseload.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;Did that surprise you?&quot; I asked Dr.
Denham.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;At the time, it annoyed me.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Connell, in his study of 107 drug users,
also found that four had been attending other clinics, where they
requested help without, of course, acknowledging the duplication.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">From observation, it appeared that a seasoned
addict with a long Home Office or clinic record, or both, had
much less difficulty in re-registering at a clinic than a
previous &quot;unknown.&quot; Dr. Bewley permitted me to sit in
on a series of interviews with addicts applying to the Lambeth
clinic. All had been previously interviewed by the clinic's
part-time psychiatrists, who also sat in on these second
interviews.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">My notes for this session are as follows:</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Male, out of prison since May 1. Was with
Lambeth a year ago, had received 200 mg. daily of heroin and
methadone; long criminal record, most recent possession of
burglar tools, <i>cannabis; </i>told to return for urine test.
Dr. Bewley indicated he probably will be reregistered with 20 mg.
methadone a day as starter. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Male, long criminal record, now under
three-year suspended sentence; long drug history, longest period
off drugs was six weeks; told to come back for urine test. Dr.
Bewley indicated he probably will be put on clinic rolls. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">3. Male, 23, in and out of series of building
industry jobs; said he started with drugs at 16, shooting heroin
and methadone at 20; said now buying six ampoules of methadone a
day on black market at $1.20 per ampoule or $7.20 for day's
supply; no criminal record; first urine test showed methadone;
told to come back after weekend for another urine test. Bewley
estimated there was a 50-50 chance he would not be back. If he
comes and test is positive, he probably will be accepted. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">Dr. Connell, in his study of the previously
cited 107 drug users at a London Clinic, found a large dropout
rate between urine tests. &quot;Refusal to prescribe at first
attendance, whilst awaiting results of urinalysis, led to a high
incidence of failed reattendance. Thus 92 per cent prescribed
heroin reattended, whilst only 35 per cent prescribed no drugs
returned.&quot; This was true, even though 22 out of 36 who had
been given no drugs had positive urine tests.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">This led Dr. Connell to conclude: &quot;In
view of the essential need for accurate diagnosis, it seems
inescapable that a prescribing method of management should not be
adopted until firm evidence of daily use is obtained by, say,
three consecutive positive urines collected on different days and
over a period of ten days or more to take into account the fact
that methadone is excreted more slowly than morphine.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">4. Female, 23, no previous history with
clinic; arrested four times, shoplifting, abuse of floor walker;
said she was taking 130 mg. heroin daily obtained from black
market. She was turned down.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The psychiatrist who first interviewed the
girl acknowledged, as did Dr. Bewley, that much of this
decision-making process is guesswork. Will this girl now go out
and steal enough merchandise to fuel what may be a drug habit?
Will she overshoot herself to convince Lambeth or another clinic
that she really is addicted? No one could answer these questions.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">DRUG DISPENSING</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="1">None of the London addicts receives his drugs
from the medical staff in the clinics. Rather, a prescription is
mailed directly </font><font size="2">to the druggist of the
addict's choice. Only on rare occasions does the addict receive a
prescription personally-for example, if it is clear that the post
office cannot deliver it in time to fill an immediate need.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Each prescription form is filled out by the
clinic physician, generally for a week's supply. Prescription
blanks are kept under lock and key, for there is a black-market
price on blank National Health Service prescription forms.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Although a week's order may be on one
prescription, the addict must collect his supplies from the
druggist daily. On Saturday, he generally receives two days'
supply because of Sunday closing. Black-market prices for drugs,
incidentally, are highest on Sundays, because of weekend demands
by occasional users and addicts who have shot up their two-day
supply on Saturday.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drugstores are monitored periodically by the
police. However, these reviews generally are confined to the
larger distributors of drugs. The Scotland Yard Drug Squad has
four detectives specifically assigned to inspecting drugstores.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Drugstores keep detailed records of both
incoming and outgoing drugs. I examined this procedure in Boots
Picadilly, the all-night drugstore in London's famed square.
Dangerous drugs are kept in a special locked cabinet. Each
prescription is double checked and, of course, recorded. One
pharmacist will make up the order and initial the package, which
is checked by a second pharmacist. This particular store served
36 addicts daily at the time of this review.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Retail prices are standardized. Heroin is a
bargain compared with the various forms of methadone. The 1970
retail prices were as follows:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Heroin 100 tablets (10 mg. each) 1000 mg.
$2.16</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Methadone 100 ampoules (10 mg. each) 1000 mg.
7.50</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Methadone linctus (syrup) 5 bottles (200 mg.
each) 1000 mg. 7.80</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since addicts come under National Health
Service coverage, the drugs are free except for a small-25
cents-weekly service charge. Disposable needles and syringes are
provided directly to addicts by some clinics or are supplied by
the drugstore.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I was able to locate only two clinics in
England that provide drugs administered directly by the staff.
These are in Southampton and Portsmouth. I visited the Portsmouth
clinic, directed by Dr. Ian Christie, in St. James Hospital.
Because of the small number of patients, significant conclusions
cannot be drawn from the in-clinic, drug-administering approach
at this hospital. Seven addicts, six receiving methadone and one
heroin, come to the clinic twice a day for their injections.
These are given by hospital nurses in early-morning and
late-afternoon sessions in the hospital's dental department.
Injections are given in the deltoid muscle. The methadone addicts
I interviewed said that they do not get a &quot;flash&quot; from
the methadone intramuscular injection as they did from heroin
when they administered it intravenously themselves in preclinic
days.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although all addicts mentioned the
inconvenience of coming twice a day to the hospital-which is not
centrally located-only one complained vociferously about it. He
said he had to take a cab from work daily in order not to miss
his second injection, at the 5:15 afternoon clinic. His employer
was unaware of his addiction and, he said, probably would fire
him if he found out.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In addition to the twice-daily clinic
patients, Dr. Christie has four others receiving methadone
linctus which he provides via prescription and two heroin
addicts-a husband and wife with a long history of addiction-who
also receive prescriptions and administer the drug themselves.
&quot;This probably was a mistake,&quot; Christie said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">None of those receiving any drug is provided
with any rehabilitation services. &quot;if they chose drugs, they
get drugs,&quot; Dr. Christie said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">He gives each addict alternatives: hospital
in-patient withdrawal (&quot;Everyone who has tried that method
has relapsed&quot;); in-hospital assessment with subsequent
in-clinic daily drug taking; and, finally, entry into a
therapeutic community, called the Alpha Unit.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">PRESCRIPTION TRENDS <br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since the clinics began operating in 1968, the
quantity of heroin used by English addicts has been greatly
reduced. In the clinics, the monthly total grams of heroin have
dropped from 2,177 in January, 1969, to 1,131 in December, 1970
(see Table 7-4).</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Furthermore, while in 1968 the vast majority
of English addicts were taking heroin, today the majority are
taking methadone alone or in combination with heroin. Whatever
the opiate, the daily amount each addict takes is generally
significantly less than the preclinic daily quantity.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Statistics show that only 10 per cent, or 140,
of all known addicts receiving opiates were receiving heroin
alone on December 31, 1970. However, this may be somewhat
misleading, not only because the reporting procedure may be less
than perfect, but because prescribing physicians frequently
change both the quantity and the kind of drug prescribed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is important to remember that methadone in
England most frequently is provided for intravenous injection (as
is heroin), and not for oral consumption, as is common in the
United States. More than twice as much methadone is prescribed
for injection as orally. Most important, injected methadone has a
good &quot;rush&quot; -oral methadone does not.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Most clinics have adopted the policy of moving
from heroin to methadone. Often, this is done gradually by giving
a combination of heroin and methadone for a certain period and
then shifting to methadone only. Finally, an attempt is made to
shift to oral or linctus methadone. Psychiatrists agree that the
hardest task beyond total drug abstention-is to convince the
addict to give up the needle.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This prescribing trend is reflected in the
individual clinics. Here are some samples:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Larnbeth-8 on heroin alone, 12 on methadone
and heroin, 76 on methadone alone</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement-36 on methadone and heroin, 35 on
methadone</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Giles-54 on heroin or methadone and
heroin, 1 1 on methadone for injection, 10 on methadone oral</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Charing Cross-2 on heroin, 10 on methadone and
heroin, 45 on methadone for injection, 33 on methadone oral</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Portsmouth-3 on heroin only, 6 on methadone
for injection, 4 on methadone oral</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The shift from heroin to methadone is further
indicated by the fact that clinics today infrequently interview a
new heroin addict. The head nurse of the largest London clinic,
Charing Cross, could not recall the last time a new heroin addict
had been interviewed; all the new cases were methadone addicts.
In Portsmouth, Dr. Christie said, no one addicted to heroin had
applied for help in the previous year; all the newcomers were
methadone addicts.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">METHADONE MAINTENANCE <br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Directors of government clinics do not
practice the Dole Nyswander methadone-maintenance technique,
emphasizing blocking the effect of heroin. Significantly, four
clinic directors expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the
blocking method. Dr. Christie, for example, believes that
methadone blocks heroin in American addicts because they are
accustomed to receive low and diluted doses of the latter drug.
&quot;When an addict takes only four or five $5 bags a day, which
don't contain more than 20 milligrams of heroin, then it
works.&quot; The others agreed that an addict who takes large
doses of heroin daily cannot be blocked with methadone.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, a private London clinic, run by Dr.
Peter A. L. Chapple, has experimented with the
methadone-maintenance approach known in the United States. This
is the National Addiction and Research Institute, which has at
least as many active patients as the biggest government clinic.
Dr. Chapple prescribes only oral methadone. He is not licensed to
prescribe heroin in his clinic, and he is opposed to prescribing
methadone for injection because it perpetuates the needle cult.
In 1969, he prescribed oral methadone to 106 patients, 70 per
cent of whom were receiving blocking dosages (between 100 and 200
milligrams a day). There are no scientific data available
indicating whether these addicts actually were blocked from the
effect of heroin. Recently, however, Dr. Chapple said that he has
been trying to</font><font size="1"> reduce the dosages of oral
methadone. &quot;It probably was a mistake to go as high as 200
milligrams a day,&quot; he added. The maximum is now 100
milligrams a day, while younger addicts are more likely to be
around the 30-milligram-per-day level. Dr. Chapple said he has
shifted from giving a blocking dose because there is less heroin
around. He said he wanted to satisfy the drug hunger and not
necessarily to block heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <img src="img00030.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="1">*Interclinic statistics kept only since
September, 1969. <b>SOURCE: </b>Department of Health and Social
Security.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">He acknowledged that it is very difficult to
work with younger </font><font size="2">addicts using oral
methadone, largely because of their delinquent and erratic
behavior. Last year, a young addict died as a result of taking
barbiturates while also taking oral methadone. (Dr. Connell, in
his examination of 107 addicts at a government clinic, also
recorded an oral-methadone overdose death. This involved an
addict on 100 milligrams a day who obtained the next day's supply
shortly after midnight and drank both within hours of each
other.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If England's drug doctors do not subscribe to
methadone maintenance, why have they shifted so dramatically to
methadone from heroin?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">First, the very creation of the clinic
approach was prompted by what England viewed <i>as </i>a growing
heroin epidemic. There was public and political pressure to halt
the rise in heroin addicts. The monthly distribution of a dossier
showing the amounts of heroin prescribed by each clinic made it
clear to each clinic director where he stood among his peers in
this respect and undoubtedly created pressure to bring the
quantity down.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secondly, there is general agreement among
clinic physicians that methadone has a longer-lasting effect than
heroin. Thus, the addict needs fewer injections a day.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Thirdly, methadone for injection is considered
somewhat more sterile than heroin, since it comes in liqui4 form,
so that the addict merely transfers the ampoule content directly
into his syringe. With heroin, he mixes a 10-milligram pill with
water, usually unsterile and sometimes from a tap or even a
toilet bowl, to dissolve the pill before injecting.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Finally, methadone for injection is viewed by
a number of doctors as the bridge to oral methadone. Breaking the
needle cult is considered an important success step in the
drug-treatment program in England.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unfortunately, addict performances on heroin,
methadone for injection, and oral methadone have received no
detailed scientific comparison in England.
Furthermore-surprisingly, to an outsider-methadone continues to
be available outside of the drug clinics. There is nothing to
prevent general practitioners from prescribing it. A few, in
fact, do. (Scotland Yard Drug Squad detectives, who monitor
drugstores, say that about six London doctors prescribe methadone
on a regular basis.) Ironically, the second Brain Committee
foresaw the possibility that a substitute drug might become
potentially as dangerous as heroin. When the committee urged and
achieved prescribing restrictions on heroin, it said: &quot;If,
in future, circumstances should change, and other drugs of
addiction should take the place now occupied by heroin and
cocaine, it would be necessary promptly to amend the 'restricted'
list accordingly.&quot; A number of leading professionals have
urged that methadone be placed on the &quot;restricted&quot;
list, but this has not been done.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic shift from heroin to methadone,
plus the absence of prescribing prohibitions on general
practitioners, undoubtedly had led to a new metbadone-addiction
problem. The key issue is how big a problem it is. The over-all
clinic drug-dispensing statistics indicate strongly that
considerably lower quantities of combined heroin and methadone
are being prescribed today than the largely heroin-only
prescriptions at the beginning of the clinic era, but exactly how
much lower is impossible to show, since methadone statistics were
not reported until September, 1969.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, it appears that there has not been a
simple switch from a heroin to a methadone problem. Doctors
interviewed are concerned about rising methadone cases but do not
suggest that they are replacing heroin cases on a one-for-one
basis. That is, the methadone increase is moving at a
considerably slower pace than the sharp drop in heroin addiction,
although no one can document the relative rates of change.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The police, however, are less inclined to make
distinctions. In a 1970 report, Scotland Yard said:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There has been a transference of addiction in as much as
    the treatment centers have succeeded in reducing the amount
    of heroin prescribed to addicts, thereby reducing the
    availability of this drug on the &quot;illicit market.&quot;
    But, in so doing, they have increased the prescribing of
    methadone to counterbalance this reduction; consequently,
    there is now far more methadone available on the
    &quot;illicit market.&quot; <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <center><font size="1">DRUGS OUTSIDE THE CLINICS<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How many other drugs do addicts take to
supplement those prescribed by the clinics?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While evidence in this area is both
fragmentary and sometimes disputed, there is agreement that
English addicts often supplement the clinic-prescribed drug diet,
with a wide assortment of chemicals that affect both the mind and
the body. These include black-market methadone or heroin,
amphetamines, barbiturates, tranquilizers, and marijuana, or, for
that matter, a smattering of all of them. In short, the addict in
England more often than not is a polydrug taker.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The most significant evidence comes from a
wide-ranging study conducted by two staff members of the
Addiction Research Institute. Between March and November, 1969,
they interviewed in depth I I I heroin users attending the London
clinics, representing about 10 per cent of all clinic patients in
England.' The results showed that only a small proportion of
English addicts can be considered &quot;stable&quot; in their
drug-taking habits.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Several clinic directors expressed
reservations about the study, claiming that it did not represent
a true cross-section of their population since it included only
active heroin addicts. At the time of the interviews, they said,
many of their patients, particularly the more promising ones, had
already been weaned off heroin and onto methadone only. The
study, however, did include 91 (of the 111) who were receiving
heroin in combination with methadone.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Eighty-four per cent reported to interviewers
that in the month prior to the interview they had used drugs
other than those prescribed for them by the clinics. Among these
other drugs, the largest number reported using barbiturates and
tranquilizers (75 per cent), which, in the majority of cases,
were prescribed by private physicians. This is an important
indication that extracurricular drug taking did not necessarily
mean adding larger doses of illegally obtained narcotics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The range of drugs used is demonstrated in
Table 7-5. These statistics show that the one additional drug all
1 1 1 heroin addicts had used was marijuana or hashish <i>(cannabis).</i></font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">An interesting sidelight brought out during
the interviews was that 37 per cent had on occasion sold, lent,
or exchanged at least some of the drugs the clinics prescribed
for them. In addition, the study confirmed the worst fears of
physicians about the </font><font size="1">unsterile procedures
that are an important risk when addicts administer drugs to
themselves. The report speaks best for itself: </font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>All subjects were using heroin by injection. In the week
    prior to interview 28 (25%) subjects had injected themselves
    at home only, a further 17 (15%) had injected themselves at
    their clinic or at a day center as well as at their home, 46
    (41 %) had injected themselves at some time during the week
    in a public toilet as well as at home, clinic, or day center,
    and 20 (18%) had injected themselves in a &quot;public
    place&quot;-e.g., shop doorways, in the street ' or in
    telephone kiosks-in addition to any of the above places.
    Sixty-two (56%) had injected themselves whilst other addicts
    were present and also injecting themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The majority of subjects ( 101, 91 %) used a disposable
    syringe for their injections and of these 67 (66%) regularly
    used their syringes more than once. Seventy-two subjects
    (68%) did not clean their arms prior to injection. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Although the most frequent method for preparing an
    injection was to dissolve heroin in sterile water, 54 (49%)
    had at some time during the week used ordinary unboiled tap
    water, and 12 (11%) had used water from a lavatory basin.
    Nine subjects reported sharing a syringe with another addict
    during the week.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <img src="img00031.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="1">If injection practices are defined as sterile
when normal medical </font><font size="2">procedure is followed
(i.e., using a new disposable syringe for each injection or using
an adequately sterilized glass syringe, not sharing a syringe,
cleaning the arm prior to injection, and making up the injection
with sterile water) then in the total sample, 12 subjects (11%)
are using sterile injection practices. In the week prior to
interview all others had engaged in some non-sterile practice. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">This kind of unsterile drug taking often led
to medical complications. Thirty-nine per cent had been in
hospitals for treatment of septicaernia, hepatitis, abscesses, or
overdose. Of all addicts interviewed, 40 per cent reported
hepatitis and overdose and 46 per cent reported abscesses treated
both in and outside of hospitals.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although this report indicated no particular
trend in polydrug taking, since the clinics began doctors have
seen definite increases in two drugs: methylamphetamine (speed)
and barbiturates. In 1968, methylamphetamine was injected by
addicts with such frequency that authorities asked its
manufacturers to agree to withdraw it from the retail market and
restrict its distribution to hospital pharmacies. Within weeks of
its disappearance from retail drugstores it disappeared among the
addict population.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Misuse of barbiturates. by addicts became an
acute problem in 1969. Some physicians, however, feel that it has
slowed somewhat since the last part of 1970. Addicts inject
barbiturates even though they are not manufactured, so that they
will dissolve completely in water. The undissolved particles
result in collapsed veins and serious abscesses on addicts' arms
and legs. Addicts I've interviewed said that they resorted to
barbiturates when they couldn't get enough heroin or methadone
from the clinics. This, like all addict testimonials, is open to
question.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The degree of barbiturate abuse-particularly
by injection-is another aspect of the English drug scene that is
left largely to conjecture. A study in 1969 of a small sample of
heroin addicts -again conducted by a team from the Addiction
Research Unit-showed that among this sample the problem was
huge.' Sixty-five heroin addicts were interviewed in May, June,
and July of 1969, and 80 per cent were found to have injected
barbiturates. Almost all of them-62 of the 65-had taken
barbiturates either by injection or orally. Of course, some had
used the drug only to help induce sleep. However, 65 per cent
acknowledged they had taken it for no medical reason and only for
&quot;kicks.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A few addicts will take barbiturates with them
to the clinics, although they may have obtained them from a
general practitioner or bought them illicitly. I observed an
especially bizarre scene in one of the clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There were two chairs in the room, a steel
sink, a length of rubber hose to use as a tourniquet, some
cotton, and a supply of paper towels. The walls and the chairs
were stained with dried blood; in general, the physical
appearance of the room was far from the kind of antiseptic clinic
presented by the likes of Drs. Kildare and Ben Casey. The
characters on this stage were two young addicts, both unsteady on
their feet from drugs taken earlier. One took a syringe from his
pocket, washed it out with tap water from the sink, pulled a
folded piece of paper from another pocket, removed a barbiturate
capsule, broke it in half over the syringe, and emptied its
contents into the tube.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Once the white powder was in the syringe, he
added tap water, shook the contents vigorously for several
seconds, and handed the syringe to his friend. Since his arms and
ankles were marked with sores, however, it took several minutes
to locate a usable vein. Finally, he settled on a spot about
eight inches below the knee. (The other addict, incidentally,
shortly afterwards injected himself in the sole of his foot.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">A third addict, more stable, helped the first
boy out of the clinic by steadying him with an arm around his
shoulders. But once outside the clinic, the boy sagged and
collapsed on the grass. A few addicts nearby helped to drag the
boy out of the sun to a tree, where they sat him up against its
trunk.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I was not alone in observing this sequence; a
clinic psychiatrist watched the entire scene with me. No effort
was made to assist, dissuade, or reprimand the addicts. We were
both spectators, like a couple of medical students watching
surgical techniques from behind a glass partition. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">LAW ENFORCEMENT <br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the English have consistently viewed
drug addiction as a medical problem, this does not mean that the
police have been dismissed from the drug scene. Possession,
selling, and importing most dangerous drugs are against the law.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">An addict can go to a government clinic and,
after convincing doctors of his addiction, obtain free heroin,
but this does not mean that anyone can walk around London with a
pocketful of &quot;horse&quot; or any other opiate. Possession of
heroin, methadone, and similar dangerous drugs is illegal without
a prescription. In the case of heroin, the only source of such a
prescription is a government clinic.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Marijuana and hashish are illegal, period.
There are no prescriptions given for these drugs and no medical
&quot;cover&quot; exists to protect the owner of them. In
England, they are clearly the number-one illegal drug, and their
use continues to rise along with the arrest statistics of those
who are caught with them. From 1968 to 1970, the number of <i>cannabis
</i>offenses more than doubled from 3,071 to 7,520. In 1970, <i>cannibis
</i>seizures amounted to </font><font size="1">11/4 </font><font
size="2">tons.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unlike the United States, Britain has no
national police agency for drugs. For that matter, if there is no
equivalent to the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
neither is there one for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Scotland Yard is essentially a London agency, and, when a
Scotland Yard man is found looking for clues on some fog-shrouded
English moor (usually in a paperback detective thriller), he is
there on loan from London. In short, there is no national police
force.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drug squads have been created largely because
of need or, sometimes, because of the personal interest of an
individual police officer. These squads have no nationwide
resources available to them either from an enforcement or from a
training point of view. Drug-squad members, including the
higher-echelon officers in charge of them, are largely
self-educated about drugs. Even Scotland Yard's Drug Squad is
likely to have a director today who next month or next year may
be shifted to a completely different area of police work.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, this does not mean that expertise has
not built up. There is no better example of expertise constructed
largely out of self-developed personal interest than Detective
Sergeant Alan Russell, who heads the drug squad in Portsmouth. If
a national police drug force ever should be established, as some
are urging, Sergeant Russell should have a prominent role in it
on the basis of his record in Portsmouth.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Russell has an excellent, and unpublicized,
working relationship with Dr. Christie of the Portsmouth drug
clinic: Christie doesn't squeal on addicts and Russell doesn't
give away police plans, but it is clear from the way the two men
speak of each other that each has developed a warm respect for
the other's approach to addiction. The addicts appear to respect
Russell as well. When the residents of Alpha Unit, the
therapeutic community directed by Dr. Christie, decided to hold
an open house, they invited Russell even though he had arrested a
number of them on past occasions.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Because of the Christie-Russell liaison-and
addicts corroborate it-there is virtually no black market in
heroin or methadone in the Portsmouth area. In 1969, Russell's
squad arrested two persons for possessing heroin, and this
involved only minute traces found in a syringe. During the entire
year, there were 12 to 15 methadone-possession arrests.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Russell, however, regards opiate addiction as
only a small part of his concern. &quot;Dependence on opiate
drugs is only the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he says. &quot;You
have millions of people in this country who are dependent on
barbiturates and amphetamines.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the greater Portsmouth area, with a
population of about 500,000, he estimates that there are as many
as 1,500 users of marijuana, barbiturates, and amphetamines, some
of whom may dabble with all of these drugs. This estimate is in
marked contrast to the very low numbers of hard-drug addicts-14
in the clinic and 17 in the Alpha Unit therapeutic community.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Possibly in part because of his respect for
Dr. Christie, Portsmouth's chief drug police officer has a very
positive attitude toward the clinics. &quot;Make no mistake about
it-and some people tend to forget it-a few years ago this country
had a serious heroin problem.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In London, there is considerable criticism of
the clinics among members of Scotland Yard's Drug Squad, although
not a single police officer whom I interviewed was willing to
scrap the clinics. Several officers thought that some clinic
doctors were still being conned by addicts into issuing larger
prescriptions than required. However, all the officers agreed
that overprescribing had been reduced drastically since preclinic
days.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As an example that the problem has not been
eliminated entirely, they cite a case in 1969: A member of the
squad searched the apartment of a longtime addict who had been
receiving drugs from one of the central London clinics before his
death. The search uncovered a horde of heroin-900 tablets or
9,000 milligrams, worth more than $2,100 on the British black
market and easily three times as much on the U.S. market.
Although there was no evidence that the addict had been selling
from this cache, the police felt strongly that it corroborated
their overprescribing charge.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Furthermore, police are annoyed that there is
no limit on the amount an addict with a clinic prescription may
carry. Recently, they stopped an addict with 40 grains (2,400
milligrams) of heroin. He told officers he had been reducing his
prescribed quantity, and no arrest was possible, even though the
police strongly doubted his story.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Yet, such dramatic anecdotes are the
exception. A review of squad arrest records shows that, from the
beginning of June to September 7, 1970 (the date of the
interview), there hadn't been a single heroin arrest and only two
methadone-possession arrests. (These were not the only London
drug arrests; for, although the squad is the only police unit
concerned solely with drugs, other London policemen make drug
arrests in the course of their regular activities.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some members of the drug squad frankly admit
that they would be in trouble if heroin were completely outlawed.
None is campaigning for such a move. One top drug-squad officer,
a critic of the present clinic approach (&quot;They sustain
addiction . . . there is no place in England where a drug addict
can be cured&quot;) is not interested in abolishing them, either.
He would like to see all drugs administered by the clinics in the
clinics. Instead of fourteen separate clinics in London, he would
like four open on a twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week
basis.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard detectives acknowledge that the
clinics have reduced not only the quantity of heroin prescribed
but the amount available on the black market. Cocaine, they say,
has also been reduced dramatically. Like their colleagues in
Portsmouth, however, they are often more concerned about the
other drugs that are available on the black market.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The lead drug, of course, is marijuana. They
claim that large scale trafficking is mainly carried on by
England's new immigrant population, primarily the Pakistanis.
Marijuana comes into England frequently by parcel post directly
from the producing countries. Students also bring it in from such
well-known drug centers as Morocco.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">LSD most often comes from the United States,
even though in<b> </b>1969 English police raided and closed down
at least two illicit laboratories producing LSD for both local
consumption and export.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There appears to be little organized
importation of heroin. What there is generally comes from Hong
Kong and is imported by Chinese sailors and distributed by
inhabitants of the small Chinese community in London. Addicts
generally are not fond of Chinese heroin because of its uncertain
strength and, since it comes in powder form, the necessity to
heat it in a spoon-in the U.S. mode-before mixing it for
injection.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Police acknowledge that one can buy a variety
of illicit drugs in the network of side streets in and around
Picadilly Circus and in some other areas of London where youth
congregate, often in or around the late-night clubs. However,
these illicit business enterprises are small and unorganized,
particularly in the hard drug line.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Black-market prices in 1970, according to the
addicts and confirmed by clinic physicians and police, are as
follows: </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin (British-manufactured) $14.40 a grain
(60 mg.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin (Chinese) $3.60 a packet (30-60 mg.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone $7.20-$12.80 a grain (60 mg.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Barbiturates 25 cents a capsule <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is no evidence anywhere that large
numbers of hard-drug users are supplying themselves from this
black market. Furthermore, there is no evidence at all that
heroin manufactured in France-the principal source of supply for
U.S. addicts-is being smuggled into England. The market just
isn't big enough to make such an enterprise profitable.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard does keep track of international
and particularly European illicit-drug activity. Its principal
source for this information is not Interpol but the European
office of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. The
drug-squad detectives express a great deal of respect for their
American colleagues and are quick to admit that, if they need
information or have a common problem, they will call Paris rather
than Interpol. Often, they say, an American narcotics agent will
arrive on the next plane.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, the BNDD for the first time assigned
a permanent man to the embassy in London, as part of its over-all
European expansion of manpower. A London slot was created because
of the LSD traffic from the United States to England and the
marijuana and hashish flow from England to the United States.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">John T. Cusack, the BNDD's European regional
director, is not enthusiastic about the English clinic approach.
Of all police officers interviewed, he was the most strongly
negative about the clinic program. &quot;The<b> </b>clinics are
not going to work giving away heroin. They are going to sustain
and create some addicts,&quot; he said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">He had three principal objections: &quot; [I]
It fools society. It kids all of us that it's<b> </b>doing a job
when it isn't doing a job. [21 The addicts will take what they
can get from the clinics and then they will get some more from
the outside. [31 The clinics flirt with a conflict of the
Hypocratic oath of the medical profession. They sustain a
medical-psychiatric sickness.&quot; (This argument is also made
by some British physicians, like Dr. Ian James, a British prison
psychiatrist.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Cusack, however, is not a
throw-them-all-in-jail police officer. He wants medical treatment
for addicts and believes that governments don't<b> </b>spend
anywhere near what they should on hospital care for addicts.
&quot;I feel so strongly about it that I'd like to sweep up all
the addicts off the New York streets and put them into hospitals.
It's incredible to me to leave addicts on the street. It's<b> </b>a
big, expensive job to bring them in, but we don't let our mental
patients run loose, do we?&quot; <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If Cusack strongly disagrees with the English
clinic philosophy, his London police colleagues sharply differ
with their American counterparts over one vital aspect of the
drug problem: the connection between crime and addiction. <i>No
one in England-from the toughest London detective to the most
liberal-prescribing clinic physician-suggested to me that
narcotics addiction increases criminal behavior. </i>This does
not mean, of course, that drug addicts are crime-free. On the
contrary, a significant number of addicts engage in criminal
behavior, and some criminals are addicts. But in England there is
no cause-and-effect relationship.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard says it in writing. In a 1970
report, its drug expert wrote: &quot;There is no concrete
evidence to connect any particular criminal activity with those
dependent on the 'hard' drugs (e.g., heroin) but without doubt,
the increasing demand for the amphetamine-type drugs leads to
thefts from chemists' premises, hospitals, and, in a smaller
degree, to thefts of prescription forms.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Study after study documents the fact that
sticking a needle into his arm doesn't propel a man into the
robber and burglar fraternity. More likely, he will have been
initiated long before. What these studies do show is that addicts
often have a whole series of antisocial &quot;hang-ups,&quot; of
which addiction is just one more on the lengthy list.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the previously cited 1970 study of 111
heroin addicts attending London clinics, 51 per cent reported a
conviction for a nondrug offense <i>before </i>their first use of
heroin. Thirty-six per cent reported such a conviction since
using heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A 1967 study of 50 addict-criminals in London
prisons again indicates that a track record in court and prison
often is established before track marks on the subject's arms.'
Brixton Prison psychiatrist Ian James found that 22 addicts had a
history of juvenile-court conviction and 16 had adult-court
convictions prior to heroin addiction. In all, &quot;Three
quarters had a history of court convictions <i>predating </i>their
addiction to narcotics, and there was usually a story of personal
and social maladjustment dating from adolescence (educational
dropout, employment instability, sociopathic conduct,
etc.).&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Ten of the subjects had been convicted only
since they became addicted, but only two were in prison for their
very first conviction. Dr. James found, too, that, if one
discounts drug convictions, fewer convictions for crimes were
recorded <i>after </i>addiction than before.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although it is risky to draw conclusions about
United States addicts based on English findings, one young
American doctor did suggest that what was true about preaddiction
delinquency in Britain may be even more valid in the United
States. Dr. Michael Paris, formerly on the staff of the Federal
Hospital for Addict Rehabilitation at Lexington, Kentucky, worked
with Dr. Bewley in 1970 in his London clinics. Asked to compare
U.S. and British addicts, he said that the Americans he saw at
Lexington had bad at least twice as much antisocial behavior in
their early teens as the London addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the first study of heroin users in a
provincial town, investigators found a reduction rather than an
increase in crime after addiction began. Twenty of 37 heroin
users had been convicted of breaking the law.&quot; </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The crimes not involving drugs were generally
petty in nature, such as stealing two pints of milk, minor
shopliftng, and taking and driving away a motor vehicle. Of the
ten people who had been convicted of nondrug offenses, three had
committed them before using any drugs at all, and seven between
first trying drugs and first trying heroin. There was only one
person who was convicted of a nondrug offense after heroin use
began, and this person had already been convicted of such a crime
before the onset of heroin use. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These findings prompted investigators to
suggest further research:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Many of our subjects were in full-time
employment or were full-time students; most were still living at
home with their parents, a high proportion of whom knew of their
heroin use. Although there were instances of nondrug crime before
heroin use began, there was only one such conviction (a second
offense) afterwards. Whether drug use is for some people an
&quot;alternative&quot; to other types of delinquent behavior is
a question which suggests itself for investigation and remains
open, but it is clear that our sample in no way constitutes a
drifting criminal subculture, <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">RESEARCH<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until 1967, research in drug addiction in
England depended on the personal interest of a physician. A
handful of doctors wrote papers based on their personal
experiences with addicts. Public awareness of the problem still
was slight, and concern and knowledge among doctors in general
were not much greater. Funds for research simply were not
available.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Today, the veterans of the predrug-crisis era
continue to produce papers for both national and international
medical publications, but they have been joined not only by
individual newcomers but by a government-supported research
project as well.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Addiction Research Unit is a kind of
scientific conglomerate that investigates three of man's<b> </b>major
vices-drinking, smoking, and drug addiction. The unit, a part of
the Department of Psychiatry of London University's Institute of
Psychiatry, began in 1964 as an alcoholism research group. In
1967, after the Brain Committee report was translated into
legislation and public concern heightened with the catapulting
addiction statistics, political pressure prompted the Health
Department to provide funds for drug-addiction research. Drug
investigations were added to the unit's agenda, and sufficient
funds were supplied to construct a separate building on the
grounds of Maudsley Hospital. Research on smoking was added in
1969.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Each area of investigation has a separate
staff and coordinator, with the largest number in the
drug-addiction field. Dr. Griffith Edwards, whose earlier
interest was in alcoholism, is director of the entire unit, and
Dr. David V. Hawks, a psychologist, is coordinator of the
eleven-man (and woman) Drug Research Group.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Another organization, the Institute for the
Study of Drug Dependence, a privately financed group, does no
clinical research, although it is looking for funds to finance
both clinical and other investigations. The Institute, with Sir
Harry Greenfield as board chairman, is directed by a retired
foreign-service officer with a personal interest in addiction. In
the two years since it began, this struggling enterprise-financed
by small foundation grants-has carved out a useful function as an
information clearinghouse. It is the one place in England where a
researcher can find extensive, indexed, and easily available
material on the English drug scene as well as numerous items
involving other countries.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until now, the national Department of Health
has done no specific drug-addiction research of its own. In 1970,
a joint committee of the Health Department and the Home Office
was created primarily to try to straighten out the sometimes
confused drug statistics. It recommended establishment of a Drugs
Research Group to be staffed by both agencies. While no specific
research program was proposed, the committee suggested the
following areas of investigation:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Developing a typology of heroin users.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Measuring the effectiveness of different
forms of treatment in the existing clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. Comparing the effectiveness of compulsory
treatment (in prison) with voluntary treatment in hospitals.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">More important, perhaps, was the committee's
recommendation that statistical information be compiled on all
persons addicted to <i>any </i>dangerous drug in England and
Wales. The Department of Health is now building such a data bank,
which already includes a total of 2,400 names, with the basic
information obtained when an addict applies to a clinic or is
hospitalized. Other government statistical records to be tapped
include:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Dates and causes of death from the General
Register office.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Admissions and length of stay in
psychiatric hospitals from the Department of Health and Social
Security records. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. Details of employment histories, sickness
and unemployment payments from the Department of Health and
Social Security's Mental Health Inquiry Records.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">4. Criminal records and prison statistics from
the Home Office Statistical Division.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This will be a vital resource for
investigators and will open numerous research opportunities into
drug addiction in England.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">THE STATISTICS <br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How accurate are the drug statistics in
England today?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is difficult to generalize. Some statistics
are clearly more solid than others. A number of persons
interviewed expressed skepticism about the validity of one or
more sets of statistics. Included among the skeptics was a
Department of Health official who works with the drug numbers.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The problem with the statistics is that
reporting depends on individual physicians and clinic personnel
whose information is not channeled through a system of
cross-checks. The new Health Department data bank should help to
improve the accuracy of some of these statistics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among the numerical data available, the clinic
figures reporting quantities of drugs prescribed appear to be
least open to significant error. Apart from an occasional
bookkeeping mistake, these statistics should accurately reflect
the downward trend of heroin use and the rise in methadone.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The monthly clinic-attendance figures should
stand up. However, the number of new addicts that clinics report
every month may be a somewhat soft statistical area, because
clinics may vary in their definition of a new addict.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic figures for the percentage of
addicts employed could be on the high side, since
&quot;employment&quot; depends on the individual's definition,
and the accuracy of the addict's statements is questionable. The
data bank, which will include employment records based on
social-security information, should provide a cross-check for
these claims.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The vital Home Office figures on addicts have
to be separated into addicts reported any time during the year
and addicts known to be receiving drugs at the end of the year.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The figures for the total year tend to be
accepted as reasonably correct by those interviewed, with the
general acknowledgment that obviously not every addict in England
is known to the Home Office. However, no one suggested that the
number of &quot;unknowns&quot; is as large as the numbers listed.
Opiate addiction, under the English drug approach, is difficult
to conceal if it is taking place on any significant scale. The
highest estimate for unreported opiate use was 25 per cent, but
this guesstimate included occasional users as well as addicts.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Home Office figures for 1968 may be
unusually high because inauguration of the clinics may well have
flushed out previously unknown addicts. As a result, the tiny
increase in the total 1969 figures may not accurately reflect the
degree of change. Not until the end of 1970 did England have a
firm statistical basis for concluding that the narcotic-addiction
spiral of the 1960's had been halted.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">RESULTS<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is a shortage of hard statistical data
about the success or failure of Britain's drug approach, either
before or after the clinic program was begun. Most available
evaluations were done prior to the inauguration of the clinic
program. These do not generate applause.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For example, in 1968, a study of 1,271 heroin
addicts who became known to the Home Office between 1947 and 1966
showed that 70 per cent were still taking opiates in 1966.&quot;
Of the nontakers, some 293 addicts-64 per cent-were in prison,
hospital, or other institutions, and 89 were dead, the majority
as a result of overdose, suicide, or sepsis.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The death rate among English addicts has been
very high according to the Bewley study, twice as high as among
U.S. addicts. However, this study was conducted prior to the
clinic program, when British addicts were receiving huge amounts
of heroin prescribed by general practitioners. The death rate
among addicts included in this review was 28 times greater than
the rate for the equivalent age group in the general population.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Studies of withdrawal treatment in hospitals
are not more encouraging. In one follow-up of 23 hospital
admissions, 12 relapsed within a week, five within a month, and
three within two months. Only three were still avoiding narcotics
three months after discharge.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Like their American brethren, the English
today have no file folder marked &quot;cures&quot;; there is no
computer printout on clinic performance that supports either the
critics or the defenders of the program.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is, however, a cautious thread of
optimism that runs through conversations with clinic directors
and also a surprising degree of candor in identifying areas of
shortcoming and outright failure. Furthermore, these subjective
evaluations by different directors generally make nearly
identical points of both promise and disappointment. Finally,
they are echoed by those who have no particular vested interest
in the clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Margaret Tripp, a doctor at St. Clement
with no previous experience with drug addicts, frankly admits
that her charges conned her in the beginning. Two years later she
said: <b>&quot;I </b>think we are controlling legal heroin. Much
to my surprise, we have stabilized the addicts-they're not dead,
and they are better. They are more stable than before; their drug
use has gone down, they work longer, and they are less of a
nuisance to everybody.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Tripp chooses her words very carefully:
&quot;Three or four of the [present] cases are reasonably off
drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Willis, at St. Giles, also avoids words
like &quot;success&quot; and &quot;cure.&quot; He also cites the
drop in heroin and agrees that the rise of addiction has slowed.
&quot;It's been possible to mount a general tidying-up operation.
They are more stable now than they were a year ago. Their general
appearance is better. They are not asking for more drugs, and
they are not claiming as much drug loss [in order to obtain
replacements] as they did before.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Connell, who is among the handful of
English drug-treatment veterans, a consultant to the national
Health Department and director of the Maudsley Hospital drug
clinic, summed it up this way:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm pleased that the frightening curve of heroin addiction
    has leveled off. I'm disturbed that methadone and
    barbiturates have risen. In terms of containing the heroin
    problem, they [the clinics] are successful. They have
    provided some treatment services where none have existed. All
    of the terrible prognostications of American workers in the
    drug field have been unfounded. But [Dr. Connell added] in
    terms of research they are a failure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Similar sentiments are voiced by those who are
being asked to evaluate their own work. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Even the most hardened policeman-as we noted
in the law enforcement section-is not prepared to suggest that
England should scrap the clinics. Despite the grumbling about
doctors who are either too softhearted-in the eyes of the
police-or simply conned by addicts, the interviewer is left with
the distinct impression that even law-enforcement officers
believe that the hard-drug picture has improved somewhat.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among druggists, there also is cautious
optimism for the clinic approach. For example, Jerry Young, chief
chemist at Boots Picadilly, says flatly:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm very pleased with the clinic system. I'd even be more
    pleased if they'd take the whole thing in their hands
    [administer drugs directly in the clinics]. We see more
    stability in the addicts. They don't come in making
    exorbitant demands on our service and our time. The genuine
    addicts are less of a nuisance. On the whole, they took
    physically better. They respond better.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Asked for some tangible proof of his
assessment, Mr. Young said that, prior to the spring of 1968,
when the clinics began, he had to call the police on the average
of twice a week to control an unruly addict in his pharmacy. Now,
he said, he can't remember a recent call for police assistance
with a clinic addict. Occasionally, he asks police help with a
forged prescription or when someone under the influence of
barbiturates makes a disturbance.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Mr. Young's analysis, like those of the
physicians who send him prescriptions, is subjective. However,
there are at least a few statistical indications-developed since
the clinic program began -that tend to support these assumptions.
To find them, you have to go to an institution dealing with a
considerably larger clientele than drug addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Brixton Prison, with its incongruous
flower-filled inner courtyard, is to London what the Tombs is to
New York. It is a remand prison, where all London-area male
prisoners are brought while awaiting trial. There are 12,000
&quot;receptions&quot; there annually.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Brixton, in 1970, had on its staff the one man
who may have seen more English drug addicts personally than any
other individual. Dr. Ian James, the prison psychiatrist, has a
long interest in drug addiction. His small prison office is lined
with maps showing the routes by which drugs come to England, the
location of addict arrests in London, the location of clinics,
the arrests of those who are off drugs-all appropriately marked
in clusters of multicolored pins.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1969, Dr. James saw 223 drug addicts who
were at Brixton for both drug and other offenses. They
represented about 10 per cent of all heroin addicts reported to
the Home Office during the year. Significantly, Dr. James said it
was rarely that he saw an addict unknown to the Home Office.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. James in the past has been a vocal
opponent of the clinic program. His opposition was based largely
on medical ethics.</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Nobody prescribes two bottles of gin a day with duly
    enriched Vitamin B for alcoholics. The doctor knows that the
    addict will use an unsanitary procedure to satisfy his
    habits. He will take unsterile pills [heroin tablets], hold
    them in his sweaty hand, and put them in a syringe which he
    pulls from his grimy pocket. What kind of medicine is that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">But Dr. James's own statistics are softening
his anticlinic stand to the point where he said: &quot;I think
the clinics are succeeding, but on the wrong premises.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. James's accounting may not give
overwhelming proof to the statement that the clinics are having a
positive impact, but it does add some significant bone behind the
subjective flesh of cautious optimism.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, a third fewer drug addicts were
admitted to Brixton than during the previous year, Almost
three-fourths of all addicts received at Brixton in 1970 were
attending a drug-addiction clinic prior to their arrest. In 1968,
only three-fifths of the drug addicts were clinic-registered.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">These statistics not only buttress the
cautious optimism of English drug experts but also cast doubt on
any contention that there is a large addict population unknown to
the Home Office or to the clinics. If such an &quot;unknown&quot;
addict pool in fact existed, sustaining itself from the
high-priced black market, a significant number of its members
surely would appear periodically inside the steel gates of
Brixton. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There are other substantive indications that
the narcotics situation is improving. At three London centers,
the number of addicts holding jobs almost doubled in two years.
In these same clinics, a series of urine tests given a year apart
showed that, while many addicts still were taking more and
different drugs than those prescribed, such misuse had been
reduced.&quot; In yet another survey, there were fewer arrests a
year after addicts had been with a clinic than before.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But what does all this mean for the United
States? What relevance does it have to America's ever-increasing
narcotics problem? In the past, almost all visiting American drug
experts have said flatly: None.&quot; The two countries, they
said, are just too different. Not only do some key narcotics laws
point in opposite directions, but the two societies' traditions,
youth culture, and race problems are so disparate that what works
in the row houses of London could not possibly work in the
walk-ups of New York.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A young researcher at the Addiction Research
Unit may well have given an explosive jolt to such blanket
dismissals. Jim Zacune, a social psychologist, in 1970 examined
in detail the performance of Canadian addicts in their native
land and after they emigrated to England. His study is
significant to the U.S.-Britain narcotics-policy argument, since
Canada's approach to opiate addiction is largely patterned after
ours.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Zacune traced and interviewed 25 of the 91
Canadian addicts who are known to have come to England in the
1960's. The rest of the emigres could not be located or had
either died or been deported. For those he was able to interview,
Zacune compared work records, prison records, and crime records
in the two countries. He diplomatically says that his findings
should not be used to condemn one country's addiction approach
while praising another's, and cautions that his sample may have
included the most stable of the Canadians who packed up their
syringes for England. But his findings are nevertheless
startling: </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, the Canadians spent 25 per cent of
their addicted years, a combined total of 141 years and 2 months,
in jail; in England, less than 2 per cent, a combined total of 2
years and 5 months.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, they compiled 182 offenses; in
England, 27.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, in the high addict-crime category of
theft, which included robbery and burglary, they committed 88; in
England, 8.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Not only did they commit far fewer crimes,
but, while in England, many of them were crime-free. In Canada,
16 of the 25 had committed five or more crimes, with one of them
recording more than 20 separate offenses. In Britain, none
committed more than four offenses and nearly half (12) were never
charged with any unlawful behavior.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Despite the fact that the Canadians consumed
far more daily heroin than the London average, many of them
became job holders and led fairly normal lives while in England.
Their living accommodations were far more stable. In Canada, only
five had a constant residence for more than three years; in
England, ten had lived at their present address for two or more
years, eight for one to two years, and five for less than one
year. Two were in the hospital at the time of the survey.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The employment record showed the most dramatic
difference between the two countries. In Canada, only one addict
claimed to have worked steadily while addicted. In England, the
majority (13) worked full-time, and four worked part-time. Six
had held the same job for at least three years. Seven had
semiskilled or skilled manual jobs, two were office workers, one
in sales, and one worked as a croupier. One was a full-time
housewife and one a student. &quot;For once we could work and
live like humans,&quot; the addicts said. The interviews
contained again and again this and other personal and pragmatic
assessments. &quot;There is less trouble from the police . . . we
don't constantly have to be paranoid . . . there is less pressure
. . . there is no need to steal.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This study may encompass too small and special
a group of addicts to permit definitive conclusions. But,
together with the other fragmentary evidence, it suggests that
the English approach is an alternative not to be dismissed
summarily, as it is in a widely distributed U.S. Government
pamphlet, which claims that &quot;The British system is
considered a failure and has been modified to meet the increasing
problem of addiction.&quot;&quot; <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <i><font size="2">PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS<br>
</font></i> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For the American visitor, the most pervasive
impression of the English drug scene comes in the form of a
question:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Why has the United States, decade after
decade, continuously viewed narcotics addiction as largely a
criminal, instead of a medical, problem?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">With all its imperfections and
inconsistencies, the British approach to drug addiction convinced
me that the United States will never make significant headway
with the drug problem until it shifts the emphasis from the
criminal to the medical. Until this national policy is changed,
American addicts will continue to be an ostracized
subculture-morally exiled and often barred from the very medical
and social-work help they need so desperately, but physically
very much present in the criminal countdown of the larger
society, which has had to lock itself behind doors for the luxury
of guarding an unworkable dogma.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until this national policy is changed, the
black market will continue to flourish no matter how many more
narcotics agents are enlisted, and daily will help to infect
others, because of the astronomical profits to be made.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Based on my research in England, I believe
that the United States should experiment with both a methadone-
and -a heroin maintenance program under more controlled and
restrictive conditions than generally prevail in Britain today.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">I believe that England provides significant
research opportunities about the effects of different opiates,
which could fill the knowledge void that is plaguing the
addiction field in so many countries. For example, what is the
precise difference between the effects of heroin and of injected
and oral methadone? What are the differences in work performance,
antisocial behavior, and life-styles among addicts who use heroin
and injectable and oral methadone? Because heroin addicts can be
observed in England under relatively controlled circumstances, a
whole series of comparative clinical and sociological studies are
possible.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;
answer can be given to the question: &quot;Is the British
approach to addiction a success or a failure?&quot; The question
itself may not be valid in a field that has so much difficulty
with the word &quot;success.&quot; A more accurate question may
be: Is the British approach to addiction helpful or harmful? Even
then, the answer may only be &quot;Yes, but . . .&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Can the British and American approaches to
addiction legitimately be compared? The study of Canadian
addicts' performance in England certainly suggests that such
comparisons no longer can be dismissed out of hand. In England,
at least, comparisons are made. Everywhere I went, opinion on
this was uniform. On my final day in London, a Home Office
official, whose knowledge of drug addiction has brought him an
international reputation, summed it up:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;We don't want to force our system on
you, but for God's sake don't bring your system over here.&quot;<br>

<h1>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse </h1>

<h2>Drug Use In America: Problem in Perspective </h2>

<p><b>Commissioned by President Richard M. Nixon, March, 1972</b>
</p>

<h2>Chapter One - Defining the Issues</h2>

<p><img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>The need to solve the &quot;drug problem&quot; has been a
recurrent theme of political and social commentary in the United
States for most of the past decade. The apparent increase in drug
use - itself defined as the problem - has precipitated a serious
inquiry into its causes, a massive investment of social efforts
to contain it, and a mobilization of medical and para-medical
resources to treat its victims. </p>

<p>The Commission does not deny that a &quot;drug problem&quot;
exists. We share the public's concern that an apparent rise in
crime and other anti-social behavior may be related in part to
drug-using or drug-seeking behavior. Likewise, we share the
public alarm over the attraction to drug use by large portions of
this nation's youth, particularly when such use is indiscriminate
and apparently oblivious to its risks. The lives and futures of
our young people can only be hurt by such behavior. We share,
too, the frustration which comes from knowing that drug use
spreads by example, and that a continuing growth in the using
population augurs no better for tomorrow. </p>

<p>While recognizing that a drug problem exists, we cannot allow
our distress to interfere with the performance of our mandate. We
were appointed not to fan public anxiety, but to convert it into
meaningful activity with constructive proposals. This can be done
only 'by refusing to accept at face value many of the common
assumptions about drugs and the drug problem. We must examine the
reasons behind the fears, conducting the inquiry without passion
and with candor. Confident social action comes from an
understanding of the problem and from an impartial assessment of
the impact of alternative strategies. We have sought to define
the problem and to provide at least an initial assessment of the
possible responses to it. </p>

<p>The Commission has carefully surveyed the social response to
the contemporary drug problem, and has been struck by a
persisting uneasiness which seems to color the entire effort. On
the street and in the councils of government, increasing numbers
of drug abuse &quot;experts&quot; wonder whether their commitment
and efforts have had any actual imp-act on the problem. Many of
them assume optimistic positions in public, while suspecting
privately that no solution will be found. The Commission
understands the reasons for this malaise. We are convinced that
public policy, as presently designed, is premised on incorrect
assumptions, is aimed at the wrong targets, and is too often
unresponsive to human needs and aspirations. </p>

<p>In this Chapter, the Commission seeks to bring the issue of
drug use into focus. First, we will explore the way our society
thinks about drugs by analyzing both the vocabulary of the drug
problem and the historical roots of contemporary attitudes. After
considering the way in which the drug problem is presently
defined, we will redefine it, first by broadening the scope to
cover the entire range of drug use in America and then by
narrowing it to that drug-using behavior which properly should
arouse social concern. </p>

<p>After the problem has been carefully defined, the
policy-making task begins. In this sense, this Chapter, and the
two which follow, are designed primarily to create a climate for
the formulation of new policy concepts. Chapter Four details the
policy-making process and sets forth specific recommendations for
immediate implementation by governmental and private
institutions. Chapter Five will then provide a broad perspective
on the development of a long-term social response to drug-using
behavior.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DEFINITIONAL CONFUSION: WHAT IS DRUG ABUSE?</b> </p>

<p>The use of psychoactive drugs is commonplace in American life.
Distribution of these drugs is an integral part of the social and
economic order. In 1970, 214 million prescriptions for
psychoactive drugs were issued, representing annual retail sales
of approximately $1 billion (Balter and Levine, 1971). The
alcohol industry produced over one billion gallons of spirits,
wine and beer for which 100 million consumers paid about $24
billion. </p>

<p>What is the pertinence of this information for a Commission
mandated to report to the American people on drug
&quot;abuse?&quot; Can such familiar American behavior include
drug abuse, even though that term is generally thought to refer
only to the consumption of psychoactive substances obtained
illicitly from a market with an estimated annual volume of $2
billion? </p>

<p>The Commission concluded early in its deliberations that the
focus of inquiry should not be determined by general impressions
or facile labels. Instead, formulation of a coherent social
policy requires a consideration of the entire range of
psychoactive drug consumption, and a determination as to whether
and under what circumstances drug-using behavior becomes a matter
of social concern. For example, does youthful experimentation
with alcohol involve different social policy considerations than
experimentation with marihuana? Do alcoholism and heroin
dependence present similar or dissimilar social policy questions?
Do the social policy implications of repeated use of barbiturates
or minor tranquilizers depend solely on whether a physician has
prescribed the drug or on the motivations for such use? In order
to deal coherently with such questions, it is necessary to
examine how this society thinks about drugs and their use.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Drugs-The All-Purpose Concept </b></p>

<p>The meaning of the word drug often varies with the context in
which it is used. From a strictly scientific point of view, a
drug is any substance other than food which by its chemical
nature affects the structure or function of the living organism.
From this perspective, the term includes some agricultural and
industrial chemicals. The physician might define a drug as any
substance used as a medicine in the treatment of physical or
mental disease; when treatment of illness is the referent, the
lay public may use the word in the same sense. However, when used
in the context of drug &quot;abuse&quot; or the drug
&quot;problem,&quot; the meaning of &quot;drug&quot; becomes
social rather than scientific. </p>

<p>In its social sense, drug is not a neutral term. This point is
best illustrated by the fact that &quot;drug problem&quot; is
frequently used not as a descriptive phrase, but a substitute for
the word drug. In our visits to communities throughout this
country and other nations, we have noted that local leaders often
feel compelled to report not simply that drugs are available or
that they are used, but that there is a &quot;drug problem.&quot;
</p>

<p>This value component of the word drug is reflected in the
selective application of this term by the general public. Table
T-1, drawn from a Commission-sponsored National Survey (Abelson
et al, 1973) * illustrates that the public tends uniformly<b> </b>to
regard heroin as a drug, as well as other substances associated
with the drug problem, such as marihuana, cocaine, the
amphetamines and the barbiturates. Some psychoactive substances,
such as alcohol and tobacco, are generally not regarded as drugs
at all. In neither public law nor public discussion is alcohol
regarded as a drug. It may be called a beverage, -a food, a
social lubricant or a relaxant, but rarely is it called a drug.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="pip10001.gif" align="bottom" width="447"
height="228"><br>
*The survey, conducted by Response Analysis, involved
face-to-face interviews with a random sample of 2,411 adults and
880 young persons age 12-17 in the contiguous -states. Findings
from the Survey are reported and discussed throughout this
Report. The reader should note that surveys which employ
probability samples may be generalized to the population as a
whole within known limits. it should also be noted that the
Survey data presented here involve unweighted bases with
percentages calculated on weighted bases. </p>

<p>Depending on the context in which the term &quot;drug&quot; is
used, statements about what a given drug does are liable to
differ. If the therapeutic meaning is employed, for example, the
characterization is likely to involve the reasons for using the
drug, the dose, the frequency of use and an evaluation of its
effects in terms of medical benefits. It might be asked whether
the drug made an individual feel better, cured his illness, or
made him less anxious or depressed. If the social meaning is
being used, however, the analysis generally focuses on toxicity,
lethality, dependence liability, possible genetic defects,
psychosis and effects of<b> </b>high doses; that is, on drug
effects in terms of their risks. </p>

<p>The imprecision of the term &quot;drug&quot; has had serious
social consequences. Because alcohol<b> </b>is excluded, the
public is conditioned to regard a martini as something
fundamentally different from a marihuana cigarette, a barbiturate
capsule or a bag of heroin. Similarly, because the referents of
the word &quot;drug&quot; differ so widely in the therapeutic and
social contexts, the public is conditioned to believe that
&quot;street&quot; drugs act according to entirely different
principles than &quot;medical&quot; drugs. The result is that the
risks of the former are exaggerated and the risks of the latter
are overlooked. </p>

<p>This confusion must be dispelled. Alcohol <font size="1">is </font>a
drug. All drugs act according to the same general principles.
Their effects vary with dose. For each drug there is an effective
dose (in terms of the desired effect), a toxic dose and a lethal
dose. All drugs have multiple effects. The lower the dose, the
more important non-drug factors become in determining drug
effect. At high dose levels, and for some individuals at much
lower dose levels, all drugs may be dangerous. The individual and
social consequences of drug use escalate with frequency and
duration of use. American drug policy will never be coherent
until it is founded on uniform principles such as these, which
apply to all drugs.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="1">'Unless otherwise noted, the word drug is
Intended to encompass only &quot;psychoactive drugs,&quot; or
those which have the capacity to influence behavior by altering
feeling, mood, perception or other mental states.<br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Drug Abuse: Synonym for Social Disapproval</b> </p>

<p>Drug abuse is another way of saying drug problem. Now
immortalized in the titles of federal and state governmental
agencies (and we might add, in our own), this term has the virtue
of rallying all parties to a common cause: no one could possibly
be for abuse of drugs any more than they could be <i>for </i>abuse
of minorities, power or children. By the same token, the term
also obscures the fact that &quot;abuse&quot; is undefined where
drugs are concerned. Neither the public, its policy makers nor
the expert community share a common understanding of its meaning
or of the nature of the phenomenon to which it refers. </p>

<p>The Commission has noted over the last two years that the
public and press often employ drug abuse interchangeably with
drug use. Indeed, m . any &quot;drug abuse experts,&quot;
including government officials, do so as well. </p>

<p>The Commission was curious about whether the public had any
more precise conception of the meaning of drug abuse than the
experts. In our second National Survey, public attitudes on this
issue were probed. The public was requested to give a
free-response explanation of what drug abuse meant. (See Table
I-2.)<br>
<img src="pip10002.gif" align="bottom" width="456" height="367"> </p>

<p>In this multiple-response question, the public was divided
between perceptions related to the purpose or motivation of drug
taking (the first three responses) on the one hand, and to the
consequences of use on the other (the remaining responses).
Roughly 30% of both youth and adult populations associate drug
abuse with the use of drugs for other than medical purposes,
including any use of those substances which have been prohibited
because they have no medical uses. In contrast, large numbers of
both adults and youth relate the term to the consequences of drug
taking. Excessive doses (27% and 16%), dependence (17% and 15%)
and danger to health (11% and lWc) are the most common examples.
Also of interest were those respondents who indicated that they
didn't know what drug abuse meant (13% and 20%). </p>

<p>In another part of the Survey, the respondents were asked
whether they regarded ten specific drug-using behaviors as drug
abuse. These data illustrate that drug abuse is an entirely
subjective concept. It is any drug use the respondent frowns
upon. Most respondents disapprove of the use of
medically-distributed pills for other than medical purposes
(those sanctioned by a physician), any use of heroin, and any use
which suggests that the user is dependent or seeking pleasure. </p>

<p>Significantly fewer respondents seem to disapprove of daily
use of<b> </b>alcohol, weekly use of marihuana and
experimentation with legitimate pills not obtained through a
physician. (See Table 1-3.)<br>
</p>

<p><img src="pip10003.gif" align="bottom" width="455"
height="396"> </p>

<p>As the National Survey data demonstrate, drug abuse may refer
to any type of drug or chemical without regard to its
pharmacologic actions. It is an eclectic concept having only one
uniform connotation: societal disapproval. </p>

<p>The Commission believes that the term drug abuse must be
deleted from official pronouncements and public policy dialogue.
The term has no functional utility and has become no more than an
arbitrary codeword for that drug use which is presently
considered wrong. Continued use of this term <b>, </b>with its
emotional overtones, will serve only to perpetuate confused
public attitudes about drug-using behavior. </p>

<p>Drug abuse, or any similar term, creates an impression that
all<b> </b>drug-using behavior falls in one of two clear-cut
spheres: drug use which is good, safe, beneficial and without
social consequence; and drug &quot;abuse&quot; which is bad,
harmful, without benefit and carrying high social cost. From
either a descriptive or an evaluative standpoint, the matter is
much too complex to be handled in such a polarized fashion. The
Commission urges that the public and its policy makers avoid such
labels and focus instead on the relative risks and social
consequences of various patterns of drug-taking behavior.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Roots of a &quot;Problem&quot; </b></p>

<p>We have focused our initial attention on vocabulary for an
important reason. The linguistic symbols which our society
attaches to certain drugs and drug-related conduct illustrate the
extent to which present attitudes and social responses are rooted
in the past. &quot;Drug abuse&quot; is only the most recent in a
long line of such symbols which this society has applied to
disapproved drug-taking behavior or to disapproved substances. In
fact, the history of drug vocabulary is also a history of the
changing perception of the drug &quot;problem&quot; in the United
States. </p>

<p>Current social policy is largely an accumulation of <i>ad hoc </i>policy
responses to the use of particular substances. &quot;Street&quot;
use of a previously unknown substance at a time of social tension
tends to generate a set of untested assumptions about the drug,
often including a presumed consequence of undesirable behavior,
and to result in a restrictive legal policy, all of which become
imbedded in public attitude. </p>

<p>Drug policy as we know it today is a creature of the 20th
Century. Until the last third of the 19th Century, America's
total legal policy regarding drugs was limited to regulation of
alcohol distribution (and the periodic regional attempts to
prohibit its use altogether), localized restrictions on tobacco
smoking, and the laws of the various states regulating pharmacies
and restricting the distribution of &quot;poisons.&quot;
Nineteenth century statutory vocabulary was simple and direct:
arsenic, tobacco, alcohol, morphine and other opium alkaloids
were all &quot;poisons.&quot; Until the Civil War, distribution
of opium and morphine, which were widely used as therapeutic
agents, was substantially unregulated. Gradually, however,
official reliance was placed on the health professions to police
distribution of these drugs; Pennsylvania enacted what may have
been the first prescription law in 1860, and most other states
followed suit over the next three decades. Medical lexicons
classified opium and morphine as &quot;narcotics,&quot; along
with most other psychoactive substances then in use, including
alcohol; however, that term was not employed in most of these
laws or in common parlance. </p>

<p>As early as the 18th Century, the medical profession was aware
that the oral use of opium could result in the development of an
&quot;appetite&quot; or &quot;habit,&quot; a phenomenon which was
generally classed in the same category as the &quot;alcohol
habit.&quot; This awareness was not of sufficient consequence to
suggest the need for caution when morphine was discovered in 1803
and when the hypodermic syringe was introduced in the middle of
the century. As the hypodermic use of morphine became common in
the United States, the syringes were left with patients for their
own use to remedy practically every painful condition. </p>

<p>The drug was used indiscriminately during the Civil War for
the wholesale relief of pain and, most significantly, to treat
common gastrointestinal ailments. After the War, morphine was
widely used in medical practice and was easily available outside
the medical system in proprietary medicines. Within a few years,
&quot;morphinomania&quot; (or the &quot;army&quot; disease)
became a recognizable medical entity. Nonetheless, use of the
drug was only minimally restricted either from outside the
medical profession or within it, as Terry and Pellens noted in
their classic work: </p>

<p>Meanwhile the ease with which pain could be relieved through
the hypodermic administration of the drug, the time it saved the
physician in his busy rounds, the contentment it brought the
patient, and above all, the all too common inclination to relieve
symptoms rather than cause, contributed to increase the practice.
Consequently throughout the period of the earlier warnings of its
dangers, the employment of this mode of administration was
increasing by leaps and bounds wherever medicine was practiced.
(Terry and Pellens, 1928) </p>

<p>This phenomenon of medically-based opiate use was largely
invisible and was not a matter of major concern outside the
medical profession for several decades. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a public response was triggered by use of these
same drugs and cocaine in another social context. Beginning with
increased Chinese immigration after the Civil War, the practice
of smoking opium took root on the West Coast and spread rapidly
across the country to most urban areas. Although the practice was
confined mainly to the Chinese, it also appeared to attract
&quot;sporty characters&quot; and the underworld figures in the
cities. </p>

<p>In 1875, San Francisco enacted an ordinance prohibiting the
smoking or possession of opium, the possession of opium pipes and
the maintenance of &quot;opium dens.&quot; As the practice
spread, it generated a succession of similar state laws and<b> </b>local,
ordinances. Despite a growing problem of opiate dependence
arising from unrestrained distribution of these drugs within the
medical system in the United States, it was the
&quot;street&quot; use of the opiates and cocaine which
accelerated professional and public interest in their
habit-forming properties. </p>

<p>By the turn of the century, the nation had become aware of a
large opiate-dependent population in its midst. Although
contemporary estimates of its size varied as widely as current
figures do, most researchers have concluded that the total never
exceeded a quarter of a million, divided evenly between
&quot;medical&quot; and &quot;street&quot; dependence. As a
result of increased awareness, the medical profession and state
legislatures intensified their efforts to control availability of
these substances, primarily by tightening the restrictions on<b> </b>medical
distribution and prohibiting non-medical distribution. In 1906,
the Congress passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, the first major
federal drug legislation, which required labelling of all
preparations containing &quot;habit-forming&quot; drugs, and
proprietaries containing significant quantities of opiates soon
disappeared. </p>

<p>By 1900, then, policy makers and the medical profession were
attuned to the dangers of chronic drug use, and some commentators
have suggested that the availability of more accurate information
within the profession and improved methods of medical education
would have retarded the medically-based opiate-dependence problem
had it not been for the introduction of heroin in 1898 (Terry and
Pellens, 1928). This new cough suppressant was promoted on the
theory that it possessed many of the virtues and few of the
dangers of morphine; some even suggested that it would be useful
in the treatment of morphinism itself. From the time of its
introduction, however, there were conflicting claims regarding
its capacity for producing dependence. Regardless of these
claims, the drug was available for the next decade in proprietary
medicines and throughout medical practice. </p>

<p>By 1910, the medical profession had become seriously concerned
about the habit-forming characteristics of heroin. The publicity
attending its pleas for legislative controls on the availability
of this drug, together with a crusade being waged by law
enforcement officials against the street use of opiates and
cocaine, aroused public anxiety about a &quot;narcotics
problem&quot; of major proportions. Although almost every state
had regulatory laws of some kind, most observers contended that
the states could not control the problem. Federal legislation was
also said to be necessary to implement international treaties. In
addition, the movement for national alcohol prohibition began
gathering steam in 1913, sensitizing the public to the
possibility of national drug prohibitions. All these factors
culminated in passage of the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1914
(.Musto, 1973). </p>

<p>The Harrison Act crystallized a national policy of curtailing
the availability of &quot;habit-forming&quot; substances. The
previous failure to appreciate the habit-forming properties of
new substances had now resulted in professional and legislative
preoccupation with this issue. Whereas the term narcotics
formerly referred to those substances which produced
stupefication and sleep (&quot;narcosis&quot;), including
alcohol, the term now assumed a new meaning, one defined by the
public policy bearing its name. The term was now associated with
any unfamiliar drug which appeared on the streets among those
populations which were associated with the opiates and cocaine.
The acute effects of the various specific drugs became blurred.
Because physicians and policy makers had now become exceedingly
cautious about the dependence issue, any new drug was carefully
scrutinized for habit-forming properties; if the drug was used on
the streets it was often presumed &quot;habit forming&quot; and
therefore classified as a &quot;narcotic.&quot; </p>

<p>Within the next three decades, peyote and marihuana were
inserted in the &quot;narcotics&quot; laws of many states;
chloral hydrate, which had been covered by earlier drug laws, was
also included in the definition of &quot;narcotics&quot; in the
new legislation. It should be noted that legal classification of
a drug as a &quot;narcotic&quot; tended to malign its therapeutic
utility. For example, heroin, and later marihuana, were purged
from the pharrnacopoeia altogether. In sum, the word
&quot;narcotics&quot; had been purged of its scientific meaning
and became, instead, a symbol of socially disapproved drugs. </p>

<p>Other substances were introduced into the practice of
medicine, notably the barbiturates and amphetamines, but they
were regulated under general pharmacy laws rather than under the
&quot;narcotics&quot; laws. Although amphetamines were introduced
in 1929 and the short-acting barbiturates appeared a few years
later, they did not enter the illicit marketplace on a massive
scale in the United States until the 1960's and consequently were
not associated with the narcotics until then. </p>

<p>During the last decade, succeeding waves of hallucinogens,
amphetamines and barbiturates escaped from the laboratories,
pharmacies and medicine chests and found they way into the
streets. Together with marihuana, which moved from one
socio-economic &quot;street&quot; to another, use of these drugs
defined a new phenomenon and became associated with a new kind of
drug user<b>. </b>To a substantial degree, the narcotics policy
had from the beginning been identified with underprivileged
minorities, criminals and social outsiders in general, although a
common feature of each periodic drug scare, including cocaine at
the turn of the century, heroin in the 1920's, marihuana in the
1930's and heroin again in the 1950's, was the fear that drug use
would spread to youth. However, the drug problem of the 1960's
was clearly identified with the children of the middle and upper
classes. Drug use was now associated with unfamiliar life styles,
youthful defiance of the established order, the emergence of a
visible street culture, campus unrest, communal living, protest
politics and even political radicalism. </p>

<p>The drug taking of this youth population coincided with
pervasive social anxieties regarding social disorder in general
and youthful behavior specifically. To many, youthful drug use,
offered a convenient explanation for these problems, and, as the
Commission noted in its first Report, marihuana in particular
came to symbolize the entire spectrum of social concern. Existing
legislative controls and vocabulary were closely tied to the old
stereotypes, and society responded to this new drug-using
behavior through separate legislative action (the Drug Abuse
Control Amendments of 1965) and a new linguistic symbol.
&quot;Dangerous drugs&quot; emerged as the statutory label for
the nonnarcotic drugs, such as hallucinogens, amphetamines and
barbiturates, whose non-medical use was socially disapproved. </p>

<p>The single-mindedness of American drug policy is illustrated
clearly by the reorganization of the federal drug bureaucracy
which took place in 1968. For technical reasons stemming from the
revenue structure of the Harrison Act, narcotics enforcement had
always been lodged in the Treasury Department. When the,
&quot;dangerous drugs&quot; were brought under regulatory control
in 1965, enforcement responsibility was assigned to a new bureau
in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Then in
1968, the responsibilities of the two agencies were merged in a
new agency established in the Department of Justice: the Bureau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. Public policy had the
appearance of coherence once again. </p>

<p>But this was not enough. Marihuana use continued to increase
throughout the decade, and the public was caught up in a highly
emotional debate. For the first time since the inception of the
American &quot;narcotics&quot; policy, public opinion focused on
some of the fundamental assumptions. Not surprisingly, debate on
the marihuana issue was often couched in terms of the statutory
vocabulary which has come to symbolize drug policy. For example,
the scientifically indefensible classification of marihuana as a
&quot;narcotic&quot; immediately provoked an erosion of the
symbolic coherence which had previously characterized drug
policy. Similarly, the inevitable comparison between alcohol and
marihuana called into question the substantive separation between
narcotics and dangerous drug policies on the one hand and alcohol
policy on the other<font size="1">.2 </font>After all, alcohol
can legitimately be classified as a &quot;narcotic&quot; in a
very specific sense of that term, and it is surely a
&quot;dangerous drug&quot; as well. </p>

<p>2 <font size="1">During most of the period of national alcohol
prohibition, the Bureau of Prohibition was responsible for
enforcement of the Harrison Act as well as the Volstead Act; but
passage of these two laws had parallel rather than shared
histories, a point clearly demonstrated by subsequent events.</font>
</p>

<p>Until the close of the 1960's, official defenses of marihuana
policy continued to be premised on the implications of the
statutory vocabulary. Although the narcotic ideology was quickly
abandoned, many official pronouncements continued to link
marihuana with the opiates because of their association in the
law and to insist that marihuana was a &quot;dangerous drug&quot;
even if it was not a &quot;narcotic.&quot; An historical
understanding apprises us that these classifications are
reflections of, rather than reasons for social disapproval. </p>

<p>It became clear by the end of the decade that
&quot;narcotics&quot; and &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; were no
longer adequate symbols of social policy; consequently &quot;drug
abuse&quot; was adopted as a replacement symbol. However, the
need to distinguish marihuana use from other forms of &quot;drug
abuse&quot; resulted in yet another distinction: marihuana was
classified as a &quot;soft&quot; drug as opposed to the
&quot;hard&quot; drugs, suggesting the same kind of distinction
drawn between &quot;hard liquor&quot; and other alcoholic
beverages. But, as has been the case with all drug vocabulary,
this distinction serves a social rather than a scientific
purpose. This terminology generally indicates an attempt to
distinguish marihuana from heroin and cocaine, the stereotypical
&quot;hard&quot; drugs. However, there is no consensus whatsoever
as to which other substances, if any, are considered to be
&quot;hard.&quot; If hard drugs is a narrow category, referring
only to the opiates and cocaine, it is simply another way of
saying &quot;narcotics;&quot; on the other hand, if it is taken
to mean everything other than marihuana, it is simply an
expedient way of disassociating marihuana from other disapproved
drugs. </p>

<p>Like &quot;drug abuse,&quot; the hard-soft terminology
reflects a nascent effort to reestablish a sphere of
&quot;bad&quot; drug use. Within the official community as well
as the<b> </b>general public, attempts are being made to grade
drugs according to their potential hazards, particularly their
capacity for inducing physical dependence. To the extent that
this is true, the new linguistic symbols suggest that public
concern has in some ways returned full circle to where it began
almost a century ago.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE SOCIAL RESPONSE: FALSE PREMISES AND THE PERPETUATION OF
A PROBLEM <br>
</b></p>

<p>As this brief historical summary illustrates, American drug
policy is almost seven decades old, and not once during this
period have the underlying assumptions been systematically
evaluated and a broad, coherent foundation for policy making
established. As a result, each new occurrence in drug development
and each new use pattern have been viewed as unfamiliar, with the
unfamiliarity breeding a sense of crisis, and the crisis
precipitating <i>ad hoe </i>policy responses. </p>

<p>The Commission feels strongly that the present institutional
response, despite sincere efforts to move it in the right
direction, continues to be rooted in the mistakes of the past,
and, indirectly, tends to perpetuate the &quot;problem.&quot;
Accordingly, it is useful to scrutinize the goals toward which
the policy is directed and the premises which support it, as well
as to describe briefly some of the present governmental responses
which are guided by these assumptions. Finally, as a prelude to
the remainder of the Report, the concluding sections of this
Chapter will attempt to &quot;wipe the slate clean&quot; and to
sketch a general frame-work for defining the problem and
formulating a coherent social policy. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The Assumptions and Premises of Present Policy<br>
</b></p>

<p><b><i>Elimination of Non-Medical Drug Use<br>
</i></b></p>

<p>American drug policy has been predicated on one fundamental or
the societal objective is to eliminate &quot;non-medical&quot;
drug use. Inquiry has rarely been addressed to whether this goal
is desirable or possible. Failure to address such questions is
abetted by the exclusion of certain drugs and certain types of
drug taking from the realm of social distress. For example, the
non-medical use of alcohol and tobacco would be inconsistent with
the declared goal; thus, statutory vocabulary and social folklore
have established the fiction that they are not drugs at all.
Although use of these substances may arouse concern, they are not
viewed in the wider context of drug use. </p>

<p>Another area excluded from public discussion is drug use
sanctioned by medical judgment. While most medically-approved
consumption of psychoactive drugs is substantially different from
the situation where the individual chooses to use the drug
himself, this is not always true. The absence of the intervening
judgment of a third party does not mean that the individual's
motivation is &quot;non-medical,&quot; or hedonistic. Nor does
the intervention of medical judgment assure that the drug will be
used for medically-intended purposes.3 </p>

<p><font size="1">3 The third party judgment may intervene
directly, as is the case with prescription drugs, or indirectly,
as is the case with over-the-counter preparations previously
approved for this purpose by the Food and Drug Administration. </font></p>

<p>Drug policy makers cannot truthfully assert that this society
aims to eliminate non-medical drug use. No semantic fiction will
alter the fundamental composition of alcohol and tobacco.
Further, even if the objective is amended to exclude these drugs,
human history discounts the notion that drug-using behavior can
be so tightly confined as a self-medication in pharmacy, where
their prescription drugs with them, the proliferation of
over-the-counter preparations, the advertising of mood-altering
drugs, and the popularity of minor tranquilizers are all
manifestations of an important contemporary trend. </p>

<p>The medical/non-medical distinction has become increasingly
blurred as emotional ailments increase. Many individuals tend
today to assess their own needs and define the purposes for which
they use a drug. For this reason, generalized societal
proclamations regarding the need to eliminate non-medical drug
use raise an important question that must be honestly answered:
how does the daily use of a prescribed barbiturate to bring a
person &quot;down&quot; from the day differ from the similar use
of a self-prescribed minor tranquilizer or, for that matter, a
martini? </p>

<p>Deferring for the moment our own view as to what society's
objective in this area ought to be, we do know that it is not as
clear cut as official pronouncements imply. In determining the
appropriate objective, a task that we will undertake in Chapter
Four, policy makers must recognize the scope and complexity of
drug-using behavior and develop rational distinctions between
that which should be disapproved and that which should be
tolerated, or even approved. Within the area of disapproval,
policy makers should not consider all disapproved drug use to be
of equal importance; priorities must be assigned on the basis of
actual and potential social consequence, and not just on the
basis of numbers of users.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Risk-Taking and Health <br>
</i></p>

<p>Often cited in support of societal disapproval of non-medical
drug use is the proposition that individuals should not risk
their health by using drugs. Without regard to the philosophical
propriety of this premise as a guide for social policy, this view
appears to be somewhat at odds with the facts about drug use and
with prevailing social attitudes toward risk-taking in other
areas. </p>

<p>Much emphasis has been placed on whether or not a drug is a
dangerous drug; and analogies have been drawn between
&quot;street&quot; drugs and such substances as cyclamates. These
examples illustrate how closely public discussion of drug abuse
has become tied to matters of individual health. In supporting
present social policy, spokesmen often list those drug effects
which are potentially harmful to individual health rather than
focusing on the social consequences of drug-using behavior. </p>

<p>The Commission believes that persons who take this approach
have misconstrued the nature of the drug issue. The assumption
that all psychoactive drug use is a high-risk behavior presumes a
progression from irregular use of low doses to continuous use of
high doses, thereby ignoring pharmacological variations among
drugs and the importance of frequency of use, method of
administration, dose, and non-drug factors as determinants of
risk. In fact, injury to health is associated primarily with
chronic heavy use and at times with the acute effects of high
doses. </p>

<p>Further, there is no correlation whatsoever between the
capacity of psychoactive drugs to induce behavioral disorders and
their capacity to induce organic or somatic toxicity or
pathology. Of the drugs which are most commonly associated with
dependence or drug-induced behavior, alcohol produces the most
clearly established and reproducible brain pathology. Cocaine,
amphetamines and other stimulants, heroin and morphine-like
drugs, and cannabis do not appear to have this effect. On the
other hand, very heavy use of phenacitin, which has no
significant behavioral impact at all, may produce renal damage,
and heavy tobacco smoking is associated with greatly increased
risk of lung cancer. If the standard for social policy were
potential injury to individual health, barbiturates, alcohol, and
tobacco would present the clearest cases for prohibition. Yet,
the latter two are available for self-defined purposes, and the
former is widely used in the practice of medicine. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the approach often applied to &quot;drugs of
abuse&quot; is the same as that applied to non-psychoactive
substances: risks to individual health will be tolerated only if
the medical needs for the substance justify the risks. But
individuals would not choose to use psychoactive drugs if they
did not perceive some advantage to themselves. So the fundamental
question arises: Who is to weigh the perceived advantages of drug
use against the risk, the individual or the society? </p>

<p>To deal with this question, we must examine the pattern of
social response to risk-taking behavior in general. For example,
we urge our youth -to be curious and to explore. Until recent
years, Americans tended to place a premium on high-powered
automobiles. We tolerate the private ownership of firearms. We
tend to applaud the courageous mountain climber or other
adventurer who ignores the risks in the effort to establish human
dominion over nature. In short, risk-taking behavior is
-permitted and often encouraged by many of our social
institutions, which defer to individual judgment the weighing of
often intangible benefits against the quite tangible risks. </p>

<p>Society has long been aware of the individual and social risks
of alcohol use. Even with the effort now being made to inform the
public of the risks of tobacco use, society still permits this
drug to be widely available. In both cases, society clearly
subordinates the risks inherent in such behavior, deferring
instead to individual judgment. </p>

<p>The Commission is not suggesting that health risks are
irrelevant to the formulation of drug policy. However, whatever
appropriate weight is given to health considerations, it is a
peripheral, rather than focal, concern. Drug policy must be based
on the social consequences of drug use, and on the social impact
of drug-induced behavior.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Motivation for Mood Alteration </i></p>

<p>Subsumed within the societal goal of eliminating non-medical
drug use is the value judgment that use of drugs for the explicit
purpose of mood alteration is <i>per se </i>undesirable. To
harmonize this judgment with approved conduct, we avoid analyzing
the motivations of similar behaviors. </p>

<p>As noted earlier, we do not verbalize the motivation f or
alcohol use in terms of pleasure but rather in terms of the
drug's function as a relaxant, as a social lubricant, and as a
beverage. We do not think about the alcohol experience as an
altered state of consciousness but rather as a means to some
other end, such as promoting conviviality or stimulating
conversation. </p>

<p>Within the medical setting, the individual is increasingly
making the decision to use medically approved drugs and selecting
them according to their capacity to alter his mood. The National
Survey shows that 157o of the adult population reported that they
&quot;take a pill to calm down or cheer up&quot; when they feel
&quot;out of sorts . . . not really sick, but nervous, or
depressed or under stress.&quot; Eighteen percent of the public
reported that they used alcohol for similar purposes. The use of
a variety of new mood altering drugs to cope with stress is
undoubtedly a, significant social development, particularly among
women. This option to employ drugs for what is essentially an
individual diagnosis of felt needs has, to a large extent,
changed public perception concerning the role of the drugs as
mood alterants in our society. </p>

<p>Whatever the biological and psychological foundations for the
common human desire to alter consciousness, policy makers must
recognize that drugs have always been used for this purpose. Most
societies have institutionalized at least one form of
drug-induced mood alteration; only the drugs differ, not the
essential purpose. Instead of assuming that mood alteration
through some drugs is inherently objectionable, while similar use
of others is not, the public and its leaders must focus directly
on the appropriate role of drug induced mood alteration. It is no
longer satisfactory to defend social disapproval of use of a
particular drug on the ground that it is a &quot;mind-altering
drug&quot; or a &quot;means of escape.&quot; For so are they all.
<br>
</p>

<p><i>Drugs and Individual Responsibility </i></p>

<p>Implicit in present policy is the concern that many
individuals cannot be trusted to make prudent or responsible
decisions regarding drug-taking. Certain drugs are thought to
possess even greater powers than they have, including the
capacity to overbear individual will. Most people are not
accustomed to thinking about drug effects in terms of
probabilities and uncertainties, of dose-response curves, of
multiple effects (some desirable and some undesirable), of
reactions which vary from individual to individual and from time
to time in the same individual. </p>

<p>A deep-seated popular belief that some drugs diminish or
destroy the individual's capacity to control his behavior is
reflected in hypotheses such as &quot;drugs cause crime&quot; or
&quot;drugs cause dropping out&quot; or &quot;drugs cause mental
illness.&quot; Any perceived correlation between use of the drug
and the unwanted consequence is attributed to the drug, removing
the individual from any and all responsibility. Similarly, while
it is true that certain drugs offer more intense psychological
rewards than others, seduction characteristics are attributed to
all psychoactive drugs, suggesting a chain of progression from
light to heavy use, from weak to stronger drugs, all without the
intervention of individual choice. </p>

<p>A drug has no effect until it interacts with an organism. The
effects of any drug, psychoactive drugs included, are mainly dose
related. At low or moderate doses they are determined mainly by
non-drug factors, such as the psychological characteristics of
the individual, the reasons why he uses the drug, what he expects
the effects will be, the physical and social setting in which he
uses it, and how he perceives its use or non-use in relation to
self-defined goals. Further, how his friends, his sub-culture,
and his society define and respond to his drug use are equally
important f actors. These psychological and social criteria not
only influence the reaction to a specific drug but they are key
factors in determining use or non-use, selection of substance,
and the pattern and circumstances of use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>An Overview of the Present Response</b> </p>

<p>Because of this confusion about objectives, the formal
institutional response to the drug problem has been more
reflexive than rational, more situation-oriented than strategic.
The <i>ad hoc </i>responses to use of specific psychoactive drugs
have interfered with examination of the fundamental questions
relating to behavior patterns and the appropriate means of social
control. </p>

<p>Research has provided us with an almost endless stream of
psychoactive substances. The tendency is to identify a new
substance, determine its potential hazards as a chemical and then
to insert it into the existing system. This procedure tends to
perpetuate the public focus on the drugs rather than on the
prevention of behavior about which society is concerned. When the
drug appears in the streets, as it inevitably does, social
institutions respond as if the behavior was unanticipated, and
because they are ill-prepared to deal with the situation, an
atmosphere of crisis is generated. </p>

<p>Because the focus has always been on the elimination of
prohibited substances altogether and on the elimination of the
street use of therapeutically useful drugs, social institutions
have directed primary attention to the problem of use of s<i>pecific
drugs. </i>Patterns of drug-using behavior have been ignored
except as an afterthought of intervention. When increases in
prohibited drug use continue to escalate, policy makers respond,
not by reassessing the problem from different perspectives, but
rather by pressing for ever-more costly mechanisms of control;
costly both in terms of resources and important social values.
Drug policy can be, thus summed up: increased use of disapproved
drugs precipitates more spending, more programs, more arrests and
more penalties, all with little positive effect in reducing use
of these drugs. </p>

<p>Details of the present institutional response share the
confusion of purpose which characterizes the, entire social
response. We will sketch a few of the key features here although
these matters will be considered in some depth in Chapter Four.<br>
</p>

<p>Throughout this Report, consumption-related offenses will
refer to offenses such as use, possession for personal use,
presence in a place where prohibited drugs are being used. Unless
stated otherwise, &quot;possession&quot; means possession for
personal use.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Risk-Education</i> </p>

<p>An important operating assumption of the present response is
that if people are educated about the risks of drug taking, they
will not use drugs. It is presumed that presentation of
information regarding dangers and risks can quiet curiosity and
the desire for anticipated pleasant psychological sensations, the
factors which account for most individual drug experiences. </p>

<p>Society's experience in attempting to discourage use of
substances not labeled as drugs is instructive. Campaigns have
been mounted in the past, both through the mass media and the
schools, about the dangers of alcohol use and cigarette smoking.
Facts have been marshaled, scientific opinion has been mobilized,
and the adverse consequences of use of these drugs have been
amply demonstrated by the number of alcoholics within the United
States and the number of persons dying yearly from heart disease,
lung cancer and other respiratory ailments. Still the consumption
of alcohol continues and the number of persons smoking cigarettes
increases. </p>

<p>This same kind of educational effort has been directed at the
illicit drugs with no apparent impact on behavior. Little insight
has been gained as to why this approach has not worked with
alcohol and cigarettes, or as to whether risk-oriented curricula
may actually arouse interest rather than dampen it. Further,
assuming that such programs might be useful, little thought has
been given to how to transmit the information, the assumption
again being that the facts speak for themselves. This vast
expenditure of time, money and effort has apparently paid few
measurable social dividends, and those that have claimed success
have done so not on the basis of scientific proof, but on the
basis of impressions and anecdote. </p>

<p><b><i>Coercion</i></b> </p>

<p>If information about risks and moral suasion is insufficient
to convince many people not to use drugs, it is assumed that the
threat of a criminal sanction will do so. While a criminal
proscription does function as a deterrent to some degree for all
behavior, the strength of this factor varies according to the
nature of the offense, the, characteristics of the actor, the
probability of detection and the certainty of punishment. With
regard to drug consumption, all of these factors diminish the
utility of the criminal sanction. Drug consumption is an
expressive conduct which normally occurs in private among groups
which are least influenced by legal condensation. In addition,
the consumption-related offenses are no longer supported by the
strong social consensus which once existed, and the emerging
ambivalence is reflected in the dispositional decisions of
police, prosecutors and courts. </p>

<p>We note that drug consumption offenses have not been
remarkably successful in curtailing use in general. However, it
is important here, as elsewhere, to distinguish between different
patterns of drug taking behavior. On the one hand, the law may
deter indiscrete use and continued use of a prohibited drug. On
the other hand, experimental behavior, particularly by youth, is
unlikely to be deterred by the law alone. For those who are
dependent upon prohibited drugs, such as the heroin-dependent
person, the deterrence concept is functionally inapplicable. </p>

<p><b><i>Sickness</i></b> </p>

<p>Anyone choosing to use drugs, despite the enumerated risks,
moral suasion and threat of criminalization, is often considered
abnormal, emotionally ill and weak of character. The last decade
has seen the pendulum of legislative opinion swing toward the
belief that drug dependence and even drug use is a
&quot;medical&quot; problem, that it can be &quot;treated,&quot;
and that the user can be &quot;rehabilitated.&quot; Like many
ideas which aim to correct those previously in vogue, the medical
approach has itself become a runaway concept. Policy makers have
adopted policy guidewords such as &quot;treatment,&quot;
&quot;rehabilitation,&quot; &quot;contagion,&quot; and
&quot;epidemic,&quot; without regard to their utility in the
present context. </p>

<p>The &quot;sickness&quot; label has been attached to all users
of prohibited drugs without regard to their patterns of
drug-taking behavior. While very few question that persons
compulsively using drugs are in need of some form of therapeutic
assistance, the same is rarely true for the experimental and
recreational user. To label drug users in general as mentally ill
is to place a large segment of American society in need of formal
medical assistance. </p>

<p>With regard to drug dependence in particular, the public has
been led to believe that this condition is as definable and
treatable as ordinary illnesses of the body. In reality, there is
not, at the present time, any generally applicable cure for
drug-dependent persons let alone non-dependent users of drugs.
&quot;Success&quot; in treatment programs has been difficult to
define, reflecting the complex relationship between drug use,
social functioning and mental health. Even when measured against
their own criteria for evaluation, most treatment programs can
demonstrate only limited &quot;success.&quot; </p>

<p>Public policy is committed to the treatment and rehabilitation
of all drug-dependent persons. While thousands of persons have
been aided by treatment efforts in recent years, social
objectives continue to outstrip professional understanding of the
condition and official capacity to deliver the necessary
services. </p>

<p><i>Perpetuating the Problem</i> </p>

<p>Because of the intensity of the public concern and the
emotionalism surrounding the topic of drugs, all levels of
government have been pressured into action with little time for
planning. The political pressures involved in this governmental
effort have resulted in a concentration of public energy on the
most immediate aspects of drug use and a reaction along the paths
of least political resistance. The recent result has been the
creation of ever larger bureaucracies, ever increasing
expenditures of monies, and an outpouring of publicity so that
the public will know that &quot;something&quot; is being done. </p>

<p>Perhaps the major consequence of this <i>ad hoc </i>policy
planning hag been the creation, at the federal, state and
community levels, of a vested interest in the perpetuation of the
problem among those dispensing and receiving funds.
Infrastructures are created, job descriptions are standardized,
&quot;experts&quot; are created and ways of doing business
routinized and established along bureaucratic channels. During
the last several years, drug programming has become a
multi-billion dollar industry, one administering to its own needs
as well as to those of its drug-using clientele. In the course of
well-meaning efforts to do something about drug use, this society
may have inadvertently institutionalized it as a never-ending
project. </p>

<p>All of these responses stem from one fundamental flaw in
present drug policy: the problem is defined incorrectly. The
uneasiness which the Commission has encountered among thoughtful
observers and officials arises largely from their own perceptions
that the present response, although massive, has so far been
relatively ineffective. Yet, any challenge to the basic premises
of policy may be viewed by some as a disavowal of the entire
social response. The Commission does not believe the present
policy should be abandoned out of hand. Instead, we hope that
policy can be made more coherent and more flexible. In order to
do so, we must put aside preconceived notions, setting out afresh
to redefine the problem.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DEFINING THE PROBLEM</b> </p>

<p><b>The Meaning of Drug Use </b></p>

<p>Throughout history man has used available psychoactive
substances to seek relief from cold, hunger, deprivation,
anxiety, pain and boredom. He also has used such substances to
receive pleasure or to achieve new experiences. Various cultures
have sought out and used naturally occurring plants for their
psychoactive ingredients, discovering their effects by trial and
error. Modern man has consciously created new chemical substances
and institutionalized their availability for similar uses. </p>

<p>Drugs have effects other than those which are sought; and all
drug effects vary with amount and frequency of use, the
characteristics of the user, and the set and setting in which
they are used. Consequently, different cultures have applied
different values to the presumed consequences of drug use,
whether beneficial or deleterious. Each society has decided which
needs are legitimate, which effects are valuable and which risks
are tolerable. These judgments are based on prevailing values
concerning specific drugs, their effects, the reasons for which
they are used, and the people who use them. </p>

<p>Man does not ordinarily continue to do something that does not
fulfill some real or imagined need. To persist, behavior must be
reinforced. To the extent that it does fulfill a need, it will
recur, often at some risk, unless it interferes with some more
important need. The need for a drug may be closely related to its
real or imagined effects or it may be grounded in social rather
than chemical elements. Use of specific substances may determine
group membership, or status within a group, or among groups. It
may function as either a symbol or symptom of rebellion,
alienation, independence or sophistication. </p>

<p>To better understand current self-defined drug use and to
determine the scope of social concern, one must go beyond the
cataloguing of substances (pharmacologically defined where
possible), the listing of effects, and the counting of users and
non-users of drugs. The inquiry must shift from drugs to people,
from pharmacological effects to the meaning and function of drug
use. </p>

<p><i>The Incidence of Drug Use </i></p>

<p>The nature and scope of society's drug problem at any given
time are generally perceived in terms of the incidence of
non-medical use of legal and illegal substances. Tables 1-4 and
1-5 present data, of this kind obtained in the
Commission-sponsored National Survey.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="pip10004.gif" align="bottom" width="439"
height="554"> </p>

<p>Such statistics may be useful for assessing in general terms
the relative success or failure of institutional efforts to
channel drug taking behavior into prescribed channels. However,
these figures, and similar ones, are often used to arouse public
concern, and do not explain either the meaning of such drug use
or the nature and scope of the social problem which it poses. </p>

<p>As an example, Table 1-5 illustrates that regular use of
alcohol is extremely widespread among Americans 18 years of age
and older (53%), and that large numbers of the nation's youth
(12-17) consume alcohol despite official blandishments (24%). Do
the respective legitimacy and illegitimacy of these behaviors
tell us anything about the nature of social concern about alcohol
use? </p>

<p>In comparison, Table 1-4 indicates that 16% of the adult
population and 14% of the youth have used marihuana despite the
legal proscriptions, and that 8 % of the adults and 7 % of the
youth continue to use the drug. Smaller percentages of the
populace have also violated the law by trying hallucinogens such
as LSD, cocaine or heroin. Does the illegitimacy and relative
incidence of such behavior bear directly on the dimensions of
social concern? Is marihuana use more or less of a social problem
than heroin use? Than alcohol use? </p>

<p>The data in Table 1-5 illustrate that over-the-counter
preparations are sometimes consumed for non-therapeutic reasons.
Does the permissibility of this behavior suggest that it is
without social consequence? Does the motivation for use make a
public policy difference? </p>

<p>Scientifically acceptable incidence data, together with
demographic analysis, can tell us who uses various drugs and bow
they are used in terms of frequency and duration. Such
information cannot, however, answer the crucial social policy
questions: why <i>and so what?<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Drug-using Behavior</i> </p>

<p>The initial step in understanding the meaning of drug use and
its impact on the social order is to regard this phenomenon as we
would any other human behavior. In Chapter Two of the Report, the
Commission will place these incidence figures in perspective,
elaborating on the patterns of drug-using behavior and the
individual and social factors which seem to influence individual
decisions to initiate,<font size="1"> </font>continue or
terminate the use of drugs. In short, we will try to answer the <i>why
</i>of drug use. Because drug-using behavior is not a unitary
phenomenon, the social consequences of this behavior are tied
directly to the individual's reason for the drug use and in turn
to the frequency, duration, intensity, dose, set and setting of
use. The Commission has divided the entire spectrum of drug-using
behavior into five patterns reflecting essentially distinct
meanings for the individual users. </p>

<p>The most common type of drug-using behavior can be classified
as <i>experimental: </i>a short-term, non-patterned trial of one
or more drugs, motivated primarily by curiosity or a desire to
experience an altered mood state. Experimental use most often
occurs among young persons in the company of one or more
drug-experimenting friends or acquaintances. </p>

<p>Most non-experimental drug-using behavior can be classified as
<i>recreational, </i>which occurs in social settings among
friends or acquaintances who desire to share an experience which
they define as both acceptable and pleasurable. Generally,
recreational use is both voluntary and patterned and tends not to
escalate to more frequent or intense use patterns. This type of
behavior is not sustained by virtue of the dependence of the user
on the drug in any meaningful sense of that term. Reinforcement
for continued use is strengthened by non-drug factors. </p>

<p>A pattern of drug-using behavior which has grown significantly
during the last decade is <i>circumstantial </i>drug use. This
behavior is generally motivated by the user's perceived need or
desire to achieve a new and anticipated effect in order to cope
with a specific problem, situation or condition of a personal or
vocational nature. This classification would include students who
utilize stimulants during preparation for exams, long-distance
truckers who rely on similar substances to provide extended
endurance and alertness, military personnel who use drugs to cope
with stress in combat situations, athletes who attempt to improve
their performance and housewives who seek to relieve tension,
anxiety, boredom or other stresses through the use of sedatives
or stimulants. </p>

<p>A much smaller group of drug users may be regarded as having
escalated from recreational or circumstantial use patterns into
intensified drug-using behavior. Although this is the most
amorphous of the behavioral categories, the Commission refers in
general to drug use which occurs at least daily and is motivated
by an individual's perceived need to achieve relief from a
persistent problem or stressful situation, or his desire to
maintain a certain self-prescribed level of performance. This
category includes persons generally referred to as &quot;problem
drinkers&quot; or &quot;heavy social drinkers,&quot; housewives
who regularly consume barbiturates or other sedatives and
business executives who regularly consume tranquilizers. A very
different group of intensified users are those youths who have
turned to drugs as sources of excitement or meaning in otherwise
unsatisfying existences. The salient feature of this class of
behavior is that the individual still remains integrated within
the larger social and economic structure; however, the regular
use of one or more drugs may constitute dependence in a broad
sense and may threaten to impair individual or social
functioning. </p>

<p>The most disturbing pattern of drug-using behavior,
encompassing the smallest number of drug users, is compulsive use
which consists of a patterned behavior at a high frequency and
high level of intensity, characterized by a high degree of
psychological dependence and perhaps physical dependence as well.
The distinguishing feature of this behavior is that drug use
dominates the individual's existence, and preoccupation with drug
taking precludes other social functioning. Under current social
and legal conditions, compulsive drug use is most easily
recognized as occurring among chronic alcoholics and
heroin-dependent persons, although the incidence of compulsive
barbiturate use is probably significantly higher than the
essentially episodic nature of street use would suggest.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Drug-Related Risk<br>
</i></p>

<p>An understanding of the different types of drug-using behavior
is the starting point for problem definition. In these behavioral
classifications, the key element is the meaning of drug use to
the individual; the specific drug being used is subsumed within
this framework. In reaching the next step in the problem
definition process, we must focus on the individual and social
risks attending drug use and those factors which distinguish
drug-using behavior from other forms of experimental and
recreational activities and other forms of coping behavior. As an
aid to understanding, basic psychopharmacological principles
concerning drug-related risk must be kept in mind. </p>

<p>Drug-related risk, both individual and social, escalates with
increasing dose and higher frequency of administration. </p>

<p>Drug-related risk varies with the mode of drug administration,
generally being highest for intravenous administration and lowest
for oral ingestion. </p>

<p>Drug-related risk varies according to the setting in which use
occurs, particularly when low doses are used. </p>

<p>Drug-related risk varies according to the user's capacity to
control intake and detoxify the drug. The greatest risk occurs
when the rate of administration exceeds the capacity of the body
to detoxify the drug and in consequence the brain is never drug
free. </p>

<p>Drug-related risk varies according to the &quot;set&quot; of
the user, including the expected and desired outcome of the drug
experience, the user's personality, his ability to compensate for
drug effects on the basis of prior experience, and his ability to
limit intake according to a predetermined capacity. </p>

<p>Drug-related risk often increases significantly if more than
one drug is used concomitantly. </p>

<p>Further, many risks associated with drug use are a function of
social policy rather than of the drugs themselves. Unintentional
drug overdoses, whatever their precise pharmacological
characteristics, occur most often among those who have secured
drugs outside the legitimate channels which control quality and
potency. For example, the incidence of alcohol-induced blindness
was significantly higher during alcohol prohibition than it is
today mainly because users resorted to methyl alcohol. In
addition, the unsupervised intravenous use of illicitly obtained
substances increases the likelihood of pulmonary and circulatory
disorders and diseases which may result from use of unsterilized
equipment or from injection of insoluble material used on the
street to increase the bulk of the drug. Finally, much
drug-related crime, particularly that associated with dependence
on opiates such as heroin, is a function of a prohibitory social
policy toward availability rather than of the drugs themselves. </p>

<p>The above propositions apply to all drugs. However, an
additional axiom is crucial to formulation of social policy:
specific drugs are qualitatively different in terms of individual
and social risk. Drug using behavior is not a unitary phenomenon;
nor are all drugs the same. At lower levels of use, when non-drug
factors predominate in determining drug effect, the differences
among drugs in terms of relative risk may be relatively
unimportant. At other levels of use, particularly in large doses
or high frequencies, the characteristics of the drug may become
most important in determining risk. </p>

<p>With these psychopharmacological postulates in mind, we now
turn to an analysis of the type of risks which engender social
concern<b>. </b>The Commission has categorized drug-related risks
into those affecting individual health, those involving
drug-induced behavior as an acute consequence of the drug
experience, and those associated with the behavioral aspects of
chronic use or dependence.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Risks to individual health </i></p>

<p>The health risks arising from the acute effects of a drug
experience are related primarily to dose and the set and setting
of use. When drugs are consumed in small doses orally or by
sniffing, acute risks to health are usually slight; when they are
administered intravenously, however, even in small doses, the
acute health risks are multiplied, and fatalities have occurred,
often for obscure reasons. High doses, individual
predispositions, including those related to age, and uncertain
expectations increase the risk of overdoses and of physical and
psychological injury. Since the lethality and psychological
effects of individual drugs differ widely, the drug used is an
important determinant of health-related risks. </p>

<p>The major concern from the standpoint of<b> </b>individual
health is the effect of repeated administration of the drug over
a long term, rather than the acute effect of the drug experience.
The possibilities of organ damage as well as impairment of
psychological function increase with the frequency and intensity
of use; also, chronic use of tolerance producing drugs increases
the risk of overdose as well as the likelihood of physical or
psychological damage. Individual drugs vary widely in toxicity,
in tolerance and in psychological effect. </p>

<p>As we noted earlier, the special public policy considerations
posed by psychoactive drug use arise not from risks to individual
health per se but rather from the capacity of these drugs to
affect behavior. There is no correlation between the capacity of
a psychoactive drug to induce behavioral disorders and its
capacity to induce either brain or other somatic pathology.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Drug-Induced Behavior</i> </p>

<p>Whether a person under the influence of a drug will become
aggressive or passive, will have impaired psychomotor capacity or
will exhibit otherwise disordered behavior depends on the entire
range of variables determining drug effect. Set and setting play
a most important role, particularly when low doses are consumed.
However, drugs are qualitatively different in this connection and
can be compared. A regular user of psychoactive substances is
generally able to compensate for some of the acute behavioral
effects. Over the long term, however, additional risks may be
encountered; as a result of chronic use, a person may become
significantly more aggressive or passive, may become
significantly less adept at muscular control, or may deteriorate
mentally, becoming incapable of engaging in voluntary learning
efforts. Most important, the likelihood of adverse long term
effects on behavior is increased substantially if the person
becomes dependent upon the substance. It is for this reason that
we have isolated the dependence liability of various substances
as a separate risk factor. </p>

<p><i>Dependence Liability</i> </p>

<p>Whether a person who continues to use a psychoactive substance
will become dependent on the substance, escalating from
recreational or circumstantial patterns to intensified or
compulsive patterns, is an issue where the characteristics of the
drug and the individual play equally important roles. As we will
discuss in Chapter Three, drugs are qualitatively different in
terms of their potential for reinforcement. For example,
marihuana is significantly less reinforcing than heroin or
cocaine. The behavioral consequences of chronic use also differ
among drugs, as does the potential for behavioral disruption when
the dependent person's drug-taking is interrupted. From these
perspectives, chronic use of dependence-producing doses of
barbiturates pose significantly different problems from chronic
use of cocaine. </p>

<p>Because the health and behavioral risks of drug use increase
with frequency, intensity and duration of use, the likelihood of
dependence is a crucial determinant of social concern.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Evaluating the Social Consequences of Drug Use</b> </p>

<p>In order to translate the analyses of drug-using behavior and
risk potential of specific drugs into a meaningful framework for
policy making, a description and<b> </b>evaluation of the social
consequences which flow from drug-induced behavior or drug
dependence is necessary. Although these issues will be addressed
in Chapter Three, some general observations regarding the social
impact of various patterns of drug-using behavior and of the use
of individual drugs is useful so that a definition of the drug
problem as it is understood to exist in American society today
can be undertaken. </p>

<p>As we wrote in our first Report on marihuana, the social
impact of the use of a particular drug or of a specific pattern
of drug-using behavior involves three distinct considerations.
First is the impact on <i>public safety </i>of drug-induced
behavior or drug dependence. The major concerns from the
standpoint of drug-induced behavior are increased aggressiveness
or violent behavior, loss of psychomotor control or alteration of
judgment and perception which might result in dangerous conduct.
With regard to drug dependence, the public safety may be
threatened by persons who are dependent upon a drug which is not
legitimately available and who may commit crimes to finance
purchases in the illicit market. </p>

<p>The second general area of social consequence is the impact <i>on
the public health and public welfare </i>arising from drug use.
This is a quantitative concept pertaining to the health resources
and social services necessary to prevent, treat and compensate
for the adverse effects of drug use as well as the social loss,
in terms of productivity and social contribution, which occurs
whenever drug use interferes with normal social and economic
functioning. For example, unemployment, absenteeism, decreased
social performance levels and family disruption may all stem from
intensified or compulsive drug use, resulting in a measurable
social loss. </p>

<p>When drug use is approached from the public health and welfare
standpoint, it must be viewed as part of the larger health and
welfare system which deals with many related problems. This
system generally focuses on populations at risk, organizing the
necessary range of medical, human and social services for
delivery of services to the appropriate population. In the drug
area, health resources must be allocated and<b> </b>available to
deal with acute reactions, overdoses and diseases, such as
hepatitis, among predictable proportions of drug-using
populations. This may require a shift of limited medical services
from one health area to another. More important, medical and
social services must be organized for delivery to persons whose
intensified or compulsive drug use is correlated with impairment
of social functioning (treatment and rehabilitation), as well as
to populations who might develop these patterns of use
(prevention). </p>

<p>Finally, an understanding of the social impact of drug use
must also include the impact <i>on the normative social order. </i>Although
this concept is entirely qualitative, dealing with the prevailing
social values, it has always determined the manner in which the
drug problem has been defined and the nature of the social
response. In terms of establishing policy predicates, the
Commission believes strongly that considerations of morality do
influence the formulation of appropriate policy objectives.
However, the Commission believes that such considerations often
have been overemphasized in the process of defining the problem.
Only when the impact of drug use on the normative social order is
placed in proper perspective can we hope to dispel the climate of
crisis in which drug policy is now made.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Defining America's Drug Problem</b> </p>

<p>Theoretically, social concern about use of a particular
substance relative to another should correlate with the verified
social costs attending the use of each drug in that society. As
the incidence of intensified and compulsive use increases, so too
should the public's concern with the problem. However, the
current problem definition in the United States bears little
relationship to actual social cost. The intense public concern
regarding use of most drugs in large measure reflects anxiety for
the future rather than empirical considerations rooted in the
present. The result has been an overestimation of the nature of
the problem attending use of some drugs, such as marihuana, and
an underestimation of the problem attending use of other drugs,
such as barbiturates and alcohol. </p>

<p>In the Commission's view, problem definition should take into
account the relationship between the maximum potential social
cost of use of a particular drug under given conditions of
availability, compared with the verified social costs at a
particular point in time. In this context, the most serious
concern in contemporary America should attach to the use of
alcohol and heroin. Moderate social concern should attach to the
use of amphetamines, barbiturates, hallucinogens, methaqualone
and cocaine, the use of which is relatively well-controlled
within the present social policy framework. The use of marihuana
and the so-called minor tranquilizers appears to require
relatively minimum social concern at the present time. Present
trends do suggest, however, that the incidence of use of and
dependence on barbiturates and cocaine may be increasing and may
demand increased social attention. It is in this context that we
turn to a general overview of the means by which social control
should be achieved. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The Limits of Social Control </b></p>

<p>The Commission believes that the contemporary American drug
problem has emerged in part from our institutional response to
drug use. Since we have failed to appreciate the diverse nature
of drug using behavior, we have failed to weave policy into the
fabric of social institutions. Instead, policy has been imposed
from the top, often without regard to possible impact on the
institutional fabric itself, much less on drug use. It is
worthwhile, then, to consider the general requirements of social
control and the general guidelines upon which policy making
should be based. </p>

<p>Responsible observers agree that society has an interest in
controlling the individual's drug-taking behavior. The
potentially disruptive behavioral effects of the drug experience
and the potentially adverse social consequences of the chronic
use of most psychoactive drugs are matters of appropriate
concern. The policy maker's task in this area is not to choose
between social control or social disinterest; rather, it is to
determine if and when informal mechanisms of social control must
be supplemented with formal ones. </p>

<p>Drug use, in one form or another, has been a common feature of
most cultures throughout history. To the Commission's knowledge,
no society has successfully eliminated drug use altogether,
although all have attempted to set limits, and most heterogeneous
societies have contained distinct subgroups opposing all drug use
among their own members. The alcohol prohibition experience in
this country is best viewed as an attempt by one social group to
impose its abstentionist doctrine on the entire culture. Social
control generally stops short of elimination. </p>

<p>In its most basic sense, drug taking is socially controlled
when it is routinized, ritualized and structured in ways which
reduce to a minimum the occurrence of drug-induced behavior which
the culture considers undesirable. In small, primitive societies,
the social control over drug use tends to be most successful
since it is fully integrated with the overall institutional
control structure, generally dominated by kinship and religious
institutions. The well-controlled, ritualized use of
hallucinogenic substances by a number of tribal cultures, such as
the Indians <b>in </b>Central and North America and the
aborigines of Australia, has been amply demonstrated (deRios
1973). </p>

<p>In contemporary mass societies, however, responsibility for
social control over increasing spheres of human conduct has
tended to pass from the family and church to educational,
economic and governmental institutions. This reliance on formal
institutions, coupled with the impersonality and complexity of
industrial and post-industrial societies, has made the task of
social control of drug-taking behavior all the more difficult.
For this reason, together with the proliferation of available
substances, the problem appears far more pervasive in these
societies, especially when they are heterogeneous and
individualistic. </p>

<p>Western societies have routinely utilized their public
institutions, particularly the legal ones, in an effort to
contain undesirable drug use within tolerable limits. </p>

<p>The success of social control through law is always difficult
to measure. First, &quot;tolerable limits&quot; is a relative
concept. Many societies in the early stages of industrialization
have large populations of chronic drug users, but the importance
of enforcement of legal controls on drug taking behavior pales
beside the more pressing social needs of food, shelter, clothing
and national survival. In this sense, the United States is
comparatively fortunate to be able to be concerned about its drug
problem, and to have a surplus of national resources to devote to
its resolution. </p>

<p>A second factor which complicates heavy reliance on social
control through law are the values different societies place on
the rights of individuals. Application of criminal law must
conform to well-established limitations in the United States and
Great Britain, for example, and certain proscriptions thought
necessary to minimize a given drug using behavior may be more
intolerable to the general social fabric than the behavior
itself. But this is not true in all societies. Japan, which is a
more authoritarian society, was able to stem a large and growing
amphetamine problem during the mid 1950's and an incipient heroin
problem during the early 1960's by mobilizing a broadly based
social response centered on effective use of the criminal law and
an educational effort based in large measure on national pride.
It is doubtful that similar exhortations and enforcement
techniques could be as readily employed in this country. </p>

<p>These cross-cultural observations provide the backdrop against
which we must consider the current American response to its drug
problem. First, reliance on law is unlikely to be effective in
American society unless it is joined consciously and directly
with use of other institutions of social control. Second, drug
policy should not be made in a vacuum. A proposed policy must be
analyzed both in terms of its likely impact on drug-taking
behavior as well as its likely impact on other social values and
institutions. Third, the problems to which the society directs
its formal response must be those which exceed the level of
socially tolerable limits. For example, most drug use, even of
disapproved substances, is socially controlled to some degree by
informal institutions such as peer groups and families. Formal
social efforts should be directed to those behaviors which are
not adequately controlled by informal mechanisms of social
control, aiming primarily to support the informal control
mechanisms and intervening directly only as a last resort.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE COMMISSION'S ROLE</b> </p>

<p>The Commission believes that the first step toward resolving
the drug problem is to reconsider the present diagnosis of the
ailment. The social response is presently a large part of the
problem, one which is compounded with each unanticipated crisis.
To break this cycle, it is necessary to refocus our attention on
that behavior which carries the most serious social consequence.
Preoccupation with the drugs themselves must be replaced by an
understanding of the behavioral impact of drug use. We must deal
directly with the ambivalence of our attitudes with respect to
drugs, conforming our beliefs to reality and our conduct to our
ideals. Only then will a coherent policy emerge, one which can
withstand legitimate criticism, and one which will have a
beneficial impact on the problem. </p>

<p>Promises which cannot be kept must not be made. The public
must be apprised that disapproved drug use is part of a larger
social pattern, and that all the money and effort that the
American society can muster will never be able to deal
effectively with this behavior if the problem continues to be
defined as it is now. Drug policy making must take into account a
wide range of social phenomena of which drug use is a small part,
and institutional responses must be framed in the context of
broader social roles. Unless present policy is redirected, we
will perpetuate the same problems, tolerate the same social
costs, and find ourselves as we do now, no further along the road
to a more rational legal and social approach than we were in
1914. </p>

<p>The Commission has not attempted to devise utopian policy
recommendations. Instead we have attempted primarily to formulate
a policy-making process, one which includes all of the important
variables and which separates various crucial issues. We have
applied this process in order to provide a plan of action to be
implemented immediately. But we would be remiss if we were only
to propose recommendations for the present. The Commission feels
that a coherent social policy requires a fundamental alteration
of social attitudes toward drug use, and a willingness to embark
on new courses when previous actions have failed.<br>

<h1>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse </h1>

<h2>Drug Use In America: Problem in Perspective </h2>

<p> <b>Commissioned by President Richard M. Nixon, March, 1972</b>
</p>

<h2>Chapter Three - The Social Impact of Drug Dependence and
Drug-Induced Behavior</h2>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Western man pays frequent homage to the freedom of his will.
Although Western philosophy has always included strains of
predestination in one form or another, the belief that man
controls his fate runs deep, and even those who question this
from. the scientific standpoint are often quick to add that the
state should continue to act upon it. Whenever an individual
chooses to act irresponsibly, as defined by his society, he is
held accountable to other men, to his state, or according to
prevailing belief, to his Creator. </p>

<p> But man does not will everything that happens to him, and the
precepts of free will and accountability have been tempered in
relation to many conditions of existence, Foremost of these, of
course, is the notion of sickness. Although the individual may
place himself in a position which increases the risk of disease,
he does not usually will to be sick; -accordingly, he is
generally not held accountable either for his sickness or for its
behavioral concomitants. Poverty is another area which has
recently been separated from notions of free will and moral
worth. There are some who shun worldly possessions in order to
enhance their spirituality, but most men do not will to be poor.
Since the late 19th Century Western society has acted
increasingly on the proposition that environmental factors may
predispose poverty and socioeconomic immobility. The emergence of
the welfare state rests on the belief that man should not be held
accountable for, or suffer for that which he cannot prevent. </p>

<p> Disease and poverty are two broad qualifications of a
normative order premised on considerations of free will. In
addition, our normative system and our law are replete with other
exceptions which recognize that an individual may well be
overborne by others or by conditions for which he is not
responsible. Love, hypnosis, duress, &quot;acts of God,&quot;
irresistible impulses, uncontrollable rages all may excuse the
individual for conduct which might otherwise be considered
foolish, unwise, intemperate or even criminal. Of course, there
are also conditions which may predispose behavior although we do
not excuse them, such as foolishness, immoderation and vanity. </p>

<p> Drugs introduce a new dimension into this uneasy marriage of
free will and human and social imperfection. The very phrase
&quot;being under the influence&quot; of a drug manifests the
fundamental proposition that drugs can alter or control human
behavior. </p>

<p> The drug may induce a socially desirable form of control in
the sense that the influence of a drug may restore control which
has otherwise been lost. For example, sedative drugs may be
administered to a person whose anguish over the death of a loved
one is out of control, not to obliterate grief but to modify the
person's responses. Drugs may also be used to minimize the
effects of &quot;unwilled&quot; behaviors stemming from mental
illness or aberration. Some examples of the socially sanctioned
uses of drugs for behavior control in the context of therapy are:
the administration of drugs to mental patients to dampen the
intensity of acute behavioral disruption and to enhance their
capacity for organized responses, the drug-based efforts to
increase concentration and reduce aimlessness of hyperkenetic
children, and the maintenance of heroin-dependent persons on
methadone to stabilize their otherwise anti-social behavior.
Drugs have also been used for punishment; that is to alter the
behavior of persons in detention, although this development, has
met with substantial resistance. </p>

<p> The common thread of these examples is that drugs may be
employed to restore the capacity for responsible, willed
behavior. However, public attitude and social policy toward drug
use are focused primarily on the fact that drugs may also
diminish the capacity of a person to control his conduct in the
manner society expects of him. This perception has dominated
political rhetoric, literary description, legal doctrine and
public understanding about drugs for centuries. With some
exceptions, the American normative system stipulates that such
loss of control is socially undesirable and in itself constitutes
irresponsible behavior. On the other hand, American law has long
been ambivalent about whether a person should be held entirely or
partially accountable for such behavior or its consequences,
reflecting the basic tension between freedom of will and human
limitations. </p>

<p> Whatever the precise relationship between drug use and self
-control, the very possibility of drug-influenced behavior is
what distinguishes drug use from other forms of behavior,
motivating all societies to regulate it. In American society,
however, the extent to which drug use, by itself, can deprive the
individual of control over his behavior has been highly
exaggerated. </p>

<p> Drugs are fixed in the collective consciousness as substances
which can rob man of his sentiency, morals and values. Each drug,
whether it be LSD, heroin or marihuana, is widely believed to
have the capacity to destroy the will. For decades, the public
has held the view that the initial use of psychoactive
substances, often tied to the exotic Eastern world, is the
opening of Pandora's box: one taste of the forbidden fruit and
control will shortly be lost. The assumed paths from marihuana to
heroin, from. LSD to insanity, from heroin to crime, and, in
bygone days, from tobacco to alcohol, and from alcohol to skid
row, reflect concern not only about social cost but also about
the inevitable erosion of will. </p>

<p> This presumed relationship between drugs and will is also
reflected in the tendencies to ascribe a causal relationship to
drugs and almost every type of unwanted behavior, and to
attribute to drugs the undes1rable behavior of disapproved social
groups. Whenever specific drugs are temporally related to sexual
excess, crime, traffic accidents or use of other drugs, the
person and his will tend to be forgotten, and the drug itself
becomes the villain. </p>

<p> Perhaps the unique expression of drug-induced loss of
self-control is the inability of the individual to stop using the
drug. The dread of becoming ensnared in the &quot;clutches of
addiction&quot; has long dominated public antipathy toward the
evils of drug use, reflecting a deep-seated belief that mental,
physical and moral debilitation is the likely consequence of
habitual drug use. Whatever its ancillary impact or subsequent
history, the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914 embodied above all
else a firm public policy judgment opposing the use of
&quot;addicting&quot; or &quot;habit-forming drugs.&quot;
Further, the progression thesis, which has been propounded since
drug policy began, although the drugs have changed, and the more
recent distinction between bard and soft drugs, suggests how
strongly concern about dependence dominates the entire drug
issue. </p>

<p> The notion of addiction is of relatively recent origin,
emerging as a recognizable medical entity during the 18th
Century. Before that time, the focus of social control in this
country as in other societies, was on the disordering
consequences of the drug experience. Aggressive behavior, loss of
psychomotor control or other disordered behavior induced by the
drug experience must also be taken into account in the
formulation of drug policy. </p>

<p> TABLE 111-1. (Cont.) </p>

<p> <img src="pip30001.gif"> </p>

<p> FOOTNOTES to TABLE 111-1. </p>

<p> I In choosing substances to be included in this table, the
Commission did not attempt to be comprehensive. Selections were
made in order to illustrate the full range of dependence
liability and capacity for influencing or inducing behavioral
change. </p>

<p> 2 Capacity of drug to induce continued use on the basis of
psychological reward. Relative judgments are based on use of
maximum tolerated dose, as measured by laboratory studies and
confirmed by refined clinical experience. </p>

<p> 3 The actual prevalence of chronic use among the using
population. The relative prevalence of chronic use of specific
substances is determined by a wide range of sociocultural
variables, including such factors as social custom, availability
of the substance, susceptibility of particular populations to
patterns of chronic use and availability of more potent
substances. </p>

<p> 4 Potential for disruption or impairment of social
functioning after a single dose. Relative judgments are based on
consumption of doses sufficient to produce marked pharmacological
effects. </p>

<p> 5 Drug-induced behavioral response, as measured by potential
impairment of social functioning, accompanying chronic
administration of dependence-producing doses. </p>

<p> 6 Short-term behavioral responses, measured by disruption or
impairment of social functioning, accompanying interruption of
drug taking after chronic administration of dependence producing
doses. </p>

<p> 7 The relative judgments regarding methadone are based on
parenteral administration and oral administration in naive
subjects. The Commission expressly notes that oral administration
to opiate-dependent persons in a maintenance setting has a
significantly different impact on behavior. </p>

<p> 8 Includes related drugs such as psilocybin, DMT. </p>

<p> 9 Inapplicable. Because of extremely low reinforcement
potential, chronic use patterns do not generally occur, and no
abstinence syndrome has been described. </p>

<p> 10 Includes drugs which are structurally related and roughly
similar in effect to mescaline, such as DOM (&quot;STP&quot;). </p>

<hr>

<p> While drugs have a capacity to affect behavior, they do not
do so uniformly. Table 111-1 provides an overview of the relative
capacity of selected drugs to induce dependence and influence
behavior. However, drugs do not affect behavior independently.
Non-drug factors play an equally crucial role in determining the
behavorial concomitants of drug use. The personal characteristics
of the user, his expectations about the drug experience and about
society's attitudes and possible responses, the setting in which
the drug is used, as well as broader sociocultural factors, are
all major determinants of drug effect and of the individual's
capacity to control the effects of the drug through the exercise
of his will. </p>

<p> We will now examine the social consequences of drug-using
behavior. First, we will establish a framework by analyzing drug
dependence and drug-induced behavior from a psychopharmacological
standpoint, providing detailed explanations for the concepts
presented in Table 111-1. Then we will consider the actual and
potential impact on the public safety and the public health and
welfare of the patterns of drug-using behavior discussed in the
previous Chapter. Finally, we will sketch the implications of
this analysis for social policy. These guidelines will serve as a
backdrop for the application of the policy-making process in
Chapter Four. </p>

<h2>I -- DRUG DEPENDENCE</h2>

<p> Since the psychoactive properties of naturally-occurring
substances were first discovered and sought, the excessive,
chronic or compulsive use of these substances has been an
identifiable and predictable human condition. Until the 19th
Century, however, this phenomenon was viewed primarily in moral,
rather than medical or scientific terms. One 18th Century
observer likened the use of opium in Eastern countries to the use
of &quot;wine and spiritous liquors in civilized Europe (where it
is) the support of the coward, the solace of the wretched and the
daily source of intoxication of the debauchee&quot; (Crumpe
1793). </p>

<p> This is not to say that the physical consequences of chronic
drug use went unnoticed. As early as 1701, a London physician, in
The Mysteries of Opium Revealed, addressed &quot;The Effects of
Sudden Leaving Off the Use of Opium After a Long and Lavish Use
Thereof,&quot; where he described a withdrawal syndrome (Jones
1701). However, neither Dr. Jones nor his contemporaries regarded
this condition as fundamentally different from that associated
with excessive wine drinking or the excessive eating or chewing
of other substances such as tobacco. The, physical concomitants
of the &quot;opium habit&quot;, like those for tobacco and wine,
were associated by some with a defect of individual will and by
others with some unknown property of the drugs. </p>

<p> Isolation of morphine from opium and the subsequent
development of the hypodermic syringe clarified the distinction
between the opium habit and the alcohol and tobacco habits. Two
previously held theories were now discarded: first, that the
opium habit was dependent on oral ingestion of the drug, and
second, that the withdrawal effects arose. from resinous
substances in the opium. Vivid literary descriptions, the,
introduction of opium-smoking by Chinese immigrants, and the
widespread use of opium and morphine during and after the Civil
War soon stimulated the attention of medical professionals. The
&quot;army disease&quot; or morphinisin was now recognized as a
distinctive medical and social problem. </p>

<p> During the last three decades of the 19th Century, medical
professionals strove to understand, describe and treat this
sickness. Meanwhile, the public was becoming acquainted with the
habit-forming properties of the opiates, as the population of
opiate-dependent persons increased. State laws at once, began to
reflect them popular fear of drug habits, as did the labelling
requirement of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.
Simultaneously, the social aspects of chronic opiate use aroused
the popular imagination. The stereotype of the &quot;dope
fiend&quot; emerged, and with it a highly restrictive public
policy, one rooted in considerations apart from the pharmacologic
effects of the prohibited drugs. </p>

<p> <b><font size="4">TEMINOLOGICAL CONFUSION</font></b> </p>

<p> In the United States, the public, the medical professions and
policy makers all discovered the individual mid social
consequences of chronic opium use at roughly the same time. A
connection between popular vocabulary and scientific terminology
was established as the scientific community tended to appropriate
lay terms, laden with emotional and imprecise meanings, and to
imbue them with scientific meanings. The first of these
descriptive terms to emerge was &quot;addictions&quot; </p>

<p> <b><font size="4">Addiction</font></b> </p>

<p> The word addiction evolved from the Latin addicere which, in
Roman law, meant the giving or binding over of a person to one
thing or another, such as a judge assigning a debtor to his
creditor. By the late 16th Century, &quot;to addict&quot; had
apparently assumed a broader meaning: to devote, give up or apply
habitually to a practice. One writer suggests that the word was
generally identified with bad habits or vices (Sonnedecker 1959).
With the emergence of public and scientific interest in the opium
problem, &quot;addiction&quot;' and &quot;mania&quot; were
commonly used in the press to describe this ascendent vice. </p>

<p> Within the American scientific community, the terms most
commonly employed during the 19th and early 20th Centuries to
describe the condition were &quot;opium (or morphine) habit&quot;
and &quot;morphinism.&quot;' In 1903, for example, the, American
Pharmaceutical Association established a &quot;Committee of the
Acquirement of Drug Habits.&quot; By 1920, however, the
scientific community had given the term addiction its blessing, a
development paralleling the popularization of the word
&quot;narcotics&quot; and the entry of government into the field.
&quot;Narcotic addiction&quot; became a household phrase. </p>

<p> As we suggested in Chapter One, &quot;narcotic&quot; soon
lost its pharmacologic meaning and came to encompass any drug
associated with the populations using the opiates or cocaine;
similarly &quot;addiction&quot; came to be tied in the public
mind to the habitual use of any drug. In the press and councils
of government, marihuana users and cocaine users were frequently
characterized as addicts. Interestingly, the dangers of alcohol
&quot;addiction&quot; were widely proclaimed during the intense
Public discussion surrounding the adoption of the 18th Amendment
although this terminology was strongly resisted by opponents of
Prohibition. </p>

<p> Many scientists remained uncomfortable with the imprecise use
of the term addiction, and particularly with its strong moral
over-tones. Yet, because the condition was so little understood,
there was little agreement on a substitute. Throughout the 1920's
there remained &quot;considerable confusion ... as to the
significance of various terms employed in consideration of drug
addiction in the broad sense of the word&quot; (Seevers 1962).
Terry and Pellens, in the introduction to their classic 1928 work
addressed this problem: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>One further matter requires consideration, namely, the
    terminology employed. As elsewhere, here also controversial
    subjects are involved, for different writers have used terms
    and definitions which in themselves have indicated particular
    attitudes toward the nature of the, problem. Thus habit,
    craving, appetite, mania, addiction, addiction disease, all
    may be interpreted significantly if desired by those using or
    reading them. We have tried to select some name for the
    condition of chronic opium-using that would not carry a
    partisan, restricted or incomplete implication as far as the
    nature of the condition is concerned. The phrase Chronic
    opium intoxication seems to fulfill this purpose better than
    any other but it has the disadvantage of length and is at
    times an awkward expression. We decided, therefore, not to
    restrict ourselves to any one term, but to employ whichever
    of those in common use today seemed best suited to the
    individual need (Terry and Pellens, 1928). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Most scientific observers recognize that habitual users of
many drugs did not experience the same degree of physical
discomfort upon abstinence as did chronic opiate, users.
Consequently, the main goal was to establish a conceptual
framework and a vocabulary which would distinguish the habitual
use of other drugs from the, chronic rise of opiates. By the late
1920's, a general consensus had emerged that habit-forming drugs
could be separated into those which produced
&quot;habituation,&quot; and those which produced
&quot;addiction.&quot; </p>

<p> <b><font size="4">Habituation</font></b> </p>

<p> In broad terms, habituation usually characterized recurrent
use of those drugs which were not associated with the development
of tolerance and an abstinence syndrome; for this reason, the
condition was closely linked with weakness of individual will
rather than specific drug effects. Addiction, by contrast, was
associated with physical dependence and -with serious individual
and social consequences. This dichotomy, because of its public
policy implications, was not completely satisfactory from either
the scientific or legislative viewpoints. For example, the
tendency to classify cannabis as an habituating substance was
generally resisted by those who sought to prohibit its use,
mainly because public policy was so closely identified with the
prohibition of drugs of addiction. Well into the past decade,
there was still a strong tendency to classify marihuana as an
addictive drug. </p>

<p> Many pharmacologists were uncomfortable with the
addiction-habituation dichotomy because many drugs would not fit
easily in these categories. They recognized that cocaine, for
example, did not produce the classic withdrawal symptoms or
tolerance which were so closely intertwined with the notion of
addiction; yet, it was clear to them that &quot;cocainism&quot;
carried significant consequences for both the individual and
society. In addition, the succeeding years witnessed the
development for medical application of whole new families of
psychoactive drugs. Often these new drugs could not easily be
pigeon-holed within the simple dichotomy. Many pharmacologists
were concerned that classifying such new drugs as
&quot;addicting&quot; would stigmatize them by associating them
with the opiates and with the perception of serious social
hazards. From this concern emerged a policy-based distinction
between the labelling and warning concepts tied to the Pure Food
and Drug Act and its successor statutes, and the addiction
concept associated with the Harrison Act. </p>

<p> <b><font size="4">The Search for Precision</font></b> </p>

<p> For more than three decades, experts attempted to preserve
the habituation/addition dichotomy, continually redefining and
enlarging its scope in the hope that it would serve the needs not
only of science and medicine but also of law and sociology. </p>

<p> In 1931, two experts, attempting to introduce some coherence
into the subject, defined habitation as &quot;a condition in
which the habitue desires a drug but suffers no in effects on its
discontinuance.&quot; Addiction was defined as &quot;a condition
developed through the effects of repeated actions of a drug such
that its use becomes necessary and cessation of its action causes
mental or physical disturbances.&quot; Addiction was further
subdivided into &quot;true addiction&quot; which involved the
&quot;physical disturbances&quot; associated with the withdrawal
syndrome, and &quot;psychic addiction, which was associated with
the &quot;feeling of exhilaration and euphoria [constituting] an
almost irresistible goad to its continued use&quot; (Tatum and
Seevers 1931). </p>

<p> Six years later another expert redefined the basic terms as
follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>By habituation is meant the physical phenomenon of
    adaptation and mental conditioning to the repetition of an
    effect. Habituation to opiates is probably more intense than
    habituation to other substances. In a, sense habituation
    represents Psychical dependence. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Addiction to opiates embraces three intimately related but
    distinct phenomena, namely tolerance, habituation, and
    dependence. These phenomena which make up the psychosomatic
    complex known as addiction are intricately interwoven and
    interdependent (Hirnmelsbach,1937). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Over the years, successive definitions and redefinitions
became more and more elaborate. In 1957, the Expert Committee on
AddictionProducing Drugs of the World Health Organization (World
Health Organization, 1957) attempted to specify the ways in which
addiction differed from habituation: </p>

<p> <b>Drug addiction</b> </p>

<p> Drug addition is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication
produced by the repeated consumption of a drug (natural or
synthetic). Its characteristics include: </p>

<ol>
    <li>an overpowering desire or need (compulsion) to continue
        taking the drug and to obtain it by any means; </li>
    <li>a tendency to increase the dose; </li>
    <li>a psychic (psychological) and generally a physical
        dependence on the effects of the drug; </li>
    <li>detrimental effect on the individual and on society. </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p> <b>Drug habituation</b> </p>

<p> Drug habituation (habit) is a condition resulting from the
repeated consumption of a drug. Its characteristics include: </p>

<ol>
    <li>a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue takin- the
        drug for the sense of improved well-being which it
        engenders; </li>
    <li>little or no tendency to increase the dose; </li>
    <li>some degree of psychic dependence on the effect of the
        drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an
        abstinence syndrome; </li>
    <li>detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual.
    </li>
</ol>

<p> Despite the loophole provided in subsection (3) to permit the
classification of cocaine as a drug of addiction, the WHO
definitions continued to tie that term primarily to physical
dependence, thereby perpetuating the impression that the social
detriments of chronic drug use arise primarily from physical
dependence or addiction. </p>

<p> Despite a concerted effort within the expert community during
the 1950's to rationalize the in-suited terms addiction and
habituation, the confusion remained. As the World Health
Organization noted in 1965: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Both terms are frequently used interchangeably and often
    inappropriately. It is not uncommon to apply the term
    addiction to any misuse of drugs outside of medical practice,
    with a connotation of serious harm to the individual and to
    society, and often with a demand that something be done about
    it. Such broad use can only create confusion and
    misunderstanding when abuse of drugs is discussed from
    different viewpoints. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The difficulties in terminology become increasingly
    apparent with the continuous appearance of new agents with
    various and perhaps unique pharmacological profiles, and with
    changing patterns of use of drugs already well known. These
    developments must be considered in their relation to, but may
    not be adequately characterized by, current definitions of
    addiction. There is scarcely any agent which can be taken
    into the body to which some individuals will not get a
    reaction satisfactory or pleasurable to them, persuading,
    them to continue its use even to the point of abuse-that is,
    to excessive or persistent use beyond medical need. Probably
    the only exceptions are agents that have incidental or side
    effects that prevent such use-for example, cumulative or
    early toxic effects, to which the individual does not become
    tolerant (Eddy, et al., 1965). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Two basic problems inhere in the concepts of addiction and
habituation. First, the nature of chronic drug-taking behavior,
involving a range of individual-drug interactions, is entirely
too complex to be compartmentalized into two mutually exclusive
categories. Determining the point where the lesser (habituation)
becomes the greater (addiction) is bound to be arbitrary, since,
as is true in all biological responses, there is a wide range of
variation in the same individual and between individuals. </p>

<p> Second, the terms, from their inception, were designed not
only to describe a form of drug-using behavior but also to
comprehend the relationship between that behavior and the
society. The need to accommodate definitions to social
consequence is reflected precisely in subsection (4) of the 1957
WHO definitions quoted above. That the chronicity of drug-taking
behavior and social harm were not directly correlated became
particularly obvious in the early 1960's when an anti-smoking
crusade was launched. In this connection, the word addiction was
commonly used to describe the tobacco habit despite the absence
of significant drug-induced behavior arising from its use. </p>

<p> <b>Drug Dependence</b> </p>

<p> In the early 1960's, the search for more suitable concepts
and terminology was intensified. In rapid-fire succession, most
experts in the field and most professional organizations
discarded the terms addiction and habituation and substituted
instead the concepts of physical and psychological (or psychic)
dependence. After endorsement by two WHO expert groups and the
relevant committee of the National Academy of Sciences-National
Research Counsel, the WHO officially adopted this position in
1965, defining drug dependence as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Drug dependence is a state of psychic or physical
    dependence, or both, on a drug, arising in a person following
    administration of that drug on a periodic or continuous
    basis. The characteristics of such a state will vary with the
    agent involved, and these characteristics must always be made
    clear by designating the particular type of drug dependence
    in each specific case; for example, drug dependence of
    morphine type, of barbiturate type, of amphetamine type, etc.
    (Eddy, et al., 1965). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> In order to save the new notion of dependence from the fate
of its predecessors, WHO added the following important caveat: </p>

<p> The specification of the type of dependence is essential and
should form an integral part of the new terminology, since it is
neither possible nor even desirable to delineate or define the
term drug dependence independently of the agent involved. It
should also be remembered that it was the desire to achieve the
impossible and define a complex situation by a single term
(&quot;addiction&quot; or &quot;habituation,&quot; respectively)
which has given rise to confusion in many cases. Therefore, the
description of drug dependence as a state is a concept for
clarification and not, in any sense, a specific definition. </p>

<p> However, the requirements of law and interdisciplinary
communication have doomed this attempt to keep dependence as a
wide umbrella sheltering a series of more technical dependence
types. All attempts to provide a more comprehensive definition
have been faced with the fundamental truth that dependence is a
matter of degree. </p>

<p> For example, federal legislation and that of many states now
define a drug-dependent person as: </p>

<p> A person who is using a controlled substance and who is in a
state of psychic or physical dependence, or both, arising from
the use of that substance on a continuous basis. Drug dependence
is characterized by behavioral and other responses which include
a strong compulsion to take the substance on a continuing basis
in order to experience its psychic effects or to avoid the
discomfort caused by its absence. </p>

<p> *Many drugs with dependence liability, notably alcohol, are
not legally classified as &quot;controlled substances.&quot; </p>

<p> The problem of degree is submerged in this definition within
the terms &quot;continuous&quot; and &quot;strong
compulsion.&quot; From a legal standpoint, the umbrella
definition and vague terms which cannot be applied to individual
cases are inadequate, particularly when a finding that a person
is drug dependent may result in coercive legal intervention. </p>

<p> The Commission applauds the much-belated attempt by the
scientific community to sever its conceptual apparatus from the
vocabulary of politics and emotion. &quot;Addiction,&quot; like
&quot;narcotics&quot; and &quot;drug abuse,&quot; has a general
connotation of evil, suggesting illicit ecstasy, guilt and sin.
Because the public image is conditioned more by cultural
perceptions than by medical ones, medically-precise meanings
simply cannot be harmonized with common parlance. </p>

<p> We believe that the concept of drug dependence offers a
useful, objective way of describing a highly complex range of
drug-using behavior. At the same time, the Commission recognizes
that the contrasting requirements of law and science may doom
&quot;dependence&quot; to the fate of its predecessors. The only
way to avoid this result is for the scientific community to
engage in a concerted attempt to formulate a narrower umbrella
definition which will meet the specificity requirements of law.
For example, the broad concept of drug dependence must, for legal
purposes, be oriented toward the degree and types of dependence
which impair the social functioning of the drug-dependent person
and pose predictable adverse consequences for the society. </p>

<p> In addition to this qualification regarding the requirements
of law, the Commission also emphasizes the responsibility of the
expert community to communicate an understanding of drug
dependence to the public, and to modify the exaggerated
perceptions which have so long been tied to the concept of
addiction. </p>

<p> <b>Excising &quot;Addiction&quot;</b> </p>

<p> The imprint of history on public attitudes is deep. Addiction
still provides the lightning rod for public concern about drugs,
and is generally identified with &quot;physically addicting&quot;
drugs, the prototype being heroin. The &quot;narcotics,&quot;
morphine and cocaine, were the models for comparative social
danger 50 years ago, and heroin is the model today.
&quot;Narcotic&quot; use was identified with depravity,
immorality, uncontrolled drug use (addiction) and crime 50 years
ago, and the same is true today. </p>

<p> Because addiction has been painted as the paramount social
and individual danger in drug use, these images and fears extend
to some extent to the use of all drugs. Scientific emphasis on
the physical attributes of addiction has confirmed and supported
the lay fears. </p>

<p> As a general guide for public policy and personal conduct,
the fear of addiction is a constant. When asked in the context of
the National Survey which drugs are addictive in the sense that
&quot;anybody who uses it regularly becomes physically [and/or]
psychologically dependent on it and can't get along without
it,&quot; the public responded affirmatively in the following
proportions: </p>

<p> <img src="pip30003.gif"> </p>

<p> When asked, in an open-ended question, to elaborate on the
dangers of proprietary and prescription drugs, the most common
response was that they are habit forming. Roughly 50% of the
public characterized this as the chief reason for not using
prescription drugs. For proprietary drugs, 35% mentioned this
concerns a proportion exceeded only by the 40% which feared
overdoses. Finally, slightly more than half of those with
opinions on the subject have worried that if they took pills they
might become dependent on them (48% have worried and 44% have not
worried). </p>

<p> These responses bear comparison with the intensity of the
fear of addiction. That is, all these drugs are perceived by a
large majority of people to be addicting; but specific
perceptions about the nature of this phenomenon vary according to
drug, often inaccurately. When asked whether they agreed or
disagreed with the statements that &quot;you can use (heroin or
marihuana) occasionally without ever becoming addicted to
it,&quot; only a small proportion of the public agreed. </p>

<p> <img src="pip30004.gif"> </p>

<p> Alcohol and barbiturates are not viewed as addicting to the
same extent as heroin, and the alcoholic is not viewed with the
same fear as the &quot;narcotics addict.&quot; For example, the
Commission-sponsored National Survey in 1971 found that 66% of
the adult public believe that &quot;most people who use alcohol
lead a normal life;&quot; only 23% thought the same was true of
most marihuana users (Abelson et al., 1972). </p>

<p> These differences in perception stem from social factors
rather than from failure to ascribe addiction potential to all
drugs. Paraphernalia is an important indicator of true addiction
in the public imagination; the needle, the spoon and
irregularly-shaped cigarettes stand as symbols of drug addiction.
Further, the perception of addictiveness and its severity has
been tied to class and ethnic considerations since the creation
of modern drug policy. The net result is that although most drugs
are thought to be addictive, some are thought to be more
controllable and less of a problem than others. These
discriminations are at odds with pharmacological truth. To
redress this situation, we now turn to an overview of the nature
of drug dependence and its social impact. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="4">TOWARD A FUNCTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF DRUG
DEPENDENCE</font></b> </p>

<p> Research has established that repetitive drug use results
from the interaction between a drug, the user and the surrounding
environment. Understanding this behavior requires a conjunction
of psychological, pharmacological and sociological theory. The
concept of drug dependence offers a useful framework for such an
analysis. This is not to say that it is without ambiguity, but
rather that it is functional, and comports with social,
psychological and pharmacological notions, rather than
overemphasizing one aspect of this intricate drug-person
situation relationship. </p>

<p> <b> Psychological Dependence: The Primary Reinforcer</b> </p>

<p> To explore the concept of dependence, we must approach
repetitive, drug use from a broad psychological standpoint. Ul
behavior which is repeated more or less systematically, whether
it be dressing in a certain order, watching special television
programs, playing poker on Thursday, going to work in the,
morning or coining !ionic from work in the evening, has been
reinforced. In a sense, a person can be said to be dependent on
any of the innumerable liabits of life. The iniportant question,
however, is how strongly the bebavior is reinforced and by what
factors. Or, put the other way, what is the degree of dependence?
</p>

<p> Degree of dependence can only be measured by looking beyond
the behavior itself to its role in the individual's existence and
to the nature of the adjustments which would be made if he could
not beliave in the way he has come to depend upon. For example,
the compulsive gambler is preoccupied with this particular
behavior, often to the, exclusion of his social obligations.
Other persons may be, preoccupied with sexual behavior, sometimes
to the point of dominating the person's existence and interfering
with the lives of others. For many Americans, TV viewing on
Sunday afternoon during football season has become a highly
significant part of weekend life. This all suggests that
recurrent behaviors will fall on a continuum from lesser to
greater dependence in terms of their importance. to the
individual. </p>

<p> The same is true for repetitive drug use, with one important
addition. While other habits are only indirectly reinforced
through the central nervous system, psychoactive drug use is
directly reinforced by its effect on the brain.2 This factor also
distinguishes the, notion of vitamin-deficient, diabetic and
cardiac-insufficient patients. Psychoactive drugs also modify the
capacity of the nervous system to react to, and to interpret the
nature of the stimulus. </p>

<p> 2 With pharmacologically inert substances dependence is based
solely on the so-called placebo effect. It is strictly
psychogenic and a reasonable measure of the, existing
psychological state of the user or of the user's relationship
with the giver. Many other substances which have no direct effect
on the central nervous .system may, because of a strong
peripheral action, reinforce psychologically and create
dependence by drug-induced sensory input or by abolishing
unpleasant sensations which arise from the the periphery. (For
example, relief of burning sensation by counterirritants, intense
catharsis, relief of heartburn by antacids and the like.) </p>

<p> Consideration of dependence on non-psychoactive drugs or
placebos is introduced here only to show why it should not be
confused, as it has been, with the principal issues as they
relate to dependence on psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p> Underlying the notion of psychological dependence is the same
concept of positive reinforcement which describes behavioral
responses to many types of rewards such as food, drink, sex, and
acclaim. In this instance, however, the specific reinforcer is a
drug whose effects are sufficiently attractive and rewarding
psychologically at the first trial to motivate the user to repeat
the experience. </p>

<p> <b>The Pharmacological Component: Reinforcement Potential</b>
</p>

<p> An individual who has had no experience with psychoactive
substances will never become drug dependent. Having once
experienced psychoactive effects, many persons will become
dependent to some degree. Some drugs are so weak that little harm
results. But many are such powerful reinforcers that if every
individual in a given society were exposed to all such
psychoactive drugs by intravenous administration and then
permitted free access to them, a major social problem would
ensue. </p>

<p> Lesser animals, such as monkeys or even rats, having once
experienced a drug such as cocaine and after being given
unlimited access, will self-administer the drug until they die.
It should be clearly understood by those who decry the depravity
of the compulsive drug user that susceptibility is only relative,
and under certain conditions, almost any individual can be made
to be drug dependent in the most extreme sense of the term.
However, specific drugs are qualitatively different in this
respect, and it is therefore important to consider the
reinforcement potential of different substances. </p>

<p> Some drugs offer, from a psychopharmacologic standpoint, high
rewards and consequently great reinforcement for their continued
use. With drugs such as alcohol, heroin, amphetamines,
barbiturates and cocaine, there is a significant likelihood that
recurrent administration of large doses will result in a high
degree of involvement. However, this result is not inevitable.
Many factors such as self-concept, peer orientation and religious
feelings may mitigate against the use of large doses and frequent
administration, thereby reducing the likelihood of a high degree
of involvement. </p>

<p> Substances such as amphetamines, when consumed orally, and
the minor tranquilizers&quot; appear to have a moderate
reinforcement potential. Others, such as marihuana and codeine,
appear to have considerably less reinforcement potential.
However, just as it is not inevitable that a high level of
dependence will occur with heroin and alcohol, it is possible for
a person consuming sufficiently high doses to develop a high
degree of dependence upon substances such as marihuana and
codeine. In such cases, the dependence is reinforced primarily by
non-pharmacologic factors related to the individual and his
environment. </p>

<p> Other drugs, such as LSD and mescaline, appear to possess a
self limiting quality due to the temporary development of a
moderate degree of tolerance to the psychic effects and to a
phenomenon of psychological satiation arising from the intensity
and duration of the drug experience. For these reasons, instances
of prolonged, frequent self-administration of these substances
are rare. Finally, some drugs, such as the phenothiazines (the
major tranquilizers) have a minimal reinforcement potential.' </p>

<p> <b>Psycho-Social Components</b> </p>

<p> Reinforcement for continued use may also stem from
non-pharmacologic factors. As noted in Chapter Two, drug-using
behavior may be influenced and reinforced by a wide range of
psychological and sociological variables, and this is no less
true of continued use than of initial use. Various conditioning
theories have been advanced to illustrate how people learn to use
drugs, adapt them to their needs and seek the drug when needed.
Drug dependence is a dynamic process composed of a sequence of
phrases during which the behavior may be reinforced by different
factors at different times. </p>

<p> On one extreme, drug-using behavior may be a function of
status definition in terms of class, group, ethnicity or
geography. Researchers have noted, for example, the antipathy of
many marihuana-smoking youths for glue-sniffing groups (Blumer et
al., 1967). Among other drug-using groups, there may be status
connotations involved in selecting a particular brand of scotch
whiskey or in preferring scotch to bourbon. The cocktail party
epitomizes the manner in which drug using behavior may be
reinforced by non-drug factors. In these examples, the recurrence
of drug use may reflect very little commitment by the user; in
other words, repetitive drug-using behavior may not reflect
drug-seeking behavior .4 </p>

<p> 3 'Reinforcement potential&quot; is an absolute laboratory
concept, within which psychosocial factors are held constant. In
this sense, the major tranquilizers are not reinforcing at all
since the &quot;normal&quot; population would not choose to
repeat the drug experience because of its side effects. However,
we should note that the use of any psychoactive drug can be
reinforcing given the appropriate Psychological and social
reinforcements. Thus, it is meaningful to say that the major
tranquilizers are reinforcing to the patients who agree to use
them because of their positive rewards as the individual and his
physician define them. </p>

<p> 4 These situations might be distinguished from the type of
behavior involving elaborate, ritualistic preparation and
administration of a drug where the meaning of the behavior rather
than the psychological experience (of the drug provide the entire
reward. The selection and preparation of a bottle of wine and the
rolling of a marihuana joint are examples. There is also the
&quot;needle freak,&quot; a person who is enamored of the process
of self-injecting any substance, including water. </p>

<p> By contrast, drug use may be reinforced by less ephemeral
variables, as a person comes to rely upon the drug effect to get
things done or to avoid unpleasantness. For example, an anxious,
unhappily married individual or an obsessional, overworked
executive may gradually drink more in quantity, frequency and
intensity as he or she finds that this behavior blurs awareness
of problems and enhances the ability to avoid their resolution.
By the same token, a lonely young person may turn to
&quot;speed&quot; when it is popular and readily available,
finding with more and more, predictability that he feels potent,
alert and energetic and that he shares a common bond with his
peers who reinforce each others participation in the entire speed
ritual. </p>

<p> At the other extreme, the recurring drug-using activity may
form the very definitional base of a person's life: &quot;When
I'm on the way home with the bag safely in my pocket, and I
haven't been caught stealing all day, and I didn't get beat and
the cops didn't get me I feel like a working man coming home;
he's worked hard, but he knows he's done something. . .&quot;
This person's life style is his repeated acquisition and
consumption of heroin; and each administration of the drug
confirms the success of his life style, representing his wages
and his sole reward. </p>

<p> <b>The Development of Dependence: Conditioning</b> </p>

<p> Many models have been proposed to describe the interactions
which take place during the development of dependence. As yet
research has not delineated or confirmed these models and their
implications. However, at least three identifiable phases of the
process of initiation and reinforcement have received attention.
The initial phase of beginning and continuing drug use is
reinforced primarily by social f actors. Pharmacological and
psychological factors become increasingly important in the
development and maintenance of dependence. Finally, the
permanence of the phase following detoxification and
&quot;withdrawal&quot; from the dependent state can be affected
by social as well as psychological factors. </p>

<p> No one model or theory is uniformly accepted and many
questions remain. However, it is instructive to examine some of
the current thinking about these factors, and about their
interaction in forming and sustaining dependence, without
implying thereby that these examples comprise a theory in
themselves. </p>

<p> On the basis of participant observation of marihuana smokers,
Becker identified a three-step process of social reinforcement
leading to continued use: technical mastery of the process of
administration, identification of the pharmacologic effects and
definition of those effects as desirable. Becker's investigations
revealed that novices generally reported their first exposure to
the drug as unrewarding. After being instructed by their
companions regarding how to aerate the smoke (to take deep
breaths filling the recesses of the lungs and to hold their
breath for maximal absorption of the drug), these novitiates
began to identify vague sensations as the drug experience.
Finally, they were led to translate what in many cases had been
unpleasant responses into desirable ones and therefore into
reasons for continuing to use marihuana. The end product of this
sequence of events was a confirmed marihuana user. Other factors
were delineated by Becker to explain the direction, frequency and
intensity marihuana-using behavior might take (Becker, 1953). </p>

<p> Social reinforcement alone, however, does not explain
subsequent and deep involvement: the weaving of drug use into the
fabric of the user's life. One elaborate scheme assesses the role
of pharmacologic reinforcement in the context of conditioning
theory. Wikler (1970), for example, describes &quot;primary
pharmacologic reinforcement&quot; as being either
&quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect.&quot; Direct reinforcement
is related to receptors in the body which pre-exist the use of
the drug. This corresponds to the concept of reinforcement
resulting from stimulation of a reward center in the brain.
Indirect reinforcement develops with drug administration and in
essence is synonymous with &quot;physical dependence.&quot; </p>

<p> During repeated administrations a learning process occurs,
which Wikler relates to &quot;direct secondary pharmacology
reinforcement&quot; or (&quot;psychic dependence&quot;) (Wikler,
1970). </p>

<p> During the learning process, associations are made between
nonspecific environmental conditions or events and the
reinforcements, including the central nervous system changes
created by the drug. For example, long abstinent persons can be
provoked into a mild withdrawal sickness simply by returning to
the community where their dependence occurred (Jaffee, 1970).
Similarly, it is conceivable that relapse to drug use by
abstinent former users may be influenced by non-drug factors
which stimulate associated drug-taking responses. </p>

<p> This kind of conditioning approach carries important
implications for treatment. For example, a treatment regimen
might usefully associate with the drug certain influences
incompatible with its consumption. The therapist might create,
verbally and otherwise, a dislike of the situation each time the
drug is administered. </p>

<p> In a corollary model some researchers have suggested that
behavioral responses may be learned while a person is under the
influence of a drug and that these responses may be reduced in
strength or be. entirely absent in the non-drug state. Such
&quot;state-dependent learning's has been demonstrated
experimentally in man using amphetamines, alcohol and amobarbitol
(Overton, 1968). </p>

<p> Many of the life style concomitants of dependent individuals
have been learned while those persons were in the drugged state.
It possible that certain relationships and activities necessary
for copingor for effective life management have become
state-dependent. If this is the case, then detoxification and
abstinence, may create anxieties and frustrations, perhaps
unrecognized, because the person is less able to cope than h e
was in the drugged state. Relapsing would then afford the
individual one option for regaining such capacity. Another option
is for the therapist to assist transferrence of these skills from
the drugged to non-drugged state. </p>

<p> <b>The Dependence Continuum</b> </p>

<p> We emphasize that the only common denominator of all types of
drug dependence is psychological reinforcement resulting from
reward associated with the first individual-drug-society
interaction and the subsequent increasing desire for repeated
reinforcement. In the broad sense of dependence, a considerable
segment of the world's population can be said to be dependent on
drugs. This drug-using behavior is not necessarily harmful, and
in most instances carries no social stigma. </p>

<p> All repeated drug taking including that which is medically
sanctioned is conditioned by positive reinforcement provided by
the action of the drug and by the anticipated response of the
user's interpersonal referent, whether it be a physician or a
social group. In this respect medical and non-medical use share
much in common. All drug therapy, regardless of the
pharmacological nature of the drug, or whether the substance is
self-selected or prescribed, has a psychological component. Were
it not so, advertising to the public would lose much of its
force, and physicians would lose a valuable aid in the treatment
of the sick, or those who believe they are sick. </p>

<p> Consequently, psychological dependence must mean something
more than positive reinforcement through drug-based reward if it
is to be a functional concept. At this point, then, it becomes
necessary to narrow the focus. As is true of non-drug habits, the
fact of the recurrence of drug use is unimportant. The crucial
question, for the individual, as well as for society, is the
degree of dependence and its consequences. For drug use as well
as any other behavior, the phase's of dependence actually form a
continuum from lesser to greater, from minimal to compulsive. The
additional elements from the psychological standpoint are the
degree to which the individual is committed to or preoccupied
with drug-seeking behavior as part of his life style, and the
degree of behavioral disruption which would attend the
interruption of his drug taking. From a pharmacological
standpoint, these elements are related to the frequency,
duration, regularity and intensity of the reinforcements. </p>

<p> Determining the existence of psychological dependence on
drugs by segmenting the broader dependence continuum requires an
arbitrary decision. It will be recalled that the same kind of
judgment was made in past years in order to distinguish addiction
from habituation on grounds other than physical dependence. The
strength of reinforcement is critical; yet, this judgment varies
not only with the chemical, physical and pharmacological
characteristics of the drug, and with the dose, method, frequency
and duration of administration, but also with the personal
characteristics of the user and the sociocultural context. </p>

<p> <img src="pip30004.gif"> </p>

<p> <b>Measuring the Degree of Dependence: Psychological
Components</b> </p>

<p> The most important factor to consider in describing the
degree of dependence is the extent to which drug use has become
interwoven in the fabric of the user's life. For some persons,
interaction with or avoidance of the world are facilitated by
drugs. The more frequently the drug satisfies the person's needs,
the greater the likelihood of his commitment to or preoccupation
with such use, with a consequent neglect of lower ordered
priorities and responsibilities, and a decrement in other social
functioning. Personal health, economic relationships and family
obligations may all suffer as the drug-seeking behavior increases
in frequency and intensity and dominates the individual's life. </p>

<p> A parallel consideration in measuring the degree of
dependence is the likelihood of adjustment or disruption which
occurs when the individual's drug-using behavior pattern is
interrupted. When faced with interruption, the individual may
respond with some form of substitute behavior or may experience a
disruption of his customary behavior patterns. Because the desire
to continue the behavior also suggests a desire to avoid being in
a position of abstinence, the notion of adaptation is closely
related to that of preoccupation. Some experience with
interruption may increase the priority assigned to the behavior. </p>

<p> The disruption which can occur when an individual is deprived
of his drug or a substitute varies with the extent of his
dependence. Mild behavioral symptoms may be seen in a housewife
deprived of her diet pills, such as lethargy, irritability,
reduced amount of housekeeping, or an unusual afternoon nap,
while, more intense drug-seeking behavior, including aggression,
may be seen among compulsive speed users. To a large extent,
these symptoms can be exacerbated by the pharmacologic effects of
the drug; in other cases they may be products of anxiety or the
unmasking of behavior formerly under pharmacologic control. </p>

<p> Many treatment programs for drug-dependent persons operate on
the premise that therapy must provide alternative supports for
the individual previously preoccupied with drug taking. In large
measure, the potential for success is related to the intensity
with which the individual participates in the design of the
program, and on the strength and numbers of supports within the
alternative system. As </p>

<p> an awareness of these interrelationships has increased, some
programs have made the system and the treatment synonymous.
Alcoholics Anonymous was one of the first such systems. During
the last decade many therapeutic communities, relying on the
pioneering experiences of Synanon, have emerged to deal with
heroin, amphetamine and alcohol dependence. For many of these
programs, particularly those dealing with severely dependent
persons, a prerequisite to participation is a drug-free status.
This is partially in recognition of the disruption attending
interruption of drug-using patterns. </p>

<p> It might be useful at this point to relate this discussion of
psychological dependence to the patterns of drug-using behavior
developed in the previous Chapter. By definition, experimental
use is not a recurrent drug-use pattern. Recreational and
circumstantial use, if systematically repeated over a short or
long period of time, would reflect the positive reinforcement
underlying the notion of psychological dependence; but these,
forms of drug-using behavior, as we have defined them, are not
sufficiently interwoven in the fabric of the users' lives to
impair social functioning. </p>

<p> The functionally important area of the dependence continuum
includes intensified and compulsive use. Intensified use may be
of the regular long-term variety which involves continuous
intoxication followed by periodic drug-free intervals of several
days' duration-the intravenous amphetamine user, for example; or
it may be of the regular daily use variety with long drug-free
intervals during the day-the heavy social drinker, for example;
or it may be of the intense episodic or spree variety-the
patterned binge drinker, for example. The classic type of drug
dependent person, of course, is the compulsive user who rarely
has any drug-free intervals. The chronic alcoholic and heroin
dependent person are the most recognizable examples. </p>

<p> <b> Physical Dependence: The Secondary Reinforcer</b> </p>

<p> All drugs which induce rewarding subjective responses have
the capacity to become psychological reinforcers. Whereas this is
the primary force leading to intensified or compulsive use
patterns, certain drugs, when administered in sufficient dose and
frequency, are capable of producing physiological changes
requiring repetitive use in the, sense, that physical illness
will ensue if the drug-taking behavior is not continued. This
highly specific abstinence syndrome, which is what is generally
meant by &quot;physical dependence,&quot; can be reversed by
readministration of the drug which causes it. Substitution of
another drug or drugs from the same pharmacologic class can also
accomplish reversal. Of course the symptoms themselves can be
ameliorated by administration of substances from other
pharmacological classes although these substances will not
reverse the patho-physiological process of withdrawal. </p>

<p> Fear of drug-deprivation, with its attendant physical and
psychological agonies, serves as a powerful secondary reinforcer
for repeated and, in these cases, continuous drug use. In the
absence of the drug or a substitute, behavioral disruption will
occur. The intensity, length and nature of the disruption varies
according to the drug, the method of administration, the dose and
the length of time the drug has been used. The rapidity with
which the physiologic need develops varies similarly. </p>

<p> Abrupt deprivation of use of certain stimulants, such as
cocaine and amphetamines, following prolonged and continuous use,
may precipitate a rebound withdrawal illness characterized by
psychological letdown and depression, and by extreme exhaustion
generally compounded by previous lack of sleep. The array of
non-specific symptoms and signs results from continuous
agitation, absolute insomnia and acidosis from food and water
deprivation. In contrast to the highly specific morphine and
barbiturate syndromes, this &quot;withdrawal&quot; illness can
not be prevented by continued readministration of the drug. </p>

<p> Lastly, there exist a number of drugs, such as marihuana,
betel and nicotine, with mixed depressant and stimulant
properties, which create strong anxiety when use of the drug is
discontinued. Since no evidence has been adduced which implicates
a physical dependence, the basis for this anxiety is presumably a
function of psychological, social and cultural variables. </p>

<p> <b><font size="4">Summary</font></b> </p>

<p> Drug dependence, in its broad sense, involves much of the
world's population. Conceptually, drug dependence should be
viewed as a continuum starting from a low degree of dependence as
measured by minimal individual preoccupation with drug-using
behavior and minimal disruptive effects upon interruption of the
behavior, and escalating to compulsive dependence as measured by
total preoccupation with drug-using behavior and serious
behavioral disruption attending deprivation of the drug. Drug
dependence exists in innumerable patterns and in all degrees of
intensity depending upon the nature of the drug, the route of
administration, the dose and frequency of administration, other
pharmacological variables, the personality of the user and the
nature of the environment. </p>

<p> In this connection, it is important to discard the
undimensional concept of individual loss of self-control which
has long dominated scientific and lay concepts of
&quot;addiction.&quot; Most people who use psychoactive drugs do
not succumb entirely to the pharmacologic. properties of the
drugs. All of the factors which we have noted interrelate in
distinctly different fashions with different individuals under
different circumstances. For this reason, there can be no static
model of drug dependence within which finite values are assigned
to these various factors. Drug dependence is a dynamic
phenomenon, and the formulation of social policy must reflect its
complexity and relativity. </p>

<p> Further, the primary basis of dependence for all drug use is
psychological reinforcement based on reward. This reward is
composed of two elements: it stems from whatever brain effects
occur, some of which the user may experience subjectively, and
from complicated sequences of psycho-social variables shaping the
needs satisfied by the drug experience, and drug-seeking
behavior. When physical dependence is a part of chronic drug
administration, the threat of the aversive effects of withdrawal
serves as a powerful secondary reinforcer of the drug-using
behavior. </p>

<p> Drug dependence is not necessarily harmful either to the
individual or to society. The social cost of drug dependence is
related directly to the intensity of user-preoccupation. The
compulsive extreme of drug dependence may lead to disorders or
defects of behavior with serious implications for the public
safety, health and welfare. However, many forms of drug
dependence do not carry adverse social consequences, as is
illustrated by the widespread chronic use of substances, such as
tobacco and coffee, with such weak psychoactive properties that
they are measurable largely in subjective rather than objective
terms. Heavy and prolonged chronic use of the substances may
damage organ systems and result in injury to individual health.
But they do not induce physical dependence or result in
anti-social behavior even upon prolonged or excessive use. This
factor distinguishes them from all other dependence-producing
drugs. </p>

<p> WHO's appreciation of the need to separate social impact
considerations from the simple description of drug dependence was
stated clearly in its 1965 statement: </p>

<p> Further to clarify our meaning, the nature and significance
of drug abuse may be considered from two points of view: one
relates to the interaction between the drug and the individual,
the other to the interaction between drug abuse and society. The
first viewpoint is concerned with drug dependence and the,
interplay between the pharmacodynamic actions of the drug and the
psychological status of the individual. The second-the
interaction between drug abuse and society-is concerned with the
interplay of a wide range of conditions, environmental,
sociological, and economic. The 1957 Committee tried to encompass
both points of view when, in its definition of addiction, it
listed characteristics of which some were pharmacodynamic and
other psychological and socioeconomic, perhaps thereby
compounding some of the existing confusion (Eddy et al., 1965). </p>

<p> 'The 1957 WHO Committee statement quoted earlier in this
chapter on page 124.<br>
</p>

<p> <b><font size="4">EVALUATING THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF DRUG
DEPENDENCE</font></b> </p>

<p> Any analysis of the social consequences of dependence, as
they relate to public safety, health and welfare depends on both
the degree of dependence and the characteristics of the drug,
rather than on the fact of dependence itself. </p>

<p> <b>Dependence, Health and Behavior</b> </p>

<p> No rational social policy would aim to eliminate drug
dependence per se. There are societies in which virtually an
entire population is dependent on natural products of plant
origin. Many of these plants, like the betel morsel, are used by
millions of people and produce no striking effects on the central
nervous system. The only subjective sensations are those of
mildly pleasant stimulation. Psychological dependence is well
established; many of the users spend much of their income to
acquire the substance, and even the more intelligent users suffer
a considerable mental letdown in its absence. </p>

<p> When the risk associated with a type of drug dependence does
not involve drug-influenced behavior, but is rather limited to
possible danger to individual health, it is the Commission's view
that private normative choices should prevail, and that the
social policy decision is of an entirely different order than
that required by behavior influencing drugs. As already noted in
Chapter One, the primary policy consideration here is the
behavioral impact on the public safety, health and welfare. </p>

<p> With regard to stronger psychoactive drugs, however, repeated
use may lead to intensified and compulsive patterns of use with
the resultant neglect of other activities, to the point of
decrement in or destruction of other social functioning. Whatever
the appropriate legal policy toward availability of any given
substance, and whatever the relative impact on behavior of
chronic use of these substances, a crucial element of social
policy must be to minimize the proportion of the population
reaching high degrees of dependence on all such substances. </p>

<p> <b>The Vulnerability Factor </b> </p>

<p> The prevalence of high degrees of dependence seems to rest
more in the nature of the soil than in the characteristics of the
seed. The individual user, rather than the drug, is the core of
the problem; compulsive drug use is generally thought to occur
most frequently in emotionally unstable persons who have
difficulty in coping with reality. </p>

<p> Drug dependence is in this sense an attempt at adaptation;
the drug-dependent person seeks to alter his personal situation
not by changing his environmental circumstances or his pattern of
behavioral reaction but by modifying his affective reaction to
and perception of those circumstances. Secondarily to this, his
entire pattern of interacting with his environment may change. </p>

<p> The concept of psycho-social vulnerability rests on the
notion that as environmental stresses and frustrations become
stronger, an increasing proportion of the otherwise susceptible
population will respond through self-changing responses such as
compulsive drug use. On the basis of this hypothesis, if an
otherwise susceptible individual can either master the
environment or remove himself from the adverse conditions, he may
broaden his options and reduce the likelihood of drug dependence.
</p>

<p> 'From this point, drug dependence will refer only to the
compulsive end of the dependence continuum; drug-seeking behavior
with a high degree of user preoccupation. <br>
</p>

<p> Although the data are inconclusive, many observers believe
that American minorities, such as the Spanish-speaking, blacks
and native Indians, have a higher risk potential to drug
dependence in the sense that they are disproportionately poor and
leave disproportionately higher percentages of drug-dependent
persons. Since social and economic forces continue to restrict
the upward mobility of these groups, particularly the young
males, they remain at high risk to development of drug
dependence. </p>

<p> Whatever the accuracy of this hypothesis, it is clear that
certain populations in any society at any given time are more
vulnerable to intensified or compulsive drug use than others. The
choice of drug varies within and across societies. Although this
phenomenon has not been studied carefully, the Commission's
impressionistic survey of consumption patterns in societies
throughout the world indicates that the choice of substances has
an affective component and differs among those segments of the
population most susceptible to intensified or compulsive
drug-using behavior. </p>

<p> In the United States, for example, the most vulnerable groups
appear to demonstrate a preference for the depressants,
particularly alcohol and heroin, which are most likely to
obliterate rather than intensify their awareness of their social
condition and to reduce the anxiety which wells up in reaction to
this condition. In other societies however, the reverse may be
true. Vulnerable populations in Japan turned to the stimulants
after World War II. We should note, however, that a persuasive
case can be made for the proposition that availability is the
crucial determinant of chronic drug-using patterns in any
society. </p>

<p> For this reason, a comparison of different drugs in terms of
relative danger to society is impossible. In each society a
multitude of factors will determine the levels of use of
different drugs, and the price which society bears as a result.
At best, we can speculate about the cumulative social cost
accruing from widespread chronic use of a drug under conditions
of unrestrained availability. Comparisons between drugs would be
based on their relative potential for reinforcement and on their
relative capacity to influence behavior. (See Table 111-1.) </p>

<p> Available cross-cultural information does suggest that there
may be a maximum penetration level of drug dependence in any
society. Even in Hong Kong where heroin is available and
inexpensive, the prevalence of intensified and compulsive use
does not exceed 4% of the entire population although this
proportion is higher (about 11%) among males over 20 years of
age. Similarly, heroin and opium are easily secured in Thailand,
but the proportion of chronic smokers does not exceed 2% of the
entire population or 10%, of the adult male population. In the
United States, the proportions are roughly the same for chronic
alcohol use: about 15% of the total population and about 15% of
the middle-aged population. Available estimates also suggest that
the level of chronic cannabis use in Egypt may be of the same
order. Interestingly enough, the prevalence of chronic opium and
morphine dependence in the United States at the turn of the
century when availability was relatively unrestricted probably
never exceeded 1% of the adult population. </p>

<p> As availability of a substance becomes more restricted
through formal legal controls, the maximum penetration level of
dependence probably becomes lower. Thus, under any given social
policy in any given society there is probably a maximum social
cost. On the other hand, no matter how restricted the legal
conditions of availability for a given substance, there is also
likely to be a minimum penetration level. From this perspective,
the best that a society can hope for is to reduce the level of
intensified and compulsive use to that minimum, and keep it
contained at that level. </p>

<p> <b>The Relevance of Social Response</b> </p>

<p> Finally, the adverse behavioral consequences of certain types
of dependence may be tied to social policy and to institutional
responses to the drug-using behavior. Among those dependent on
highly reinforcing drugs, the level of dependence likely to be
reached is increased by social policies which prohibit
availability of the substance to the drug-dependent person. This
is because the &quot;hustle&quot; necessary to acquire the drug
will exaggerate the user's preoccupation with drug-seeking
behavior. Similarly, prohibitory policies also increase the
adverse social impact of drug-abstinence behavior of those
physically dependent on the prohibited drugs. Consequently,
appraisal of the social cost of a given type of dependence must
also take into account the potentially counterproductive effects
of the institutional response. </p>

<p> <b>Present Social Impact</b> </p>

<p> Turning now to the social impact of dependence on various
substances in the United States today, we find first that public
perception of the problem is not related either to the prevalence
of dependence or to the environmental and pharmacologic aspects
of the issue. </p>

<p> <b>Alcohol</b> </p>

<p> Alcohol dependence is without question the most serious drug
problem in this country today. Alcohol users far outnumber those
of all other drugs and are found along the entire continuum of
dependence. The reinforcement potential of alcohol and its
potential for behavioral disruption are high. Use of the drug is
pervasive within the general population, and its ready
availability facilitates the development of high degrees of
dependence among vulnerable populations. The prevalence of
intensified and compulsive use among the entire alcohol using
population is roughly 10%, and a serious decrement in social
functioning is noticeable in half of this group. </p>

<p> While there are many abstainers and the number of
non-dependent users is large, alcohol use nonetheless carries a
substantial social cost. The risk of individual involvement is
accentuated also by the pervasive sentiment which tends to
exclude alcohol from classification as a drug, thereby
eliminating it from the concept of &quot;drug abuse&quot; and the
social problems which go by that name. As noted in Chapter One,
according to the National Survey, alcohol is regarded as a drug
by only 39% of the adult population and 34% of the youth
population. Twice-daily use of the drug is viewed as drug abuse
by only 36% of the adults and 37% of the youth in contrast to the
use of heroin &quot;once in a while,&quot; which is regarded as
drug abuse by 82% and 80% of these populations. Finally, only 7%
of the public mentioned alcoholism as a serious social problem,
as compared with the 53% who mentioned drugs. </p>

<p> <b>Heroin</b> </p>

<p> Heroin is a highly reinforcing drug and, in the present
social context, demonstrates a selective attraction for
high-risk, vulnerable populations, in particular those with
minimal opportunities for a rewarding life style. The risks of
compulsive use are exacerbated by the prevalence of intravenous
administration and the rapid development of tolerance. The
dependence continuum is compressed at the maximal end and
movement through the phases of dependence is rapid. Even though
the incidence of ever-use among the adult and youth populations
is less than that of any other drug, the prevalence of dependence
among the exposed population is high, though not as high as
popular belief would suggest: available data suggest that 25% to
50% of those in high risk populations who try heroin may become
dependent. </p>

<p> Heroin dependence is disproportionately high among the most
vulnerable segment of the population; young males in the nation's
urban centers. Because dependence tends to develop during the
early years of adulthood, social and economic integration is
inhibited at the most crucial time, to the detriment of the
society in general and to the users' immediate social group in
particular. For this reason, the social cost of heroin dependence
is substantial. Unfortunately, present social policy tends to
exacerbate this cost even more. Because of enormous pressures
characterizing the present social-legal-medical response, a
disproportionate degree of behavioral disorganization and
disruption accompanies heroin dependence. </p>

<p> <b>Barbiturates</b> </p>

<p> Barbiturates are pharmacologically similar 'to alcohol,
involving the same dependence liability and potential social
impact. At the present time, however, no major social cost
arising from compulsive use has been specifically identified.
This is largely because these substances were hitherto
distributed primarily through medical channels, and their use has
been generally hidden. Recently, episodic barbiturate use has
appeared increasingly in the streets among youth populations,
posing serious problems in certain urban areas. For the most
part, however, high degrees of dependence have not been apparent.
</p>

<p> The Commission suspects that the prevalence of dependence may
be much higher than is generally estimated. The depressant
properties of the barbiturates have already attracted the same
populations who are most vulnerable to alcohol and heroin
dependence, and these drugs are often used in combination or as
alternatives. Even more important, however, the frustrations so
commonly felt among housewives appears to be fertile soil for the
development of sedative, anti-anxiety responses. Increased
barbiturate use in the past decade parallels the increase in
alcohol dependence during the late 1950's among this same
population. </p>

<p> The Commission believes that barbiturate dependence may be
the modern equivalent of the hidden opiate dependence of the late
19th Century. Therefore, even though a verified social cost
remains relatively low, the Commission attributes this fact less
to the pharmacologic qualities of the drug than to the present
medical orientation of the distribution system. As shown in our
National Survey figures in Chapter Two, the incidence of
barbiturate use outside the medical system has increased
significantly in recent years and promises to result in more
serious problems of episodic and multi-drug use in the future,
and perhaps an increased prevalence of intensified and compulsive
use patterns. Even so, the appropriate social response must be
formulated in the context of continuing therapeutic needs within
the medical system. </p>

<p> <b>Amphetamines and Related Stimulants</b> </p>

<p> Amphetamines and related stimulants, when administered
intravenously, have a high reinforcement potential. Consequently,
strong psychological dependence can develop, even though these
drugs do not induce physical dependence. The potential social
cost of amphetamine use, as measured by the prevalence of
compulsive use, is much lower than with any of the depressants,
largely because continued use of increasing amounts beyond the
stage of pleasant mental and physical exhilaration leads
generally to unpleasant and unbearable hyper-excitability through
psychotic manifestations. For this reason, compulsive use is
rarely sustained on a chronic basis. </p>

<p> This does not mean, however, that compulsive use of
amphetamines cannot present a significant social problem. In
post-war Japan, thousands of persons, particularly adolescents,
turned to readily available methamphetamine. Enormous problems in
social reconstruction were created. The establishment of special
psychiatric hospitals and the formulation of stringent legal
controls were necessary to curb the increased use. Fortunately,
cultural homogeneity and national purpose facilitated effective
measures to deal with this problem. </p>

<p> In the United States, compulsive use of amphetamines did
occur among a highly vulnerable segment of the adolescent
population during the middle and late 1960's, although the extent
of this phenomenon was exaggerated at the time and has diminished
rapidly since then. On the other hand, there is mushrooming
evidence that large numbers of middle class adults, particularly
women, have developed chronic using patterns of orally
administered low dose stimulant preparations. Although this
phenomenon may have been halted by modified prescription
practices, most of the dependence on these substances at the
present time does appear within the context of the medical
distribution system. In contrast to the barbiturates, medical
indications for the amphetamines and related stimulants are
highly limited. </p>

<p> <b>Cocaine</b> </p>

<p> Laboratory experiments with animals have demonstrated beyond
dispute that cocaine is the most powerful reinforcer of all
psychoactive substances. Although neither tolerance nor physical
dependence develop, this drug has a higher potential social cost
than the amphetamines. </p>

<p> Little social cost has actually been verified in this
country. Although increasing, the incidence of use and the
prevalence of chronic use remain relatively low. The route of
administration normally employed, sniffing or
&quot;snorting,&quot; is less likely to induce high degrees of
dependence than intravenous use. At the same time, cocaine has
demonstrated its attraction to the same populations vulnerable to
heroin dependence and to intensified amphetamine use, although
this factor may be in part attributable to multi-drug use and an
overlap in the acquisition ritual. Prudent policy planning
demands that the nature of cocaine-using behavior be kept under
close scrutiny, and that the currently inadequate data-base on
cocaine and the behavioral concomitants of its use be
significantly improved. </p>

<p> <b>Hallucinogens</b> </p>

<p> The dependence liability of hallucinogens is relatively low.
Although indiscriminate, sometimes daily use was not uncommon a
few years ago, the combination of rapid tolerance, aversive
side-effects and psychological satiation minimize the likelihood
of intensified or compulsive use. For this reason, these drugs
are generally utilized only for &quot;spree&quot; circumstantial
or recreational use, generally with the goal of self-exploration
or enhanced awareness. Consequently, dependence is not a
significant social concern, and attention should instead be
focused on the behavior potentially influenced by the drug
experience itself. </p>

<p> <b>Cannabis</b> </p>

<p> Particularly in the doses commonly used in this country,
cannabis is not a highly reinforcing drug. This drug does not
induce physical dependence and no significant degree of tolerance
is developed. Although compulsive use of the more potent forms of
cannabis does occur in cannabis-origin countries, there is no
evidence that such a use pattern is developing in this country
where use is generally experimental or intermittent and is
confined primarily to the less potent forms. Although there is
some evidence that the availability of hashish is increasing, the
users generally titrate their doses to reach the desired effect.
Finally, most persons using cannabis heavily in the United States
can be classified as intensified rather than compulsive users.
Consequently, dependence on marihuana is but a minor problem in
the United States today. We should note, in this connection that
whatever tranquilizing effect marihuana has may be sought in
alcohol and other sedative, anti-anxiety drugs. For this reason,
the likely penetration level of cannabis dependence is fairly
low. </p>

<h2>II -- DRUG INDUCED BEHAVIOR </h2>

<p> A variety of social forces mold and reinforce desirable
individual behavior. Can the momentary influence of a drug loosen
the socialized restraints, inducing the individual to behave in
ways he would not otherwise choose? </p>

<p> The history of psychopharmacology is replete with examples of
behavior changes associated with the acute administration of
drugs. A traditional, widely shared assumption of current
thinking in biological science is that there are an infinite
number of interactions between behavioral and pharmacological
systems. The description of these interactions requires
information about concomitant variations between the
characteristics of the behaviors and of the drugs. Information
about the behaviors should be specific with respect to factors
such as intraindividual and interindividual variability, type of
behavior and past behavioral history. Information about the drugs
should be specific with respect to such items as dose-response
relations, time-response relations, dose-order relations,
localization of the site of drug action, dosage forms, routes of
administration, absorption and distribution in the body and
biological fate. </p>

<p> Such drug and behavioral variables can be further modified by
environmental variables such as set and setting. The resultant
myriad of drug-induced changes in behavior cannot be fully
understood unless all these underlying variables are so
specified. Furthermore, recent advances in neurochemical research
suggest that many drug effects on behavior are mediated by
neurochemical events and that these relationships are reciprocal
in the sense that changes in one may affect the state of the
other. </p>

<p> If all of these possible combinations and permutations appear
hopelessly confounded, it should simply caution us in making any
premature generalizations about drug-behavior interactions. While
it is true that a full understanding of these interactions is
restricted by the limits of present empirical data, the presence
of such intricacies should temper an initial desire to simplify
the drug-behavior story and encapsulate it in succinct clich6s
suitable for mass media. Such attempts in the past have probably
contributed to the need for this Commission in the first place
and to do so again would be to ignore that information which the
Commission has marshalled. </p>

<p> Nonetheless, there is a certain utility in discussing several
important ways in which drugs may affect behavior. Although the
interaction among all of the drug-person-environment variables
will not be fully explored in this discussion, the Commission
believes it important to sketch certain categories which are
directly relevant to man's conduct. Since behavior has been
defined by some as activity of an organism which is observable by
the organism itself or by other organisms, drug-induced change in
perception is a suitable place to begin. </p>

<p> <b>IMPACT ON PERCEPTION </b> </p>

<p> Perception is defined as those processes by which man
receives or extracts information about the environment through
sensory apparatus (for example, vision and audition). Drugs can
alter the sensitivity of these systems and thereby alter
perception. </p>

<p> Space and time relationships are examples of perceptions
commonly affected by drugs. Marihuana, alcohol, hallucinogens and
other drugs have been noted to expand or contract estimates of
elapsed time or distance. For example, in simulated driving tests
involving use of moderate doses of marihuana, some subjects
perceived themselves to be driving at a speed faster than that
actually being simulated. Similarly, some user-perceptions
relating to enhanced sexual performance under the influence of
marihuana are thought to relate to temporal distortions as well
as to abolition of negative perceptions. Temporal distortions
have also been described by amphetamine users who perceive
themselves to be performing more activity in shorter time spans. </p>

<p> Drug effect may simply be a facilitating factor in many
alterations of perceptions; the effect of setting, for example,
cannot be overlooked. However, the occurrence of illusions and
hallucinations seem less influenced than other perceptual changes
by non-drug factors. Hallucinogens such as LSD increase the
visual threshold in man, cause arousal of the central nervous
system and allow for hyperexcitation to visual and auditory
events. Colors may seem more saturated and sounds may seem
louder. Similarly the delirium tremens associated with alcohol
use is a state involving visual hallucinations and spatiotemporal
distortions. </p>

<p> Drugs may also produce changes in specific anatomic areas of
sensory organs. For example, several phenothiazines (used for
tranquilizing and sedative effects) have produced pigmentary
degeneration of the retina, and, occasionally, blindness. Some
drugs, such as the anti-depressant imipramine, have even
precipitated glaucoma in susceptible individuals. </p>

<p> Drugs may also interfere with the user's perception of his
own abilities. Some studies have noted that student amphetamine
users tended to overestimate their capacity to make sound
judgments and solve mathematical -problems, and amphetamine-using
soldiers tended to overestimate their performance in certain
routine monotonous tasks. </p>

<p> The important implication of any of these perceptual changes
is that behavior may be altered from the expected to the
unexpected unless the user is able to compensate for these
effects as do some sophisticated users of marihuana and alcohol.
The degree to which the altered behavior is of concern to society
relates to the type of conduct which may be affected by the
perceptual change. This could range from being late for an
appointment to foolishly undertaking hazardous tasks. </p>

<p> <b>IMPACT ON MEMORY </b> </p>

<p> Man's behavior is dependent in part on what he has learned,
either directly from experience or from others. To the extent
that drug use or any other event affects man's ability to acquire
knowledge or recall it, it may influence his ability to
anticipate the consequences of his behavior. A full discussion of
learning and memory processes is beyond the scope of this Report;
indeed, these processes are currently the subject of intensive
research, covering an entire range of variables from genetic ones
to biochemical ones. The controversial nature of these
investigations into learning and the inadequacy of the data on
the impact of drug use on man's learning process preclude
detailed consideration here. However, some general observations
may be made regarding the influence of drugs on memory
(short-term and long term storage and retrieval). </p>

<p> Retention of acquired learning is hindered by amnesia or
forgetfulness. Amnesia is a state of decreased retrieval produced
by trauma or by chemicals; forgetfulness is a state of decreased
retrieval produced by passage of time or by preoccupation with
sensory input during time. Among the precipitators of amnesia are
electro-convulsive shock, anoxia, anesthesia (barbiturate and
ether), carbon dioxide and certain antibiotics. With regard to
psychoactive drugs in particular, anesthesia produced by either
ultra-short-acting barbiturates or by ether can precipitate
amnesia. Similarly, &quot;blackouts&quot; are commonly reported
after drug-taking episodes, constituting a form of drug induced
amnesia. </p>

<p> Drugs may also induce forgetfulness. It is common knowledge
that moderate doses of barbiturates and alcohol can reduce or
ablate newly acquired knowledge; in recognition of this
phenomenon, a recently proposed highway safety device would
require the driver to recall a randomly displayed series of
numbers before being able to engage an automobile ignition
system. </p>

<p> Occasionally recall may be facilitated by drugs. Marihuana,
LSD, and ketamine act vicariously to retrieve stored images and
&quot;project&quot; them into some sensory modality-vision,
audition, smell. The use of short-acting and intermediate-acting
barbiturates to facilitate recall of long-term memory in
psychoanalysis or espionage (truth serum) is well documented.
Finally, nitrous oxide has been shown in some circumstances to
reduce forgetfulness. </p>

<p> <b>ALTERATION OF MENTAL STATES</b> </p>

<p> Profound mental changes, both transient and permanent, have
been attributed to psychoactive drugs. These include some drastic
changes in mood and psychological status. Humans are normally
constrained by sets of socially-induced inhibitions from engaging
in certain behaviors. Drugs such as alcohol and other sedative
hypnotics tend to relieve these socially-inculcated anxieties
thereby increasing the likelihood of the usually restrained
behavior. The garrulousness and amorous behavior associated with
cocktail parties and the unabashed laughter following marihuana
use are examples of this disinhibition. Indeed such actions are
so common as to form a battery of socially recognized excuses for
normally embarrassing behavior. With prolonged use of high doses
of some drugs, notably alcohol, and the barbiturates, general
irritability increases and aggressive threatening acts may occur.
The challenging conduct frequently encountered in bars
constitutes a recognizable example. </p>

<p> Some drugs, notably amphetamines, cocaine and alcohol, can
produce a sense of bravado and have reportedly been used
intentionally to support the performance of daring acts. Euphoria
associated with initial opiate experiences may promote
thoughtless or indiscriminate actions. Amphetamines may induce
garrulousness, hyperactivity, rash promises and the like. At the
opposite pole, depressive states and suicidal acts are associated
with drug taking, particularly with the sedative-hypnotic
substances. This fact was overlooked when some sedative-hypnotic,
drugs were incorrectly promoter as tranquilizers appropriate for
the treatment of depression. </p>

<p> Almost all psychoactive drugs can produce transient
confusional and delusional states. The use of hallucinogens,
particularly by naive, control-oriented individuals, can produce
transient panic reactions, as the. user apparently loses control
of his environment. Phencyclidine has been associated with panic
states involving fear of suffocation arising from the drug's
powerful action on the muscles of respiration; hydrocarbon
inhalants have been associated with similar states of fear
arising from displacement of oxygen in the inspired air. Acute
confusional states occur with overdoses of alcohol, barbiturates
and other sedative-hypnotic drugs. Alcohol and marihuana among'
other drugs have been known to produce depersonalization. </p>

<p> Subacute and chronic psychotic episodes, particularly
paranoid reactions of a persecutory nature, are associated with
the major stimulant drugs--cocaine, amphetamines and
amphetamine-like substances. A prolonged &quot;spree&quot; use of
stimulants may induce a psychosis similar to that induced by the
hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and others). These
drugs also have the specific capacity to induce an acute
psychosis with a single effective dose even in so-called
&quot;normal&quot; individuals. As with all of the drugs
mentioned above, emotionally unstable individuals are especially
susceptible to drug-induced behaviors of this type. </p>

<p> 'This is probably due in part to sleep-deprivation which may
last 5-10 days. It is well established scientifically that
prolonged sleep-deprivation alone can induce an acute psychosis.<br>
</p>

<p> The exact relation between the drugs and these reactions is
unclear. Although the acute reactions mentioned above are quite
generally accepted as being at least partially drug related, the
origins of the chronic psychoses, either drug-precipitated or
residuals after termination of use, are much more debatable.
Perhaps the most confusion and misinformation devolves about
drug-induced &quot;brain damage&quot; and its relation to mental
dysfunction. </p>

<p> With but few exceptions, disorders of behavior cannot be
related specifically to detectable morphological change in the
brain, either at the gross or microscopic level. Whereas gross
and cellular changes have been associated with chronic
alcoholism, and with very heavy intake of barbiturates and the
hydrocarbons, profound behavioral and marked mental changes may
also be observed following long-term, chronic use of most other
potent psychoctive drugs without any detectable cellular
alterations whatsoever. In fact, this is usually the case. Thus,
any statement that no mental dysfunction occurs because no brain
damage can be demonstrated is in error. </p>

<p> The social significance of these drug-induced mental changes
is manifested in several ways. Those disruptions of mental
function associated with illusions and hallucinations,
confusional states, and the like, cause the individual to
misinterpret his environmental impressions and react in an
abnormal manner. This may take the form either of complete
withdrawal and negativism, or at the other extreme, of violent
and aggressive responses to situations which otherwise would not
have been considered to be threatening. In either type of
response, regard for welfare of self or others may be impaired or
entirely lost leading to violent behavior and even to suicide and
homicide. </p>

<p> <b>IMPAIRMENT OF PSYCHOMOTOR FUNCTION</b> </p>

<p> Depressant drugs as a class-alcohol, barbiturates, volatile
hydrocarbons and a multitude of lesser drugs-with the common
properties of inducing unconsciousness and anesthesia in large
quantities, produce varying degrees of motor incoordination as a
dose-related response. This phenomenon is so much a matter of
common experience with the alcohol-consuming public that it
hardly warrants description. </p>

<p> These drugs impair the function of all of the highly
integrated response mechanisms in the nervous system which
control all coordinated acts such as ambulation, operation of
motor vehicles and the like.' Depressant drugs by impairing
higher brain functions and distorting or rendering inactive
sensory input, or by rendering the user inattentive to these
controlling signals, may make him completely incapable of
performing complex voluntary actions. Unfortunately, such
impairment may occur with quantities of drugs much smaller than
those required to prevent the muscular response itself. Thus, the
driver of a motor vehicle under the influence of relatively small
quantities of alcohol may lose control, not because he is unable
to perform the mechanical act of driving, but because his
attention span is reduced, his vision is impaired, his memory of
a turn in the road is obliterated or he fails to hear the horn of
a passing vehicle. In other words, simply because a drug user can
&quot;walk a straight line&quot; after drinking does not
necessarily qualify him to drive a motor vehicle. </p>

<p> &quot; Less complicated psychomotor tasks do not require all
of this biological machinery to be In action. For example, a
blind person may feed and dress himself without the sensory input
from vision and a deaf person can even operate a motor vehicle
without auditory input, providing other sensory input is not
impaired or distorted.<br>
</p>

<p> Stimulant drugs, notably the amphetamines, have been widely
used to permit truck drivers to endure long trips and athletes to
carry on beyond their ordinary limits of endurance. Whereas such
drugs may mask the subjective effects of fatigue, they do not
correct the adverse effects of fatigue on attention, visual
discrimination and other factors which control proper psychomotor
functioning. Amphetamines were used by all belligerents in World
War II to prolong psychomotor performance. It was common practice
for Allied pilots to take these drugs after a bombing mission in
Germany to permit them to get back to their home bases in
England. A surprisingly large number made the return flight to
England safely but crashed their planes on landing. The subtle
effects of fatigue on psychomotor and other sensory components of
proper psychomotor functioning are not corrected by this class
or, for that matter, by any other class of drug. </p>

<p> <b>SUMMARY</b> </p>

<p> In summary, drug taking has the potential for affecting man's
behavior in a number of overt as well as subtle ways. Drugs can
affect perception, thereby influencing the way man regards his
environment. Drugs can affect memory, thereby influencing man's
capacity to anticipate the consequences of his actions. Drugs can
alter mental states, thereby affecting his capacity to interpret
and order his environment. Drugs can alter psychomotor function,
thereby affecting man's capacity to respond appropriately to his
environment. </p>

<p> These effects are neither uniformly negative nor uniformly
predictable. The number of variables affecting the interaction
between a drug, a person and his environment is perhaps
limitless. We can state with assurance only that drug-induced
behavior is as multi-faceted as all other human behavior. </p>

<hr>

<h2>III -- IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY </h2>

<p> All other ends of government are secondary to its
responsibility to ensure the public safety; and the cornerstone
of any viable social organization must be that each individual
have due regard for the life, limb and property of others. Fear
that the drug user will violate this precept has been a common
feature of the periodic cycles of public concern about drugs. </p>

<p> We have indicated that drugs can affect behavior in a
multitude of ways, some subtle such as decrement in short-term
memory, and others more overt such as aggressiveness and
psychotic disorders. Naturally, public concern has always been
greatest for drug-induced violence or assaultive behavior. But
the public safety may also be endangered by drug-influenced
recklessness or negligence. In this section, we will assess the
impact of drug use in the two areas of the most concrete
interest: crime and driving. </p>

<p> <b>DRUGS AND CRIME </b> </p>

<p> Fifty-three percent of all adults surveyed in the National
Survey spontaneously mentioned drugs as one of the most serious
problems facing our nation and in need of attention. As noted in
Chapter One, the &quot;drug problem&quot; conjures up many images
and conveys many things to many people; but for 13% of all those
who mentioned this problem, the primary concern was the
relationship between drugs and crime. </p>

<p> When the National Survey queried the respondents directly on
this question, it found that more than half of all adults and
about two thirds of our youth believe that marihuana users often
commit crime to buy more of the drug and that they &quot;often
commit crimes that they would not otherwise commit.&quot; The
American public is even more convinced of heroin's direct
relationship to crime; more than 90% of both youth and adults
believe that &quot;heroin users often commit crimes to get the
money to buy more heroin&quot; and that they often commit crimes
that they would not have otherwise committed. The extent of
agreement with these statements, however, was found to differ
significantly according to both the age and drug experience of
the respondent. (See Table III-4.) </p>

<p> <img src="pip30006.gif"> </p>

<p> In order to probe some of the factors responsible for this
set of beliefs, respondents were also asked to indicate their
experience with what they perceived to be drug-related crime. The
data show that about one-third of the adults reported having
experience at some time with someone breaking into their home or
place of work to steal some property. Fifteen percent stated that
the theft occurred at work, 19% indicated that it took place at
home and 67% had no recollection of .such an incident. Then
respondents were asked if they, personally, had ever been
attacked, mugged or robbed or if another member of their
household ever had such an experience, or if this bad happened to
someone &quot;they knew well.&quot; Again, about one-third (31%)
responded affirmatively; that is, if they themselves did not have
such an experience, they at least knew someone who had been
victimized in this manner. These individuals were then asked if
they had reason to believe that the attacker was a drug user or
was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offense.
The data reveal that just under onefourth of those with such
personal experience or knowledge believed that the criminal may
have been a drug user. Specifically, 77o believed the attacker or
robber was a drug user, 2% thought he was under the influence of
alcohol, and 22% said they did not know. </p>

<p> In general, those who reported either being a victim or
knowing a victim of personal crime were disproportionately young,
college educated, and from a large metropolitan area, usually
located in the Northeast. Users of marihuana and alcohol
(behaviors which also correlate with age and education) were also
disproportionately likely to have been a victim or to have
first-hand knowledge of one. Thus it appears that the generalized
belief in the existence of a direct relationship between drug use
and crime derives considerable reinforcement from the public's
experience with both personal and property crime. </p>

<p> As the Commission noted in its first Report on marihuana, the
relationship of drug use to criminal behavior is difficult to
unravel. Its investigation requires more than an examination of
the pharmacological properties of a particular substance and
their effects upon the individual user. Rather, additional
factors to be considered include dosage level; the immediate and
long-term physiological and psychological effects on the
individual; frequency, intensity and duration of use; the purity,
potency or type of drug used; the potentiating effects of drugs
used in combination; personal expectations; motivations for use;
set and setting; and the general impact and influence of the
larger society upon the individual. </p>

<p> In order to assess the nature, direction and strength of the
alleged relationship between drug use and antisocial behavior,
particularly violent and non-violent criminal and delinquent
behavior, the Commission examined several hundred documents in
the professional and research literature and conducted a number
of its own studies. Review of the professional and research
literature, including a number of studies conducted either by or
for the federal government, have led the Commission to conclude
that it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish a direct
relationship between crime and the use of various drugs; but if
one cannot say that the use of any drug in and of itself is
directly responsible for the commission of a criminal act, it is
possible to demonstrate that drug use in combination with a
number of physiological, psychological and social factors may
assume an important role in the exacerbation of criminal,
delinquent or other antisocial behavior. </p>

<p> In the pages which follow, we will briefly survey 11 selected
classes of drugs ranging from alcohol to heroin relative to their
pharmacologic potential for inducing criminogenic behavior, and
to the empirical relationship of their use to crime and
delinquency in selected populations. Then we will attempt to
identify the major psychological, social and demographic
characteristics of drug users, both criminal and noncriminal, and
compare these with similar characteristics of non-drug users,
both criminal and non-criminal. Next we will grapple with tl.e
problems associated with inferring causation in the relationship
between drug use and criminal behavior, regarding the impact of
each on the other. Finally, we will address the larger issue of
the impact of drug treatment and rehabilitation on that criminal
conduct assumed to be related to drug use. </p>

<p> <b>Drugs and Their Criminogenic Effects</b> </p>

<p> All potent psychoactive drugs have been associated with
crime, delinquency, heightened aggression, mental illness,
reckless or negligent operation of a motor vehicle or other
dangerous machinery and other forms of antisocial behavior. In a
paper prepared specifically for the Commission, 'Enklenberg
(1973) has examined the pharmacological properties of several
drug classes, has analyzed the degree to which they may be
considered criminogenic, and has completed an exhaustive review
of the research literature regarding the empirical relationship
between drug use and the generation of criminal and delinquent
behavior. This section draws substantially upon this special
report to the Commission. </p>

<p> <b>Alcohol</b> </p>

<p> The major behavioral effects of alcohol derive from its
depressant action on the central nervous system, also affecting
the function of peripheral nerves, skeletal, smooth and cardiac
muscle and other body tissues. Any behavioral stimulation which
is observed is probably attributable to the suppression of
inhibitory control mechanisms in various parts of the brain.
Among the commonly observed acute effects of alcohol use are a
reduction of anxiety, mild euphoria, some lack of muscular
coordination, slurred speech, enhanced conviviality and
assertiveness. </p>

<p> Low doses of alcohol, although said to improve functioning
with regard to some simple motor or cognitive tasks, reduce the
level of performance of such complex tasks as driving. When taken
in moderate doses, alcohol has been found to reduce substantially
motor skills as well as orderly thought processes and speech
patterns. Higher doses of this substance may cause the user to
become highly irritable and emotional and displays of anger and
crying are not uncommon. Exceptionally high doses are known to
cause stupor, unconsciousness and sometimes death. </p>

<p> The standard setting, dose-response function and personal
expectations of the individual with regard to alcohol are, in
part, responsible for his behavior while under its influence.
When loss of control, whether physical or emotional, is an
expected and recurrent reaction to alcohol use, the individual
often feels justified in his belief that it was the drug which
was responsible for his behavior. </p>

<p> Some researchers have advanced the theory that alcohol
reduces anxiety related to sexual behavior and enhances sexual
aggression; in fact, however, scientific opinion is split on the
validity of this proposition. </p>

<p> Various empirical studies on the relationship between the use
of alcohol and the commission of violent crime have shown that,
in the case of homicide and other assaultive offenses, alcohol
was used by at least half of the offenders directly prior to the
crime (Shupe, 1964; Wolfgang, 1958; MacDonald, 1961; Voss and
Hepburn, 1968). These studies also show that in alcohol-related
violent crime, the violence is most often directed at relatives
or friends who were drinking together. </p>

<p> Sex crimes have also been attributed to the use of alcohol.
In a survey of sex offenders conducted by the Kinsey Institute
for Sex Research, alcohol was reported as a factor in 67% of the
sexual crimes against children and 39% of sexually aggressive
acts against women (Gebhard, et al., 1967). </p>

<p> Molof (1967) found that youth who used alcohol were
responsible for significantly more crimes of assault than their
non-drinking counterparts, and Goodwin and his colleagues (1971)
reported that the use of alcohol was significantly associated
with other forms of antisocial behavior including poor school
attendance, an unfavorable work record and excessive fighting. </p>

<p> Finally, some researchers have stated that a criminal may be
prone to excessive drinking in order to increase courage in
preparation for the commission of a crime. </p>

<p> <b>Marihuana</b> </p>

<p> The initial effects of marihuana on the body can be compared
with some of those attendant to alcohol use; mild euphoria,
stimulation of the central nervous system and increased
conviviality. The user experiences a pleasant heightening of the
senses and relaxed passivity. In moderate doses the substance can
cause short lapses of attention and slightly impaired memory and
motor functioning. Heavy users have been known to become socially
withdrawn and depersonalized and have experienced distortions of
the senses. </p>

<p> Marihuana use is believed to reduce the inclination of the
individual toward physical tasks, particularly those requiring
sustained effort. The combination of aversion to sustained effort
as well as the disruption of the thought processes and alteration
of sensory perception occurring from high doses of marihuana is
believed to act as a deterrent to those criminal acts which
require, continuing physical effort and concentration. Only on
very rare occasions have individuals under the influence of this
substance been shown to become agitated and even aggressive, and
many of these persons had long histories of acting out behavior
well prior to their marihuana use. </p>

<p> Motivations for use, personal expectations, along with set
and setting exert a strong influence upon the individual's
behavioral responses to marihuana use. A person who believes that
marihuana use does not culminate in loss of control can be
expected to remain nonassertive while under its influence. </p>

<p> 'The Commission has already provided a detailed report of the
research findings regarding the impact of marihuana on public
safety (see Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding, Appendix,
Vol. 1, 1972, pp. 424-477). Presented here is a brief updated
overview of these findings. </p>

<p> Because marihuana does not have high dependence liability,
the cessation of use, regardless of frequency and intensity of
prior consumption, does not induce the physical discomfort
attendant to abstinence from other, more reinforcing substances
such as heroin, barbiturates or amphetamines. Therefore, it is
unlikely that even the heavy marihuana user will resort to crimes
to sustain his level of use. It should be noted, however, that
some individuals who sustain particularly heavy levels of use may
become psychologically dependent upon the substance and may
become somewhat more likely to engage in socially disapproved
behavior and to become involved in multidrug use. </p>

<p> As with alcohol, marihuana is not an aphrodisiac and does not
chemically induce sexual arousal. Although some observers believe
that the sexual experience is enhanced by marihuana use, an equal
number disagree with this theory. In its review of the available
data, the Commission found no evidence to indicate that marihuana
use results in heightened sexual aggressiveness. </p>

<p> From the facts stated above one can conclude that marihuana
use is not ordinarily accompanied by or productive of aggressive
behavior, thus contradicting the theory that it induces acts of
violence. Indeed, the only crimes which can be directly
attributed to marihuana-using behavior are those resulting from
the use, possession or transfer of an illegal substance. </p>

<p> <b>Barbiturates</b> </p>

<p> Like alcohol, barbiturates cause depressant reactions and
affect nerve, skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle as well as
other body tissues. Depending on the barbiturate used, the dosage
administered and the emotional state of the individual, reactions
to these drugs can range from mild sedation to coma and death. In
general, individual reactions to these substances are closely
parallel to those of alcohol. </p>

<p> Barbiturate use in low to moderate doses is generally
unlikely to result in assaultive behavior, although high dose use
of these drugs has been known to cause irritability and
unpredictably violent behavior in some individuals (Bell and
Fraser, 1950; DiMascio, 1968; McGrath, 1970; Eckerman, et al.,
1971; Malmquist, 1971; Blum et al., 1972; Tinklenberg, 1973). For
the individual accustomed to maintaining a high level of
barbiturate use, cessation of that use may result in delirium,
convulsions and other transient toxic disturbances which is
usually life-threatening. </p>

<p> The increasingly common simultaneous use of alcohol and
barbiturates must be considered when examining the relationship
between barbiturate use and crime. In a study by Devens and
Wilson (1971), it was discovered that 70% of the population (N =
129) of multiple drug users were known users of barbiturates as
well as alcohol. As mentioned previously, many of the effects of
these substances on the individual are similar. It is not
surprising, then, that persons who are regular users of
barbiturates may also be or have been regular users of alcohol.
Since a strong association between the use of alcohol and violent
crime undoubtedly exists, it is not difficult to surmise that
high level barbiturate use may also be linked to violent crime. </p>

<p> <b>Amphetamines</b> </p>

<p> The group of drugs known as amphetamines consists of
synthetic chemicals causing stimulation of the central nervous
system. They are commonly referred to as &quot;uppers&quot; or
&quot;speed.&quot; Some of the acute reactions produced by these
substances include increased alertness, vigor, suppression of
boredom and sometimes paranoia, assertive or assaultive behavior.
Because of their reputation for increasing physical endurance,
amphetamines have been used by athletes, truckers and other
individuals who have found it necessary to sustain high levels of
alertness and vigor. Some individuals, however, experience
headache, palpitation, dizziness, confusion and sometimes
delirium and fatigue. </p>

<p> The cessation of repeated use of high doses of amphetamines
generally causes the user to feel irritable, fatigued and
depressed; and a type of withdrawal occurs, although it is
qualitatively different from and not as uniquely characteristic
as the withdrawal syndrome associated with cessation of heroin
use. </p>

<p> The influence of amphetamines on sexual behavior is largely
dependent upon dosage, setting and predisposing personality (Bell
and Trethowan, 1961; Ellinwood, 1967). Use of these drugs over a
short period of time, however, appears to induce no appreciable
change in performance although some increase in the enjoyment of
the sex act (accompanying the delay of orgasm) has been reported.
Anqrist and Grershon (1969) found that &quot;increased
promiscuity, compulsive masturbation, prostitution and
intensification of sado-masochistic fantasies were all reported
as consistent sequelae of [high level and high intensity]
amphetamine use.&quot; Similar findings were also reported by
Geerlings (1972). In sum, the research findings indicate that the
direct effects of amphetamines on sexual behavior are complex and
multidetermined. </p>

<p> Only a limited number of studies have focused on the
relationship of amphetamine use to crime (Blum, 1967b. 1969;
Eckernian, et al., 1971; Ellinwood, 1971, 1973; Malmquist, 1971;
Smith, 1972; Tinklenberg, 1978). The majority of research
conducted on this subject, however, shows that amphetamine users
were disproportionately involved in crimes of violence (assaults
and robberies, for example). It has not been definitely
determined, in this country however, that these crimes were
directly attributable to the acute reactions of the drug,
although it would appear likely that the paranoid states induced
by this drug may be linked to dangerous conduct. This is
confirmed by the close association between methamphetamine use
and violent crime which occurred in Japan during the mid 1950's.
This development was particularly striking because violent
behavior is relatively rare among the Japanese and the incidence
of this conduct decreased markedly when the use of amphetamines
receded (Nagahama, 1968). </p>

<p> <b>Opiates</b> </p>

<p> Taken in small to moderate doses, the opiates can diminish
pain, anxiety and tension and induce mild euphoria. Sustained
high intensity use, unlike that of alcohol or barbiturates, does
not cause slurring of speech or lack of muscular coordination,
nor do these drugs induce the paranoid behavior generally
resultant from the use of amphetamines. The effect of a
particular dose of any of these substances is largely dependent
on the means of administration. Injection of these substances
reacts on the body more quickly than oral administration.&quot;,
however, the latter often causes a more prolonged although less
intense &quot;high.&quot; All drugs included in this class have
the potential for inducing dependence, and tolerance is built up
rapidly. </p>

<p> &quot; Heroin is not consumed orally. </p>

<p> The relationship of opiates to crime has been extensively
investigated. The research conducted in this area has been
limited primarily to: review of criminal records of known
dependents in an effort to determine whether dependence predated
or postdated criminal behavior; or a determination of the rates
of dependence among criminal or mental hospital populations; or
comparisons of criminal activity among dependents and
non-dependents or among users and nonusers; or comparisons of
pre- and post treatment criminal activity; or comparisons of
criminal behavior between dependents who remained in or
successfully completed treatment and those who dropped out of
treatment or relapsed. </p>

<p> Regardless of the type of study, some common conclusions were
apparent. First, the available data indicate that most known
opiate (primarily heroin) dependent persons had long histories of
delinquent or criminal behavior prior to their being identified
as drug users, that opiate use becomes a further expression of
delinquent tendencies, and that most heroin-dependent persons
continue to be arrested subsequent to release from prisons,
hospitals or treatment programs (Kolb, 1925, 1962; Anslinger,
1951; Anslinger and Tompkins, 1953; Morgan, 1965; Blum, 1967b;
Winick, 1967; O'Donnell, 1969; Chambers, et al., 1970a; Friedman
and Peer, 1970; Cuskey, et al., 1973; Friedman and Friedman,
1973; Jacoby, et al., 1973; Tinklenberg, 1973). Tn fact,
opiatedependent persons tended to escalate the seriousness of
their offenses and to experience increased arrests over their
pre-dependence rates, mostly for drug arrests and secondarily for
crimes against property (Blum, 1967a; Friedman and Friedman,
1973; Jacoby, et al., 1973). As Blum (1967a) has noted,
&quot;there is no doubt that among addicts with a delinquent
life-style, drug use is part and parcel of their other
activities, crime included.&quot; </p>

<p> Other observers have focused their attention on the
criminogenic effects of opiate use, per se, and especially on the
necessity to resort to crime in order to support a habit (Dal,
1937; Pescor, 1943; Haines and McLaughlin, 1952; Mever, 1952;
Tappan, 1960; Maurer and Vogel, 1962; Schur, 1962,1965; Duvall,
et al., 1963; Lindesmith, 1965; Vaillant and Rasor, 1966;
Cushman, 1971), and most note that the crimes committed for this
purpose generally tend to be non-violent. money-making crimes
(Bromberg and Thompson. 1937; Finestone, 1966, Kolb, 1962; Chein,
et al., 1964; Schur, 1965; O'Donnell, 1966; Preble and Casey,
1969; Amsel, et al., 1971; Canadian Commission. 1972; Friedman
and Friedman, 1973). </p>

<p> Indirect evidence linking the opiate (heroin) user to
criminal behavior is provided by a number of persons
administering treatment programs. Research findings indicate that
when the drug users are active in a therapeutic program and
presumably not using heroin, criminal activity decreases. That
is, when heroin use, decreases either by treatment or other
means, criminal behavior is also said to decrease (see, for
example, Joseph and Dole, 1970; DuPont and Katon, 1971;
McGlothlin, et al., 1972). This proposition and the supporting
data. however, will be scrutinized carefully in a later section. </p>

<p> Since drug-behavior interactions are complex processes
involving the operation of multiple variables, the identification
of a single factor as causal is bound to be incorrect and
misleading. The number of nondrug influences on the opiate user's
behavior is large, involving not only the immediate
circumstantial or situational variables but what preceded them
(personality, socioeconomic factors, etc.). Some observers focus
their attention on the contagious features of opiate use, that
is, the spread of use is seen as largely attributable to drug
availability, modeling behavior, peer group pressures,
conditioning and reinforcement (Chein, et al., 1964; Hughes,
1971; Goode, 1972b; Friedman and Friedman, 1973). Despite
significant and numerous attempts by skilled investigators to
discover which of the many non-pharmacological f actors assume,
the greatest relative importance, generalization,, at this time
are still premature. </p>

<p> In sum, the use of opiates in the United States, particularly
heroin use, increases the probabilities that all individual will
engage in acquisitive crimes or other criminal behaviors. most of
which are directly related to supporting the drug habit. However,
the available evidence indicates that users of opiates are
significantly less likely to commit homicide, rape and assault
than are users of alcohol, amphetamines and barbiturates. While
there are no data directly comparing the criminal proclivities of
opiate users with those of the general population, the evidence
indicates that a disproportionate number of heroin dependent
persons have had long histories of deviance which began well
prior to their use of and their official identification as users
of heroin. </p>

<p> <b>Cocaine</b> </p>

<p> Cocaine is obtained from the leaves of Erythroxylon shrubs
which grow in the Andes. It is a powerful stimulant to the
central nervous system and its acute effects resemble those
caused by the amphetamines, increased alertness and vigor and
suppression of hunger, fatigue and boredom. Unlike the effects of
amphetamines, the effects of cocaine last only a short time due
to rapid detoxification, and no tolerance occurs. Chronic use,
when and if it occurs, is attributable to psychological rather
than physical dependence. </p>

<p> Since cocaine produces many of the same reactions as
amphetamines (e.g., paranoid reactions, impulsiveness and
hostility), one would expect the user to be prone to aggressive
action. Although there have been crimes against persons
perpetrated by cocaine users, documentation of the drug's
specific effect is often absent. Like the opiate user, the user
of cocaine is more prone to commit crimes against property (Kolb,
1962; Lewin, 1964; Eckerman, et al., 1971; Woods and Downs,
1973). </p>

<p> <b>Hallucinogens</b> </p>

<p> The hallucinogens or &quot;psychotomimetic&quot; drugs can
cause marked alterations in normal thought processes, perceptions
and moods. Usually produced synthetically, this class of drugs
includes lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD),
dimethoxymethylamphetamine (STP), dimethyltryptamine (DMT),
mescaline, phencyclidine and psilocybin. Of this family of drugs,
LSD is the most potent and differs little from the other drugs
except for intensity of induced reactions and side effects. Among
the acute reactions of these drugs are dizziness, nausea,
dilation of the pupils of the eyes, visual ,aberrations and
heightened auditory acuity. According to Holister (1968) the
individual first experiences somatic changes then perceptual
alterations and finally psychic changes. The effects of any of
these drugs on the, individual are largely dependent upon his
expectations. his emotional outlook and the social action
occurring around him. Although dependence does not develop with
continued use, the individual may be prone to flashbacks and
psychotic reactions even after use is discontinued. </p>

<p> Presently, there are no convenient methods for determining
the tissue level of most hallucinogens; consequently, information
regarding the association between use of these drugs and crime is
limited toverbal reports and general observations. What little is
available, however, suggests that aggressive outbursts can occur
during panic reactions, especially if such reactions include
paranoid delusions and hallucinations. A small number of
homicides attendant to LSD induced psychoses have been documented
(Williams, 1969, Glickman, 1970; Malmquist, 1971; Reich and
Hepps, 1972; Snyder, 1973). </p>

<p> In his review of drugs and violence, Blum (1969) asserted
that emotionally stable individuals, even under the influence of
these, drugs, do not generally act in ways qualitatively
different from their normal patterns of behavior. As such, it is
important for investigators of the LSD-crime relationship to
examine the LSD user's previous psychosocial history and behavior
patterns before attributing any criminogenic potential or
properties to the drug itself. Blum did note, however, that a
poor judgment syndrome may develop in association with chronic
use, and that this syndrome could be a contributory factor to
some non-violent crimes such as perjury or theft. Nonetheless, he
concluded that hallucinogens probably have little effect upon
both the induction and prevention of violence. </p>

<p> <b>Other Psychoactive Substances</b> </p>

<p> Reactions attendant to the, use of the non-barbiturate
sedatives include excitation of the central nervous system and
feelings of anxiety. Very few data exist regarding the
relationship of these substances to crime. However, it is
believed that crime attendant to their use is probably minimal
and not of a violent nature. </p>

<p> Glue and noxious vapors may cause impairment of brain f
unction in the individual as well as delirium and toxic
psychoses. At present, however, there is a general absence of
information regarding the relationship between these substances
and the commission of crime, although a few isolated cases of
assaultive behavior by persons in a delirious state have been
reported. The delinquent behavior generally attributable to these
substances, however, tends to be of a petty and nonviolent
nature, although Friedman and Friedman (1973) have noted
increasing violence among glue sniffers. </p>

<p> <b>Summary</b> </p>

<p> In conclusion, the research findings concerning the
associations between drug use and crime have been complicated by
the interplay between the pharmacologic properties of the drugs
and the psychosocial characteristics of the individuals who use
them. Inferences which might have been drawn from laboratory
research have suffered primarily from the difficulties attending
replication of non-pharmacological. variables; and while
naturalistic studies are appropriate to this area of
investigation, they have been plagued for the most part by
deficiencies in research design and sampling procedures.
Nonetheless, the following tentative conclusions appear
justifiable from the data available: </p>

<p> Alcohol, the most commonly used drug, is strongly associated
with violent crime and with reckless and negligent operation of
motor vehicles. </p>

<p> Research findings linking barbiturate and amphetamine, users
with criminal behavior, especially assaultive offenses, are
increasing, but no definitive association has yet been
established in this country; However-, a strong association has
been demonstrated between amphetamine use and violence, in Sweden
and Japan. </p>

<p> Research data are generally lacking regarding the actual
relationship between cocaine use and criminal behavior; however,
the pharmocologic effects of the drug would seem to suggest a
potential for drug-induced violent behavior similar to that shown
for amphetamine and barbiturate users. </p>

<p> Marihuana use, in and of itself, is neither causative of, nor
directly associated with crime, either violent or non-violent. In
fact, marihuana tends to be underrepresentcd among assaultive
offenders, especially when compared with users of alcohol,
amphetamines and barbiturates. </p>

<p> Use of opiates, especially heroin, is associated with
acquisitive crimes such as burglary and shoplifting, ordinarily
committed for the purpose of securing money to support
dependence,. Assaultive offenses are significantly less likely to
be committed by these opiate users, especially in comparison with
users of alcohol, amphetamines and barbiturates. </p>

<p> Except in relatively rare instances generally related to
drug-induced panic and toxic reactions, users of hallucinogens,
non-barbiturate sedative-hypnotics, glue and similar volatile
inhalants are not inclined toward assaultive criminal behavior.
It should be noted, however, that some of the non-barbiturate
sedatives, notably methaqualone, and the hydrocarbon solvents
have a potential for inducing violent behavior although the
incidence, of such behavior is currently low. </p>

<p> <b>Psychosocial Characteristics of Drug-Dependent Persons:</b>
</p>

<p> <b>Implications for Public Safety</b> </p>

<p> The research literature is replete with descriptions of the
psychological, social and behavioral characteristics of drug
users, indicating that the characteristics and attributes of
different drug-using populations are varied and tend to change
over time. The research findings regard-ing the characteristics
and attributes of drug-using offenders, however, tend to reveal
more similarities than differences. In general, this can be
explained by their usual reference to a very narrowly defined
sub-population of drug users: the arrested, convicted,
incarcerated, hospitalized or in-treatment populations of drug-
(primarily heroin-) dependent persons. </p>

<p> Before describing the characteristics of this sub-population,
however, we emphasize again that the largest proportion of drug
users never comes to the attention of official authorities. Most
of those who experiment with drugs do so while they are young and
terminate use without escalating to dependence, or incurring ,any
adverse effects upon their behavior or their psychological or
social development. The same official invisibility and general
absence of untoward effects also obtain for the majority of
recreational and circumstantial drug users. </p>

<p> These segments of the drug-using population share the
characteristics of the population-at-large; to the extent that
they do come to the attention of law enforcement authorities or
medical and psychiatric personnel, such contact is almost
exclusively limited to apprehension for drug law violations
(possession, transfer and sale offenses or alcohol-related
traffic violations) or temporary treatment for an acute toxic
reaction to a drug. Such persons are generally neither more nor
less criminal than their non-drug-using counterparts.11 </p>

<p> Compulsive drug users,12 especially heroin-dependent persons,
on the other hand, are considerably more visible to official
agencies and frequently differ considerably in their
characteristics and behavior patterns front the
population-at-large, particularly with respect to their histories
of psychopathology tied social de6alice. For the most, part,
heroin-dependent persons can be said to belong to a subculture
whose dominant characteristic is the presence of a variety of
pathologies and illegal activities, only one of which is the use
of illicit drugs (see Kozel, et al., 1969; Cuskey, et al., 1973@.
The probability is high that such individuals will, in the
relatively lengthy course of their dependence, come, to the
attention of the police, the courts, the prisons, the general
hospital, the mental hospital, the treatment program or the
morgue. </p>

<p> 11 To the extent that they do become more deviant, it may be
a function of the manner in which they are officially handled
(contamination through incarceration, for example) or the
operation of the self-fulfilling prophecy (Consequent to labeling
them as deviant for their drug activities (see Weitzner and
Figlio, 1973). </p>

<p> 12 Under present social conditions, the segment of the
drug-using population which we have classified as intensified
users is composed primarily of &quot;problem drinkers&quot; of
alcohol, and heavy barbiturate or amphetamine users in the
mainstream population. These persons do not tend to commit crimes
and are not arrested for their drug-using behavior. </p>

<p> Although compulsive drug users constitute the smallest
numerical segment of the drug-using population, they, like the
chronic offender generally, are seen to pose the greater threat
to the public safety. For this reason, the following discussion
will focus on this particular group. </p>

<p> Although a few of the more recent studies deal with
drug-dependent persons drawn from the various cohorts of the
general population, most research has been specifically and
exclusively concerned with drug-Involved male offender
populations (arrestees, prison inmates, parolees), persons in
drug treatment programs or residents of psychiatric hospitals. As
such, the descriptions to follow can be viewed as limited to
those drug-dependent individuals already officially recognized
and labeled by society as emotionally unstable, criminal or
antisocial. </p>

<p> <b>Social and Demographic Characteristics</b> </p>

<p> <b>Age: 13</b> </p>

<p> Most drug-dependent (primarily heroin-dependent) persons
known to some official agency or authority are young, the
majority being under 30 years of age. Despite their youth,
however, their drug-using behavior has endured for many years;
substantial segments of this population report onset of drug use
to have occurred by the mid-teens, heroin use, to have occurred
by about 18 to 20 years of age, the stage of drug dependence to
have been reached within a few years thereafter, and public
notice of their heroin-related activities to have followed within
about five years from the onset of dependence (Ellinwood, 1967 ;
Robins and Murphy, 1967 ; Kozel, et al., 1969; Roebuck, 1970;
Taylor, et al., 1970; Bass, et al., 1971 Cushman, 197 I ; Heckel
and Mandell, 1971, Inclardi and Chambers, 1971a; Joseph, 1972;
Cuskey, et al., 1973; Friedman and Friedman, 1973; Jacoby, et
al., 1973). </p>

<p> Taylor and his colleagues (1970), for example, indicated that
56% of their sample of heroin-dependent persons in a Philadelphia
methadone treatment program were under 35 years of age, but 58%
of the sample had histories of over ten years of drug use. The
median age of a sample of heroin dependent persons entering the
New York Narcotic Control Commission for treatment was 20 years;
the median age of their initial drug experience was 13 years for
males and 15 years for females (Inciardi and Chambers, 1971b).
The ages of 81 patients in a hospital methadone clinic studied by
Cushman (1971) ranged from 20 to 62 years; the mean age was 37
years. The length of dependence in this group ranged from two to
47 years with a mean of 14.2 years. </p>

<p> 13 Research findings are inconsistent regarding sex and
racial distributions, a function perhaps of inherent sampling
biases. </p>

<p> Only seven of the 81 patients reported having been
heroin-dependent for five years or less. </p>

<p> Bass, et al., (1971) interviewed 150 admissions to the
District of Columbia Jail during January of 1971. Forty-seven
percent were found to be dependent on heroin and an additional
21% were reported to be &quot;chipping&quot; heroin. Eighty
percent of the dependent offenders were under 30 years of age
(mean age,: 24.1 years) ; 94%, of the &quot;chippers&quot; were
under 30 (mean age 22.3 years). A comparison with the non-heroin
using admissions revealed that the latter were, on the average,
five years older than the heroin-dependent offenders and seven
years older than the chippers (mean age 29.2 years). The mean
ages of onset of drug use for the two heroin using groups were
20.5 years for heroin dependents and 19.7 years for the chippers,
though use of other types of drugs had occurred considerably
earlier for both groups. About one-fifth of the dependent
offenders (21170 reported using heroin on a daily basis for one
year or more with 3% indicating that their daily use of heroin
continued over a period of at least five years. </p>

<p> Two years earlier, Kozel and his colleagues (1969) had
similarly interviewed a random sample of 225 inmates at the D.C.
Jail and identified 45% as dependent on heroin and 2% as chipping
the drug. Two-thirds of the dependents in this institutional
population were under 30 years of age with the greatest
concentration being under 21. Half had used heroin before the age
of 20, and 26% reported using heroin by the time they were 17
years of age. </p>

<p> <b>Educational Status:</b> </p>

<p> Very few of the heroin-dependent persons included in the
various studies completed high school, and many dropped out
before reaching the 9th grade. The majority, however, dropped out
between the 10th and 11th grades or as soon as they reached the
age at which they could legally do so (Griffith, 1966; Babst, et
al., 1969; Kozel, et al., 1969; Chambers, et al., 1970a, 1970b;
Roebuck, 1970; Stanton, 1970a; Taylor, et al., 1970; Amsel, et
al., 1971; Bass, et al., 1971; Cushman, 1971; Cuskey, et al,
1973; Friedman and Friedman, 1973). </p>

<p> Even while they were in school, however, and despite normal
intelligence, most exhibited behavioral problems in the classroom
situation (Bender, 1963; Griffith, 1966; Robins and Murphy, 1967;
Babst, et al., 1969; Kozel, et al., 1969; Milman, 1969; Joseph,
1972; Cuskey, et al., 1973; Friedman and Friedman, 1973). </p>

<p> <b>Income, Occupation and Employment Status:</b> </p>

<p> Because of their rather low educational achievement and their
general absence of occupational skills, most heroin-dependent
individuals remain at the bottom of the socioeconomic hierarchy.
Substantial, though varying, segments of this population have
been unemployed either totally or intermittently for considerable
lengths of time and many researchers have noted their financial
dependence, either upon public welfare or the support of others.
Among the 41-66% of the various study populations found to be
employed immediately prior to arrest, incarceration or treatment,
most described their jobs as unskilled labor with low earning
capacity and admitted to supplementing their income, in order to
support their habits, through illegal activities (Griffith, 1966;
Angrist and Gershon, 1969; Babst, et al., 1969; Kozel, et al.,
1969; Chambers, et al., 1970a, 1970b; Taylor, et al., 1970; Bass,
et al., 1971; Cushman, 1971; Inciardi and Babst, 1971; Joseph,
1972; Cuskey, et al., 1973; Greenleigh, 1973). </p>

<p> Because of the generally high relapse rate, employment
subsequent to release from prison or treatment tended to follow
these general patterns. The proportion actually employed,
however, tended to rise after incarceration or treatment (Joseph
and Dole, 1970; Cushman, 1971; DuPont, 1972; Cuskey, et al.,
1973). </p>

<p> <b>Home Environment and Marital Status:</b> </p>

<p> For the most part, heroin-dependent persons known to official
agencies were raised and still resided in the inner city core
areas close to their drug sources, in an environment
characterized by economic deprivation and family instability.
Excessive drinking and criminal involvement among both family
members and friends were not uncommon. Many of these conditions
continued into the marital situations of these subjects. Although
most remained single, possibly as a function of their youth, a
substantial segment of those who married had already terminated
their marital relationships through separation or divorce. In
essence, the preoccupation with drug use, the self imposed
isolation from stable social relationships (both to avoid
detection and preclude the possibility of family disapproval or
efforts at reform) and the general inability to assume, personal
and economic responsibilities collectively contributed to
unstable home and family situations (Ellinwood, 1967; Babst, et
al., 1969; Kozel, et al., 1969; Chambers, et al., 1970b; Roebuck,
1970; Taylor, et al., 1970; Amsel, et al., 1971; Bass, et al.,
1971; Cuskey, et al., 1973; Friedman and Friedman, 1973). </p>

<p> <b>Psychological Characteristics</b> </p>

<p> The heroin-dependent individual has been variously described
as immature, resentful of authority, passive-aggressive,
emotionally labile, sexually inadequate, anxiety-ridden,
rebellious, withdrawn, socially isolated, depressed and suicidal.
According to the available evidence, he also tends to repress
aggressive and hostile feelings, to require immediate
gratification, to have low frustration and anxiety tolerance, to
possess generally low self-esteem and to be manipulative, (Hill,
et al., 1962; Bender, 1963, Alessinger and Zitrin, 1965,
Schonfeld, 1967; Milman, 1969; Chambers, et al., 1970a; Roebuck,
1970; Friedman and Friedman 1973). </p>

<p> The heroin dependent person can be viewed as an individual
totally uncomfortable with and alienated from himself and his
surroundings, who must constantly maintain control over the
frustrations, anxieties, hostility and aggression. At the same
time, because his dependence requires his preoccupation with
drug-using and drug-seeking behavior, he has neither the, time
nor the inclination to form stable social relationships. His low
self-esteem and perceived inadequacies push him further into
isolation from friends and relatives. </p>

<p> It is not, surprising given this variety of psychological and
social characteristics, that so many of these individuals have
histories of psychopathology and antisocial behavior which date
to childhood and continue,, exacerbated by drug dependence, well
into adulthood. </p>

<p> <b>Problems in Inferring Causation</b> </p>

<p> Research interest has recently increased in the relationship
between dr-ug use and antisocial behavior. Regardless of its
quality or method, most of this research is intended to answer
the following, basic questions: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Does drug use predate or postdate criminal or delinquent
        behavior? </li>
    <li>What is the nature of the relationship between drug use
        and crime? How strong is it? Under what conditions is it
        present? </li>
    <li>Is criminal behavior caused by drug use? </li>
    <li>Does involvement in criminal behavior increase the
        likelihood that a given individual will use drugs, either
        generally or of a specific type? </li>
    <li>Is criminal or delinquent behavior aggravated by drug
        use? Is drug use, increased or aggravated as a
        consequence of involvement in criminal or delinquent
        behavior and its psychological, social and behavioral
        correlates? </li>
    <li>Is the alleged association between crime and drug use
        direct and identifiable or is it largely, if not wholly,
        attributable to the presence, of external intervening
        factors or simultaneously operating variables (that is,
        is it &quot;real&quot; or spurious) ? </li>
</ul>

<p> The research thus far conducted falls into several major
categories. </p>

<p> One category involves the interviewing of selected offender
populations (arrestees, adjudicated delinquents, prison
initiates) relative to their drug-using behavior in relation to
the offense for which they were last arrested, convicted or
incarcerated. A second type involves comparisons between the
drug-using behaviors of selected groups of offenders and matched
groups of either non-offenders or different types of offenders. A
third type involves comparison of the criminal records of drug
users and non-drug users. The fourth major type involves a
before-after design relative to the temporal sequence of drug use
and criminal behavior; the arrest records of individuals are
compared both before and subsequent to the onset of drug use or
drug dependence. </p>

<p> Few studies either use prospective (following one or a,
number of cohorts through time) rather than retrospective
analysis, or take into consideration multi-drug use patterns, or
adequately investigate the individual's past psychological,
social and behavioral history. As such, untested assumptions are
accepted as given and invalid conclusions are presented as
definitive. </p>

<p> Two illustrations should suffice to make this point. First,
it has been assumed that if drug use is found to predate arrest,
then it was in some measure responsible for the criminal
behavior. Often unrecognized, however, is that a considerable
amount of undetected criminal behavior may have existed prior to
apprehension and prior to the onset of drug use (see Inciardi and
Chambers, 1971a; Jacoby, et aL, 1973; Friedman and Friedman,
1973; Tinklenberg, 1973). </p>

<p> Second, if the offender indicated that he has taken a drug of
some type (including alcohol) prior to the commission of a crime,
or his use of drugs is identified in some, other manner, an
assumption made is that the drug was responsible for (caused) the
crime. This is difficult to prove because the arrest may occur
many hours, days, weeks or months after the crime and the few
tests that exist are not systematically used to determine the
type or amount of the drug in the body. Despite these problems,
the simple assertion or determination of drug use is often deemed
sufficient to establish a causal link between that drug use and
crime. </p>

<p> Despite the methodological limitations of specific studies,
however, comparative analysis of self-reported delinquency or
criminality and of arrest or court records presents at least one,
challenge to the hypothesis that drug use causes crime. If a drug
user or drug-dependent person commits criminal or delinquent acts
before he begins using drugs, then his criminality cannot be
solely attributable to his drug use. Further, an examination of
the types and amount of crime committed subsequent to the onset
of drug use or dependence is useful in analyzing the oft-stated
assumption that many drugs, especially heroin, have criminogenic
effects on the personality and behavior of the user. </p>

<p> Relative to the first point, considerable data exist to show
that the majority of drug-dependent, especially heroin-dependent,
persons are involved with criminality or delinquency prior to
their drug use and dependence (Morgan, 1965; Vaillant and Brill,
1965; Finestone, 1966, Smith, et al., 1968; Bluni, 1969; James,
1969; Stanton, 1969; Plair and Jackson, 1970; Inciardi and
Chambers, 1971b; Cuskey, et al., 1973; Ellinwopd, 1973; Friedman
and Friedman, 1973; Jacoby, et al., 1973; Research Concepts,
Inc., 1973; Tinklenberg, 1973). </p>

<p> Most of the researchers who have found that the majority of
their sample populations were arrested before the onset of
dependence agree that criminal behavior is not a by-product of
dependence but results, as does the, drug dependence, itself,
from psychological and social deviance which predates dependence
and is ordinarily apparent by adolescence. This conclusion
challenges the theory that drugs cause crime and stresses that
drug dependence and criminality are two forms of social deviance,
neither producing the other. </p>

<p> It is generally agreed that drugs have the ability to
exacerbate, existing psychopathology, delinquency and
criminality. However, such ability is conditional upon the
pre-existence of psychological and social maladjustment prior to
the onset of drug use or dependence (Bender, 1963; Hekimian and
Gershon, 1968; Milman, 1969, Stanton, 1969; Jacoby, et al., 1973;
Friedman and Friedman, 1973; Jones, 1973). Stanton (1969) notes,
for example, that: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Offenders do not originally become unstable or commit
    crimes because of drug use but drug use does contribute to
    and exacerbate both instability and anti-social behavior (p.
    16). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> In examining post-dependence arrests, the increases were
highest for drug law violations and to a lesser extent
acquisitive crimes against property (Jacoby, et al., 1973;
Weitzner and Figlio, 1973). Even smaller was the increase in
arrests for crimes against the person; several researchers found
no increases in violent or personal crime (Chein, et al., 1964;
Finestone, 1966). </p>

<p> To the extent that increased criminal activity involves drug
offenses and acquisitive crimes, some observers have suggested
that the illegal status of heroin is the primary factor in the
criminal behavior of heroin-dependent persons. By law, society
has defined the drug-related behavior (possession, sale) of the
dependent person as criminal, and has necessitated continuous
criminal contacts. The property crimes often resorted to by
heroin-dependent persons to support their habits are seen as a
direct consequence of these conditions. Of course, this view is
also compatible with the argument that this previously delinquent
population would probably have engaged in another criminal life
style even if it had not been the heroin life style. </p>

<p> Whatever the merits of this argument, it does highlight
several important issues. First, what are the social costs of
heroin dependence under circumstances of prohibited availability?
What price is society paying in order to avoid the social
consequences of loosened availability? Second, to what extent are
treatment programs for heroin dependent persons able to reduce
these costs? </p>

<p> <b>The Costs of Heroin Dependence</b> </p>

<p> In order to accurately estimate the social costs of heroin
dependence, several factors must be taken into account, including
the crime-related costs as well as the public health and welfare
costs. In this section we will cover only the crime-related
costs. In the next, we will deal with factors such as the
economic loss to the community of productive citizens and the
strain on the community caused by social and economic dependence,
family disruption, and the like. With regard to crime related
costs, we will cover: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The cost to the drug-dependent person to support his
        habit. </li>
    <li>The cost incurred to the community from crimes against
        both person and property committed by the
        opiate-dependent person. </li>
    <li>The cost to the community for arrest, detention, trial,
        probation, incarceration, parole, aftercare, treatment
        and rehabilitation. </li>
</ul>

<p> <b>Cost to the Heroin-Dependent Person</b> </p>

<p> A figure recently released by the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs sets the number of &quot;active addicts&quot;
nationwide at 559,224. It has been estimated that between half
and three-fifths of the nation's opiate-dependent persons reside
in New York. That State's Narcotic Control Commission estimated
that at the end of 1967, there were approximately 65,000 active
opiate-dependent persons in New York City alone, and by the end
of 1971, approximately 150,000 heroin users were known to the
Narcotics Register maintained by the Department of Health in New
York City. The problems involved in accurately estimating the
number of heroin-dependent persons, however, are myriad, and past
estimates have all suffered from invalid assumptions or
inappropriate measurement techniques. 14 It is not surprising,
therefore, to find critics of these estimates who are willing,
however, to substitute equally questionable ones in their place.
One such critic has set the 1971 New York City estimate at
between 70,000 and 100,000. Regardless of the exact number of
heroin-dependent persons or even heroin users, however, a basic
fact remains: a substantial illicit heroin market exists in this
country and the demand apparently remains larger than the supply.
</p>

<p> 14 The Commission has specifically addressed the problems of
heroin estimation and has attempted to identify the major
fallacies and deficiencies of past work in this area. It has also
provided some suggestions for future research. This study can be
found in its entirety in the Appendix to the Report (Blumstein,
et al., 1973). </p>

<p> Undoubtedly, the price of heroin and its quality vary with
both the supply of and demand for the drug. Between World Wars I
and II, heroin use was confined primarily to artisans,
entertainers and marginal social groups who congregated in urban
areas. Use of the drug also became fairly widespread among the
black and Puerto Rican males in the inner cities. </p>

<p> After World War II, heroin trade ,and distribution routes,
which had been interrupted during the War, reopened. New York
City and to a lesser extent Chicago, witnessed a great upsurge in
heroin use among young minority group males. As victims of
unemployment and discrimination, frustration and alienation, they
formed a ready market for the new influx of heroin. At this time,
heroin was in ample supply and of good quality; it was rarely
beyond the financial reach of anyone who cared to escape the
realities of his existence. </p>

<p> During the 1950's, heroin use spread with increasing
popularity to the younger people of the cities, children of
immigrants and Southern blacks who were unsolved in the life and
life style of the street gangs. Although the available evidence
is somewhat contradictory, many observers have related the
increase in heroin use to the disorganization of gang activities
and the disintegration of many street gangs. as their members
grew ineffective in their own terms and incapable of protecting
gang interests (Chein, et al., 1964; Hughes, 1971). </p>

<p> Late in 1961, a critical shortage of heroin, an event which
came to be known as the &quot;panic&quot;, occurred in New York.
According to some, this panic&quot; is largely responsible for
the inflated cost of maintaining a habit today. Because the
substance was in such short supply, dealers cut the quality of
the, dose many times and therefore increased the amount of the
drug needed and the amount of money necessary to buy it. Yet,
even with the inflated price and deflated quality, dealers
experienced little difficulty in disposing of their supplies. Two
observers have noted that during this period, the cost of
maintaining a habit was said to have increased to ten times what
it had been only twenty years before (Preble and Casey, 1969). </p>

<p> The inflationary cost of heroin, however, did not disappear
with the passing of the panic, and recent estimates of the daily
cost of supporting a habit have ranged from $20 to $100,
fluctuating according to availability and location (Hekimian and
Gershon, 1968; Babst, et al., 1969; Kozel, et al., 1969; Preble
and Casey. 1969, Holahan, 1970; Joseph and Dole, 1970; Rogers,
1970; Tinklenberg and Stillman, 1970; Cushman, 1971 ; DuPont and
Katon, 1971; DuPont, 1972). </p>

<p> <i><b>Costs to Society From Criminal Activity</b></i> </p>

<p> According to Preble and Casey (1969), at least 80% of New
York's heroin-dependent population reside in urban slum areas.
Figures culled from the Bureau of the Census reveal that at the
close of the 1970 census, the median family income of New York
City residents was $9,692. while, the mean income of families
reporting public assistance in that city was $2,114. </p>

<p> If we assume that a heroin-dependent person has a daily habit
of $20 (the lowest daily estimate found but amounting to $7,300
per year), we can also assume that it would be relatively
impossible for him to support his habit without supplementing his
income through illegal means. </p>

<p> F or the most part, this illegal activity manifests itself in
crimes against property, principally burglary and shoplifting
(Finestone, 1966; Kozel, et al., 1969; Preble and Casey, 1969,
Jacoby, et 11., 1973). Less commonly, heroin-dependent persons
resort to offenses against the person (assault, mugging, robbery)
in a similar desperate effort to obtain the money required to
purchase the drug (Anisel, et al, 1971; Friedman and Friedman,
1973; Jacobv, et al, 1973; Tinklenberg. 1973). Researchers have
estimated that for a heroin-dependent person to support his
habits he must steal property amounting to between two and
one-half to five times the actual cost of his habit (Cushman,
1971) and that he may be expected to steal in property an amount
ranging from $25,000 to $50,000 per year (Joseph and Dole, 1970;
DuPont, 1.972). The estimated daily tolls in stolen property have
ranged from $25 to $375. At least one researcher (Singer, 1971),
however, has been highly critical of these, estimates, all of
which he deems to be grossly exaggerated. </p>

<p> Heroin-dependent persons are also known to raise funds to
support their habits by pimping and prostitution. Although these
activities do not represent a direct financial burden to society,
they do, nevertheless, constitute socially and legally
disapproved behavior&quot; (Cushman. 1971 , 1972; see also Amsel,
et al., 1971). </p>

<p> A heroin-dependent person may also become involved in the
complicated hierarchy of individuals who are responsible for the
importation and distribution of heroin. In this way, he is
assured of a supply of the drug for his own needs and very often
realizes a profit large enough to induce him to go into the
drug-dealing business for himself. </p>

<p> <b>Criminal Justice Costs: Processing the Drug-Dependent
Person</b> </p>

<p> In addition to the costs of crime incurred by drug-dependent
persons, the community must also assume the cost of
investigating. identifying, arresting, detaining, trying,
sentencing, treating and rehabilitating the drug-dependent
offender. </p>

<p> In 1969, the New York State Department of Corrections
estimated that it cost the State $12.75 per day for incarceration
of one person (Cushman, 1971), a figure including the separate
costs of overhead, custodial personnel, maintenance and other
limited services.15 A similar figure of $12 per day was quoted as
the cost of (retention, while arrest procedures were estimated to
total $25 per arrest (Cushman, 1971).16 </p>

<p> 15 One 1969 study (Babst, et al., 1969) estimated that the
cost of keeping all individual on parole or in aftercare came to
approximately one-tenth of that required to maintain him in a
correctional facility. This suggests all a(Witional cost to the
community of approximately $1.25 per day once the individual is
released from prison (if. of course. the estimated cost of
incarceration is reasonably accurate). </p>

<p> 16 This estimate was derived hy multiplying the hourly
wag&quot;, of an average policeman by five, the absolute minimal
estimated time deemed necessary to complete the initial
administrative procedures attendant to arrest. </p>

<p> In a more recent study of heroin use in Washington, D.C.
(DuPont, 1972), the daily cost per user for incarceration was set
at $14, compared with an approximate cost of $5.50 per patient
for outpatient care. The Corrections Department in that same city
listed the daily cost per offender on parole at $0.97, a figure
somewhat lower than that noted for New York a few years ago. </p>

<p> If the costs of arrest, trial, incarceration, treatment and
the like are multiplied by the alleged number of
heroin-dependent, persons in this country today, society is faced
with another potentially astronomic bill directly related to
heroin and other drug use and dependence. To this figure must be
added additional amounts which reflect the, rate of recidivism
among drug offenders and the costs incurred from crimes committed
to support their habits. Yet another adjustment must be made for
those who, during the course of their drug dependence will
probably be arrested several times on a variety of charges and be
processed through the criminal justice system many times over. </p>

<p> <b>The Effect of Drug Treatment on Crime</b> </p>

<p> During the past eight years, methadone maintenance has
evolved from an experimental program with 22 patients into the
most widely used treatment mortality in the nation. Its
supporters havee claimed that participation in one methadone
program reduces heroin-related crime, a direct function of the
patient's reduced need for and use of heroin. In addition,
individuals participating in methadone maintenance programs are
reported to be able to function, perhaps for the first time in
their adult lives, as socially responsible and economically
independent and productive members of society. </p>

<p> The Commission has carefully scrutinized these claims. In
general, they have been based on the reported findings of a
limited number of quasi-experimental studies (mostly before-after
comparisons); the deficiencies in research design, sampling
techniques, analysis and interpretation of the data significantly
limit the reliability and validity of the conclusions and the
inferences drawn therefrom. In fact, we have not found
sufficiently responsible research to conclude that any of the
various treatment modalities, regardless of type, actually reduce
crime. </p>

<p> When methadone maintenance was first devised, its
crime-reducing potential was regarded as ancillary to achievement
of the primary program goal, the elimination of drug use. With
the passage of time, however, heightened public fear and dramatic
increases in what is frequently reported to he heroin-related
acquisitive crime have distorted the public's view of the purpose
of methadone maintenance. Funding agencies, program officials and
public leaders have continually touted this treatment modality as
a law enforcement strategy designed primarily to reduce
drug-related crime.17 </p>

<p> 17 The Canadian LeDain Commission recently noted in its,
report on treatment &quot;The success of methadone programs is
generally measured in terms of social or cultural criteria rather
than psychological ones. A return to a normal life cycle based
upon employment, marriage and stability of social interaction is
the prime criterion of success. However, the expectation of a
normal life style characterized by emotional maturity and
complete abstinence in addition to a law-abiding. productive
existence is an ideal which in practice is seldom achieved.
Because of this, some methadone programs arrange their goals
hierarchically. The foremost expectation is that all patients who
are treated will become law-abiding citizens. although they might
not become productive. mature or drug-free. The next level is to
achieve a status in which patients are law-abiding and gainfully
employed.&quot; (1972. 1). 24.) </p>

<p> <b>Current Research Findings </b> </p>

<p> The degree to which patients in treatment, have made gains
toward crime-free lifestyles is generally measured by comparing
patients' arrest records prior to program entry and during
treatment. In a few studies, however, attempts at control have
been made by comparing arrest records of methadone maintenance
patients with those of reportedly matched groups of individuals
in other treatment modalities (detoxification or abstinence,
programs) or with those of individuals who dropped out of the,
maintenance program at, some stage. </p>

<p> Several before-after comparison studies have attempted to
establish a direct relationship between methadone maintenance and
a reduction in crime. Although the data available strongly
suggest a reduction in the criminal behavior of patients in
treatment, differences in the basis of measurement preclude
precise comparison of their results. Joseph and Dole (1970), for
example, utilized data on convictions whereas Gearing (1971)
studied arrests; Cushman (1971) reported on data derived from
police records and interviews while DuPont (1972) drew on crimes
known to the police, arrests and incarceration figures. The
periods of time before and after treatment which were measured
also differ considerably and thereby affect the crime rates
reported. </p>

<p> Examination of studies incorporating control groups have
generally come to conclusions similar to those reflected in the
before-after designs. Researchers who have compared individuals
in treatment with those who have dropped out, at some stage
uniformly show significant differences in arrest or conviction
rates between the two groups and therefore conclude that it was
the treatment which was largely responsible for the resultant
crime reduction (Joseph and Dole, 1970, Williams, et, al, 1970;
Moffett, et al, 1971: Clines, 1972, DuPont, 1972). </p>

<p> Studies designed to compare the arrest or conviction rates of
individuals in different treatment modalities are intended to
deal more specifically with the degree of crime reduction
produced by a particular type of treatment. In general, their
findings have shown that methadone maintenance has been
significantly more successful than other modalities
(detoxification, and abstinence, for example) In achieving crime
reduction, although the absolute amount of reduction and the
program differentials have varied considerably (Asher, 1970:
Joseph and Dole, 1970; Wieland and Chambers, 1970; DuPont, 1972;
Cuskey et al., 1973). </p>

<p> Although the statistics presented are generally impressive
(crime reduction estimates range from 14% to 94%) untested basic
assumptions and other methodological deficiencies preclude their
generalization and signal careful interpretation. </p>

<p> In one before-after study, for example, the researcher's
major hypothesis was that a recent annual rise in serious crime
was largely attributable to a heroin &quot;epidemic,&quot; and
was manifest in significant increases in commitment rates of
opiate offenders and parallel increases in index offenses for
that period. A second hypothesis was that a subsequent unexpected
and abrupt decline in serious crime was largely attributable to
the treatment (primarily methadone maintenance) of thousands of
heroin-dependent persons. Although the researcher did give some
credit for this &quot;pronounced and progressive&quot; reduction
in crime to the doubling of the police force during the time
period under investigation, the major conclusion of the study was
that if the rise in crime was correctly attributable to a heroin
epidemic, then it was also true that heroin treatment was largely
responsible for- the subsequent crime reduction (DuPont, 1971). </p>

<p> The researcher failed to demonstrate, however, that the
significant increase in reported crime was indeed attributable to
the alleged rise in heroin dependence. Although the proportion of
incarcerated heroin dependent persons did increase, the reported
number of index crimes increased by an even greater margin. Some
of this increase was undoubtedly related to the growth of heroin
dependence, but the very large and general increase in the crime
rate suggest that most of the increase was probably attributable
to the majority of criminals who are not heroin -dependent.
Another fallacy in the researcher's reasoning lies in the fact
that the study was based on increases in arrests and
incarceration and on the records of those persons who were in
treatment. Those arrested, however, represent only a small
fraction of the universe of offenders, even drug offenders;
persons incarcerated constitute only a tiny fraction of those
arrested; and persons in treatment represent only a small
proportion of known heroin-dependent persons (many more are on
waiting lists) which, in turn, represents some unknown fraction
of all heroin-dependent persons. Thus, what is perceived as a
triumph of a particular treatment modality may be for the most
part a simple statistical artifacts </p>

<p> Numerous other methodological obstacles preclude
generalization from research findings regarding, treatment and
crime. In only one study, for example, did the researcher attempt
to control for dosage level of the methadone administered (those
with lower dosages were found to have higher crime rates). None
of the studies examined takes into account the monitoring and
supervision of the drug's administration nor is there any
standardization of the point in treatment at which the
measurements are. made. Finally, some studies use a man-year
figure as a measurement of success although the conclusions drawn
therefrom are especially likely to be distorted and misleading,
(Joseph and Dole, 1970; Gearing, 1971, Joseph, 1972). </p>

<p> To illustrate this final point, let us assume for a moment,
that we are interested in 20 individuals in treatment program X.
Of these 20, 15 had dropped out at exactly two months after
entering, two more dropped out after five months in the program,
one stayed for a year before leaving and one confirmed in
treatment for three years. Multiplying the number of individuals
(20) by the number of months each spent in the program and adding
those figures yields the total member of man-months spent in
treatment. This number, divided by 12, equals the total number of
man-years in treatment. (See Table III-5) </p>

<p> <img src="pip30007.gif"> </p>

<p> Dividing the man-month or man-year figure by the number of
individuals who had participated in treatment yields the average
(mean) number of man-months or man-years of treatment per
individual. In this case, the average number of man-months of
treatment per individual totals 5 (or an equivalent of .4
man-years of treatment per individual, on the average). </p>

<p> Both the total. and the average man-month or man-year
figures, however, provide for varying interpretation, depending
upon motive and requirements. In the case above, for example, an
individuals average time, in treatment was calculated to be five
months; yet the actual situation shows that 15 out of the 20
(75%) of these individuals dropped out of the program after two
months, the latter being the modal length of stay. </p>

<p> The ways in which programs record admission and dropout data
further complicate this matter. In some instances, persons who
drop out during the early high risk period (0-5 months after
entry into program) are simply not counted and therefore remain
invisible for dropout or failure statistics. These same persons,
however, are frequently counted as program participants for
budgetary and accounting purposes. Similarly, dropouts who return
to the program after a specific, unusually short, period of time,
are frequently counted as new program entrants rather than
readmissions, again primarily for budgetary and program
accounting reasons (Research Concepts, Inc., 1973). </p>

<p> Clearly, the manner in which data are presented can
significantly alter and distort the perception of the reader if
not the actual facts themselves. Aside from any basic
methodological deficiencies, this kind of statistical
misrepresentation constitutes perhaps the most serious defect in
the available research literature on the effect of treatment in
reducing crime among drug-dependent persons. </p>

<p> <i><b>A Realistic Appraisal</b></i> </p>

<p> We have already noted that most opiate-dependent persons
leave long histories of psychopathology and social pathology
which are manifest in delinquent, criminal, suicidal and other
deviant, behavior prior to the onset of drug use. Psychiatric and
other studies have also confirmed the hypothesis that the
pre-existence of these problems significantly increased the
individual's initial susceptibility to opiate dependence as well
as his high vulnerability to relapse into drug use and crime, 18
(Bender, 1963; Milman, 1969, Stanton, 1970a: Taylor, et al.,
1970; Chambers and Taylor, 1971 Cushman, 1971; Gearing, 1971;
Inciardi and Chambers, 1971b; Joseph, 1972; Laugrod and Lowinson,
1972; Cuskey, et al., 1973). </p>

<p> 18 A partial explanation for the increase in rearrest may lie
in police practice. By virtue of the police practice of increased
surveillance of known drug-dependent persons the once-identified
drug-dependent person, one with a history of arrest and
hospitalization, stands a greater chance of being apprehended
than does one who is not yet known to the police. The simple
addition of opiate-dependence to delinquency automatically
increases the likelihood that the drug-dependent offender will
come to the attention of the police (see Bridges, 1965: Roberts,
1967: Cuskey, et al., 1973; Jacoby, et al., 1973). </p>

<p> Additional research findings have indicated that most
opiate-dependent persons come from unstable home and family
situations where social deviance was evident in other family
members, and drop out of school at a fairly early time (generally
about 10th grade). They generally possess no marketable skills;
have non-existent or at best unstable employment histories; have
unstable personal and social relations; reside in the inner-city
ghettos and suffer the psychological, social and economic
stresses so often concommitant with that type of existence.19 </p>

<p> 19 Several researchers have attempted to describe the
&quot;addict subculture&quot; and to document its importance and
its implications for the treatment of drug-dependent individuals.
See, for example, Finestone, 1964; Sutter, 1966; Feldman, 1968;
Preble and Casey, 1969; Stephens and Levine, 1971. </p>

<p> Taken together, these findings suggest that chances for
rehabilitative success, however defined, are not high for such
individuals. The psychological ambivalence which most
opiate-dependent persons feel toward the drug coupled with the
indication from research findings that these persons had not yet
been &quot;habilitated&quot; suggests a poor prognosis for their
&quot;rehabilitation,&quot; defined in terms of a &quot;normal
life style based on gainful employment, marriage and social
stability.&quot; Notwithstanding the fact that social,
psychiatric, psychological, counseling and other ancillary
services are provided to those in treatment, this society must
face the fact that even the best of the services have inherent
limitations in the degree to which such programs can alter the
behavior of individuals who for so long have been subject to
nonsupportive social and emotional circumstances. While evidence
does exist to show that some qualitative and quantitative changes
in behavior with respect to crime and employment are associated
with treatment, the precise nature or amount of change which can
be directly attributable to programmatic inputs is difficult to
measure and has not yet been documented substantially. </p>

<p> <b><font size="4">DRUGS AND DRIVING</font></b> </p>

<p> Adult Americans spend an average of 5% of their waking hours
every day behind the wheel of their cars.20 Although
&quot;driving under the influence&quot; of drugs is universally
condemned by public opinion and public law, far too many
Americans appear unwilling to structure their activities in such
a way that drug use and driving do not coincide. In an ideal
society in which all individuals behaved responsibly, the effects
of drugs on driving would not be of major concern. In this
country, however, our citizens are more dependent on motor
vehicles than they are on drugs. For this reason, the full impact
of drug-using behavior on the public safety cannot be fully
assessed without reference to the effect of psychoactive drugs on
the user's ability to drive a motor vehicle. </p>

<p> 20 Each licensed driver drives an average of 10,000 miles
every year, spending 255 hours on the road. </p>

<p> <b>Research Limitations</b> </p>

<p> Data are generally lacking on drug use and its effect upon
the user's driving ability and motor vehicle accidents. The major
research obstacle is that effective devices are, not available to
detect some psychoactive drugs within the body fluids of persons
who are involved in accidents or traffic violations. In addition,
these, tests, where available, are inconvenient and are not
systematically administered. Since it took several years of
research to develop functional alcohol detection devices, it is
reasonable to predict that it will take some time to develop the
more complex detection devices for these drugs. Further, even if
blood or urine samples are taken in an effort to test for the
presence of drugs other than alcohol, laboratories are generally
not available or equipped to determine the identity or quantity
of drugs present. </p>

<p> Even when such tests are feasible and available, research is
further inhibited by the complexity of the drug-person
interaction. The relationship between the risk of automobile
accidents and use of psychoactive drugs is difficult to establish
for many reasons, among which are: the wide variety of such drugs
which are available; the, substantial quantitative and
qualitative variation in drug-effect, the differences in duration
of drug effect; the cumulative and/or interaction effects due to
prolonged or combined drug usage, and individual differences in
reaction to drug-effect. One of the major shortcomings of prior
research is its emphasis on the dosage per se rather than on
blood concentration levels which more accurately reflect the
dosage effect according to individual characteristics, such as
weight. </p>

<p> Moreover, the studies conducted leave suffered from serious
methodological defects which undermine their findings (Nichols.
1971). </p>

<p> Laboratory Investigations can determine the effects of use of
particular drugs on driving-related performance. However, it is
difficult to generalize such results to real driving situations,
and previous studies have failed to relate performance decrement
to drug concentration levels. </p>

<p> <i>Anecdotal reports and case histories </i>may suggest areas
where controlled research is needed, but are, in themselves
insufficient to establish relationships. </p>

<p> <i>Comparison of crash records of drug users and non-users </i>comprises
an alternative method for assessing the impact of drug use on
highway accidents. However, even if the frequency of accidents is
higher among drug users, these findings do not establish any
causal relationship between the variables. For example, there is
no way of determining from this method alone whether the highway
accidents in which drug users are involved occurred while such
users were &quot;under the influence&quot; of a drug. </p>

<p> <i>Systematic analysis of body fluids taken from crash
victims can </i>determine the correlation between drug use and
accidents but can only presume causal relationships. As we noted
earlier, such data are presently inadequate because some drugs
are not detectable in human body fluid samples. In addition,
testing procedures are plagued by unstandardized sampling and
screening techniques. </p>

<p> <i>Comparison of drug concentration levels of crash victims
and of non-involved drivers operating vehicles under similar
circumstances </i>is perhaps the. soundest way of determining the
impact which drug use <i>per se </i>may be having on highway
crashes. However, this procedure has not generally been used in
connection with drugs other than alcohol. In addition, it is
hampered by the difficulty of matching comparison groups and by
the inconvenience of stopping and testing drivers not involved in
accidents. </p>

<p> <b>Research Findings</b> </p>

<p> Prior to describing the available data regarding specific
drugs and their effects on driving, we should note that
insufficient attention has been paid to the impact of
&quot;medical&quot; drugs on driving performance. </p>

<p> At any one time, perhaps 3-5% of the driving population (age
16 and over) are taking psychoactive medication prescribed by a
physician (Kibrick and Smart, 1970).21 </p>

<p> 21 In addition, psychoactive preparations sold
over-the-counter may affect driving performance. So may some
prescription drugs not normally taken for their psychoactive
properties, such as antihistamines, which may have sedative side
effects in some individuals. </p>

<p> <i><b>Alcohol</b></i> </p>

<p> Alcohol is the one drug which has been studied extensively to
determine its effect on driving ability. Not surprisingly, the
data confirm popular opinion that its use is a major contributor
to accidents, especially fatal ones. The evidence consists
largely of postmortems of fatally injured drivers, conducted in a
multitude of locations , which consistently show that 60% of
these victims had more than a 0.05% blood/alcohol concentration
and that at least 30% of these drivers had more than a 0.15%
blood/alcohol concentration (Arthur D. Little, Inc. 1966; Midwest
Research Institute, 1972). Complete assessment of the role of
alcohol in accidents requires a controlled investigation
comparing the incidence of drinking by accident and non-accident
driving populations exposed to the same risks. Such studies are
not conclusive, but they do indicate that the incidence of
drinking in the non-accident group is far less, and among the
accident group, drinkers are more prevalent than nondrinkers. </p>

<p> Present data, though still inadequate, are sufficient to
suggest for purposes of policy making that drinking itself is a
contributory factor in a major fraction of all traffic accidents
and fatalities. In addition, several researchers have estimated
that heavy drinking may be a factor in perhaps one, quarter of
all automobile fatalities. Although infrequent heavy drinking and
chronic alcoholism naive not been sufficiently distinguished in
the, literature, one study does indicate that alcoholics, when
sober, do not appear to have an accident rate significantly
higher than average. These points could stand further
examination, but additional studies are quite unlikely to refute
the present evidence which implicates chronic drinking as a very
important factor in fatal automobile accidents (Arthur D. Little,
1966). </p>

<p> <b>Marihuana</b> </p>

<p> In our first Report on marihuana, we concluded that research
had not proven that use of this drug significantly impairs
driving ability or performance; we cautioned, however, that
driving under the influence of any potent psychoactive drug is a
serious risk to public safety and that acute effects of marihuana
intoxication, such as spatial and time distortion and slowed
reflexes, could be expected to impair driving performance. We
also urged further research in this area. </p>

<p> In the period between our first Report and the present one
several studies have been performed to determine whether or not
automobile driving performance may be adversely affected by use
of marihuana. Generally, the studies indicate that marihuana use,
even at dose levels normally consumed in social settings, does
impair to a significant degree visual perceptual performance as
well as temporally controlled responses (National Institute of
Mental Health, 1973). </p>

<p> In actual and simulated driving tests, poorer automobile
handling was found among subjects under the influence of
marihuana, including slowed reaction times and increased
frequency of incorrect or inadequate driver-responses (Dott,
1972, Kielholz, et a]., 1972. Miller, et al, 1972) </p>

<p> In experiments designed to study the effects of marihuana on
driving-related visual functions, it was found that marihuana
interfered with peripheral vision as well as central vision. This
deficit was interpreted as a result of momentary lapses of
attention during marihuana intoxication (Moskovitz, 1972). </p>

<p> <i><b>Other Psychoactive Substances</b></i> </p>

<p> In contrast to the vast literature on alcohol and the growing
marihuana research, very few studies have been conducted
regarding the relationship between use of other psychoactive
drugs and motor vehicle accidents. Virtually no research has
appeared on hallucinogens and cocaine, and the studies on
opiates, amphetamines, barbiturates and tranquilizers are quite
limited. </p>

<p> On the basis of pharmacologic effects, however, some
generalizations can be made. The information presented earlier in
this Chapter regarding the influence of psychoactive drugs on
perception and psychomotor function have important implications
for driving performance. The, amphetamines present a case in
point. Although the stimulant properties of amphetamines and
amphetamine-like drugs may appear to improve alertness and
endurance, a significant highway hazard is presented by the
extreme fatigue and mental depression which occur when the
effects of stimulant drugs have worn off and by the unpredictable
appearance of these, effects after extended use. </p>

<p> In sum, depending on dose, most psychoactive drugs are
capable of impairing driving performance. It can be predicted
that widespread use of any of these drugs would have a direct
impact on highway safety. </p>

<h2>IV -- IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE</h2>

<p> It has become increasingly common in recent years to
characterize drug use as a public health issue, as opposed to a
criminal justice. issue, or alternatively as a medical problem as
opposed to a legal problem. Before analyzing the impact of drug
use on the public health and welfare, this classification of drug
use as a public health problem must be clarified and placed in
proper perspective. </p>

<p> A public health problem is neither synonymous with medicine
nor antonymous with law. The distinguishing feature of the public
health approach is the recognition that prevention of a definable
physical or psychological condition is beyond the competence of
the traditional medical system. Lead poisoning, cigarette
smoking, and air pollution are public health problems precisely
because, their prevention requires social resources and legal
measures beyond the services of individual physicians. Public
health is essentially a socio-medical concept, and legal actions
are generally ail integral part of the public health response to
a problem, as is illustrated by enforced quarantine of Carriers
of communicable diseases, compulsory vaccination, prohibition of
use, of lead in house paint. and fluoridation of water.
Prevention of certain social conditions having ail impact on the
health and welfare of the population is the hallmark of a public
health approach .22 </p>

<p> 22 The oft-stated distinction between the
&quot;criminal&quot; and &quot;medical&quot; approaches refers
primarily to the individual drug user, rather than to the public
impact of drug-using behavior. Many of those who characterize
drug use as a &quot;medical problem&quot; would prefer that the
individual be left alone and be permitted to risk his own health
if he so chooses. On the other hand, those who insist that drug
use he viewed as a criminal justice problem are emphasizing
either that the person should be punished for his behavior or
that the criminal law is a necessary deterrent to drug use or
both. Persons insisting on criminal intervention may actually be
doing so on public health grounds on the theory that the criminal
law will contain drug use and minimize its potentially adverse
consequences on the public health and welfare.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE: A PREVENTIVE CONCEPT</b> </p>

<p> In the Commission's view, all public health problems share
two common features. First, the society is confronted with a
significant incidence of a disabling medical condition or a clear
potential for development of such a situation. For example, a few
unrelated cases of pneumonia do not constitute a public health
concern; only when a particular condition becomes or threatens to
become of consequence to the collective well-being does it become
a public health matter. Second, the prevention and control,
including perhaps even treatment of this condition is generally
beyond the capacity of the individual medical practitioner. These
two elements define the existence of a public health problem. The
contours of the public health response will be determined by the,
nature of any operating),' assumption with regard to the cause or
causes of the undesirable condition, or in the absence of such a
hypothesis, will be limited to research alone. </p>

<p> The classic illustration of a public health problem is the
communicable disease such as typhoid. Prevention (or
&quot;primary treatment&quot; in the lexicon of public health
officials) would include sewage systems, water purification,
regulations for dish and food handling and immunization
procedures. Strategies of control (&quot;secondary
treatment&quot;) would be instituted upon the appearance of a
single, case of typhoid, including isolation of the carriers and
other techniques for reducing the spread of the epidemic.
Obviously such measures are beyond the capacity of individual
physicians and require an integrated public response. 23 In this
situation the potential impact on the public, health and welfare
is substantial, the relationship between an individual carrier
and the undesirable social consequences is immediate and direct,
and the necessary preventive and control measures are apparent. </p>

<p> 23 Treatment (&quot;tertiary treatment&quot;) could be
performed by the physician, such as by administering antibiotics,
etc. </p>

<p> On the fringes of the public health concept are matters such
as disabling automobile accidents. Here we have situations where
there is a significant incidence of a disabling medical
condition, one which is predictable and proportionate to the
number of drivers. In addition, the condition can presumably be
prevented by eliminating automobiles or controlled by various
traffic safety regulations. Finally, the population at-risk is
definable and becomes larger as participants in this activity
communicate its advantages to others. Thus, analytically
speaking, automobile accidents are a public health concern. The
crucial question, of course, relates to the implications of so
classifying them, and the relevance of countervailing social
needs and values, such as the utility of individual
transportation and the personal conveniences of relatively
unencumbered driving. </p>

<p> This brings us to the important question. In what ways is it
useful to think of drug use as a public health problem? The
earlier discussions of drug dependence and drug-induced behavior
demonstrate that the adverse social impact of drug use arises
from the special capacity of psychoactive drugs to influence
behavior by direct action on the brain. The acute or chronic use
of any drug, whether or not it is psychoactive, carries risk for
the physical health of the user, depending on dose, frequency and
other variables; but this fact is not the one which defines the
special public health dimension of psychoactive drug use. The
major component of the public health concern with drugs is mental
health, broadly defined: the decrement in individual's social and
psychological functioning attending certain patterns of drug use.
Consequently, the public &quot;health&quot; aspect actually
encompasses the less tangible impact on the total welfare of the
individual and the community in terms of social and economic
functioning. In short, the public health and welfare issues
overlap, as do the consequences to the individual and the
society. </p>

<p> In terms of public health analysis, the use of psychoactive
drugs falls somewhere in between the prototypical communicable
diseases on the one hand and car accidents on the other. It is
possible to predict and measure in very gross terms incidence of
disabling physical and psychological conditions among a
population of drug users. It is also possible to predict under a
given set of social conditions that the population at-risk will
be increased as drug users introduce their friends and
acquaintances to this behavior. Finally, the harm to the social
organism accruing from compulsive drug use is clear and
substantial, its is apparent from the incidence and consequences
of chronic alcoholism. In this sense, then, the use, of
psychoactive drugs particularly in intensified or compulsive use
patterns, has an adverse impact on the public health and welfare,
and may legitimately be classified as a public health problem. </p>

<p> The next question is whether and in what ways the
institutional apparatus we call the public health system can be
brought to bear in order to prevent, control and minimize these
aspects of the problem. As preventive measures, legal
prohibitions or restrictions on availability may be viewed as
elements of a public health approach. Of course, the public
health considerations may be outweighed by advantages offered by
the specific drug, whether therapeutic, recreational or
sacramental, and by the impracticality of restricting
availability under certain social conditions, as in the case of
alcohol. As we pointed out in Chapter Two, legal restrictions on
distribution can only reduce availability, not eliminate it. </p>

<p> Given the availability of psychoactive drugs and the
inevitability of their use, the public health approach must be
oriented toward the amelioration of the, acute health hazards of
use and the prevention of intensified and compulsive use, those
patterns with direct impact on the public health and welfare. As
our earlier observations on drug dependence illustrate, these
behavior patterns are initiated and reinforced by interrelating
factors involving the effects of the drug, the characteristics of
the user and the nature of the environment. Consequently,
institutional efforts to prevent drug dependence are inseparable
from the emerging concept of &quot;total health&quot; which
embraces the individual and his relationship with his
environment. It is crucial to recognize in this connection that
all intensified or compulsive drug user almost always has other
problems as well: emotional, social, familial, medical and under
our present system, legal. For this reason, the requirements of a
public health and welfare strategy is the need and ability to
provide a wide range of services to the individuals and
communities at-risk. </p>

<p> Before dealing with the appropriate public health response to
drug use, more specificity as to the adverse impact of this
behavior on the public health and welfare is needed.
Unfortunately, however, this impact has not been measured with
any degree of precision. As we pointed out earlier, the incidence
of drug use which has been measured does not define the problem.
The threshold question is to determine the conditions upon which
the psychological and behavioral concomitants of drug use are of
consequence to the public health and welfare. </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">ASSESSING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE
IMPACT OF DRUG USE </font></b> </p>

<p> The, forms of drug dependence with which society is most
familiar are that of the chronic alcoholic or &quot;skid
row&quot; drunk and the street heroin-dependent person. Somewhat
less visible than these compulsive users, however, is an even
larger group of intensified alcohol users who can be classified
as marginal with respect to their social functioning and economic
capability. Further, a substantial number of drug dependent
individuals generally remain &quot;hidden&quot; from public
notice. The opiate-dependent physician, the barbiturate-dependent
housewife and the functional alcoholic, for example, all
presumably suffer from some impairment of functioning which might
be manifested in absenteeism, reduced performance level or
neglect of family responsibility. However, since no concrete
information is available on these matters and the social impact
is not easily ascertainable, our primary focus here will be upon
that more visible group of drug-dependent individuals (generally
on heroin or alcohol), who cannot maintain an adequate level of
economic, social and psychological functioning and who therefore
pose more, immediate consequences for the public health and
welfare. </p>

<p> A very substantial proportion of such individuals is drawn
from what might be called a pre-dependent or high-risk group;
that is, persons who have been raised in an atmosphere rife with
social and psychological pathology: poverty, illiteracy,
malnutrition, delinquency, violence. emotional deprivation,
mental illness and alcohol or other drug dependence. These
persons are especially at-risk because they frequently lack both
the inner strengths and the institutional supports necessary to
cope successfully with the problems of living in such an
environment. </p>

<p> Because the environment in which heroin-dependent persons
dwell is frequently and characteristically the same as that in
which they resided prior to becoming heroin dependent, it is not
surprising to find substantial proportions of these individuals
with histories of psychiatric disorders, delinquent and criminal
behavior which long preceded their heroin involvement. In such
cases, the same unhealthy conditions which existed in the past
are simply carried over into the present but are now exacerbated
by the additional problems concomitant with drug dependence. </p>

<p> The Commission has noted an absence of reliable data with
respect t the social and economic costs of alcohol dependence,
and data regarding heroin dependence are virtually nonexistent.
Further, available data in specific jurisdictions are generally
not maintained in a manner which permits comparison with the
experiences of other jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Therefore, the following information regarding the impact of
drug dependence on the public health and welfare will be drawn
principally from the research on alcoholism. </p>

<p> <b>The Population of Heavy Alcohol Users</b> </p>

<p> The problems associated with drinking and alcoholism have
been demonstrated by many researchers. In a national survey
conducted by Cahalan, et al., (1969), for example, 31% of the
sample indicated some problem with drinking within the last three
years. Forty percent of the men and 15% of the women claimed some
psychological dependence on alcohol while 12% of the men and 8%
of the women reportedly experienced some health problem
associated with drinking during the three years preceding the
survey. </p>

<p> The Cahalan, et al., 1969 survey of drinking practices found
that 28% of the male drinkers and 8% of the female drinkers were
heavy drinkers and that half of the heavy drinkers (6% of the
general population) were heavy-escape drinkers who drank
excessively in an effort to avoid social pressures and personal
problems. Although such heavy-escape drinkers included most of
those termed &quot;alcoholics,&quot; they may also include
excessive drinkers who have avoided much of the long-term
psychological and physical effects of alcoholism. </p>

<p> In any case, Cahalan, et al., (1969) found that most
important predictors of heavy drinking to be sex, age, city size
and social position. The proportion of male heavy drinkers, for
example, was found to be about three and one-half times higher
than the proportion of female heavy drinker (28% VS. 8%).24 Among
drinkers, the highest proportion of heavy drinkers (30%) are men
in the 30-34 and 45-49 year age groups; in women the highest
proportions (10%) are found in the 45-49 and 21-24 year age
groups. For both sexes the prevalence of heavy drinking declined
rapidly after age 50. Residents of large urban areas consistently
evidenced higher rates of heavy drinking than did residents of
smaller towns. </p>

<p> 24 The U.S. Department of Health. Education and Welfare found
in 1965 that at least five times as many men as women were
&quot;alcoholics.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>Economic Loss</b> </p>

<p> The available data indicate that most heroin-dependent
persons are males, under 26 years of age with a tenth-grade
education or less, whose age at first arrest for heroin use was
genet-ally between 16 and 19 years. To a great extent, the
heroin-dependent individual suffers the loss of his youth, his
most formative and important years for healthy growth and
development, which can never be regained or recouped. And the
community simultaneously suffers the loss of its most valuable
natural resource. </p>

<p> Because alcohol dependence develops gradually, economic
losses do not generally occur among younger populations, in
marked contrast to those associated with heroin use. However,
once alcohol dependence develops, its impact on economic
functioning is devastating. </p>

<p> Gillespie (1967) found that between 27 and 81% (median 52%)
of alcoholics are unemployed. Fifty-two percent of the
hospitalized alcoholics in Glatt's sample (1967) lost their jobs
because of drinking, while Robbins, et al. (1969) discovered that
56% of alcoholics had job difficulties directly attributable to
drinking. Among alcohol-dependent persons who remained employed,
the decrement in job performance is substantial. For example, the
American Society for Personnel Administration (1972) has
estimated that &quot;there are 4.4 million employed people in the
country who are alcoholics; 90% of them have been on the job
10-20 years; they're costing employers $8-10 billion per
year.&quot; </p>

<p> Although the precise amount of absenteeism, accidents and
economic losses attendant to alcohol use is difficult to assess,
its impact is clearly considerable. Zentner (1969) found that the
cost to industry primarily in<b> </b>absenteeism and inefficient
job performance among employed alcoholics is nearly $2 billion
per year. Trice (1965) found that alcoholics use two to five
times more sick time than non-alcoholics and receive three times
the, amount of disability payments. Trice and Roman (1972) note
that sickness payments for problem drinkers was three times
greater than those for the normal worker. </p>

<p> A review of the existing literature indicates that most
observers generally agree that drug and alcohol dependence
contribute to increased insurance rates, industrial accidents,
increased absenteeism, theft, problems of morale and discipline,
impaired job performance, security risks, retraining costs and
other associated problems. </p>

<p> <b>Death</b> </p>

<p> Death is a particularly finite measure of the social cost of
drug dependence. The correlation between unnatural or premature
death and drug dependence is an astounding one. Because the data
regarding alcohol-related death is national in scope and
reliable, while that regarding other drugs is regional and
sketchy, we will have to present this information separately. It
does appear in<b> </b>general, however, that drug-dependent
persons and heavy non-dependent users are more likely than the
rest of the population to die by their own hand, either
intentionally or accidentally , or by the hand of others. </p>

<p> <i><b><font size="2">Alcohol</font></b></i> </p>

<p> Robbins, et al. (1959) reported that 26% of suicide victims
were reported to be chronic alcoholics. On the basis of a study
made one year later, 31% of the suicides were found to be
alcoholics (Palola, et al., 1962). The suicide rate for
hospitalized male alcoholics was reported by Kessel and Walton
(1965) to be 86 times the rate expected for the general
population; and 75% of the suicide victims studied by Murphy and
Robins (1967) were found to suffer from either alcoholism or
depression. </p>

<p> In addition to suicide, the excessive drinker of alcohol
risks death and injury in various other ways. Alcoholics are 2.5
to 3 times as likely to die during any given time period as the,
general population (Tashiro and Lipscomb, 1963; Brenner, 1967).
The most frequent causes of death are violence 24% (9% in general
population), heart disease 23% (40% in general population), and
cirrhosis of the liver 14% (3% in general population). Alcoholics
are seven times as likely to die in fatal accidents as
non-alcoholics (Tashiro and Lipscomb, 1963). </p>

<p> Waller (1968) found that 71% of persons who died of
accidental poisoning had a blood alcohol content of .10% or
higher. The same was true of 58% of those killed by fire and 46%
of those who drowned. In contrast, only 7% of the victims of
death by natural causes had significant levels of blood alcohol. </p>

<p> Accidents in the home, on the job or on the road show very
few factors in common other than human carelessness. It is
striking, therefore, to note how closely alcohol use is
correlated with accidental injury. By subjecting non-fatal
accident victims to the breathalyzer test, Wechsler et al.,
(1969) found that 22% of home accident victims, 30% of
transportation accident victims, and 15.5% of those<font size="1">
</font>with occupational injuries had positive blood alcohol
readings. Victims of fights or assaults showed significantly
higher alcohol involvement, with 56% showing positive blood
alcohol readings. </p>

<p> <font size="2">As we noted earlier in this chapter, a drinker
is less likely to survive than a non-drinker even when both are
involved in the same two vehicle automobile accident. In a study
of such crashes in<b> </b>which one driver survived, it was the
non-drinking driver who survived in 59 of 67 cases (U.S.
Department of Transportation, 1970b).</font> </p>

<p> The Commission's review of presently available data indicates
that property damage, insurance costs and medical services
consequent to alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents ran to $1
billion in 1971 (National Clearinghouse for Alcohol Information,
1972). A review of highway fatalities since 1966 shows that each
year approximately one-half are related to accidents involving
alcohol. From a public welfare standpoint, the impact is
considerable when one considers the lost earning power of those
injured or killed, the social security payments to dependents of
the deceased as well as public assistance and aid to dependent
children-expenditures which must be maintained as the result of
such accidents. </p>

<p> These data demonstrate, that the excessive drinker is subject
to significantly greater physical and social stress leading to
higher injury and fatality rates than the general population. The
greater vulnerability appears to be due to the general stress
involved in the alcoholic's living conditions, the presence of an
inadequate diet, the diseases connected with alcohol consumption
itself, and the increased (Chance of death after injury with
large quantities of alcohol in the blood (Brenner, 1967). </p>

<p> <i><b>Heroin</b></i> </p>

<p> National data concerning the incidence of heroin-related
death do not exist. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in
New York City, however, maintains what are undoubtedly the best
statistics on heroin-related morbidity and mortality. In 1968, he
estimated that bacterial endocarditis caused about 2% of the
deaths among heroin dependent persons in New York City, a figure
which represented about one-third of all deaths from endocarditis
in that city. In that same year it was noted that more than
one-half of the patients admitted to Bellevue Hospital for
hepatitis were heroin-dependent persons who injected the drug
intravenously (Baden, 1970). </p>

<p> In 1972, heroin-related deaths in New York City rose slightly
in comparison with the previous year (916 in 1971 to 924 in
1972). These, statistics account for deaths due to acute heroin
reaction and overdose, and deaths from hepatitis, endocarditis
and other infections. lf we add to these data other
heroin-related deaths such as homicides, suicides and fatal
accidents, the total figure for 1972 climbs to 1,409 as compared
with the composite 1971 figure of 1,268. New York City reported
324 opiate-dependent persons were homicide victims in 1972, as
compared with 208 in 1971 (Markham, 197 3). </p>

<p> Far too little is known at the present time about the
syndrome of acute fatal reaction following the intravenous
injection of heroin. Acute reaction which constitutes the major
cause of death among heroin users is commonly referred to as
&quot;overdose.&quot; Baden points out that this is an inaccurate
judgment and states that: </p>

<p> A pharmacologic overdose can sometimes be demonstrated, but
the precise mechanism of death is not clear in most cases. There
are probably many mechanisms for death, which may include an
allergic type reaction to heroin, quinine, or other dilutents; a
reaction to injected bacteria or other foreign materials; or a
true pharmacologic overdose of heroin or quinine or other drugs
(Baden, 1972a: 837). </p>

<p> Presently available data point to the fact that in<b> </b>New
York City, the heroin-related deaths account for the largest
proportion of deaths of persons between the ages of 15 and 35
years. In<b> </b>1960, New York City reported 199 opiate deaths.
This figure rose almost five times by 1972 when 924 deaths were
attributable to opiate drugs. Further, during the decade of the
1960's, as the number of deaths from opiates significantly
increased, the median age of such deaths decreased from 31 years
in 1960 to 23 years in 1972. As Baden (1972b) points out: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[There has been a] change in pattern of drugs abused from
    heroin alone to multiple drugs, most recently methadone; more<b>
    </b>than 30% of narcotic deaths in New York City this year
    [1972] have been associated with methadone use, licit and
    illicit. The majority of younger addicts now have other drugs
    in their tissues at autopsy in addition to heroin: alcohol,
    methadone, barbiturates, and others hypnotics, amphetamines,
    tranquilizers, analgesics, etc. (P. 1). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <i><b>Barbiturates</b></i> </p>

<p> Barbiturates appear to be related to death in two ways:
consumption of lethal doses is a common means by which persons
commit suicide; and their combined effects with alcohol sometimes
result in death even in cases where suicide is not apparent. It
has been estimated that 400 barbiturate-induced suicides occur
each year in New York City alone (Baden, 1972c). NIMH (1968)
indicates that there were 1,602 suicides involving barbiturates
nationwide in 1968. </p>

<p> Many accidental deaths involving barbiturates appear to
involve alcohol. For example, a report prepared for the
Commission by the Assistant Medical Examiner of Dade County,
Florida, indicates that 151 persons died from barbiturate-related
causes during 1970 and 1971, 133 of which were classified as
suicides on<b> </b>the basis of other factors. Of the 132 cases
tested for the presence of alcohol, 35% were positive, and 40% of
the accidental overdoses had blood alcohol levels of 0.05% or
more as compared with 23% of the suicides (Blackbourne, 1972). </p>

<p> <b>Medical Complications of Chronic Drug Use</b> </p>

<p> Disease which is related either to the life style of the drug
user or to the method by which be administered the drug is
especially common among skid row alcoholics and heroin-dependent
persons. In these populations susceptibility to various ailments
is significantly increased by virtue of life style; these
individuals commonly live in rather poor circumstances under
frequently unsanitary conditions. Consequent to their general
inability to maintain proper nutrition and health habits, these
persons frequently contract tuberculosis and other communicable
diseases or illnesses .25 </p>

<p> 25 A substantial public health concern in this regard is the
transmission of disease, especially hepatitis, through medically
required blood transfusion. It has been a longstanding and common
practice for hospitals to purchase whole blood from proprietary
blood banks because voluntary sources, especially Red
Cross-sponsored programs, are frequently unable to provide it in
sufficient amounts. It has likewise been a common practice for
persons who are drug dependent (especially heroin and
alcohol-dependent persons) to sell their blood. Cohen and
Dougherty (1968) found that the risk of contracting hepatitis
from transfusion of blood from a proprietary blood bank was six
times greater than from a bank where blood was given free. They
discovered as well that the chance of contracting hepatitis from
blood donated by known or suspected heroin dependent persons was
70 times greater than that of non-parenteral drug users. </p>

<p> In addition to diseases which may be related to life style, a
number of prevalent conditions or diseases are immediately
related to the method by which a drug is administered. Among
persons who are parenteral drug users, the use of unsterile
needles and contaminated drug solutions contributes to a serious
disease problem. Hepatitis, infectious endocarditis and tetanus
are particularly common among heroin users. </p>

<p> In New York City, tetanus is almost exclusively found among
heroin users. The Deputy Chief Medical Examiner of New York City
estimates that between 10 and 20% of deaths among
heroin-dependent persons are due directly to medical
complications, particularly hepatitis, infective endocarditis and
returns. Heart damage related to endocarditis is not uncommon
among persons engaged in parenteral drug use. Baden estimates
that 80% of the infective endocarditis cases are bacterial and
involve the aortic and mitral valves (Baden, 1972b). Similar
patterns of disease have been noted among persons who inject
&quot;speed&quot; or barbiturates (Canadian Commission . . .,
1972). </p>

<p> Disease and other medical complications associated with
alcohol use, are both common and serious. The incidence of heart
disease and cirrhosis of the liver is disproportionately high
among alcohol users (Tashiro and Lipscomb, 1963). Statistics from
New York City also point to the association of tuberculosis with
both alcohol and heroin dependence. It is estimated that 10% of
those admitted to the Chest Service at Bellevue Hospital are
heroin-dependent persons suffering from tuberculosis; 30-40% are
chronic alcoholics also afflicted with tuberculosis. </p>

<p> Cahalan, et al. (1969) found that 12% of all male drinkers
and 8% of all female drinkers experience health problems related
to alcohol use. Other researchers have noted that if a
21-year-old male in good physical health starts drinking, he has
a .9% chance of deeveloping gastritis, a 1% chance of developing
Laennec's cirrhosis, a 0.02% chance of developing primary liver
cell carcinoma, and a 0.01% chance of developing delirium tremens
(Malzberg, 1960; Sundby, 1967; Victor and Adams, 1970; Brunt,
1971; Goodman and Gilman, 1971). </p>

<p> It should be noted that contrary to popular belief,
alcoholism is rather common among heroin-dependent persons. A
1968 report emanating from the Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner in<b> </b>New York City indicates that at least 20% of
the heroin-dependent population. demonstrate heavy drinking
problems, and many show fatty livers and alcoholic-type cirrhosis
at autopsy (Baden, 1970). </p>

<p> <b>Impact on the Family Structure</b> </p>

<p> The family unit is particularly susceptible to the impact of
drug dependence; it not only reflects but magnifies the effects
of crime, suicide, accidents, economic problems, illness and
death. The influence of excessive drinking is deleterious to all
aspects of family life and often reduces the ability of family
members to function within them accepted limits of our society. </p>

<p> The alcoholic marriage is generally unstable and disturbed.
Chafetz, et al. (1971) found marital instability in 41% of the
families of alcoholics. Intense conflict appeared in 60% of
alcoholic homes (27% of the homes of non-drinkers) in a study by
McCord and McCord (1960). The Robins (1966) study revealed that
55% of previously married alcoholics bad been divorced.
Separations or divorces were found in 60% of the alcoholics'
family units by Lemert (1960). In<b> </b>fact, the higher the
degree of alcoholic involvement, the lower the likelihood of an
intact marriage (U.S. Department of Transportation, 1970a). In a
review of 22 studies conducted between 1944 and 1965, for
example, Gillespie (1967) found that 18-55% (median 32%) of
alcoholics are divorced or separated. Pittman and Gordon (1967)
noted that among their sample of chronic drinkers, 19% were
divorced and 32% were separated. </p>

<p> The effect on<b> </b>children of alcoholic parents has been
especially remarkable; between 22% and 55% of the children of
alcoholics have been reported to become alcoholics themselves
(Ellerman, 1948; Prout, et al., 1950; Selzer and<b> </b>Holloway,
1957; McCord and McCord, 1960; Moore and Ramseur, 1960; Block,
1964; Bailey, et al., 1965). </p>

<p> Goodwin, et al. (1971) reported that 67% of male felons
studied were alcoholics or problem drinkers. Studies of the
backgrounds of alcoholic criminals seem to indicate not only that
their family history and experiences are related to alcoholism
itself, but that a significantly high incidence of violence is
part of their home environment. Social deviance found in the
family may well be learned and passed on by parents to their
children, so that a pattern of deviance develops. </p>

<p> Of all the social institutions, the family is perhaps the
most crucially affected by drug dependence. </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">Compensatory Social <b>Costs</b></font></b>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Commission has found that very few
jurisdictions maintain any data on public assistance payments to
drug-dependent persons. However, it has been estimated that
one-third of all persons receiving welfare payments use alcohol
excessively (Rubington, 1969). Regarding heroin dependence, data
obtained from the City and State of New York in<b> </b>early 1973
indicate that there are about 30,000 heroin dependent persons
receiving public assistance in the State of New York.
Twenty-seven thousand of these are in New York City. Heroin
dependent persons thus comprise 1.5% of the total public welfare
caseload of New York State, estimated at 1.8 million persons. In<b>
</b>New York City, these persons comprise 2.1% of the public
welfare rolls in a total caseload of 1.2 million.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Of course these data represent only the tip of
the iceberg. Social support for the families of compulsive drug
users runs into hundreds of millions of dollars, and the massive
investment in treatment and rehabilitation services constitutes a
major social cost of drug dependence. The federal and state
governments spend approximately $380 million annually in<b> </b>connection
with alcohol treatment and yearly expenditures for
&quot;drug&quot; treatment have now reached $650 million. To
these costs should be added the $100 million annually spent
processing chronic alcoholics through the criminal justice system
(President's Commission, Task Force on Drunkenness, 1967) as well
as the $475 million devoted to processing heroin-dependent
persons (McGlothlin, 1972).</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">FRAMING A PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The psychosocial, medical and economic
problems produced by and associated with drug dependence are
substantial. Whether the drug dependence is of the
&quot;hidden&quot;' variety in which the individual is
functional, albeit at a reduced level, or is totally
incapacitating and visible, it is a costly proposition for the
public health and welfare. Individuals who are socially
incapacitated as a consequence of alcohol, heroin, or other drug
use deprive the community of their participation and constitute a
drain on public resources. Unfortunately, they often appear
immune to many of the traditional methods of intervention, most
of which are directed at the symptoms rather than the causes of
dependence.</font> </p>

<p> The Commission has observed that in order to deal effectively
with this kind of drug dependence, reliable and valid information
about the epidemiology of that condition is essential. At
present, however, few reliable or valid data exist in this area.
We simply do not know the number of persons who can be
characterized as either pre-dependent individuals especially
vulnerable to full-scale dependence, or even the number who are,
already incapacitated by drug dependence. </p>

<p> Consequently, most of the &quot;public health&quot; response
to drug dependence, whether labeled &quot;control,&quot;
&quot;prevention,&quot; &quot;treatment&quot; or
&quot;rehabilitation,&quot; has occurred after the fact.
Imperfect knowledge has been one reason for society's failure to
&quot;rehearse&quot; the problem and formulate an effective
preventive strategy. But, there is another reason for this
failure: the inadequacy of the public health structure itself. </p>

<p> In this nation's pluralistic medical and human services
system, the functions of health and social service agencies are
largely undefined and overlapping. The fact that a particular
situation has been defined as a public health problem does not
assure that all of these resources will be harnessed in a
coordinated way to deal with the problem; instead it is entirely
likely that a series of initial <i>ad hoc </i>responses will be
followed by attempts on the part of each of the diverse
components of the system to define its own role independently of
the others. This is precisely the situation that now
characterizes the &quot;public health response&quot; to the
problem of drug use. </p>

<p> In this as in other public, health areas, a multitude of
public and private service agencies are involved: family and
child-care agencies, welfare organizations, business resources,
law enforcement agencies, the medical profession, community
mental health centers, the schools, social service agencies and
so on. There is no cohesive response as each institution deals
with a. small component of the total problem. Confusion of
funding, lack of training, inadequate accessibility of services
and insufficient assignment of priorities now characterize this
society's response to many public health problems ranging from
nutrition to drug dependence .26 </p>

<p> At the present time, a &quot;public health approach&quot; is
more a way of looking at a problem than of dealing with it.
Consequently, to state that drug use is a public health and
welfare problem is only to confirm the actual and potential
impact of certain drug-using behaviors on the public health and
welfare. Beyond this point, the determination of the appropriate
public health strategy is plagued by the amorphous character of
this nation's public health system, if in fact we have a
definable &quot;system&quot;, and uncertainty about, the utility
of different responses to the problem. </p>

<p> The Commission notes that the community mental health system
is designed to overcome these problems although administrative
and financial obstacles have continued to inhibit its
development. </p>

<p> We would suggest that an appropriate strategy for preventing
the adverse public health and welfare consequences of drug use
can be formulated only after the following questions are
answered. What, as a practical matter, can be, done in order to
prevent medical complications from drug use, to prevent chronic
use in general and to restore the health and social functioning
of those who have engaged in such use? Which of the components of
the public health and welfare system can perform those functions
which are achievable? In what ways should the various public
health and welfare resources be structured for delivery to the
client populations? Finally, if the existing resources are
insufficient, how should they be allocated and what new health
and welfare services should be developed? </p>

<p> In the next chapter we will address specifically three
particular elements of the public health response; prevention,
treatment and rehabilitation and emergency intervention. As a
prelude to these discussions, however, we think it important to
outline some general principles for formulating these strategies.
</p>

<p> First, the response to drug use must be part of the general
sociomedical strategy, focusing on the total person as a part of
the total environment, including the interrelationship between
family members, peers and other community influences on social
integration and mental health. </p>

<p> Second, the community-based response apparatus must be geared
to early detection of problems, and must have the capacity to
deal with them at all stages, primary through chronic. By
focusing on acute problems, early intervention techniques and
ongoing care, many drug related problems can be prevented among
the individuals being &quot;treated,&quot; and, most importantly,
among those influenced by them. For example, early concern about
the, families of those who are alcohol or heroin dependent might
be the most effective strategy for minimizing the incidence of
dependence among offspring. </p>

<p> Third, within this overall framework, services must be
geographically and economically accessible to target populations,
who must be aware of their existence. These services must be
adequate in terms of the training and experience of all
professional and paraprofessional personnel '27 and in terms of
facilities and equipment. Finally, the, services must be
coordinated in<b> </b>terms of lines of communication, authority
and responsibility. </p>

<p> 27 In this connection, the Commission notes with favor the
development of regional training and resource centers dealing
explicitly with community-oriented skills and services. These
centers will he discussed in<b> </b>the following Chapter.<br>

<h1>The Facts About Drug Abuse </h1>

<p> <b>The Drug Abuse Council, 1980</b> </p>

<p> <font size="5">Foreword</font> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> IN 1970, at the peak of the drug scare, the trustees of the
Ford Foundation decided that piecemeal measures were not enough.
As a first step in a major program the Foundation asked Patricia
M. Wald, now a United States Circuit judge in the District of
Columbia, and Peter B. Hutt, a Washington lawyer, to undertake a
survey in depth of drug abuse and to suggest what private
foundations might contribute to understanding, if not solution,
of the problem. In their report to the Foundation published in
1972 -Dealing with Drug Abuse-judge Wald and Mr. Hutt said: </p>

<p> It is of fundamental importance that man has and will
inevitably continue to have potentially dangerous drugs at his
disposal, which he may either use properly or abuse, and that
neither the availability of these drugs nor the temptation to
abuse them can be eliminated. Therefore, the fundamental
objective of a modern drug-abuse program must be to help the
public learn to understand these drugs and how to cope with their
use in the context of everyday life. An approach emphasizing
suppression of all drugs or repression of all drug users will
only contribute to national problems. </p>

<p> There is an urgent need for effective nongovernmental
leadership toward a more reasoned approach to drug abuse in this
country. A void exists that we believe can be filled by the
creation of a new Drug Abuse Council. In our best judgment, the
Council could successfully exert this leadership and could have a
substantial and beneficial impact on drug abuse in this country.<br>
</p>

<p> According to McGeorge Bundy, then President of the Ford
Foundation, <br>
</p>

<p> The second important step was to join with three other
foundations that have shared our concern with drug abuse-the
Carnegie Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation-in financing one of the principal
recommendations of the report, namely, the establishment of an
independent national Drug Abuse Council.<br>
</p>

<p> (The Equitable Life Assurance Society joined the foundations
in contributing to the expenses of the Council.) </p>

<p> The Council was organized in January 1972, but only after it
had been determined that a widely representative board of
directors and a highly competent staff could be assembled for
about five years of active service. The last formal meeting of
the board was held in June 1978, and since then the President of
the Council, Dr. Thomas E. Bryant, and the staff have been
engaged in the preparation of this Final Report. </p>

<p> The Report demonstrates that widespread misuse or abuse of
dangerous drugs-not just heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, but
alcohol and caffeine, and a great variety of stimulants and
tranquilizers, some prescribed, some sold over the counter-is not
an evil that can be extirpated by legislation or other means. Yet
it is believed that an informed society, aware of the
complexities of the issues and evidence, will be better able to
cope constructively with the use of drugs. This belief underlies
this Final Report. </p>

<p> It is not the function of a foreword to anticipate the
findings and conclusions of a massive study. It would, however,
be gross neglect not to acknowledge in this foreword the
exceptional contributions of the directors, the officers and
staff and consultants of the Council, and the foundations and
many others who have enabled the Council to apply knowledge and
reason to the understanding and treatment of a major national
problem. These include: </p>

<p> Judge Wald and Mr. Hutt, the Co-chairmen, and James V.
DeLong, the extraordinarily able Executive Director of the Ford
Foundation survey staff, who produced <i>Dealing with Drug </i>Abuse-the
seminal study that led to the creation of the Council. </p>

<p> The directors of the Council for regular attendance at
meetings, for the information and wisdom and wit that enriched
the deliberations of the board, and especially Dr. Bryant for the
personal and professional qualities that underpinned his
indispensable leadership. </p>

<p> And, of course, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie
Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation, and the Equitable Life Assurance Society, for the
financial support essential to a major private enterprise. </p>

<p> And the Council here records special gratitude to the senior
officers and responsible staff of the Ford Foundation for six
years of unfailing interest and support.<br>

was appointed to the drug use/misuse task panel of the
President's Commission on Mental Health.<br>

<h1>The Facts About Drug Abuse </h1>

<p> <b>The Drug Abuse Council, 1980</b> </p>

<p> <font size="5">Final Report Of The Drug Abuse Council</font> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> IN 1972 <i>Dealing with Drug Abuse: A Report to the Ford
Foundation </i>concluded that the national drug policies at that
time were not effective and were not likely to eliminate or even
greatly affect &quot;drug abuse.&quot; That report, describing
the complex nature of psychoactive drug use and misuse,
identified flaws in programs and laws which had been designed to
reduce the harm to individuals and society of the indiscriminate,
nonmedical use of psychoactive drugs. Public policy was found to
be unrealistic and unresponsive to cultural, social,
psychological, and economic factors underlying the widespread use
of drugs. </p>

<p> The report to the Ford Foundation was issued at the end of a
decade of increasing drug use and increasing concern about such
use. Drugs seemed to be everywhere; a generation of young
Americans had been urged to &quot;turn on, tune in, and drop
out&quot; with a wide variety of mood-altering drugs. The United
States was described as a nation of &quot;pill poppers. &quot;
Deeply held public fears were heightened as city after city
reported heroin addiction of epidemic proportions. From suburban
neighborhoods, long considered secure and stable, came reports of
heroin experimentation by high school students from middle- and
upper-income families. Thousands of American soldiers in Vietnam
were said to be addicted to heroin. New words and
phrases-&quot;pot,&quot; &quot;downers,&quot; &quot;uppers,&quot;
drug &quot;trips&quot;-became part of the popular vocabulary. </p>

<p> In 1972 it was estimated that between three- and six-hundred
thousand Americans-the vast majority of whom were said to be
inner-city blacks and Hispanics-were addicted to heroin. Nearly
25 million Americans were reported to have tried marijuana and 10
million were said to use it regularly. Millions of others
regularly used stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and
tranquilizers for non-medical purposes. However, alcohol and
nicotine continued to be the most widely used and misused drugs
illicit drugs-marijuana, heroin, and cocaine in particular-were
singled out for attention, yet the misuse of legally available
drugs was often ignored. While various methods or approaches for
&quot;solving the drug problem&quot; were presented, confusion
prevailed. Drug issues, particularly that of the relationship
between drug use and crime, were constantly publicized and
politicized. Many Americans thought the increase in street crime
during the late 1960s resulted largely from illicit drug use and
therefore responded enthusiastically to calls for a war on drugs
to keep illicit drugs and their users apart. Heroin was labelled
&quot;Public Enemy Number One.&quot; New &quot;get tough&quot;
laws were proposed, and many were enacted. Hundreds of millions
of dollars were appropriated for programs to stiffen law
enforcement, improve public education, and expand treatment
efforts. </p>

<p> At the height of public concern in 1972, <i>Dealing with </i>Drug
Abuse urged caution and restraint. It called for a climate of
reason which would permit identification of the real risks of
drug misuse and rejection of policies and programs based on
misinformation and sensationalism. It pointed out that drug use
and drug problems were not new but have persisted throughout
history, not only in the United States but in many other
countries, cultures, and societies as well. It noted that
knowledge about the causes of drug misuse was inadequate, as was
knowledge about its -grevention and treatment. Moreover, the
report revealed much of what was then accepted as fact to be
erroneous, out of date, or misleading. </p>

<p> The authors of <i>Dealing with Drug Abuse, </i>the sponsoring
private organizations which funded the Drug Abuse Council, and,
subsequently, the council's board of directors perceived a
pressing need for independent analyses of public drug policies
and programs. They felt that lawmakers and public officials,
particularly in the federal government, were reacting to
drug-related problems from a limited, crisis-oriented perspective
when a longer-range view was necessary, and that the
effectiveness of law enforcement and treatment strategies was
often overstated by public officials, which led to unrealistic
expectations of rapid and sweeping solutions. Thus these
individuals and groups agreed to sponsor an independent
organization capable of providing the public with a less
emotional, more apolitical perspective. As a result the Drug
Abuse Council was established in early 1972. </p>

<p> As of this writing, the Drug Abuse Council has been in
existence for nearly seven years. During this time the council
has, through staff-directed projects, research grants, and
contracts, assessed many aspects of the use and misuse of
psychoactive drugs.2 This work has been undertaken with the
unhampered view and resources of a national, independent,
nonprofit, nongovernmental organization. </p>

<p> The council has had resources sufficient to examine
drug-related issues in depth and over time. It began by analyzing
the assumptions underlying public perceptions and policies. It
examined the accepted knowledge of the interaction of chemical
substances with the human body and mind. It studied various
aspects of contemporary society to identify socioeconomic and
cultural factors relating to drug use and misuse. The council has
reviewed and assessed laws, programs, and projects-federal,
state, and local; governmental and private-which have been
adopted in response to psychoactive drug use and misuse. </p>

<p> In pursuit of its efforts to learn more about drug use and
misuse, the council gathered information from public officials,
scientists, historians, and law enforcement and treatment program
personnel. It canvassed widely and deeply the experiences and
views of current and former drug users, of minority groups and
individuals, and of other informed or concerned persons. </p>

<p> The council has periodically published its findings on many
aspects of drugs and has sought to bring about changes in
policies and programs it considers unsound. Through these
activities, it has sought to provide leadership in the private
sector. </p>

<p> When operations began in 1972, a five-year period of activity
was planned. In the fifth year, the board of directors decided to
continue some of the council's functions for an additional two
years. Now, as this seven year period comes to an end, we feel a
responsibility to share our major observations, findings, and
suggestions for the future in the form of a final report. </p>

<p> This final report consists of two major sections: first, the
report of the directors of the Drug Abuse Council; and second,
six chapters on various drug policy topics prepared by the
council's staff and consultants. While not every judgment or
suggestion advanced in these staff report chapters is
specifically endorsed by the council's board of directors, they
do form the analytic base from which the board drew its
observations, conclusions, and recommendations. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Report of the Directors</b> </p>

<p> As this report developed, it became increasingly clear that
the most valuable document we could provide would be one
addressed to the concerned citizen, not just to the professional
in the drug field. We stepped back from the day-to-day concerns
of those who work in research, treatment, prevention, and law
enforcement to begin to address the broader philosophical,
social, moral, legal, and pragmatic issues influencing national
drug policies and the expenditure of public funds. Thus readers
of this report will find few recommendations about the
particulars of program efforts in treatment, prevention, or
enforcement. We do not mean by this to suggest that there are no
improvements that can be made in program operations; there are in
fact many. We have, however, chosen to focus our discussion
instead on the public policies and attitudes from which these
program efforts stem. We believe that substantial benefits can
come only as a result of a significant rethinking of our approach
to drugs, not from tinkering with the mechanisms of our public
program response. </p>

<p> This report is a conscious effort to stimulate public
interest in drug policy issues and to promote greater public
understanding of them. By indicating the costs and benefits of
past and present efforts, we can begin to formulate and accept
principles with which more reasonable and effective alternative
approaches to drug misuse can be constructed. We have no
blueprint for a step-by-step solution to the nation's -problems
with drugs; in our opinion it would be a mistake for anyone to
think such a plan could be devised, given present knowledge. It
would, however, be equally erroneous to think that nothing can be
done to improve the current situation. </p>

<p> Since the creation of the Drug Abuse Council in 1972, what is
often termed &quot;the American drug scene&quot; has changed in
several ways. As a general observation, more Americans appear to
be using more psychoactive substances. Drug use and misuse have
become among the most compelling realities of contemporary
existence. Among legally available drugs, alcohol has increased
in the number of its users, particularly among younger people.
Among illicit drugs, marijuana has steadily increased in use, as
has cocaine more recently. Although recent research has provided
evidence of substantial numbers of occasional, nonaddicted heroin
users, federal officials report that heroin addiction has
declined over the past two to three years. </p>

<p> Greater changes can be observed in the nation's response to
drug use and misuse in terms of changes in laws and publicly
supported programs. In some respects, the situation has improved.
Given the magnitude of federal expenditures on drug treatment
programs and law enforcement efforts-estimated to be nearly $6
billion since 1971-some improvements should be demonstrable. For
example, the passage of the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act
of 1972 has led to the creation of a nationwide network of drug
treatment programs, chiefly for heroin dependence. As a result,
treatment for those dependent on heroin is now more readily
available. The federal National Institute on Drug Abuse reports
that between 1971 and 1978 hundreds of thousands of individuals
have received treatment in about two thousand federally funded
clinics throughout the country. However, many more have not
voluntarily sought treatment. </p>

<p> Another area of improvement over the past few years is in
basic research, work which has broadened understanding of the
addictive process and the biochemistry of the brain and central
nervous system. More questions remain unanswered than have been
answered, but recent progress is encouraging. </p>

<p> Perhaps the most significant change may be the decline in the
emotional fervor that once dominated public discussion of drugs.
Public concern is still intense; nonetheless, there is wider
public acknowledgment that simple, quick solutions to our drug
problems will not be forthcoming. As a result, public
expectations are more moderated development that may encourage
more realistic law enforcement and control objectives. </p>

<p> While we consider these to be changes for the better, the
basic situation remains: Despite progress in a number of areas,
more Americans use and misuse more psychoactive drugs than ever.
Since in our considered judgment this situation will prevail at
least through the next few years, it is necessary for us as a
nation to plan carefully and thoughtfully how to handle it most
responsibly. This planning requires a basic rethinking of
national goals, policies, and strategies regarding the use and
misuse of psychoactive drugs. The underlying social dynamics and
problems that lead to drug misuse are so exceedingly complex as
to as yet elude totally satisfactory solutions; the rational
course, then, is to begin with what has been learned from
history, particularly from the experience of the past several
years. </p>

<p> The council has several general observations that we regard
as of central importance to this process of rethinking, but
before submitting them, we emphasize again that we have no
step-by-step blueprint for solving the nation's drug problems. We
can, however, indicate where past experience and current analysis
should direct us, and we can begin to strive toward more
consistent, coherent, and responsible approaches to drug use and
misuse in the future. The following observations are, in our
view, central to this process. </p>

<p> 1. Psychoactive substances have been available for use since
the beginning of recorded time and will predictably remain so.
Man will undoubtedly continue to use such substances for a
variety of reasons: to relax, to escape, to enjoy, to worship, to
delude, to destroy. At given times in history certain drugs have
had greater appeal or easier availability and have consequently
been used more widely, but the essential point is that <i>some
psychoactive drugs are almost always readily available </i>to
enable people to achieve what they wish or need for alteration of
mood or mind. As we search for more effective policies and
programs, this certainty of drug availability should be at the
forefront of our thinking. </p>

<p> 2. <i>While the use of psychoactive drugs is pervasive,
misuse is </i>much <i>less frequent. </i>A failure to distinguish
between the misuse and the use of drugs creates the impression
that all use is misuse or &quot;drug abuse.&quot; This is
particularly true in the case of illicit drugs. For example,
while millions of Americans of high-school and college age have
experimented with various drugs and many use some of them
regularly, clearly the majority exercises personal restraint or
obeys social controls in drug-taking behavior. To state this in
another way, the number of young Americans who are in serious
personal difficulty because of the misuse of drugs is relatively
small. However, the frequent depiction of the minority who do
misuse drugs, especially illicit ones, as typical conveys the
mistaken impression that misuse is pervasive if not inevitable. </p>

<p> 3. While not enough is known about why certain individuals
misuse drugs, it is known that <i>there is a definite correlation
between pervasive societal ills-such as </i>poverty,
unemployment, and <i>racial </i>discrimination-and drug misuse.
When such conditions predominate-as they do in the inner-city
areas of many large American cities-the manifestations of
widespread drug misuse and trafficking in illicit drugs can be
seen in their most pernicious forms. So long as these adverse
social conditions persist, -widespread -drug misuse <b>care </b>be,
expected. Drug misuse resulting from such societal conditions
aggravates other urban problems, and makes restoring the vitality
of our inner cities more difficult to achieve. </p>

<p> 4. Attempts <i>to control </i>the availability <i>of drugs
often present a conflict between the desires of </i>individuals
and <i>the aspirations of society. </i>When harm to both the
individual and society is clearly demonstrable, the conflict may
be resolved. When harm to either is less clearly demonstrable, it
is less easily resolved. This may lead to dissension of
considerable magnitude, involving sensitive questions of
individual rights and the limits of governmental powers. To state
it plainly, the price of an effective strategy for eliminating
drug misuse would be perceived by many Americans as too high in
terms of the invasion of privacy and the abrogation of individual
freedoms. National drug policies must reflect careful balancing
of these concerns in order to enjoy substantial public support. </p>

<p> 5. Drug-related laws and policies center too often on the
drugs themselves and not often enough on the problems of the
people misusing them. This leads to <i>preoccupation with and
elaboration of the adverse aspects of certain drugs, </i>as if
they themselves were somehow culpable. Such thinking can
reinforce a focus on eliminating or legalizing the availability
of certain drugs as &quot;solutions&quot; to related problems.
Drug policies should instead be primarily focused on people and
their problems. </p>

<p> 6. Too many Americans have <i>unrealistic expectations about
what </i>drug <i>laws and programs can </i>accomplish. All too
often, these laws and programs are expected to eliminate drug
problems. More disturbing, drug laws and programs have been
expected to contribute substantially to other social objectives
as well, such as reducing crime, increasing employment, or
restoring family cohesion. Such expectations place overwhelming
and unfair burdens on laws, programs, and those administering
them, and make failure and public frustration commonplace. Our
drug policies and laws need to be more realistically stated to
command public support. </p>

<p> 7. Finally, we Americans should resist the temptation to
blame our drug problems on others. We have done this too often in
the past. Our <i>drug problems are peculiar to our own national
experience. </i>They derive from our history and cultural
traditions, our mistakes and prejudices, our societal ills and
flaws-not those of Turks, Mexicans, Burmese, or Colombians.
Certainly, many aspects <b>of </b>drug problems are international
in scope, and much can be gained by multinational research and
education efforts. At times we must seek the cooperation of other
peoples and other countries in order to try to curtail the flow
of illicit drugs into this country. However, the chances for
success in these cooperative efforts would be enhanced, in our
view, if they were undertaken with an acceptance that the most
fundamental aspect of American drug problems is the magnitude of
demand for drugs and that the problems leading people to mis<b>use
</b>drugs will not vanish even if the supply of one or two drugs
is eliminated. </p>

<p> It is against the backdrop of these general observations that
the council submits its conclusions and recommendations. We
repeat, they will not dispose of our drug problems. However, if
applied they would, in our view, mitigate much of the harm that
comes from present policies and approaches-harm that in the minds
of many is damaging in a free society. </p>

<p> As we observed above, Americans tend to overlook the capacity
for misuse of licit drugs and overestimate the misuse of illicit
drugs. As a consequence, we pursue widely divergent courses,
depending upon the legal status of a particular psychoactive
substance. </p>

<p> For example, some drugs, such as caffeine, are freely
available in a wide variety of forms. Use is frequently promoted
and misuse largely unacknowledged. Other drugs, such as nicotine
and alcohol, are considered potentially more harmful, but their
use is largely controlled by social attitudes and their misuse,
though discouraged, is not prohibited. Actions taken under the
influence of such drugs that have a potential for injury to
others-drunken driving, for instance-are subject to criminal
sanctions, although misuse itself is not. </p>

<p> Still other drugs, such as barbiturates, amphetamines, and
tranquilizers, have generally recognized legitimate medical uses,
yet they also have significant potential for harm if misused.
There is growing public awareness of this potential harm, and the
availability of these drugs is more carefully controlled, as, for
example, by prescription of licensed physicians. Criminal
sanctions are employed to discourage diversion from legitimate
channels. </p>

<p> Then there are some drugs, such as heroin and marijuana,
which are considered to be harmful to individuals and society and
without legitimate medical uses. National policy toward these
drugs over the past seven years has been a two-pronged effort to
control the supply or availability and reduce the demand. Thus,
laws are designed to eliminate the availability of these drugs by
prohibiting their use, production, or distribution, and criminal
sanctions are employed to enforce them. On the demand side,
assistance-primarily treatment for heroin addiction through
publicly funded clinics-is offered and sometimes mandated for
those using these drugs. </p>

<p> Public drug policies are in essence a reflection of
prevailing attitudes about psychoactive drugs, and current
attitudes are, conversely, strongly influenced by past and
present policy. In this manner current policies reflect
assumptions and events more than a half century old, despite the
fact that many of those assumptions were erroneous or founded in
demogoguery. Unfortunately, in the view of the council, drug
policies and prevailing public attitudes continue to represent
misunderstanding and wishful thinking more than sober analysis.
For example, it is still widely believed that by prohibiting the
use of a particular drug through the criminal law, that drug can
be eliminated from society. Despite sobering experiences to the
contrary, it is still hoped that more resources for law
enforcement and treatment or more stringent laws will end
problems with drugs. </p>

<p> Individuals use and misuse all kinds of licit and illicit
drugs for a wide variety of reasons, some with greater potential
for harm to themselves and society than others. For example, some
drug use is clearly experimental or inquisitive; individuals want
to know what a drug will do to them, how it will make them feel
and act. Other drug use is recreational; individuals use drugs to
relax, to enhance enjoyment of a social situation. Still other
drug use is demonstrably harmful and antisocial; individuals use
drugs in ways harmful to themselves or society. </p>

<p> As it is now constituted, however, national drug policy does
not reflect an adequate appreciation of these very real
differences in drug-using behavior-yet at the same time most
Americans in their day-to-day experience are at least generally
aware of such differences. For example, most are aware of the
difference between social drinking and alcoholism. They perceive
the difference between taking an occasional tranquilizer and
taking tranquilizers compulsively, between taking prescribed
narcotics to relieve pain and being addicted to them. Many
Americans have begun to recognize the difference between smoking
an occasional marijuana cigarette and being constantly
&quot;high&quot; on marijuana. To command in<i>formed public
support, public policies must recognize these differences in the
patterns and circumstances of drug use.</i> </p>

<p> Public policy regarding heroin can probably never be the same
as policy respecting marijuana or alcohol. These drugs differ
pharmacologically, and people generally use them for different
reasons and in different situations. However, the principles upon
which the control mechanisms of public drug policies are based
can and should be consistent. As the public begins to appreciate
the differences in drug use patterns and behavior, some changes
in attitudes and policy approaches are occurring. </p>

<p> For example, many states have lessened the severity of their
laws regarding marijuana possession. The use and misuse of
sedatives and tranquilizers are under scrutiny. Responsible
national organizations such as the National League of Cities and
the U.S. Conference of Mayors have publicly called for new
approaches to heroin addition. Others have urged caution in our
response to the observed increase in cocaine use, lest an
illadvised response make matters worse. </p>

<p> The federal government's attitude about drugs also has been
affected. The Ford administration's 1975 <i>White Paper on Drug
Abuse, </i>which expressed the federal strategy, differed
dramatically in tone from the &quot;war on drugs&quot; approach
of the early 1970s. Although the White <i>Pa</i>per had little
immediate impact, it opened the door for substantial future
changes. The Carter administration's appeal for the
&quot;decriminalization&quot; of marijuana has provided
additional evidence that change is possible. </p>

<p> Because the country does appear to be in a relatively calm
mood regarding drugs and a process of rethinking is evident, it
is a good time to look to the future. Given the council's belief
that in the future there will in all probability be more, not
less, use and misuse of psychoactive drugs, it is essential to
consider ways in which society may face this situation. </p>

<p> <b>Suggestions for the Future. </b>To state it plainly, the
challenge facing America regarding drugs is to determine how best
to live with the inevitable availability of psychoactive drugs
while mitigating the harmful aspects of their misuse. A case can
be made that we are, in fact, learning to do just that. </p>

<p> For example, the latest national survey indicates that
two-thirds of American adults regularly use alcohol and some 13
million adult and youthful drinkers are said to be problem
drinkers. Currently, federal efforts are increasingly focused on
determining the underlying causes of alcohol misuse in the hope
of developing more effective preventive and treatment measures.
However, despite very deep concerns, there are no serious
proposals for a return to Prohibition. The lessons of that
experience were well learned-the criminal justice system could
not and should not be society's chief agent for controlling
alcohol abuse. Instead, attention is now directed at more
effective public education and health measures. The public seems
to wish to reduce the dangers and risks associated with the
misuse of alcohol and yet continue to enjoy the perceived
benefits derived from responsible use. While no one argues that
we have been successful in eliminating the enormous social costs
of alcoholism and alcohol related problems, current policies are
largely regarded as both reasonable and responsible. </p>

<p> Similarly, a case can be made that, with nearly 50 million
Americans having tried marijuana and 16 million of these
reporting current use, the public (on the basis of opinion polls)
believes that marijuana use will not decrease markedly over the
next few years and that society must adapt to this use in a more
reasonable, responsible manner. While this usage, too, is seen by
many as a disturbing development, appreciable numbers think that
responsible adaptation is possible. To date, eleven state
legislatures have removed the threat of criminal arrest and
imprisonment for the possession or use of small amounts of
marijuana. This development reflects an understanding that severe
criminal sanctions against the use of small amounts of marijuana
are neither appropriate nor effective. The harm to society
associated with the use of small amounts of marijuana is not seen
as sufficient to justify the use of criminal sanctions in
attempts to control it. </p>

<p> Another case in point is the great increase in public
awareness during the past ten to fifteen years of the potential
harm of excessive cigarette smoking. Increased awareness has led
to new approaches in education and to ordinances and laws
imposing civil fines for smoking in designated &quot;no
smoking&quot; areas. Yet there have been no serious proposals to
jail those who smoke. Since smoking is perceived as at worst a
public health problem, not a criminal activity, more effective
public education and health measures are seen as the most
appropriate policy response. </p>

<p> These changes are encouraging. Perhaps they offer directions
for changes in public policy regarding the use of other
psychoactive drugs. In developing such new approaches to the use
and misuse of these drugs, the nation must first set realistic,
consistent goals. In <i>this regard, the </i>primary <i>goal the
council urges is that society seek to </i>minimize the <i>harm
and dysfunction that can accompany the misuse of any psychoactive
substance, whether that drug is currently classified as licit or
illicit,</i> </p>

<p> To accept this goal entails accepting factors which up to now
have not enjoyed wide acceptance-e.g., the continued use of
illicit drugs by many Americans. It also entails accepting that
not all illicit drug use is necessarily harmful. Further, it
indicates that seeking to minimize harm from drug misuse is not
synonymous with seeking to eliminate drug use. </p>

<p> If our goal is to minimize harm and dysfunction, then the
target of national efforts should logically be the harm and
dysfunction which come from indiscriminate drug use. <i>Such a
target calls primarily for education, public health, treatment,
and rehabilitation measures. </i>Such measures could be more
effective in reducing the misuse of drugs if other drug policies
themselves were more reasonable, consistent, and realistic. The
experience of decades makes it clear that only in reducing the
misuse of drugs is there real hope for effectively reducing drug
problems. This is not to say that society should sanction the
unbridled use of psychoactive drugs. To the contrary, public
policy should make clear society's strong disapproval of the
misuse of such drugs. This disapproval will be more persuasive if
it is expressed in terms of concern for individual health and
well-being. </p>

<p> This is also not to say that the nation should immediately
abandon all domestic and international law enforcement efforts
aimed at reducing the availability of illicit drugs. Though by no
means are all drug law enforcement and control efforts effective,
it would be highly inaccurate to say that they have produced no
benefits. While many of these benefits (e.g., reduction in the
availability of particular drugs) have proved temporary in the
past, even such temporary gains are welcome developments. To the
extent that law enforcement efforts curtail the supply of illicit
drugs in a responsible manner, they should be continued. </p>

<p> The problems with drug law enforcement are complicated.
Americans have historically overemphasized drug law enforcement
and control measures and, at least until recently,
underemphasized policies aimed at reducing the misuse of drugs.
In so doing we have paid enormous costs in both dollars and
other, less quantifiable ways, such as increased burdens on the
criminal justice system, corruption, and decreased respect for
law and those enforcing it. All too often these law enforcement
efforts have continued blindly and repetitiously without a
careful assessment and balancing of their costs and benefits. </p>

<p> Perhaps the greatest costs have been those attendant to
criminalizing users of illicit drugs. For example, to brand as
criminals hundreds of thousands of American youths otherwise
leading normal lives, by virtue of their experimental or
recreational marijuana use, presents a fundamental problem in a
society founded on principles of justice and respect for law. It
leads directly to suspicion of and disrespect for the law.
Similarly, to -persist <b>in </b>depicting addiction to opiate
drugs as leading inexorably to violent criminal behavior fosters
further disrespect for law. As is well documented, many opiate
addicts do engage in certain kinds of criminal behavior,
particularly &quot;crimes against property&quot; in order to
raise funds to support their drug habits; but addiction itself,
whether to narcotics, alcohol, or nicotine, is essentially a
psychological and physiological phenomenon. There are social,
cultural, and economic factors which demonstrably influence this
phenomenon or are intimately related to it, but addiction is a
&quot;crime&quot; only because we have traditionally labeled it
as such. </p>

<p> At this stage in our history, there is a clear need to
redress the longstanding imbalance between publicly funded
efforts to reduce misuse and efforts to reduce supply. The
primary focus of public policy should be on the former. We submit
that such a redressing would encourage more realistic
expectations-even public acceptance-of what law enforcement
strategies and agencies can accomplish in reducing drug
availability. </p>

<p> The most important aspect of such a change in emphasis would
be that public policy would reflect contemporary and foreseeable
realities in a straightforward manner. </p>

<p> By placing the major emphasis on reducing the misuse of
drugs, society will be confronted with the necessity of improving
program effectiveness in that regard; the record of the past is
not exemplary. There is an urgent need to expand the base of
knowledge concerning educational, preventive, and treatment
methodologies and techniques. This means a far greater investment
in basic and applied research and evaluation. In addition to
increasing the research investment, it will be necessary to
develop a national research strategy which can provide direction
and coordination to these efforts. Since it is unlikely that
answers will be instantly forthcoming, this strategy should be
applied for the next several years and assure continuity of the
research effort. Public officials must also be more willing to
change policies if necessary in response to expanded knowledge.
Only by taking these steps can there be a realistic expectation
of attracting the calibre of research scientists that could make
a difference. </p>

<p> While we think such an expanded research effort will produce
more understanding and better guidance for educational,
preventive, and treatment approaches, certain steps can be taken
now, based on available knowledge and experience, to make the
publicly funded response to drugs more reasonable and more
effective. </p>

<p> At the federal administrative level, for instance, there
should be much closer coordination between domestic and
international drug law enforcement efforts and agencies on the
one hand and prevention and treatment strategies and agencies on
the other. Effective coordination can occur only at the highest
levels of the executive branch of government, whether by a
special-purpose, cabinet-level committee or by a special staff in
the executive office, because the important drug program
functions are lodged in several departments and agencies
throughout the executive branch. </p>

<p> Such a high-level coordinating body or staff could meet two
essential criteria for greater effectiveness in national drug
policy development and implementation: First, it could develop a
cohesive policy, and, second, it could advise the President and
provide accountability to Congress, and thereby to the public. </p>

<p> This concept is, of course, not new. The 1972 Drug Abuse
Office and Treatment Act created the White House Special Action
Office on Drug Abuse Prevention which was succeeded in 1976 by
the Office for Drug Abuse Prevention. This latter office ceased
to function in 1978, to be succeeded-at least in some of its
functions-by a Special Assistant to the President for drug
issues, a small staff within the White House's Domestic Policy
Staff, and a Federal Strategy Council composed of public
officials and private citizens. However, while it thus appears
that a coordinating mechanism does now exist at the highest level
of the executive branch, it is our impression that this mechanism
is not currently achieving its major objectives, namely, the
development and implementation of a cohesive national drug policy
and closer coordination of law enforcement and treatment
agencies. </p>

<p> In addition to the more effective coordination mechanism that
we recommend, other improvements in the performances of drug
agencies are possible. This is as true for treatment and
prevention programs as it is for law enforcement agencies,
particularly as they relate to heroin addiction. Again, however,
we stress that for such improvements to make a lasting impact
they must be preceded by substantial changes in public policy. </p>

<p> In drug treatment activities at present, improvements are
both possible and needed. Some improvements can come by applying
the new knowledge gained in recent years; others can come by
seeking more aggressively to increase that knowledge. At the same
time there is a need to acknowledge the limitations of drug,
treatment, imposed by social and economic conditions well beyond
the influence of drug treatment programs. </p>

<p> One development that has begun to affect drug treatment
during recent years is change in the concept of heroin addiction.
There is convincing evidence that more individuals use heroin
than are addicted to it. Since most heroin treatment has been
founded on the principle that to use heroin is to be addicted to
it, the existence of large numbers of nonaddicted heroin users
has substantial implications. It is also known that the typical
heroin addict, once thought to use heroin to the exclusion of all
other drugs, is more likely to use many drugs, some in concert
with heroin, others when heroin is unavailable. One implication
of this is that when heroin is unavailable today's heroin addicts
are as likely to turn to other drugs as they are to treatment. </p>

<p> The past eight to ten years have seen substantial progress in
the treatment of heroin addiction. Various treatment approaches
have evolved, the most widely publicized of which has been the
use of the synthetic opiate methadone as a
&quot;maintenance&quot; drug for individuals addicted to heroin.
There are currently seventy-eight thousand individuals enrolled
in methadone maintenance programs throughout the country, the
majority of which are publicly funded. </p>

<p> During this same period there has been a corresponding
increase in the number of individuals enrolled in what are most
often termed &quot;drug free&quot; treatment programs, i.e.,
those based on the principle of abstinence from drug use and
using psychological and behavior modification techniques to
achieve this goal. There are currently an estimated 132,000
individuals receiving treatment in this type of program. </p>

<p> There now exists a nationwide network of treatment programs
and facilities none of which existed prior to 1972. This network
was initiated primarily by federal grants and contracts through
state drug abuse coordinating agencies to local governmental or
nonprofit programs. As a result, federal officials are frequently
quoted as saying that any heroin addict who wants treatment can
receive it. While this statement may be theoretically accurate,
there are two major caveats. First, the accomplishments of
treatment efforts are limited by lack of funding, societal
conditions (e.g., the general employment picture), and the
difficulties of providing &quot;successful&quot; treatment under
any circumstances. Second, for every heroin addict who is in
treatment on any given day, there are an estimated three who are
not. They have neither volunteered nor been referred by the
criminal justice system. </p>

<p> While there has been dramatic progress in making treatment
more available, serious problems remain. Perhaps the most
frustrating of these problems is the fact that no one-including
the council-appears able at this time to provide definitive,
persuasive answers about the comparative effectiveness of the
various treatment approaches. The basic problem with ascertaining
treatment effectiveness is that there is no public or
professional consensus about what treatment should accomplish or
what constitutes &quot;successful&quot; treatment. Different
approaches-e.g. abstinence, methadone maintenance, and
detoxification-are needed to respond to the broad diversity of
people in trouble from the misuse of drugs. Treatment success
should be gauged by the improved function of the individual in
society as measured by personal stability, employment, and
related criteria. Treatment for drug dependence need not have as
its primary goal abstinence from all drug use for its own sake.
To the extent that abstinence is attainable for certain
individuals, it should be a goal; for others, such a goal may be
unrealistic, premature, or even self-defeating. Treatment goals
should reflect the complex nature of drug dependence, which
varies from person to person. </p>

<p> Successful treatment for drug dependence may-foster-such a <i>degree
</i>of stability in an individual that he or she is able to be
gainfully employed; employment may in turn become a major
reinforcing factor in the success of treatment. It is, however,
unrealistic to expect too much regarding employment from
treatment and rehabilitation efforts since the individuals in
treatment often have little or no work experience and few skills
to offer in a job market characterized by fluctuating economic
conditions. Successful treatment may also result in such
stability that the individual no longer engages in criminal
activities to support a costly drug habit. In each case, the goal
of drug treatment should be the degree of stability necessary to
lead to later developments, not those developments themselves.
While some may brand such differences as only matters of
semantics, we believe they are of crucial importance to the
search for realistic goals in the treatment of drug dependence. </p>

<p> Further problems with treatment become evident when attention
is focused on the quality of different programs. There are not
enough programs which offer the wide range of assistance needed
by those dependent on drugs who seek rehabilitation. Numerous
factors have contributed to this situation, not the least of
which is the rapid proliferation of programs which occurred in
the early 1970s. Many weak programs were funded then and are
still in existence. The nature and quality of the clinical
process in many programs have also been adversely affected by the
increased number of treatment clients coming to them by referral
from the criminal justice system. This development has led some
drug treatment programs away from a properly therapeutic function
into an increasingly custodial role with their patients. </p>

<p> Health and drug treatment providers should not have to become
society's agents for the control of social deviance or criminal
activity. The primary responsibility of treatment systems should
be treatment. If modification of drug-taking behavior, even of
life styles, is a component of treatment then it should be
presented as such. Treatment for <i>drug dependence should be
available chiefly because people need help, not as a behavior or
crime control </i>measure. Conversely, efforts to curtail
drug-related crime should be presented as such and not mislabeled
as therapeutic approaches to drug dependency. </p>

<p> For now, pending the outcome of further study and evaluation
as well as research developments, there is a clear need to
integrate the treatment of heroin addiction more closely with the
general health care system. Drug treatment is now too isolated;
the cross-fertilization of new ideas and trends from other
disciplines which should be occurring is not observable. For drug
treatment to retain its vitality in the immediate future, it
cannot remain entirely apart from the mainstream of traditional
physical and mental health care, nor on the other hand can it be
totally absorbed by that system. </p>

<p> <i>Our final suggestion on treatment is that we should </i>immediately
en<i>ter into a more active phase of research and experimentation
with heroin, particularly regarding the potential of using the
drug itself in the treat</i>ment <i>of heroin addiction. </i>We
do not know enough about the treatment of heroin addiction or
about what types of treatment are effective to be able to close
our minds to alternative approaches. Through experience we have
learned much about the use of methadone in treatment; we need to
learn more about the potential of similar use of heroin. Several
highly qualified research scientists have designed a variety of
research protocols which call for the use of heroin at some stage
in the addiction treatment process. Under present law, these
projects could be funded; we are convinced that the most
promising of them should be. </p>

<p> This research should emphasize local and state options and
flexibility. What may prove efficacious in one setting may not in
others, and what may prove effective for one individual may be
inappropriate for another. While we have much to learn from the
experience of other countries, particularly England, heroin
addiction in America presents unique problems requiring creative
approaches. Thus, our call for research and experimentation into
the use of heroin in treatment should not be misconstrued as an
endorsement of the concept of heroin maintenance (i.e., the
provision of heroin to registered addicts). We have serious
reservations as to whether such an approach would prove
beneficial in this country. On the other hand, we submit that we
do need direct experience with the use of heroin in treatment
settings; otherwise, we will not be able to learn what we should
know before making decisions regarding fundamental policy
changes. </p>

<p> just as we think treatment program efforts and policies can
be improved, we feel that drug law enforcement can also be
improved. The basic problem with law enforcement efforts lies
with the drug laws themselves. As long as these laws separate
drugs into licit and illicit categories, there will be a
necessity for such agencies as the Drug Enforcement
Administration, with its primary mission of controlling the
availability of illicit drugs. The elimination of the
availability of these drugs is in our view unachievable; still,
as long as the laws remain in effect, they should be responsibly
enforced. </p>

<p> Earlier we indicated our belief that national drug policy
ought to be based on the way in which a drug is used rather than
on the properties of specific drugs. This enlightened approach is
generally characteristic of our public policies with respect to
alcohol, tranquilizers, and a host of other potentially abusable
drugs. Society accepts responsible use of these drugs, while
seeking to prevent their misuse and, if necessary, punishing both
those who jeopardize the safety of others by irresponsible usage
behavior and those who illegally manufacture or sell such drugs.
However, our laws regarding illicit drugs such as marijuana,
cocaine, and heroin do not distinguish responsible from
irresponsible use; thus, under the law, any use of these drugs
constitutes misuse or &quot;drug abuse.&quot; Drug law
enforcement is consequently directed, at least theoretically,
against all users and suppliers of illicit drugs. This is where
problems with drug law enforcement begin. It is not, however,
where they end. </p>

<p> Many proponents of a national policy of total prohibition of
illicit drug use are beginning to acknowledge the impossibility
of achieving such a goal. Revised goals, such as containment
rather than elimination of availability, are now being advanced.
Infrequently acknowledged, however, even with the more cautious
goals, are the attendant costs of attempted prohibition, such as
criminalizing and stigmatizing hundreds of thousands of users and
using questionable practices in developing cases against them. </p>

<p> Nor are we convinced of the supposed benefits of many current
drug law enforcement efforts. It is commonplace to assume that
laws and law enforcement efforts decrease the number of people
who would otherwise use these contraband substances. However,
there are reasons to doubt this assumption. Exhaustive study has
revealed little deterrent impact from the so-called &quot;get
tough&quot; drug laws of New York State. This study showed little
change in the incidence and prevalence of heroin or other illicit
drug use as a result of the new law. Similarly, in Oregon, where
annual surveys have been conducted to assess the impact of that
state's enactment of <font size="2">marijuana
&quot;decriminalization,&quot; no appreciable increase in use has
been observed over time or in comparison to other jurisdictions
where marijuana penalties have remained stringent. In fact, other
surveys indicate that the primary reason people have chosen
either not to begin use or to discontinue it is simple lack of
interest; -the existence of criminal sanctions against use ranks
quite low as a reason given for not using marijuana. While such
examples do not offer sufficient evidence from which to draw firm
conclusions, they do raise important questions requiring careful
examination.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The most important recommendation the Drug
Abuse Council can make in the area of drug law enforcement has
little to do with specific law enforcement approaches. <i>We
propose a major research effort to </i>analyze <i>the actual
effects of drug laws </i>and drug <i>law enforcement on personal
decisions to use or not use illicit drugs. </i>A well-designed
national study, similar to that of New York drug laws undertaken
in 1974 by the Bar Association of the City of New York, could
furnish much useful guidance in this sensitive area.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In addition to encouraging us to recommend
such general policy research, our years of examination of the
issues involved in the widespread use of marijuana in
contemporary society have convinced us, beyond a doubt, that the
use of criminal law and criminal procedures to deter marijuana
use results in more harm to society than is warranted by present
knowledge regarding its potential harm with moderate use. This
conviction should not be misconstrued as giving marijuana a clean
bill of health. Much about this drug remains unknown. Research
should continue, particularly multi-year studies which seek to
examine the consequences of marijuana use by humans over long
periods of time. Enough is now known to warrant considerable
caution with its use, particularly heavy use; use by pregnant
women and by adolescents should be avoided. <i>However, we also
believe that legislative efforts to decriminalize atfederal and
state levels the possession of small amounts of marijuana for
personal use should continue. States should be encouraged to try
different legislative models, the effects of which could be
assessed over time, </i>in an <i>effort to learn which works most
effectively to </i>minimize potential harm from <i>the
indiscriminate use of </i>marijuana.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The above observations and suggestions about
drug treatment and law enforcement lead us to the conclusion
that, by adhering to an unrealistic goal of total abstinence from
the use of illicit drugs, opportunities to encourage responsible
drug-using behavior are missed. Individual decisions about drug
use invoke value judgments seldom made in isolation; peer
pressure and social, economic, and cultural variables must all be
taken into consideration as we seek to minimize harm and prevent
misuse.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Public education efforts should attempt to
place the use and misuse of psychoactive drugs in accurate
perspective for all members of society, </font><font size="4">not
just younger members. In order to be helpful in minimizing the
harm of drug misuse, information must be credible, coherent, and
verifiable. It must be believable when placed in the context of
life experiences. For example, it strikes us as inconsistent to
issue calls for total abstinence from some drugs while
&quot;happy hours&quot; with two drinks for the price of one are
promoted for another. Such inconsistencies are readily apparent
to the youth of our country and engender skepticism on their part
as to the wisdom of official drug policies-and of the older
generation in general.</font> </p>

<p> Many of our suggestions and observations have been directed
toward policyrnakers in the public sector, those elected and
appointed public officials who make national drug policy through
their actions and decisions at federal, state, and local levels.
It is no less true today than it was seven years ago when the
Drug Abuse Council was created that the views of these officials
tend to be crisis-oriented and short-range. While public
officials have a duty to lead as well as to administer, there are
limitations to their ability to go much beyond prevailing public
attitudes in matters as volatile as drug issues. The private
sector, on the other hand, can and should play a critical,
responsible role in developing longer-range views and policies
and improved public attitudes. </p>

<p> The Drug Abuse Council has been one such effort in the
private sector. Other alternatives either already exist or could
be created. Any such entity will require the exertion of
private-sector leadership and the investment of resources
sufficient to undertake independent research and legislative,
budgetary, and policy analyses. Much basic examination and
reexamination has occurred and does not require repeating. With
modest annual expenditures, an organization within the private
sector could help keep the American public informed and provide
leadership for the development of broad public support for
sensible drug policies and programs. <i>It is our conviction that
the private sector needs to continue to take an active role in
both developing and assessing public drug policies and pro</i>grams.<br>
</p>

<p> A Final Thought and Suggestion. The goal of the council was
stated in its 1972 Annual Report. The chairman said, </p>

<p> The Directors of the Drug Abuse Council, widely
representative in personal and professional exposure and
involvement, are determined not to look to exhortations or crash
programs for illusory solutions or cures. Instead, because the
Council was initiated and is supported as a private independent
agency, unencumbered by shibboleths or taboos or political or
bureaucratic pressures, the Directors have been free-and have
exercised their freedom-to begin to learn, and to publish what
they have learned, about drug abuse and treatment in. a drug
using society. </p>

<p> Since 1972 the many publications of the council-and of
persons and agencies supported by the council-have reported what
we have learned about drugs, about their use, misuse, and our
response to them. In the concluding paragraphs of one of the last
and most significant studies initiated and supported by the
council, <i>The Nation's Toughest Drug </i>Law: Evaluating-the <i>New
York Experience ' </i>it is stated that, </p>

<p> First, the use of heroin and other opiates is but one element
of a larger problem. The misuse of all dangerous drugs-alcohol,
cocaine, opiates, and other mood-changing drugs, some prescribed
and some sold over the counter-all together constitutes &quot;the
drug problem.&quot; Problems with so many components do not yield
to one-dimensional solutions. As no single drug treatment method
is suitable for all users, so there is not likely to be a single
legal approach that is suitable for all offenders. </p>

<p> Second, whether or not illicit drug use is for the most part
a medical concern as some contend, it is incontrovertibly deeply
rooted in broader social &quot;maladies.&quot; Narcotics use in
particular is intimately associated with, and part of, a wider
complex of problems that includes family break-up, unemployment,
poor income and education, feeble institutional structures. and
loss of hope. </p>

<p> The final observation is a corollary of the second: it is
implausible that social problems as basic as these can be
effectively solved by the criminal law. </p>

<p> If this statement is accurate-and we are convinced that it
is-it reinforces our considered judgment that drug misuse is
primarily a social, medical, and public health problem, a problem
that will not yield to single or simplistic solutions or
approaches. And it reinforces our judgment that solutions or
approaches that might be useful in one place or with some
individuals would not necessarily be so in another setting or
with other people. </p>

<p> Recognizing that deeply felt attitudes and established
policies reflect fears and judgments that will yield slowly, if
ever, to facts and conditions described in the council's
publications, we recommend that serious consideration be given to
the use of individual state or local option as a means of
attempting solutions appropriate in one place but not in others.
Local option could encourage greater flexibility and ingenuity
rather than reliance upon an unrealistic, rigid homogeneity in
national drug policy. We need to respond to the diversity of
people who use and misuse drugs, base all our policies on a
consistent set of principles seeking to discourage misuse, and
keep our seemingly innate drug-using behavior within reasonable
limits through means which do not themselves cause more harm than
they prevent.<br>

<p> <b><font size="4">Introduction<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Throughout the twentieth century the
government of the United States has engaged, in one form or
another, in efforts to prevent its citizens from using certain
designated psychoactive drugs. The use of nonapproved drugs has
been defined as illegal, and billions of taxpayer dollars have
been spent and millions of man-hours devoted to curtailing the
availability of such drugs. Yet in spite of these efforts there
are now as many users and abusers of illicit drugs as ever
before. Similarly, the misuse of legally available drugs has
dramatically increased.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Data on the use of illicit drugs do not
conclusively demonstrate that the federal government's antidrug
efforts have failed, but they do provide compelling reasons to
undertake a thorough reappraisal of federal policies and
programs. Evaluations made by both federal government study
groups and private organizations' have resulted in
changes-particularly in preventive and treatment approaches-but
federal drug policies have remained fundamentally the same for
decades.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This chapter will concentrate on the response
of the federal government to the issues of illicit drug use <b>and
</b>misuse from 1969 to the present. It was during this period
that our country experienced an unprecedented growth in the
governmental response to the use of illicit drugs. This period
also roughly coincides with the years during which the Drug Abuse
Council has been studying drug issues and policy.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">To understand the U.S. government's response
to illicit drugs in the 1970s it is necessary to know something
of the history. Our nation's current drug policies and programs
are the result of over seventy years of development. Detailed
analyses such as those provided by David </font><font size="1">Musto2
</font><font size="2">and Rufus King3 offer insight into this
process. It is clear from these analyses that the government's
response to public fear of certain drugs and drug users has
primarily consisted of law enforcement or quasi-enforcement
strategies intended to prohibit both new and continued use of
nonapproved substances. The belief that some drugs are so
innately harmful that the citizens of this country should and
could be prevented from using them has been the basic tenet of
American drug policy for the past seven decades.<br>
<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Historical Review <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Several major pieces of drug legislation and
presidential initiatives have shaped public policy in the drug
field. The first pertinent legislation in this area passed by
Congress was the District of Columbia Pharmacy Act in </font><font
size="1">1906.4 </font><font size="2">Although this act applied
only to the District of Columbia, it set a precedent for Congress
to deal with drug issues. This act permitted a physician to
prescribe narcotics to addicts, but only when &quot;necessary for
the cure&quot; of addiction; the prescription of narcotic drugs
to nonaddicted persons was limited to the treatment of injury or
disease. The intent of the act was to prevent the further -spread
of addictive drug use. It first raised the difficult
philosophical question of government regulation of physician
prescribing practices with respect to addictive drugs, an issue
still actively debated.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Harrison Narcotic Act,' passed in late
1914, marked the official entry of the government into the area
of narcotics control. This act simplified record keeping on the
dispensation of certain narcotic drugs, and required that
standard forms be filed and maintained for two years on the sales
of narcotic drugs. Revenue agents could inspect these records at
will. However, physicians were allowed to dispense drugs without
keeping records if in actual attendance on their patients.
Numerous patent medicines containing small amounts of morphine,
cocaine, opium, and heroin were still permitted to be sold by
mail order or in general stores.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Through regulations issued by the Treasury
Department pursuant to the Harrison Narcotic Act, the federal
government hampered the treatment of heroin and morphine
addiction to such a degree that by the early 1920s those clinics
in the country which regularly provided opiates to registered
addicts (so-called &quot;maintenance clinics&quot;) were closed,
and few private physicians dared to provide these drugs to
addicts </font><font size="1">. 6 </font><font size="2">This
effectively ended the medical profession's active involvement in
the treatment of drug addiction until the 1960s. From the 1920s
on, the federal government was for all practical purposes in
charge of attempts to control illicit drug use. Although there
were, at the time, serious questions raised about the
constitutionality of using federal police powers to restrict, and
eventually prohibit, the use of certain drugs, the popular belief
was that the use of these drugs must be eliminated even when
occurring in the context of medical treatment for addiction.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1929 Congress passed the Porter Act </font><font
size="1">7 </font><font size="2">ostensibly addressing the
treatment needs of convicted addicts. The Porter Act called for
the building of two narcotics &quot;farms&quot; in which those
convicted of the &quot;crime&quot; of drug addiction would be
housed in order to receive compulsory treatment. The underlying
assumption of the act seemed to be that treatment-enforced
abstinence-required isolation and a controlled environment.
Although the Porter Act became law in January 1929, the first
farm did not open until 1935 in Lexington, Kentucky. A second
farm opened in 1938 in Fort Worth, Texas. The treatment rendered
at these farms was not successful, with most addicts returning to
addiction after discharge.&quot; In reality the farms were little
more than specialized prisons. In fact, Musto reports that
&quot;not until the late 1960s were the bars removed from the
Lexington facility and the cells turned into rooms.&quot;9</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1930 the first federal agency specifically
devoted to the control of illicit drugs, the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics (FBN), was established. Because the federal regulation
of narcotic drugs was based on the taxing power of Congress, the
FBN was made part of the Treasury Department and was concerned
only with enforcement issues. The FBN was responsible, at least
initially, for enforcing the Harrison Narcotic Act and
controlling only what were then thought of as the most dangerous
drugs-cocaine and the opiates. The FBN's policies were predicated
on the belief that &quot;the most effective way of gaining public
compliance with a law regulating a dangerous drug was a policy of
high fines and severe mandatory prison sentences for first
convictions.&quot; 10</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The FBN did not initially support a federal
antimarijuana effort. However, newspaper accounts of serious
crimes attributed to marijuana users and the drug's &quot;Mexican
purveyors&quot; triggered a series of events that culminated in
the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. 11 The FBN changed
its policies after this act was passed, vigorously enforcing the
federal laws prohibiting marijuana. </font><b><font size="1">12</font></b>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Passage of the Marihuana Tax Act in effect
imposed a total prohibition on marijuana use. Marijuana was
described in congressional hearings as impairing the ability to
think rationally, dangerous to the mind and body, and leading to
insanity. It was further claimed that marijuana led to the
commission of violent crimes, spread drug use to school children,
and resulted in impotence in the habitual user. It was not until
the early 1970s that many of these views began to be modified. To
this day, however, their effects on public attitudes and policies
linger.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">During the late 1940s and early 1950s there
were reports that rates of heroin addiction had risen,
particularly in inner-city minority communities. This period
coincided with the beginning of the so-called &quot;McCarthy
era,&quot; a time when public fear of nonconforming behavior was
high and tolerance of it low. Drugs were linked to communism. As
David Musto has written, &quot;The Federal Bureau of Narcotics
linked Red China's attempts to get hard cash, as well as to
destroy Western society, to the clandestine sale of large amounts
of heroin to drug pushers in the United States.&quot;13 In
addition, a theory that addicts began with marijuana use and
moved inexorably to the use of heroin (or morphine or
cocaine)-the progression&quot; or &quot;stepping-stone&quot;
theory-was widely believed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In this atmosphere, the Boggs </font><font
size="1">Act14 was passed in late 1951. The </font><font size="2">Boggs
Act increased penalties for all drug law violators and for the
first time made penalties for violation of the marijuana laws the
same as those for narcotic drugs. This act also introduced, at
the federal level, the concept of minimum mandatory jail
sentences for drug law offenders.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Boggs Act-and later amendments which
further increased penalties </font><b><font size="1">15</font></b><font
size="1"> </font><font size="2">-reflected an undeviating
reliance on law enforcement activities and harsh penalties to
deal with the perceived &quot;drug menace.&quot; The Boggs
Act-and the later Narcotic Control Act of 1956-passed after only
cursory hearings, which did not delve into either the causes or
the nature of the use of illicit drugs. The widespread fear of
communism and intolerance of nonconforming views and behavior at
the time made it politically feasible-even desirable-to advocate
reliance on the criminal justice system to control and punish
narcotics users. The need for treatment was ignored. Most
Americans directly affected by these laws were politically
impotent, disliked, and distrusted because of prevailing racial
and ethnic prejudices.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The first notice of change in official
attitudes came in 1963 with President Kennedy's appointment of an
Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse (the Prettyman
Commission) to review the nation's drug problems and the
government's response to them. The Prettyman Commission report </font><font
size="1">16 </font><font size="2">challenged many of the
assumptions which had long dominated official thinking in the
drug area. It recommended a decreased use of minimum mandatory
sentences, an increase in appropriations for research, and the
transfer of the FBN to the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare. It also recommended that the final judgment on the
legitimate medical use of narcotics be given back to the medical
profession.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Prettyman Commission noted the
fragmentation of federal activities in the drug field and
recommended that &quot;the President appoint a Special Assistant
for Narcotic and Drug Abuse from the White House staff to provide
continuous advice and assistance in launching a coordinated
attack. </font><font size="1">&quot; 17 </font><font size="2">Although
the commission made many recommendations, few were implemented at
that time.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One recommendation of the commission which did
receive attention was that a civil commitment system be
established &quot;to provide an alternative method of handling
the federally convicted offender who is a confirmed narcotic or
marijuana abuser.&quot; Such a system was instituted by the
Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966 (NARA).&quot;'
Although NARA ostensibly considered drug addiction a
&quot;medical problem,&quot; addicts committed under NARA
programs were basically perceived as prisoners.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">By the mid-1960s, illicit drug use had become
a highly visible and emotional issue throughout the United
States. It was widely believed that illicit drug use was
increasing rapidly and for the first time reaching into the
suburbs and affecting white middle-class youth. News reports
often tended toward sensationalism in presenting stories on LSD
and hallucinogenic drug use on college campuses. Anti-Vietnam War
protesters became identified with marijuana use. The use of
illicit drugs was, in general, identified as an antisocial
gesture and was associated in the public's mind with mental
illness and rising rates of street crime.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In February 1968 President Johnson established
&quot;a new and powerful Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD)&quot; within the justice Department.&quot;' Johnson had
seen that the federal enforcement of narcotics laws was
fragmented. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics in the Treasury
Department had some responsibilities, while the Bureau of Drug
Abuse Control (BDAC)-an agency created only three years earlier
in 1965 in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare-had
been assigned certain regulatory functions having to do with
nonnarcotic drugs. In an attempt to unify the federal response,
the FBN and BDAC were abolished and the new BNDD was given full
authority to enforce all U.S. narcotics laws, from worldwide
operations to work with state and local law enforcement
officials. In addition, BNDD was directed to &quot;conduct an
extensive campaign of research and a nationwide public education
program on drug abuse and its tragic effects.&quot; In fact, in
President Johnson's message to Congress proposing Reorganization
Plan No. 1, the only mention of any federal effort in research-
treatment, or education was in the context of the justice
Department's BNDD. The emphasis was again on law enforcement and
the relationship between drugs and crime.<br>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="2">Understanding the Growth of the
Governmental Response to Illicit Drugs<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">During Richard Nixon's presidential terms, the
issue of &quot;drug abuse&quot; was given a higher priority and
greater visibility than at any other time in our country's
history. In January 1969 the annual federal. budget for drug
treatment, education, research, and law enforcement was $81.4
million; five years later it was $760 million-nearly a tenfold
increase. A series of major legislative, organizational, and
programmatic changes accompanied these dramatic budget increases.
The reasons for this enormous increase in the federal response
can be traced to three unforeseen circumstances of need and
opportunity. </font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">The Need to Reduce Rates of Urban Street
Crime. </font></b><font size="2">Rising street crime was a key
issue in the 1968 presidential campaign. The urban riots of the
mid-1960s and the rising crime-rate figures issued by the FBI
provided fuel for much of the campaign rhetoric about the growing
&quot;lawlessness&quot; and &quot;violence&quot; of America.
&quot;Law and order&quot; emerged as the dominant domestic theme
of the 1968 Republican presidential campaign </font><font
size="1">.20</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Campaign promises to &quot;get tough&quot;
with urban street crime are historically easier to make than to
fulfill. The jurisdiction and power of the federal government to
prevent burglaries and armed robberies-among the most common
types of urban street crime--are limited. Except in the District
of Columbia, such violations are usually matters for state, not
federal, action. Even if Congress had extended the legal
authority of the federal law enforcement agencies, these agencies
(FBI, IRS, BNDD) did not have the manpower to address urban
street crime effectively.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In spite of the passage of &quot;tough&quot;
legislation such as preventive detention, harsh prison sentences,
and &quot;no-knock&quot; warrantless searches, crime rates
continued to rise, as reported by the FBI, jeopardizing the
administration's promised law and order. Even in the District of
Columbia, where the federal government could exercise some
contrcl, the crime rate increased during the first year of the
Nixon presidency.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Clearly, from a political perspective the
Nixon administration needed to show progress in some area of
crime control before the 1972 election. This was one element
underlying the growth since 1969 of the federal government's
efforts to control the use of illicit drugs.</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">The Public's Increasing Concern About
Heroin Addiction. </font></b><font size="2">The association of
illicit drug use with street crime and violence developed over a
long period of time. By the late 1960s, the relationship between
heroin &quot;addiction' and street crime was generally accepted
as fact, despite the absence of any careful research and
documentation. 22 Heroin had become inextricably linked in the
public's mind with the urban crisis; and as public anxiety about
crime grew, so too did the fear of heroin and heroin addicts.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The public's fear of heroin was intensified by
reports of increased use of narcotics among American soldiers
stationed in Vietnam. The thought of &quot;soldier-junkies,&quot;
trained in guerrilla warfare, returning to the streets of urban
America heightened public concern and led to further demands for
government action. &quot;Drug abuse&quot; (particularly heroin
addiction) rapidly became a major public concern, as reflected in
the opinion polls of that time, adding another argument for an
expanded government effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But neither the need for an effective crime
reduction program nor the growing public concern about heroin
explain by themselves the increased federal response: a third
element was crucial. In all likelihood the government's efforts
to prevent &quot;drug abuse&quot; would have expanded without
this third element, but it is doubtful that the expansion would
have been anywhere near the same magnitude.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">* In the late 1960s no distinction was made
between heroin use and heroin addiction-all use of heroin was
believed addictive. More recent studies indicate that this is not
necessarily accurate.21<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">The Emergence of New Approaches to the
Problem of Heroin Addiction. </font></b><font size="2">Three new
avenues of response to the problems of heroin addiction and
heroin-related crime emerged. Although distinct from one another,
these three approaches in time became interrelated in subsequent
government programs. The opportunities they presented led-some
say misled-federal policyrnakers to believe that they could
respond to the problems of heroin addiction more successfully
than previously.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">First, the legislative basis for federal drug
law enforcement efforts changed. Federal regulations and controls
on drugs before 1970 were based primarily on the power to levy
taxes and prohibit traffic in smuggled goods. Thus virtually all
federal drug law enforcement programs were administered by the
Treasury Department-until the creation of the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs in the justice Department by executive order
in 1968; simultaneously the Treasury Department's Federal Bureau
of Narcotics was abolished. This transfer of jurisdiction was
given a statutory basis in 1970 with the passage of the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control </font><font
size="1">Act.2&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This act addressed a broad range of drug
program efforts, providing increased support for drug treatment,
rehabilitation, and education as well as enforcement. The
enforcement provisions of this legislation (Title II of the act)
were part of a larger attempt to reduce criminal activity through
improved federal law enforcement. Congress and the Nixon
administration sought through this legislation to recodify the
existing drug laws into one comprehensive law. Most narcotics law
enforcement powers were given to the justice Department, thus
allowing the Attorney General to exercise control over all
dangerous drugs (e.g., amphetamines and barbiturates) and
narcotics. This was the first federal law making it illegal to
traffic in or possess certain drugs which did not refer to the
taxing authority. Instead, the justification for federal-as
opposed to state-enforcement was shifted to the power of Congress
to regulate interstate commerce. The concept of the
&quot;interstate commerce&quot; powers of Congress had greatly
expanded in the decades prior to this new drug legislation.
Supreme Court rulings on the &quot;New Deal&quot; legislation of
the 1930s and 1940s and on the civil rights cases of the 1960s
had clearly broadened the scope of activities that Congress could
regulate under its constitutional authority to regulate
&quot;interstate commerce.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This shift in the constitutional basis of drug
law enforcement allowed the federal government to become more
directly involved in suppressing one presumed major cause of
urban street crime about which there was great public fear. It
offered some hope that expanded and intensified efforts to combat
trafficking in illicit drugs could succeed where past efforts had
failed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A second new avenue of response centered
around bilateral agreements to reduce the international flow of
illicit drugs-particularly heroin-into the United States. For
more than sixty years, beginning with the Hague International
Opium Convention of 1912, the United States has negotiated
bilateral and multilateral international agreements to keep
illicit opiates out of the country. Since opium, of which heroin
is a derivative, is not grown anywhere in the United States, all
the heroin used by addicts in this country comes from foreign
sources; hence the concept that if opium is not cultivated
elsewhere, heroin will not be available for use here. Since,
however, it is virtually impossible to prevent the growth of the
opium poppy everywhere, a second line of defense has been to
disrupt international trafficking in opium, its chemical
conversion into heroin in foreign laboratories, and its
subsequent shipment into the United States.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In January 1969, up to 80 percent of the
heroin used in the United States was believed to be of Turkish
origin. The major processing country for converting Turkish opium
into heroin for shipment to American East Coast port cities was
reputed to be France. The operations in these two countries were
frequently blamed for the rising rates of heroin addiction
reported in the United States in the late 1960s.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Nixon administration sought greater
international cooperation to keep illicit drugs from entering the
United States </font><font size="1">.14 </font><font size="2">In
early 1971, just as public concern about heroin was reaching its
peak, separate agreements were reached with France and Turkey
enlisting their formal assistance in keeping heroin out of the
United States. The French government agreed to take steps to
close down the clandestine laboratories operating principally
around Marseilles and to prevent the traffic of opium into, and
heroin out of, France. The agreement with Turkey-the culmination
of five years of negotiations-amounted to a total. ban on -poppy
cultivation in Turkey in return for American financial aid for
crop substitution programs and income compensation for Turkish
farmers.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It was anticipated that these two agreements
would significantly reduce the flow of heroin to the United
States, and that the resulting shortage would reduce the levels
of heroin addiction and heroin-related crime. Thcy were touted as
major victories on the international front of the new &quot;war
on drug abuse.&quot; The federal government sought to capitalize
on these agreements by negotiating agreements with other
potential &quot;source&quot; and &quot;processing&quot;
countries. The hoped-for success of these efforts to control
international supplies thus emerged as the second new avenue of
the government's heroin control effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The third new avenue of response was the use
of methadone to treat heroin addiction. Methadone is a synthetic
analgesic developed by the Germans during World War 11 as a
substitute for morphine. After the war and throughout the 1950s,
methadone was used in the United States as a detoxifying agent
for heroin addicts. In 1964 Drs. Vincent P. Dole and Marie E.
Nyswander of the Rockefeller Institute in New York City found
that they were able to maintain six heroin addicts on a stable
dosage-level of methadone without their craving heroin. Dole and
Nyswander soon began an expanded program of methadone maintenance
to both demonstrate methadone's potential and evaluate the
program's impact. In 1966 they reported the initial results of
their work: Among the most widely publicized of their results was
that criminal activity among the enrolled addicts had been
&quot;virtually eliminated. </font><font size="1">'125 </font><font
size="2">Public and government interest in the concept of
methadone maintenance grew, and by the late 1960s methadone
programs were in operation in many urban centers, providing
addicts with an alternative to the more traditional forms of
treatment which emphasized abstinence, and which had not proved
successful for large numbers of addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While methadone maintenance programs are
generally considered &quot;treatment,&quot; particularly by their
staffs and clients, the idea of using methadone treatment as part
of the larger national effort to reduce urban street crime had
begun to take hold by late 1969. The proposition put forth was
that if an addict's dependence on heroin was broken (by
substituting legally prescribed methadone), the crime rate would
be reduced, because-so the theory went-addicts committed a large
proportion of the street crime in order to feed their illicit
habits. A 1970 Domestic Council Summary Option Paper on Drugs
stated, &quot;The Federal government has only one economical and
effective technique for reducing crime in the streets-methadone
maintenance. </font><b><font size="1">-26</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone thus offered an important new form
of treatment to heroin addicts as well as a possibility of
reducing urban street crime. Which aspect was considered more
important is difficult to determine. In any event, the emergence
of methadone treatment was a crucial -part of the developing
&quot;solution&quot; to the problems of heroin addiction and
heroin-related crime.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Thus in the late 1960s and early 1970s several
new<b> </b>and potentially significant approaches developed. Many
believed that if effectively applied in concert they could
substantially reduce the rate of heroin addiction and associated
problems, particularly the crimes committed to raise money to
support heroin addiction. These developments, coinciding as they
did with the political commitment to reduce urban street crime
and respond to the growing public concern about heroin addiction,
had much to do with the enormous growth of the federal response
to illicit drugs which began in 1969.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Federal Response, 1969-1971 <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In January 1969 the federal government's
response to illicit drugs as measured in dollars spent was small;
$86 million was spent in fiscal year 1969 (FY 69), and only a
modest increase to $101.9 million was requested for FY 70 </font><font
size="1">.27</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The principal federal agencies involved in the
drug field during this period were the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) in the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare; the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the
justice Department; and the Customs Bureau of the Treasury
Department. These three agencies accounted for the bulk of the
federal drug effort in four operational areas: treatment and
rehabilitation; education, prevention, and training; research;
and law enforcement. NIMH was the major federal sponsor of all
non-law-enforcement programs, while BNDD and Customs each held
some responsibility for the federal drug law enforcement effort.
The emergence of BNDD created an intense bureaucratic rivalry
with Customs regarding jurisdictional responsibilities for drug
law enforcement programs. Although this dispute was supposed to
have been settled in 1969 when BNDD was authorized to conduct
overseas operations and Customs was restricted to border
searches, it has surfaced frequently in subsequent years; even
now the situation seems merely a temporary truce. (See Staff
Paper 2, &quot;Drug Law Enforcement Efforts,&quot; below.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The FY 71 budget was the first to be
completely developed by the Nixon administration, and in it the
federal drug budget more than doubled to a total of $212.5
million. The major increases in the FY 71 budget were for
treatment and rehabilitation and education, prevention, and
training. While the drug law enforcement budget rose by more than
50 percent, it was for the first time surpassed in absolute
numbers by expenditures for treatment and rehabilitation, which
by this time were assuming added dimensions as part of the crime
reduction effort (see Figure 1. 1).</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1001.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since the use of illicit drugs was of growing
public concern and government interest, federal budget makers
were clearly more receptive to agency budget requests for new
drug programs, and by FY 71 there were fifteen separate federal
agencies involved in some kind of drug-related effort. For some,
such as the Office of Education, the Veterans Administration, and
the Department of Transportation, FY 71 marked the first year
they had undertaken specific drug activities. For others, such as
the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of
Economic Opportunity, drug-related expenditures, which until then
had been minimal, rose dramatically. This expansion of the
federal drug budget was accompanied by greater problems of
interagency coordination. Although federal response to the use of
illicit drugs was growing, it generally lacked cohesion and
overall purpose (other than a commitment to &quot;solve the drug
problem&quot;). This lack of coordination led Hutt and Wald to
comment in 1972, &quot;Federal activities in the drug abuse field
tend to be <i>ad hoc </i>reactions to current crises rather than
well-considered, long-term programs.11211</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The proposed FY 72 budget, announced in
February 1971, projected a drug budget of $265 million-an
increase of just over $50 million. This proposal envisioned
federal expenditures of $96 million for law enforcement, $101
million for treatment and rehabilitation, $24 million for
research, and $44 million for education, prevention, and
training. By this time there were sixteen separate federal
agencies involved in the drug effort, with little coordination
between them. The resulting bureaucratic nightmare was
graphically depicted in a government report covering all federal
drug efforts except law enforcement (Figure 1.2).</font> <img
src="fada1002.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In early 1971, the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse began work on the first of two
consecutive one-year studies it was to undertake. The appointment
of this federal study commission, the scope of its work, and the
schedule for the completion of its two reports had been
delineated in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
Act of 1970. (The Senate and the House of Representatives each
appointed two members to the thirteen-member commission;
President Nixon selected the remaining nine.) Congress had
stipulated that the commission first complete a comprehensive
study of marijuana-related issues by March 1972 (discussed more
fully in Staff Paper 5, &quot;Marijuana and Cocaine,&quot;
below). in the commission's second year, Congress directed it to
complete a more general examination and analysis of the nature,
causes, and significance of the &quot;drug abuse&quot; problem in
the United States, and further directed it to present
recommendations for legislative and administrativ6 actions
consistent with the commission's findings and conclusions.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">However, on June 17, 1971, long before the
scheduled completion of the commission's second report, President
Nixon sent to Congress a special message on drug abuse in which
he requested a supplemental budget of $155 million and a
reorganization of responsibilities regarding drug treatment,
education, prevention, research, and, most notably, coordination.
Citing the immediacy of the drug problem and the need for a more
effective response, Nixon simultaneously issued an executive
order establishing the position of Special Consultant to the
President for Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in order to
&quot;institute to the extent legally possible&quot; the
legislation which he proposed to Congress. It was at this point
that the fundamental restructuring of the federal government's
response to illicit drugs began.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">President Nixon's Message to Congress, June
17, 1971.19 </font></b><font size="2">President Nixon's message
to Congress on June 17, 1971 raised the issue of illicit drug use
to the highest level of government concern and responsibility.
This statement was the culminating step in the declaration of a
strong and irrevocable public commitment to reduce the crime
heroin addicts were thought to commit and bring the problems of
illicit drug use under control. &quot;If we cannot destroy the
drug menace in America , Nixon informed Congress and the American
public, &quot;then it will surely in time destroy us. I am not
prepared to accept this alternative.&quot; Although the President
spoke of the general problems of &quot;drug abuse,&quot; there is
little doubt that the chief problems and concerns to which he
referred were those relating to heroin addiction.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Clearly, public alarm about heroin-related
crime and addicted Vietnam veterans demanded a more effective
governmental response than previous ones. Equally clear was the
fact that increased funding alone had not been successful.
According to Nixon: &quot;We must now candidly recognize that the
deliberate procedures embodied in present efforts to control drug
abuse are not sufficient in themselves. The problem has assumed
the dimensions of a national emergency.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Forceful measures were required, so the
thinking went, if the twin problems of heroin addiction and urban
crime were to be curtailed. Speed was essential to the Nixon
administration because of the political aspects of illicit drug
use. Predictably, the policies and programs it advocated were
consistent with enforcement and quasi-enforcement approaches
which had characterized past federal efforts. The government's
response to the use of illicit drugs in 1971 sprang from the same
assumptions about their innate harmfulness and arrived at
fundamentally the same conclusions as had been espoused for more
than sixty years. The changes proposed were those of technique,
size, and scope only.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The president acknowledged the problems of
undirected growth in the government's response. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">We must recognize that piecemeal efforts, even
where individually successful, cannot have a major impact on the
drug abuse problem unless and until they are forged together into
a broader and more integrated program involving all levels of
government and private effort. We need a coordinated effort if we
are to move effectively against drug abuse.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A two-sided approach was developed to
coordinate the federal drug effort. On the &quot;supply&quot;
side were all federal drug law enforcement efforts to halt the
illegal production, distribution, and use of prohibited
substances. On the &quot;demand&quot; side were all federally
sponsored efforts at treatment and rehabilitation and education,
prevention, training, and research. Each approach was envisioned
as separate and independent of the other, although they shared
the same goals of eliminating illicit drug use and drug-related
crime in America.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">To control &quot;demand&quot; the Nixon
administration proposed a dramatic reorganization which would
temporarily centralize responsibility for all federally sponsored
efforts in drug treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention,
training, and research in a new White House Agency, the <b>Special
Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP). </b>The
director of SAODAP was to be immediately accountable to the
President. From an organizational standpoint it made sense to
coordinate the many federal agencies involved. To have ignored
the management problems displayed in Figure 1.2 above would have
led to further chaos and undercut the potential of any federal
response. However, this does not explain why such coordinative
responsibilities were lodged in the White House under
presidential supervision. Other federal programs also involved a
number of federal agencies, yet coordination could usually be
achieved through more regular bureaucratic measures such as
cabinet- or sub-cabinet-level working agreements. What made the
drug issue different?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One explanation lies in the deteriorating
relationship at that time between the White House staff and
various federal agencies. Particularly with respect to the
funding of methadone maintenance programs, the White House felt
that there was considerable bureaucratic &quot;foot-dragging. </font><font
size="1">&quot;30 </font><font size="2">Administration officials
had become persuaded of the benefits of methadone maintenance as
a way to reduce &quot;heroin and criminal recidivism,&quot; but
they had been unsuccessful in gaining the full support and
cooperation of NIMH, the agency which normally would have funded
and overseen these programs. NIMH officials were cautious of
government &quot;sanctioning one addiction [to methadone] in
order to reduce the burden on society of heroin addiction,' and
continued to resist White House pressures to fund a greater
number of methadone programs </font><font size="1">.31 </font><font
size="2">The administration contended that NIMH opposed the
programs because to endorse the concept of methadone maintenance
would have been tantamount to admitting the failure of the
psychiatric profession to successfully treat heroin addiction </font><font
size="1">.32</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While mention of methadone is made only once
in President Nixon's message to Congress, the proposed creation
of SAODAP and the accompanying redelegation of authority would
help circumvent NIMH and increase federal support for methadone.
The administration sought thus to bypass-since it could not
cajole-a reluctant bureaucracy. The president's designation of
Dr. Jerome Jaffe-a prominent supporter of the use of methadone in
treatment-as his Special Consultant for Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs until SAODAP could be legally constituted by Congress left
no doubt as to the administration's intention. Indeed, when Dr.
Jaffe assumed leadership responsibilities in mid-1971, there were
135 federally funded drug treatment programs; eighteen months
later, with a significantly increased drug treatment budget, the
number had nearly tripled to 394 </font><font size="1">.33 </font><font
size="2">Treatment for heroin addiction was emphasized in this
program expansion and the rate of growth of methadone treatment
programs was accelerated.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A second explanation for centralizing
drug-policy-making responsibilities in the White House is that
the administration anticipated a successful campaign against
illicit drug use and drug-related crime and wanted to take
political credit for it. If the needs were great, so were the
opportunities. The president's message to Congress exuded
confidence in spite of the crisis rhetoric in which it was
couched; the message sought to portray illicit drugs as the
villain in a domestic war which could only be won by forceful
presidential leadership, as the following excerpt suggests.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Narcotics addiction is a problem which
afflicts both the body and the soul of America. It is a problem
which baffles many Americans. In our history we have faced great
difficulties again and again, wars and depressions and divisions
among our people have tested our will as a people-and we have
prevailed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The threat of narcotics among our people is
one which properly frightens many Americans. It comes quietly
into homes and destroys children, it moves into neighborhoods and
breaks the fiber of community which </font><font size="1">makes
neighbors.... And we are not without the will to deal with this
matter. We have the moral resources to do the job. Now we need
the authority and the funds to match our moral resources. I am
confident that we will prevail in this struggle as we have in
many others. But time is critical. Every day we lose compounds
the tragedy which drugs inflict on individual Americans. The
final issue is not whether we will conquer drug abuse, but how
soon.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The message drew upon traditional perceptions
and fears of illicit drugs and illicit drug users in order to
rally public support for a renewed crusade against a social evil.
The rhetoric was consistent with the tenor of the times. Leading
a war against illicit drugs was certain to enhance any
politician's popularity. And, although the public pronouncements
tended towards the dramatic, the reorganization and expansion
called for, particularly regarding federal efforts in drug
treatment and prevention, were clearly warranted.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The president's message leaves no doubt that
the administration thought a war against illicit drugs could be
won. The president proposed only a three-to-five-year life for
SAODAP because it was to be &quot;an emergency response to a
national problem which we intend to bring under control.&quot;
This &quot;war&quot; was going to be swift, requiring immediate
and decisive action and sufficient financing. SAODAF's role was
to give the White House direct involvement, visibility, and
credit. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">Development of the Expanded Federal
Response<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Having made a public commitment to respond
forcefully to the problems of illicit drug use, the
administration commenced a period of whirlwind activity. Each of
the three new avenues of response-methadone treatment,
international negotiations, and domestic drug law enforcement
programs-were vigorously pursued in an attempt to launch a
comprehensive attack on the perceived problems. Funding was
increased commensurately. In his message to Congress the
president had requested a supplemental budget of $155 million to
bolster the new drug programs. When passed by Congress, this
supplemental appropriation raised the FY 72 drug budget to $418
million-four times what it had been only two years earlier.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">Treatment. When he took office in 1971,
President Nixon's new drug advisor, Dr. Jerome Jaffe, turned
first to the problems of the Vietnam soldier and veteran, among
whom rates of addiction were reported to be extraordinarily high.
The drug treatment programs of the Veterans Administration (VA)
were expanded; many new centers opened, enabling the VA to
attract more addicted veterans into treatment. And to stem the
reported flow of drug-addicted soldiers returning to the United
States, the </font><font size="2">Defense Department initiated a
massive urinalysis detection program to screen all Vietnam
servicemen for illicit drug use before they left Southeast Asia;
any heroin- or opiate-using soldiers testing positive were to be
detained for treatment and rehabilitation. President Nixon
informed Congress, &quot;We will be requesting legislation to
permit the military services to retain for treatment any
individual due for discharge who is a narcotic addict. All of our
servicemen must be accorded the right to rehabilitation. </font><font
size="1">1134 </font><font size="2">In all, nearly $50 million of
the president's supplemental budget was applied to expanding the
drug treatment and rehabilitation capabilities of the Defense
Department and Veterans Administration.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The SAODAP staff also immediately assumed
responsibility for directing the expansion of drug treatment
programs throughout the United States. Although NIMH received an
additional $51 million for treatment and rehabilitation as a
result of the supplemental budget, raising its total treatment
and rehabilitation budget to $100 million, control of the
expenditure of these funds was largely shifted from NIMH to
SAODAP and the White House staff. With respct to program
expansion, the emphasis was placed on heroin addiction treatment
and &quot;there was a massive expansion of methadone maintenance
programs throughout the country. </font><font size="1">&quot;35</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The first new goal of treatment was to enable
any addict who wished it to obtain it without delay. This meant
eliminating the waiting lists for entry at many programs, and
expanding treatment in communities where it was needed but not
yet available. When Dr. Jaffe assumed responsibilities in June
1971, federally funded treatment programs were located in 54
cities; only eighteen months later the number of cities involved
had quadrupled to 214 </font><font size="1">.36 </font><font
size="2">The speed and size of this expansion was dramatic by any
account. The earliest available federal estimate places the
number of clients in federally funded treatment programs at just
ovar twenty thousand in October 1971; by December 1972 the figure
was over sixty thousand </font><font size="1">.37</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The only recognized approaches for heroin
addiction other than the expanding methadone treatment were
abstinence oriented and usually took place in a residential
community setting. While popular and sonletimes effective
treatment approaches for small numbers of addicts, these
abstinence programs had not and-according to federal policy
makerscould not have a significant impact on urban crime.
Methadone thus became a new hope, in spite of the objections of
the Food and Drug Administration about insufficient research or
the opposition from minority communities about the underlying
philosophy of using one addictive drug to treat another </font><font
size="1">.311 </font><font size="2">In December 1972, the Food
and Drug Administration published new regulations which loosened
federal controls over methadone, changing its status from that of
an investigational new drug to a new drug requiring ongoing,
long-term study </font><font size="1">.39 </font><font size="2">By
October 1973, nearly <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">eighty thousand persons were enrolled in
methadone maintenance programs </font><font size="1">.40 </font><font
size="2">Some of these programs were federally funded; all
operated with federal government approval.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">From the government's perspective, methadone
treatment programs had certain advantages over therapeutic
community programs. Methadone allowed greater numbers of people
to be treated in fewer programs, thus making rapid program
expansion easier. For a large number of heroin addicts unable to
successfully remain drug-free, the expansion of methadone
programs offered an invaluable alternative to heroin addiction.
Moreover, the cost per client of methadone maintenance was
substantially less than the cost in a therapeutic community. And
although methadone treatment could not meet the public's demand
for drug abstinence, it could satisfy the even more popular
demand for a reduction in heroin-related crime. Finally,
methadone programs staffed with medical doctors and operated in
more traditional medical clinical style could be more easily
understood by the public. The encounter sessions and heavy
psychological orientation of the therapeutic community were often
misunderstood, even though the drug-free orientation was
commended. Thus, the expansion of heroin treatment
programs-particularly using methadone treatment-became SAODAP's
first objective.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">International Activities. </font></b><font
size="2">In his June 1971 message to Congress, President Nixon
had proposed an all-out global war on international drug
trafficking. To dramatize his intentions, Nixon called together
the U.S ambassadors to Turkey, France, Mexico, Luxembourg,
Thailand, the Republic of Vietnam, and the United Nations to
discuss ways to encourage greater cooperation from other nations
in the effort to control the illegal growing and trafficking of
opium worldwide. &quot;I sought to make it . . . clear,&quot; he
told Congress of this meeting, &quot;that I consider the heroin
addiction of American citizens an international problem of grave
concern to this Nation, and I instructed our Ambassadors to make
this clear to their liost governments. We want good relations
with othe@r countries, but we cannot buy good relations at the
expense of temporizing on this prob-</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">lem </font><font size="1">. -41</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Two weeks later President Nixon formally
announced that the Government of Turkey had agreed to impose a
total ban on opium poppy cultivation following the 1972 harvest.
In return the United States pledged $35.7 million in aid over a
five-year period to compensate Turkey for the projected financial
loss on legitimate sales of opium, and to help Turkish farmers
develop substitute crops offering new sources of income. The
agreement was hailed as a &quot;most significant
breakthrough&quot; even though the ban was not to take effect
until a year after its announcement </font><font size="1">.42 </font><font
size="2">The Turkish agreement was intended to help launch a
concentrated American<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">effort to halt all illicit opium production
throughout the world. During the following twelve months,
however, that effort far surpassed any tangible results.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In September 1971 President Nixon established
a new Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, to
oversee the further development of U.S. international drug
control efforts. The Cabinet Committee, chaired by the Secretary
of State, directed the U.S. embassies in fifty-nine countries to
prepare Narcotics Control Action Plans to be used as a basis for
negotiating bilateral agreements with foreign countries in
furtherance of U.S. international drug control programs.
Apparently, however, it was decided that other countries were not
to be offered the same type of broad-based economic assistance
which had been extended to Turkey. Rather, the Narcotics Control
Action Plans were to be more limited in scope, essentially
offering law enforcement assistance to improve the
&quot;intelligence capability and law enforcement capacity of the
host </font><font size="1">. `43 </font><font size="2">Furthermore,
whereas Turkey had been offered the &quot;carrot,&quot; other
nations were threatened with the &quot;stick&quot; of, among
other things, termination of economic and military assistance </font><font
size="1">.44 </font><font size="2">This change in strategy
suggests that the administration was aware, even before the
Turkish ban took effect, of the severe limitations of this
approach. There simply were too many countries where opium could
be grown and converted to heroin for sale in the lucrative U.S.
market </font><font size="1">.45 </font><font size="2">It would
have been difficult to negotiate similar agreements with all
other potential &quot;source&quot; countries, and even if
diplomatically possible the cost would have been prohibitive.
Moreover, because of the remoteness of many areas from their
governments, not every country could successfully impose an opium
ban even if it agreed to try. Gradually, therefore, international
interdiction efforts replaced prevention of opium cultivation as
the major objective of the U.S. international drug control
effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Thus, despite active presidential involvement,
no dramatic bilateral agreements other than that with Turkey and
the aforementioned one with France were produced to show success
on the international front.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In addition to bilateral efforts, efforts were
also made to strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1961
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the governing international
agreement on illicit drug control. In 1971 the United States
submitted proposed amendments to the Single Convention which were
largely directed toward improving controls on illicit opium
cultivation in source countries. These amendments were formally
agreed upon at a plenipotentiary conference in 1972 and submitted
to the signatory countries for their ratification. The Nixon
administration apparently regarded the amendments as a bold new
approach in international narcotics control, despite the
ineffectiveness of the basic treaty </font><font size="1">.41,</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In return for strengthening the 1961 Single
Convention, the opium growing countries pressured the United
States to support a second international agreement which would
for the first time place multinational controls on synthetic,
&quot;psychotropic&quot; drugs such as hallucinogens,
amphetamines, barbiturates, and tranquilizers. This treaty, also
drafted in 1971, became known as the Psychotropic Convention.47
The opium-producing countries viewed its ratification as a
demonstration of the industrialized nations' seriousness about
controlling the spread of nonnarcotic drug misuse. American
support of the Psychotropic Convention thus became a necessary
quid pro quo for support from the opium-producing nations on
strengthening the Single Convention.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">President Nixon sent the Psychotropic
Convention to the Senate for approval on June 29, 1971. The
proposed treaty met strong opposition because it threatened to
limit domestic flexibility in regulating various psychoactive
drugs. It was argued that the treaty would further remove the
medical and scientific professions from decision-making
responsibilities in U.S. domestic drug policy. To date neither
the Psychotropic Convention nor the changes in domestic law that
it would have required have been passed.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">Domestic Drug Law Enforcement. </font></b><font
size="2">Until 1970 BNDD and its principal predecessor, the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, were often accused of concentrating
too much law enforcement effort on users and street dealers in
order to inflate the number of arrests made. In 1970 BNDD claimed
this policy had been reversed, with efforts being redirected to
the higher levels of the illicit drug distribution structure.
BNDD director John Ingersoll explained the anticipated result of
this change to a House Appropriations subcommittee in March 1970.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The shift in emphasis of federal narcotic and
dangerous drug law enforcement from the addict, abuser, and
small-time street peddler to the <b>im</b>portant illicit
traffickers and illegal supply sources will undoubtedly result in
fewer total arrests. But those made should have a greater impact
on the supply of narcotics and drugs available for distribution
to the consumers in this country than a larger number of less
significant arrests. 48</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, in 1971 the administration sought to
increase the number of arrests by getting BNDD to move once again
against street-level dealers.49 The administration apparently
believed that this would suggest a more active and successful
&quot;offensive&quot; in its &quot;war&quot; on illicit drugs and
drug users. BNDD resisted the change, contending that such
efforts should be carried out by state and local agencies, and it
continued to go after the higher levels of the drug distribution
systems. Like NIMH, BNDD was not immediately responsive to the
administration's wishes. And so once again the White House
created a new agency under direct White House control. In January
1972 the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE) was created
by executive order within the justice Department.50 ODALE was
made &quot;responsible for the development and implementation of
a concentrated program throughout the federal government for the
enforcement of federal laws relating to the prevention of drug
abuse and for cooperation with state and local governments in the
enforcement of their<b> </b>drug abuse laws </font><font size="1">.&quot;51
</font><font size="2">The director of ODALE was also made a
special consultant to the president for drug-abuse law
enforcement, thus becoming the nation's chief drug law
enforcement spokesman.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Within a month after its establishment, ODALE
had selected thirty three target cities and had deployed strike
forces consisting of federal investigators and agents, assistant
U.S. attorneys, and state and local police officers. These strike
forces concentrated on the lower and middle levels of the
domestic heroin distribution systems, and, according to one
observer, -were instructed -to &quot;make arrests by any lawful
means possible, even if it meant bypassing the normal channels. </font><font
size="1">`52 </font><font size="2">By combining the<b> </b>specialized
enforcement authorities and powers of various federal agencies
e.g., the Internal Revenue Service, Customs, BNDD, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms Agency, etc. -ODALE was in a unique position to
&quot;bypass normal channels.&quot; The strike forces were
sufficiently funded to be able to make extensive use of
undercover agents and &quot;buy money&quot; to purchase drugs and
pay infofmants; investigative grand juries were empaneled; and
ODALE was empowered to use court-authorized wiretaps and
&quot;no-knock&quot; warrants in making arrests. As expected, the
number of arrests rose quickly and the increased figures were
publicized. Rapidly and dramatically, ODALE became a prominent,
highly visible part of the administration's &quot;war on
drugs.&quot;<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Congressional Response: Passage of the Drug Abuse
Office and Treatment Act of 1972<br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Congress responded to President Nixon's
challenge for quick and decisive action by passing the Drug Abuse
Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (P. L. 92-255), just nine months
after his June 1971 message and a year in advance of the
scheduled completion of the second report of the National
Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse </font><font size="1">.51 </font><font
size="2">This new legislation reorganized a major part of the
federal drug effort, effected important changes in the roles of
state and local government in the planning and funding of drug
treatment services, and expanded the overall size of the federal
drug effort by voting higher budget authorizations. Compared with
most major legislation, action on this bill was quick and
thorough: Two Senate committees and one House committee held
hearings on the proposed legislation; after the Senate and House
passed differing versions, a Conference<b> </b>Committee ironed
out the differences, and then both bodies passed the compromise
legislation by unanimous votes.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The final wording of the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act showed Congress and the president to be in general
agreement on the best organizational arrangements for effectively
coordinating the federal drug effort. The basic
&quot;supply&quot; and &quot;demand&quot; approach was adopted,
and SAODAP was established to coordinate and oversee the
development of federal drug-abuse prevention activities,* the
&quot;demand&quot; side of the equation. Congress acceded to the
president's request that SAODAP be made a part of the executive
office of the president. Since at this time the question of the
limits of executive authority was uppermost in the minds of many
legislators, this was generally interpreted as a strong
affirmation of congressional intent to deal decisively with the
drug issue. Congress agreed with the president that SAODAP need
be only a temporary agency, and established June 30, 1975 as the
date by which SAODAP -would be -replaced by a new National
Institute on Drug Abuse, operating within the traditional
channels of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">SAODAP's primary responsibilities were to
reorganize and direct the federal programs in drug treatment,
rehabilitation, education, prevention, training, and research.
Moreover, SAODAP would be responsible for coordinating these
&quot;demand&quot; efforts with the federal drug law enforcement
programs, though the agency would have no authority over the
latter. SAODAP's position was a difficult one: Congress and the
president expected it to coordinate, &quot;from outside and
above,&quot; the activities of fourteen agencies that until then
had existed in relative autonomy; to attain its goal in a short
period of time; and to coordinate these activities in a field
where there was considerable disagreement as to the most
effective means of dealing with the problems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">*The legislation used the term &quot;drug
abuse prevention&quot; to refer to all non-law-enforcement drug
efforts including treatment and rehabilitation; education,
prevention, and training; and research. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">To help the new agency accomplish these
formidable tasks, Congress included in the legislation several
provisions designed to insure a coordinated federal drug effort. </font><font
size="1">54 </font><font size="2">First, it established SAODAP as
a kind of mini-Office of Management and Budget, though limited to
the drug abuse prevention programs of the various federal
agencies. -SAODAP was empowered to reprogram an agency's
drug-abuse prevention funds if necessary to insure greater
conformity with the overall policies and priorities it would set.
Second, Congress established a special fund of $40 million for
SAODAP for each of three fiscal years &quot;to provide additional
incentives to Federal departments and agencies to develop more
effective drug abuse prevention functions and to give the
Director [of SAODAP] the flexibility to encourage, and respond
quickly and efficiently to, the development of promising programs
and approaches.&quot; Although Congress stipulated that at least
90 percent of these funds had to be spent by federal agencies
other than SAODAP, they had to be spent according to SAODAP
directives. Third, SAODAP received the power of &quot;management
oversight review.&quot; This -power, although never actually
exercised, gave it the authority to assume the drug-abuse
prevention functions of an uncooperative federal agency for up to
thirty days. The explicit legislative granting of such power is
very rare; the potential authority is usually enough to persuade
any recalcitrants of the advantages of cooperation.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the purpose of this reorganization
was to streamline, coordinate, and make more efficient the
federal response, it also effectively muted opposition. In fact,
when he signed the legislation enacting SAODAP, President Nixon
warned that &quot;heads will roll&quot; if the agency directors
did not cooperate with the new office.51 The president named Dr.
Jaffe -to direct SAODAP and expand the work he had already begun
under executive order. When SAODAP formally began in March 1972,
policy and programmatic decisions had essentially been made; it
was simply a matter of carrying them out. What reservations there
were within and without government were largely ignored or
overridden. Recommendations such as those put forth by the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse in 1972 and 1973
were quickly rejected because they were inconsistent with the
policies and programs the administration had already chosen to
pursue.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In sum, up<b> </b>to and through the 1972
presidential elections the Nixon administration sought to be <i>(1)
responsive </i>to the public concern about heroin addiction and
heroin-related crime, (2) <i>effective, </i>in contrast to the
lack of success which had characterized past drug efforts, and
(3) <i>quick, </i>so that &quot;progress&quot; could be claimed
at the earliest possible moment. Most of the bureaucratic
restraints which might have impeded the Nixon administration's
&quot;war on drugs&quot; had been overcome, so its potential to
&quot;solve the drug problem&quot; could be tested.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="2">Deemphasis of the Drug Issue and Emergence
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse </font></b><font size="2">(NI15A)
<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Eighteen months after the enactment of the
Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act, and only ten months after
his reelection, President Nixon signaled a change in direction by
announcing in September 1973, &quot;We have turned the corner on
drug addiction in the United States.&quot;511 Although caveats
followed this declaration, the announcement was an important
milestone in the history of the government's response to illicit
drugs. In addition to being a statement of &quot;victory,&quot;
the president's message also implied disengagement from the war.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In the days and weeks following this
announcement, administration officials offered evidence in
support of the President's statement </font><font size="1">.57 </font><font
size="2">This &quot;evidence&quot; included claims of an apparent
shortage of heroin on the East Coast, an increase in the street
price of the drug, an increase in the number of drug seizures and
arrests, the expansion of drug treatment availability and
utilization, a reported decline in the incidence of new heroin
use, and heroin-related crime being down. Not everyone agreed:
Some challenged the accuracy of the statistics, others challenged
their interpretation. Still others accepted the evidence, but
cautioned that the downward trend might only be temporary.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In retrospect, it is clear that the &quot;turn
the corner&quot; speech was based on more than statistics. Other
factors were also at work, and a brief review of certain events
which occurred between June 1971 and September 1973 will help to
explain the turnabout.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">First, the 1972 presidential election had
passed. Though it is difficult to assess what part this may have
played in the administration's response to the drug issue, there
is little doubt that it had some importance. Illicit drugs were a
major political issue, and anyone running for national elective
office was expected to address it.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Second, the armies of addicted Vietnam
soldiers never materialized. The severity of the problem had been
overestimated; among those soldiers who did use opium or heroin
in Vietnam, subsequent research showed that relatively few were
either dysfunctional or addicted users after their return to the
United States </font><font size="1">.58</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Third, public interest in the drug issued
waned. There were a host of possible explanations for this: The
problems had been overdrarnatized and public fears exaggerated,
the rate of urban crime had leveled off, other domestic issues
had taken precedence, the media had run out of things to say, or
it was simply part of the natural ebb and flow of public
interest. Whatever the reasons, there is little question that the
public's attention had become diverted elsewhere.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Fourth, the new avenues of response to the use
of illicit drugs, which had been pursued with varying degrees of
success, had in their combined effect failed to measure up to
original expectations, and it seemed unlikely that any further
improvement would result from a widened or intensified effort in
these areas.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For example, federal law enforcement efforts
against street-level drug activities had backfired. ODALE was not
always well received by local law enforcement agencies, and its
ability to have a significant impact on street-level drug
activities was seriously questioned.59 In April 1973, ODALE
agents were involved in two criticized &quot;no-knock&quot;
entries into homes in Collinsville, Illinois. The events in
Collinsville precipitated a thorough review of the agency and a
reevaluation of the need for unique enforcement authorities
against drug dealers and users. In effect, ODALE had gone too far
in &quot;bypassing the normal channels.&quot; Instead of becoming
a positive symbol of how to win a war on drugs, ODALE became the
focal point of criticisms about the excesses of that war. On June
30, 1973, ODALE was abolished in yet another drug-law-enforcement
agency reorganizations The position of special consultant to the
president for drug-abuse law enforcement matters was also
abolished, and Congress subsequently repealed the no-knock and
preventive detention sections of the federal statutes. Federal
law enforcement strategy reverted to a concentration on the upper
levels of drug distribution systems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Turkish opium ban did contribute to a
shortage of heroin in 1973, principally in the eastern United
States. But because the government had been unable to negotiate
any other significant bilateral agreements, it became clear that
the Turkish ban would have only a temporary effect. The period
immediately after the Turkish ban took effect was the high point
in terms of any practical significance which it could have had.
The demand for heroin and the consequent profits to be realized
were bound to generate new supplies and supply routes-it was only
a matter of time. Bilateral agreements thus failed to provide any
lasting &quot;solution.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drug treatment programs, methadone programs in
particular, had been expanded to a point where everyone
voluntarily seeking treatment could get it. Overall, the quality
of the treatment offered in methadone as well as drug-free
programs improved. Program personnel gained experience and with
it increasing expertise. Increased funding assured greater
program stability. However, treatment supply exceeded treatment
demand; in this crucial respect the administration's goal had
been reached: Unless more people were to enter treatment, the
maximum short-term impact of this approach had also probably been
reached.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The administration, through SAODAP, had also
achieved a more coordinated federal effort on the
&quot;demand&quot; side. Much overlapping, duplication, and
inefficiency had been eliminated. Within the framework of its
policies and programs, the federal response was functioning much
more smoothly.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">And the budget was sufficient; the total FY 74
drug budget was $760 million. Lack of funds no longer limited the
potential of the federal drug response; at the same time there
was no indication that increasing the budget further would
measurably improve the situation.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There seemed little need to any longer
maintain a strong White House identification with the drug issue.
Within the framework of the policies and programs the
administration had chosen to pursue the situation was probably as
good as it would get in the foreseeable future. Politically, this
may have suggested to the federal government that the issue could
be returned to a more &quot;normal&quot; status within the
bureaucracy and be dealt with like most other urban and social
problems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Whether or not the president's assessment of
the situation in his &quot;turn the corner&quot; speech was
correct, it triggered a turn in government activity in the drug
field. The more extraordinary measures of the previous years
could no longer be justified, On the contrary, it became
necessary for government budget- and policymakers to make major
changes in the federal drug effort in order to prove that a
victory had been won. Even before the president's pronouncement,
drug law enforcement programs had been moved away from active
White House involvement to a newly formed Drug Enforcement
Administration within the Department of justice. Federal efforts
against street-level drug dealers and users were quietly
abandoned. International efforts to curtail illicit drug
cultivation and trafficking continued, but were less publicized.
SAODAP remained in existence until June 30, 1975, but it lost its
influence after the &quot;turn the corner&quot; speech. The trend
in budget requests was also reversed: The overall treatment and
rehabilitation budget for FY 75 (proposed in January 1974) was
$33 million less than in the previous fiscal year, marking the
first drug budget cutback in the Nixon administrations
Furthermore, the administration sought increasingly to shift drug
programming responsibilities to the states, under the aegis of
its &quot;new federalism&quot; policies.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The combined effect of these actions was
significantly to reduce the visibility and controversy of the
federal drug effort. This was beneficial in the sense that the
drug issue was temporarily freed from the political rhetoric that
had bound it. But the loss of momentum was unfortunate to the
extent that the government's opportunity to shape a more
comprehensive approach to drug problems in America was not
decisively acted upon.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One of the most important and lasting
byproducts of this chain of events was the creation of a new
agency, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) within HEW.
This was created by a departmental reorganization announced by
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on September 23,
1973. The announcement occurred more than a year in advance of
the congressional requirement in the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act of 1972 for the creation of such an agency no later
than December 30, 1974 </font><font size="1">.113</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Organizationally, NIDA was made a fourth-level
agency in HEW. As Figure 1.3 illustrates, the director of NIDA is
one of three agency directors reporting to the administrator of
the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental. Health Administration
(ADAMHA). The administrator of ADAMHA is, in turn, one of six
Public Health Service officials reporting to the assistant
secretary for health, who in turn is one of many assistant
secretaries reporting to the secretary of HEW.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Despite this organizational arrangement, NIDA
was charged with providing &quot;leadership, policies and goals
for the Federal effort in the prevention, control and treatment
of narcotic addiction and drug abuse, and the rehabilitation of
affected individuals.&quot; Clearly, NIDA was intended to succeed
SAODAP as the lead agency on the &quot;demand&quot; side of the
federal drug effort.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But NIDA was not and could not be a substitute
for SAODAP. SAODAP was designed to be a policy and coordinating
office, with minimal direct program responsibilities. NIDA was
given the bulk of drug treatment program responsibilities but
very limited coordinating powers. Much of SAODAP's authority was
contained in P. L. 92-255, and most of those powers were not
transferable to NIDA without congressional approval. Even if the
powers were to be transferred, the decisions and directions taken
by NIDA, buried as it was within HEW, would obviously have
attracted less attention and carried less weight than when the
very same actions were announced by a White House office.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the earlier-than-anticipated
emergence of NIDA and diminution of SAODAP made many of those
involved with drug treatment and prevention anxious about the
future, some found solace in the fact that the drug treatment and
prevention effort had been removed from the immediate control of
NIMH. Under the HEW reorganization NIDA was established as
separate and equal to NIMH. Similarly, responsibility in the
alcoholism field had been removed from NIMH and given to another
new separate and equal agency, the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism. The effect of removing NIMH control from
these fields was to allow each to more fully develop its own
approaches. Inasmuch as drug problems in many respects lie
outside traditional mental health concerns, the creation of NIDA
independent of NIMH was applauded by many people in the drug
treatment and prevention fields.<br>

</font> </p>

<p> <b>The Arguments for and against the Continuation of SAODAP<br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Even though NIDA was in full operation by
mid-1974, SAODAP continued to function until its expiration date
of June 30, 1975, though with greatly reduced staff levels and
diminished bureaucratic status. It was maintained to exercise
those coordinating functions which could not legally be
transferred to NIDA. Moreover, it provided the drug treatment and
prevention fields with a symbolic organizational parity with drug
law enforcement concerns, a role which NIDA could not fulfill.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">By early 1975, questions were being raised
about the implications of SAODAP's impending demise. The future
direction and scope of the federal drug effort seemed uncertain.
Gerald Ford had succeeded Richard Nixon as president, and Ford's
views and commitment regarding the drug field were largely
unknown.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In March 1975, Senator William Hathaway,
chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics,
introduced legislation amending the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act of 1972. The proposed legislation called for a
modified version of SAODAP, to be called the Office of Drug Abuse
Prevention Policy (ODAPP), which would continue certain
policymaking and coordinating functions of the predecessor
agency. The expiration of SAODAP along with other provisions of
P. L. 92255-including funding authorizations for future federal
treatment, prevention, and research efforts-gave Congress its
first opportunity to review both the 1972 legislation and the
status of the federal response.114</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This congressional review prompted President
Ford to direct the Domestic Council to undertake its own
assessment in order to define more clearly the administration's
drug policies and prepare the administration's response to any
congressional action </font><font size="1">.6' </font><font
size="2">These congressional and executive office assessments
reconsidered the tone and approach of the government's response
to illicit drug use in a distinctively less politicized way than
had marked the crisis atmosphere during the Nixon administration.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Both Congress and the administration sought to
back away from the warlike rhetoric of the Nixon administration.
The emphasis on &quot;victories&quot; and &quot;solutions&quot;
was replaced by more cautious statements about &quot;goals&quot;
and &quot;objectives.&quot; Congress amended its Declaration of
National Policy by adopting more temperate wording. The Domestic
Council Report to the president was even more straightforward
with respect to its assessment of goals:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">We should stop raising unrealistic
expectations of total elimination of drug abuse from our society.
At the same time, we should in no way signal tacit acceptance of
drug abuse or a lessened commitment to continue aggressive
efforts aimed at eliminating it entirely. The sobering fact is
that some members of any society will seek escape from the
stresses of life </font><font size="1">through drug use.
Prevention, education, treatment, and rehabilitation will curtail
their number, but will not eliminate drug use entirely. As long
as there is demand, criminal drug traffickers will make some
supply available, provided that the potential profits outweigh
the risks of detection and punishment. Vigorous supply reduction
efforts will reduce, but not eliminate, supply. And reduction in
the supply of one drug may only cause abuse prone individuals to
turn to another substance.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">All of this indicates that, regrettably, we
will probably always have a drug problem of some proportion.
Therefore we must be prepared to continue our efforts and our
commitment indefinitely, in order to contain the problem at a
minimal level, and in order to minimize the adverse social costs
of drug abuse.&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">This acknowledgment of the persistence of drug
problems and the impossibility of achieving a quick victory had
no direct effect on the operational aspects of the various drug
programming efforts; it only sought to adjust public expectations
of them.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Congress and the Ford administration relieved
some of the anxieties felt in the drug treatment field after the
&quot;turn the corner&quot; speech by halting the one-year budget
cutback which had been initiated with that speech. Although
questions were raised about the adequacy of the administration's
budget proposal, many agencies and individuals were pleased
-simply by this temporizing action.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">More serious difficulties between Congress and
the president arose over whether some modified version of SAODAP
should be continued. Many in Congress argued for such an agency;
President Ford and his administration were opposed to it. The
proponents of a successor agency to SAODAP contended that White
House coordination of the drug effort was still necessary <b>.7 </b>They
held that without some successor to SAODAP the earlier
organizational Difficulties could easily reappear, maintaining
that the logic which dictated congressional approval of SAODAP in
1972 extended to the proposed Office of Drug Abuse Prevention
Policy in 1975. Congressional proponents further argued that
NIDA, as a fourth-level HEW agency, would never be able to
exercise any real control over the &quot;demand&quot; side of the
federal drug effort. They pointed cut that 51 percent of all
federal expenditures for drug prevention programs were made by
agencies other than NIDA, and thus concluded that &quot;for NIDA
to coordinate and lead the Federal drug abuse prevention effort,
both from a structural and from a fiscal perspective, would be
difficult at best and, more likely, actually
impossible.&quot;&quot;&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">President Ford and the Domestic Council Task
Force agreed on the need for continued coordination, but they
differed with the proponents of ODAPP on the way to achieve it.
Rather than have a special White House agency just to coordinate
the &quot;demand&quot; side of the federal drug effort, President
Ford opted for &quot;strong Cabinet management&quot; of the
program. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In April 1976 he created the Cabinet Committee
for Drug Abuse Prevention (CCDAP), chaired by the Secretary of
HEW, which included the Secretaries of Defense and Labor and the
administrator of the Veterans Administration. CCDAF was given
responsibility for the oversight and coordination of all federal
activities involving drug prevention, treatment, and
rehabilitation, integrating the efforts of all the cabinet
departments and agencies involved. Moreover, CCDAP was expected
to &quot;give HEW, ADAMHA, and NIDA the organizational strength
and authority to provide the interdepartmental and interagency
coordination needed to maintain the progress which has been made
in drug abuse treatment and prevention. &quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">ODAPP's sponsors sought to extend its
projected responsibilities of review, -formulation, and
coordination of drug policies and priorities to all drug policies
and programs, including drug law enforcement programs and
international negotiations. This was to be the major difference
between ODAPP and SAODAP, whose authority had been confined to
drug treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention, and
research. This proposed extension of authority for ODAPP gained
support for several reasons: First, it sought to reconceptualize
the federal drug effort by bridging the gap between the
enforcement and treatment approaches. ODAPP was envisioned as the
forum in government by which the long-standing philosophical
conflicts between the medical and law enforcement communities
could be faced and, ideally, reconciled.70 At the very least,
ODAPP was being designed to insure a more comprehensive review of
the drug programs and policies of the various federal agencies.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Second, this extension of ODAPP's authority
was proposed at a time when the balance between drug law
enforcement and drug treatment and prevention programs was once
again shifting in favor of law enforcement.71 The drug law
enforcement budget was rising while drug treatment and prevention
funds remained level; and, bureaucratically, DEA was a higher
level agency within the justice Department than was NIDA in HEW.
ODAPP was supported partly in the hope that it could keep a
balance between these two principal agencies and their respective
approaches to the drug problem.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Third, support for ODAPP stemmed from the
congressional desire to have one single administration official
with overall responsibility for national drug policy who would be
accountable to Congress. At the time Congress was considering
ODAPP, officials of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
were refusing to testify before Congress on drug policy issues,
and the directors of the various drug agencies (NIDA and DEA in
particular) spoke only for their own programs and policies. The
unresolved areas, as well as the overall concerns, of national
policy could easily be unintentionally overlooked in this
situation. ODAPP was designed to rectify this.72<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">President Ford and the Domestic Council Task
Force also recognized the need to coordinate treatment and
enforcement approaches. In its report the Domestic Council
stated, &quot;Strong coordinative mechanisms are necessary to
ensure that the efforts of these [Federal] departments and
agencies are integrated into an effective overall program, and
that the approach adopted in each is consistent with the
President's priorities.&quot;&quot; However, the administration
maintained that such coordination could be attained without a
White House agency. Instead, it chose to formalize the division
of the drug functions developed during the Nixon administration.
Thus the government's response split the effort into three
separate areas, each with a &quot;lead agency </font><font
size="1">. '174 </font><font size="2">The Drug Enforcement
Administration was designated as the &quot;lead agency&quot; for
drug law enforcement, the State Department for international
activities, and NIDA for prevention and treatment. To strengthen
interagency coordination within each functional area, President
Ford convened three separate cabinet committees, each with
oversight and coordination responsibilities within one area.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Going a step further in acknowledging some
need for &quot;program oversight and limited interagency
coordination at the Executive Office level </font><font size="1">&quot;75
</font><font size="2">President Ford and the Domestic Council
accordingly made several more recommendations.76 Foremost among
them was the recommendation that the Strategy Council on Drug
Abuse* be revitalized to provide overall policy guidance, and
that a small staff at OMB be maintained to assist the Strategy
Council and executive office in formulating drug policy. However,
these recommendations fell considerably short of a White House
Office for drug abuse.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">*The Strategy Council, mandated in 1972 by
P.L. 92-255, consists of government officials and private
citizens appointed by the president.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The argument that Congress needed one person
or office to be accountable to it for total federal drug policy
was rejected by the administration. &quot;The best places to get
such information and to seek accountability for progress,&quot;
said President Ford, &quot;are the departments and agencies which
have direct responsibility and program authority.&quot;</font><font
size="1">77</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In point of fact, the arguments raised both
for and against ODAPP were illusory. There were other ways to
satisfy the needs cited by the proponents of ODAPP, and the
creation of ODAPP would not have guaranteed the advantages
envisioned anyway. For example, the Ford administration could
have coordinated its response to the drug problems of America
without an ODAPP, just as it could have allowed the partitions
between the medical and legal approaches to continue despite
ODAPP's presence.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The ODAPP concept was <i>strongly </i>supported
by the majority of individuals, associations, and private
organizations working in the drug treatment, rehabilitation,
education, prevention, and research fields. All had felt
seriously threatened by the funding cutbacks of the Nixon
administration's last budget, and the elimination of SAODAP had
added to the uncertainty about future federal commitment.
Accordingly, these associations and organizations, many of which
had developed during the years of budget expansion, vigorously
lobbied Congress to support the small White House agency for
drugs as a sign of their support for the drug field.
Congressional spokesmen took note of the symbolic importance of
ODAPP, explaining that &quot;there is a clear danger that
elimination of that office [SAODAP or ODAPP] would have enormous
symbolic significance to this field. There is no way in which
this move [the elimination of SAODAP], coupled with recent
proposals to cut funds, can appear to be anything but a drastic
retrenchment in Federal priorities </font><font size="1">.&quot;711</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Ford administration's opposition to ODAPP
was also symbolic, but not in relation to the drug field.
President Ford had committed himself to a reduction of executive
office power and a restoration of the powers of the various
cabinet departments and federal agencies. He wished to reverse
the concentration of power in the White House which had
characterized the Nixon administrations trend to which SAODAP was
both a symbolic and a real contributor. To the Ford
administration, the negative symbolism of a new White House drug
office-even a small one-overrode any positive symbolism it might
have conveyed to the drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In March 1976, eight months after SAODAP had
expired, Congress passed legislation creating in the White House
the Office of Drug Abuse Policy (ODAP, a slight shortening of the
originally proposed name) </font><font size="1">.71, </font><font
size="2">Compared to SAODAP, ODAP was organizationally small and
its legislatively granted powers limited, but its coordinating
responsibilities extended to law enforcement and international
negotiations, thus giving it broader scope than its predecessor.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">President Ford signed the legislation creating
ODAP only because sections of the same bill contained the
necessary funding authorizations to continue federal efforts in
drug treatment and prevention. The president remained steadfastly
opposed to ODAP in principle, and in signing the legislation he
said:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I have voiced strong opposition to the
reestablishment of a special office for drug abuse in the White
House. I believe that such an office would be duplicative and
unnecessary and that it would detract from strong Cabinet
management of the Federal drug abuse program. Therefore, while I
am signing this bill because of the need for Federal funds for
drug abuse prevention and treatment, I do not intend to seek
appropriations for the new Office of Drug Abuse Policy created by
the bill. 110 </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This impasse continued throughout Ford's
presidency; ODAP had been legally constituted but remained a
&quot;paper&quot; agency with neither staff nor funds. Instead,
President Ford continued his plan for supervision of government
response to illicit drug use through three cabinet committees,
one each for law enforcement, international narcotics control,
and treatment and prevention. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="2">Government Response under Presidents Ford
and Carter<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drug problems and issues faded from the
limelight during the Ford administration, a change generally
viewed as salutary when compared to the tumultuous years
preceding it. Funding levels in all areas remained reasonably
stable, as did program operations. Although whatever gains had
resulted from the Turkish opium ban were reversed by the new
availability of Mexican heroin, no new &quot;wars&quot; were
proclaimed. Utilization of existing treatment capacity did
increase throughout the country and funding was increased to
treat several thousand more people. The Drug Enforcement
Administration continued to confiscate large amounts of illicit
drugs, but the overall impact on illicit trafficking was
marginal.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Guided by the Domestic Council's &quot;White
Paper on Drug Abuse,&quot; the Ford administration accepted the
verdict that the &quot;drug problem&quot; could not be
eliminated. Instead of trying to rally public support to end
&quot;drug abuse,&quot; the administration started seeking to
develop greater public tolerance of this ineradicable phenomenon.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the style was different and the goals
less ambitious, the Ford administration's response to illicit
drugs was largely predicated on the same assumptions about the
innate harmfulness of illicit drugs that have guided the
government's response to drugs throughout the twentieth century.
The administration's response continued to rest upon law
enforcement or quasi-enforcement strategies fundamentally
intended to prohibit new or continued use of nonapproved
psychoactive substances. Though these assumptions were not
challenged, the limits of any attempt to &quot;solve&quot; the
problems of illicit drug use were at last openly acknowl-edged-a
significant change from previous administrations.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In his one major public statement on the use
of illicit drugs, President Ford devoted less than three
paragraphs to treatment and prevention issues. The remainder of
his six-page message to Congress&quot; addressed the drug-crime
nexus, law enforcement efforts, proposals for mandatory minimum
sentences for traffickers and bail denial, the activities of
Customs, use of the Internal Revenue Service to go after
traffickers, international control and cooperation, and the like.
Support for programs in treatment and prevention was derived, as
with enforcement, from the longstanding fears and assumptions
about illicit drugs, their users, and their effects on society.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">When Jimmy Carter became president some
observers of the drug field expected swift and significant policy
and programmatic changes to result, in part because of Carter's
close association with Dr. Peter Bourne, a highly regarded drug
program expert. In March 1977, under some pressure from Congress,
President Carter activated ODAP, naming Dr. Bourne as its
director. It was believed that ODAP might devise a more unified
and coordinated government response to illicit drugs, melding the
goals and concerns of the treatment, prevention, and enforcement
communities.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No sooner had ODAP been activated, however,
than President Carter announced his intention of abolishing the
office. This announcement was made as part of the Reorganization
Plan No. 1 of 1977, in which President Carter sought to
streamline and reduce the White House staff. As a result, ODAP
expired in April 1978, after completing a series of drug policy
studies spanning the treatment, prevention, and enforcement
fields. </font><font size="1">82 </font><font size="2">ODAP's
legal functions were transferred to the president. Dr. Bourne
remained as special assistant to the president in part to
&quot;advise the President on drug policy and assist in the
coordination of interagency efforts,&quot; until his resignation
in July 1978. Several ODAP staff members were transferred to the
Domestic Policy Staff, where they continue to provide some
overall review of drug policy issues. The results of this
reorganization resemble the plan of strong cabinet management
with &quot;some&quot; executive coordination advocated by the
Ford administration.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Shortly after announcing his reorganization
plan, President Carter presented Congress with his first major
message on drug issues.113 His primary concern was the
fragmentation and lack of coordination among drug programs and
agencies. (This organizational problem has persisted in spite of
all the attention it has received.) President Carter stressed the
continuing need for international cooperation, and directed the
individual agencies involved to give the drug issues a high
priority. Like Presidents Nixon and Ford before him, Carter
stressed international law enforcement efforts to eradicate the
illicit cultivation of drugs and interrupt international
trafficking networks. And like his predecessors, he urged
Congress to ratify the Psychotropic Convention.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">With respect to law enforcement, President
Carter announced support for programs which would promise
&quot;swift and severe punishment&quot; to traffickers in drugs.
These programs include the investigation of links between
organized crime and drug trafficking, revocation of passports and
freezing assets of known major traffickers, support of
legislation raising the dollar value of property seized from and
forfeited by a drug violator through administrative action, study
of possible denial of bail or any release prior to trial for
certain major drug-traffic offenders, and the possible emendation
of the Tax Reform Act to allow for easier investigation of major
traffickers (if this would not infringe on the privacy of
citizens). For the most part, these proposals are conceptually
indistinguishable from those made by Presidents Nixon and Ford;
all sought to enact measures that would deter major drug
traffickers in the hope of reducing the availability of illicit
drugs at the street level.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As for drug treatment, President Carter called
upon NIDA to include more programs for abusers of barbiturates,
amphetamines, and combinations of drugs (including alcohol). He
supported expansion of rehabilitation and job-training programs
for former heroin addicts. President Carter also expressed the
need for better coordination of federally sponsored research
efforts on a variety of drugs, including opiates, alcohol, and
tobacco. He expressed the hope that this would save money and
&quot;lead to greater scientific understanding of addiction
problems.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In recent years the barbiturates have been
recognized as a major drug problem (this problem has resulted in
part from their widespread licit medical use). The special
attention that President Carter directed to be given to these and
other sedative-hypnotic drugs will cover the whole gamut of
federal drug response: Prescribing practices of physicians will
be reviewed, more intensive efforts will be made to prosecute
physicians who deliberately overprescribe, DEA will investigate
street marketing activities and audit companies lawfully
manufacturing the drugs, and HEW will study the question whether
barbiturates should remain on the market. In focusing such
specific attention on barbiturate abuse, President Carter took a
significant step toward extending the federal government's
response to drugs beyond a traditional concern with such illicit
drugs as heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">And in what amounted to his most significant
policy break with Presidents Nixon and Ford, Carter endorsed the
decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana for
personal use, noting that &quot;penalties against possession of a
drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of
the drug itself.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nevertheless, the overall thrust of President
Carter's first major statement on drug issues does not suggest
any fundamental changes in the specifics of government response.
The tone does suggest a less emotional approach than that of the
early 1970s; the inclusion of licit drugs which can be
dangerously misused suggests a broader understanding of the
concept of &quot;drug abuse&quot;; and the adoption of a
marijuana decriminalization position suggests that fundamental
changes in government response could occur after current policies
and programs are clearly, repeatedly shown not to work. But in a
broader context President Carter's drug statement further
reflects the tortuously slow process by which public opinion and
public policy change. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Some Concluding Thoughts <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The overriding observation which emerges from
a review of the federal government's history of response to
illicit drugs is that its drug policy changes slowly if at all.
Federal drug programs<i> </i>have changed considerably in the
past decade, but policy remains essentially unchanged. Faith
remains strong in the power of criminal sanctions to deter
illicit drug use and the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts
to eliminate that use which does occur.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Two deeply rooted premises have guided federal
response: One is that there are certain drugs which people <i>should
</i>be prohibited from using under any circumstances. The second
is that the government can then prevent their use. The first
premise is philosophical in nature, the second pragmatic.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The philosophical question of the
justification of prohibition can always be argued at great
length; there is no single &quot;answer&quot; as such. With
respect to the pragmatic issue, the belief that government can
prevent illicit drug use, there is more concrete evidence to
analyze. The experience of the 1970s clearly shows that even with
an extensive, generally efficient, and popularly supported
federal effort, it is impossible to prohibit the presence of
nonapproved drugs in American society. It is difficult to
conceive how that effort might have been expanded or intensified
to be more successful while still respecting the traditional
values of a free society.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Federal policymakers are by now generally
cognizant of the limits of current federal drug policy. Why then
do they continue to pursue the same fundamental policies? Because
the public demands it; to relax the prohibitionary goal is
tantamount to being &quot;soft on drugs&quot; (a most pejorative
term that has been used in ugly ways to cast aspersions on those
who question the wisdom of prohibition). In a democratic society,
policymakers cannot stray too far from what the public wants or
they will simply be replaced. Federal drug policy will not change
substantially until there is public support to do so.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But federal drug officials have not conveyed
to the public an understanding of the limits to their potential
accomplishments; it is far easier politically to highlight
occasionally successful programs and to emphasize long-range
goals or aspirations. Policyrnakers also seem reluctant to engage
the public in a discussion of the philosophy of drug prohibition.
One reason for this difficulty is that for many years the federal
government fueled the popular demand for drug prohibition. Yet
those who are familiar with drug policy recognize now that the
designation of certain drugs as illicit and as targets for
prohibition has roots in racism, hysteria, and sensationalism. It
is also now apparent, based on current knowledge about drugs and
their effects, that prohibition has been based on much
misinformation and misunderstanding.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the context of these general observations,
the following concluding thoughts are offered:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. The most important contribution which
federal drug agencies can now make to future drug policy is to
provide the American public with opportunities to carefully and
sensibly reexamine the wisdom of drug prohibition. Even though
they are now more than five years old, the two reports of the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse would still make
an excellent starting point for this reappraisal process.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Until the drug issue becomes less
vulnerable to sensationalism, there is no way to guarantee that
excesses in the federal drug effort, such as those of the early
1970s, can be prevented. Federal drug policies and programs ought
to be the product of careful, thoughtful consideration.
Impulsive, hastily conceived programs such as ODALE can do great
damage to our society.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. The federal drug effort needs greater
coordination; the treatment, enforcement, and international
components cannot be left to go -their own -ways. Coordination
without &quot;teeth&quot; has beer, more superficial. than
substantive.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">4. From a policy, bureaucratic, and budgetary
perspective, criminal justice and drug law enforcement agencies
have been too dominant in our national response to the abuse of
psychoactive drugs. This dominance has not served society well;
rather than bringing out the best in us, it has led us to rely
too heavily on our meaner, more punitive instincts.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="2">APPENDIX A: A Budget Perspective <br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Overview of Fiscal Years 1970-1978. It is
impossible to account exactly for all funds expended on the
federal government's response to illicit drugs. The figures
presented in this report are, however, sufficiently accurate to
be used for an overall fiscal analysis and review of significant
trends and priorities. Table 1. 1 presents the federal drug
budget by function for fiscal years 1970-1978.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">From July 1969 through September 1978, the
federal government spent approximately $5.7 billion on its
drug-related efforts. Of this total, $2.4 billion was spent on
treatment and rehabilitation, $2.3 billion on law enforcement,
and the remainder ($.95 billion) was spent on education,
prevention, and training ($.4 billion), research ($.4 billion),
and planning ($.15 billion).</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The effect which the &quot;war on drug
abuse&quot; had on the budget is clearly demonstrable beginning
with FY 72 (which began July 1, 1971, two weeks after President
Nixon's special message to Congress). (See Figure 1.4.) The most
rapid expansion of the federal drug budget occurred during FY 72
and FY 73. After FY 74 and Nixon's &quot;turn the corner&quot;
speech, the rate of budget expansion slowed considerably. (In
fact, if adjusted for inflation, the buying power of the federal
drug effort was lower in FY 78 than it had been since FY 72.)
Still, although the annual rate of growth of the federal drug
budget slowed, the absolute size at which its annual total
more-or-less leveled off was much higher than ever before. The
average annual federal drug expenditure for the years 1974-78 was
over $800 million; for 1973-78-a six-and-one-quarter-year
period-it totaled $5 billion.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Perhaps the most useful index of federal
priorities in the drug area is a comparison of the treatment and
rehabilitation budget with the law enforcement budget. Figure 1.4
displays the rapid growth of the treatment and rehabilitation bud
get between FY 71 and FY 73; however, since FY 73 it has
alternately declined and increased, ending up at nearly the same
level as in FY 73 ($366 million in FY 78 compared to $350 million
in FY 73). The drug law enforcement budget, on the other hand,
has risen steadily, doubling in size from $200 to $400 million in
the same time period. <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1004.gif"><font size="2"> <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If we look at these items in a slightly
different way-as a percentage of the total federal drug
expenditure for each year-we find a rapid expansion of the
treatment and rehabilitation strategy between FY 71 and FY 73 and
detectable slippage since FY 73 (Figure 1.5). In contrast, the
percentage of the total drug effort allocated to law enforcement
rose from a low of 29 percent in FY 73 to 45 percent, its highest
level, in FY 78.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This apparent reversal in strategy in the
period FY 71-73-with treatment more heavily funded than
enforcement-is explainable insofar as one accepts the thesis that
drug treatment programs-in particular, methadone treatment
programs-derived at least part of their government support from
concern more with reducing criminal recidivism that with reducing
heroin recidivism. If so, then recent government response to
illicit drug use has remained rather consistently dominated by an
enforcement approach, as indeed it has since the early 1900s.
Moreover, insofar as drug treatment has been funded because of
its crime reduction potential, it may have been in part
ill-defined as &quot;treatment&quot; in a traditional health
context. The pursuit of this avenue of response-crime reduction
through treatment-may offer a reasonable explanation for the
brief reversal during FY 71-73 in the traditional balance between
treatment and enforcement approaches. If so, this adds greater
credence to the contention that the underlying assumptions <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1005.gif"><font size="2"> </font><font size="1">and
strategies of the government's response to illicit drugs has
changed very little in the 1970s.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <b><font size="1">The FY </font></b><font size="1">79 <b>Budget
Request. </b>President Carter released his proposed FY 79 budget
on January 20, 1978. Inasmuch as this budget request is the first
one fully prepared by the Carter administration it is logical to
turn to it for any signs of impending changes in the government
response to drugs. The currently available budget documents
suggest that it will remain essentially unchanged. However, a
complete analysis is precluded because neither OMB'nor ODAP has
compiled drug-related expenditures on an agency-by-agency basis
as they previously did every year since 1971. Without that
compilation it is not possible to add in agency expenditures for
third-party reimbursement, nor is it possible to estimate
accurately either the non-line-item expenditures of federal
agencies or how block grants will be used.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Thus at this time it is not possible to
include the FY 79 figures in our tables and figures. This absence
of an overall analysis of the drug budget by either OMB or ODAP
could allow a return to a situation where agency drug budgets
dictate overall federal drug policy rather than the other way
around.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="fada1006.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">In the absence of an overall analysis of the
federal drug budget, the budget proposals for NIDA and DEA-the
two principal federal drug agencies-may serve as a useful
surrogate. NIDA's budget will increase to $275.2 million in FY
79, a $13.1 million increase over FY 78. The greater part of this
increase-$11.8 million-is earmarked for research, in response to
the preliminary recommendations of the president's Commission on
Mental Health. NIDA will continue to support a treatment capacity
of 102,000, with a maximum local matching rate of 40 percent; the
treatment budget will remain at $161 million.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The Drug Enforcement Administration will
receive a modest budgetary increase if President Carter's request
is approved; the DEA budget for FY 79 will be $193 million,
compared to $188.5 million in FY 78. Funding for direct
enforcement activities will increase by $4.2 million to a total
of $137.2 million, while DEA's research and development program
will be cut by more than half to $2.3 million.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Overall, the FY 79 federal drug budget
proposal seems to maintain the status quo. The total expenditure
will increase a little, as it has in each of the past several
years; the relationship between treatment and enforcement
approaches will remain essentially unchanged.<br>

<p> APPENDIX B: A Comment On The Role of State and Local
Governments* <br>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">The material for this appendix is largely
drawn from a paper by Peter Goldberg, &quot;The Role of the City
in Responding to the Problems of Drug Abuse,&quot; in <i>Rehabilitation
Aspects of Drug Dependence, </i>ed. Arnold Schecter (Cleveland:
CRC Press, 1977).<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">In addition to the federal government, state
and local governments have been active in the drug field.
However, the activities and directions of state and local
governments vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, thus making
it impossible to generalize about these efforts as if they were
uniform. In recent years, organizations such as the National
Association of State Drug Abuse Program Coordinators, the
National League of Cities, and U.S. Conference of Mayors have
attempted to catalog expenditures at the state and local level
and offer some general analysis of policy decisions and program
directions. The Drug Abuse Council cannot add substantively to
that information.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">One important issue, however, deserves
comment, that of the intergovernmental system for planning and
programming established by the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment
Act of 1972 (P. L. 92-255). The system, perhaps inadvertently,
has resulted in a nearly total absence of any sustained,
systematic large-city government participation in the state or
federal policy making and program planning processes. It is an
inexplicable situation, since the nation's most severe drug
problems are concentrated in its large central cities.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The conditions of heroin addiction and crime
which initially prompted an expanded federal response to illicit
drug use in the early 1970s were concentrated in the larger
cities of this country. In fact, the increased federal response
was required partly because the scope and extent of the problems
associated with addictive drug use had far transcended the
ability of city governments to respond effectively. Also, state
governments-whose legislatures were frequently dominated by rural
and suburban interests-were often reluctant to become extensively
involved in what they felt was essentially a central-city
problem. Before the passage of the Drug Abuse Office and
Treatment Act of 1972, only New York, California, and Illinois
had undertaken major efforts in drug treatment and prevention.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">Nevertheless, when the federal government
began its large-scale expansion of the drug effort, the states
lobbied for and succeeded in obtaining the major role in that
effort. The role of local government was ignored; large
cities-where the social costs of illicit drug use are the most
severe-were left out of the formal policyrnaking and funding
process. This imbalance between city and state responsibilities
can be traced to the congressional authorization of annual
formula (block) grants to states, detailed in Section 409 of the
Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act. In return for the block
grants, Congress required each state to establish a drug abuse
coordinating agency and annually prepare a drug abuse plan to
meet treatment and prevention needs. Thus Congress, in effect,
required even nonurban states such as North Dakota, Vermont, and
Montana-states having comparatively small drug problems-to plan a
drug abuse response effort, while cities such as Newark, Detroit,
New Orleans, Boston, and Los Angeles were ignored in the
legislation.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The resulting problems were first of all
political. Large-city concerns and needs tend to be
underrepresented at the state level of government, where rural
and suburban interests are disproportionately powerful. Moreover,
blacks and other minority populations have added yet another
political concern, most clearly articulated in a resolution
passed by the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials in
June 1974. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Whereas, unfortunately, the problems of drug
abuse have disproportionately affected large numbers of Black and
Spanish-speaking Americans, these minority populations tend to be
most underrepresented at the state level where drug abuse
policies are being increasingly formulated, thus creating a large
discrepancy between those most afflicted by the problems and
those establishing the policies and procedures to solve the
problems.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">In addition to these political concerns, the
drug problems themselves in rural and suburban areas are often
quite different from those in the central city. While heroin may
be the major drug of abuse (alcohol excepted) in the large
cities, other parts of a state are usually concerned with other
drugs. And while treatment may be the most pressing need in
dealing with heroin addiction in the central city, the emphasis
desired or demanded by the rest of the state may be for education
and prevention programs. Although the larger cities may want
increased funding for methadone programs, other areas of the
state where heroin is not a problem may be unsympathetic to this
use of one addictive drug to treat another. In the final
analysis, different units of government are bound to have
different needs, priorities, and philosophies, all justified from
their own perspectives.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The imbalance between state and large-city
determinations of problems and priorities has become further
aggravated as the principal federal drug treatment and prevention
agency, NIDA, has sought to become more reliant on state plans in
determining federal funding decisions. In fact, NIDA has recently
announced its intention to fund virtually all of its treatment
and prevention efforts through statewide services contracts with
state governments by 1979. It is argued that this will be
administratively efficient; but this increasing substitution of
state decision making for federal does not augur well for the
large cities, where drug and drug-related problems are most
severe.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">In some instances a strong state role has
worked well; this is most often true in states where there are no
large urban centers. But in many other instances, potentially
serious problems between state and large-city governments have
impeded the effective flow of funds and delivery of services.
City organizations such as the National League of Cities and the
U.S. Conference of Mayors have repeatedly expressed their
dissatisfaction with the lack of state responsiveness to large
city needs in the drug area. Representatives of a number of
large-city governments have also voiced strong and specific
complaints about this. There is clearly a need to make some
adjustments in the state planning process so that plans more
adequately and appropriately allow for large-city needs and
participation. Such adjustments can be made without dismantling
the state planning system.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">NIDA and the cities need to communicate more
directly on drug issues and learn more from one another. To an
unfortunate extent federal drug policies are formulated without
discussion or collaboration with local elected officials from
areas where drug and drug-related problems are particularly
severe. This situation must be remedied if our drug policies and
programs are to work more efficiently. NIDA needs to develop
mechanisms by which it can more aggressively and systematically
seek large-city government input in its deliberations, and,
conversely, cities need to develop a better understanding of why
NIDA does what it does. The concept of an Office of Urban
Services within the NIDA bureaucracy to facilitate these crucial
interactions would seem to have merit.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Finally, NIDA should seriously consider
initiating a program to fund city coordinating agencies with
responsibility for developing city-wide drug abuse plans in a
number of cities with the highest concentrations of drug-related
problems. These plans should provide for interaction with the
state government. Cleveland needs such an agency and plan far
more than does the state of Idaho, Atlanta more than Vermont.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">A federal system that funds only state drug
abuse plans and agencies is either focusing solely on
administrative ease or operating in ignorance of the actual
problems. Plans should not proliferate uncontrollably across the
country, but if the federal government is to require planning it
should at least make certain that there will be direct
participation from those areas most afflicted and concerned. An
additional benefit of funding city agencies would be that it
would give local elected officials a dependable and developed
local source of advice and assistance on drug issues and
problems.<br>

<h1>The Facts About Drug Abuse </h1>

<p> <b>The Drug Abuse Council, 1980</b> </p>

<h2>Drug-Law Enforcement Efforts </h2>

<p> John R. Pekkanen </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> When the city of San Francisco passed an ordinance n 1875
banning the smoking o opium in opium dens.&quot; it marked the
first time a law prohibiting the use of narcotics was enacted in
this country. Since then cities, states and the federal
government have enacted a great number of drug laws. Some have
been stringent, others more lenient. Some were passed during
politically volatile periods when &quot;get tough&quot;
approaches were thought to be the answer; others were passed
during calmer times when more moderate approaches were sought. </p>

<p> To understand why we embarked on a course of prohibition for
particular drugs is a difficult and elusive undertaking, too
affected by deeply rooted attitudes and prejudices to allow for
completely dispassionate inquiry. Drug laws from their inception
were a special breed. In effect, the passage of these prohibitory
laws created crimes by definition; drug activities derived their
criminal label more from prevailing attitudes and prejudices than
from actual threats to persons or property. These were laws by
which people could and did express social disapproval, and were
not in the tradition of laws enacted to protect us from those who
steal, murder, or commit fraud. They were the means by which
right and wrong were distinguished according to popular but
arbitrary national values and mores. </p>

<p> In many instances, a proposed drug law would begin as an
attempt to control the use of a certain substance, such as opium,
cocaine, or marijuana. The rhetoric surrounding the proposed
antidrug law would usually call for the preservation of
predominant social and moral values, and it would be offered as a
means of restoring those &quot;lost&quot; values. Frequently such
a law would be directed at an outcast or minority segment of
society identified with the use of the drug. I Supporters of the
law would offer it as a solution to a wide range of social,
moral, racial, political, and economic problems-from unemployment
and crime in the streets to preserving the white race. </p>

<p> Early in the consideration of the Harrison Narcotic Act (the
first major federal antinarcotics act2), there was some
discussion about the hazards of legislating morality, but these
cautions were soon put aside. In essence, the Harrison Narcotic
Act was a tax law enacted to achieve a moral end, similar in that
regard to the Volstead Act prohibiting alcohol. Since then, drug
laws and the enforcement policies which flow from them have never
been seriously challenged. </p>

<p> In his study of alcohol prohibition, Symbolic Crusade: Status
Politics and the American Temperance Movement,3 Joseph Gusfield
examines the components of criminal law and separates them into
&quot;instrumental&quot; and &quot;symbolic&quot; aspects.
Applied to antidrug laws, the &quot;instrumental&quot; aspect is
what the law states as its intention-i.e., the prevention of the
use and availability of certain drugs. The &quot;symbolic&quot;
aspect may have an importance as great as or greater than that of
the instrumental*: In the case of antidrug laws, part of the
symbolic function has been to define users of particular drugs as
abnormal and to designate their behavior as criminal. When this
labelling process was attempted with alcohol prohibition as w
ell, it failed because the number of alcohol users in the country
was so large and diverse that no one group could be singled out
and designated as &quot;abnormal&quot; exclusively because of
drinking alcohol. </p>

<p> *These two functions of the law were best exemplified by the
report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse,
which called for the retention of laws against simple marijuana
possession but not enforcement of those laws. The law by itself
would discourage use, it was argued, and not enforcing it would
avoid stigmatizing those who did use the drug. </p>

<p> However, the use of certain drugs, such as opium, heroin,
and-until the 1970s-marijuana was most often primarily confined
to subgroups and minorities, whose separation and isolation were
more easily accomplished. This fact partly explains why only
congressional approval was needed to ban narcotics and marijuana,
while alcohol prohibition required a constitutional amendment,
and why when antidrug laws have appeared to be unsuccessful their
total repeal has never been seriously considered, although repeal
was possible with alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> In the material that follows, the law enforcement approach to
the control of certain drugs will be discussed from five
perspectives: the development of the laws themselves; how the
agencies charged with enforcing drug control laws have gone about
their task; the relationship between drug use and crime; a case
study of the impact of the nation's &quot;toughest&quot; drug
control law, the New York State Drug Law Amendments of 1973; and
the impact of drug law enforcement on illicit drug-using
behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Drug Control Laws and Policies</b> </p>

<p> Efforts to control certain drugs have come in cycles,
focusing on specific drugs during specific periods. 4 Generally,
the demand for tough drug control has been most vociferous during
periods of economic or political turmoil in the United States.
The antiopium crusade began during the depression of the 1870s;
the anticocaine crusade came during a period of racial turmoil in
the South . 5 Federal sanctions against selected drugs toughened
considerably between 1915 and 1920, during the first &quot;Red
Scare&quot;; the prohibition of alcohol was of course also
effected during this period. Later, during the depression of the
1930s, the entry of many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans into the
labor market in the Southwest appears to have been a major cause
of the antimarijuana crusade and attendant laws. The creation of
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) in 1930 established the
preeminence of law enforcement in the drug field, a fact which
has not changed over the years. The FBN's initial major drug
targets were heroin and marijuana; this policy lasted for more
than thirty five years.&quot; </p>

<p> In the 1940s drug control activities remained relatively
stable. There were no new demands for harsh laws or policies.
States adopted legislation comparable to the Harrison Act, the
major federal drug law, and this tightened the nation's drug
prohibition policy, There were also outbreaks of concern over the
misuse of legitimately produced drugs-amphetamines and
barbiturates were the most widely abused-but these drugs escaped
the full force of the antidrug effort. By 1950, however, the
atmosphere had changed, and many voices demanded new, tougher
antidrug laws.7 </p>

<p> Between 1947 and 1950, an apparent increase in illicit drug
use was reported among blacks and Puerto Ricans in many northern
cities. This caused alarm, creating support for passage of a new,
more stringent drug law in 1951. Commonly called the Boggs Act
after its sponsor, the late Representative Hale Boggs, it enacted
the harshest penalties for drug law violations to date . 8
Historian David Musto notes in The American Disease, &quot;Hale
Boggs's bill, which contained mandatory sentences, was passed in
1951 at the beginning of the McCarthy era and fears of Soviet
aggression, the 'betrayal' of China to the Communists, and
suspicion of domestic groups and persons who seemed to threaten
overthrow of the government.&quot;&quot; In 1956 an even more
severe federal narcotics bill was enacted which empowered a jury
to impose the death penalty on anyone over the age of eighteen
selling heroin to anyone Under the age of eighteen. 10 Several
states also enacted extremely harsh laws during this period,
imposing heavy penalties for both sellers and users. </p>

<p> This &quot;tough&quot; approach was eventually moderated: the
mid-1960s marked the beginning of a more comprehensive approach
to drug law enforcement. New criminal laws regulated
&quot;dangerous drugs&quot;-i.e., legally produced hallucinogens,
stimulants, and depressants. These laws were more moderate in
tone and substance, and marked a belated attempt at more uniform
policy at the federal level for the control of legitimate and
illegitimately produced drugs. The previous concern had been
exclusively with a very few illicit drugs like heroin, cocaine,
and marijuana. </p>

<p> The present era in drug law enforcement, an outgrowth of the
1960s, was inaugurated during the Nixon administration which
organized an intensified, coordinated federal antidrug program.
This was the heralded &quot;war on drug abuse.&quot;&quot; The
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
replaced the former crazy-quilt of criminal drug law statutes
which had been gradually patched together since the beginning of
the century. 12 Through the Controlled Substances Act portion of
the legislation, psychoactive drugs were placed into five
schedules according to their presumed potential hazards. The
federal drug bureaucracy, which had gradually grown since the
1920s, was restructured and further expanded. </p>

<p> As important as these steps were in modernizing the American
approach to drug control and in moderating the Draconian criminal
penalties of the 1950s, the new era did not break significantly
with the past in any fundamental way. The law enforcement
approach to drug use remained fixed and, except for a relatively
brief period, continued to receive the bulk of federal dollars
expended in the drug field. Popular notions about drugs were not
significantly altered, nor were traditional responses seriously
questioned. The beliefs in the almost mystical power of illicit
drugs over people may have become more sophisticated, but they
did not change radically. Users of opiate drugs, instead of being
viewed merely as criminals, were now charitably viewed as
&quot;sick&quot; criminals. But they were still viewed as
criminals, and still are. </p>

<p> Perhaps one of the most important ideas to remain unchanged
was the belief in a direct link between illicit drugs and crime.
This presumed link, which had been the basis for the harsh drug
laws of the past, remained a permanent fixture. The nature of
this assumed relationship-as is discussed in later sections of
this chapter-has undergone some changes, but the basic belief in
a causal link has not. </p>

<p> Whatever the causes and motives behind the nation's drug
laws, the inescapable conclusion from the more than one hundred
years of experience since the first prohibitory law was enacted
is that they have not stopped or even diminished the use of
illicit drugs. For example, in 1924 the U.S. Public Health
Service estimated the opiate addict population at two hundred
fifteen thousands ; although imprecise, this figure is considered
to be the most reliable of that period. In 1976 the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) estimated the heroin addict
population at five hundred thousand; other recent studies
indicate that the figure for all types of heroin users may be two
to four million. 14 Allowing for population increases, there are
more heroin users today than there were a half century ago. The
same appears to hold true for users of other illicit drugs. </p>

<p> Because of such findings, our drug laws and policies are more
openly questioned today than at any point in the past. On one
hand there are those who argue that government has no right at
all to intervene in the private lives of individuals. This view
holds that drug use is essentially a private act, and that
therefore government ought not intervene unless drug-taking leads
to socially disruptive or criminal behavior. A more pragmatic
aspect of this position is the feeling that laws and policies can
do little to diminish the supply of illicit substances because of
the enormous profitability involved and the consequent
development of highly organized &quot;black market&quot;
distribution networks. It is argued that the government's
resources could be better used in attempting to change the
conditions that contribute to illicit drug use-i.e., poverty,
unemployment, and other social problems-than to continue
self-defeating efforts to eliminate the supply and use of
particular drugs. </p>

<p> On the other hand, there are those who feel the government's
antidrug effort is doing about as well as can be expected in
cutting back the supply of illicit drugs, short of abridging
everyone's civil liberties. They argue that if law enforcement
programs did not attempt to diminish supply and frighten some
individuals from using drugs, our drug problems might be far
greater than they are. Then there are those who argue we are not
doing nearly enough, that more severe and repressive approaches
and policies are needed if we are to combat and eradicate the
&quot;enemy, drug abuse.&quot; In its extreme form, this latter
view holds that no price is too great to pay in order to achieve
this end. </p>

<p> However, much of the debate over drug control laws has failed
to focus sufficiently on the difficulties involved in enforcing
them. Passing a drug law is only one part of a control effort;
enforcing it is quite another. It is important to understand that
even when operating at maximum effectiveness, there are serious
limits to what law enforcement agencies can achieve. </p>

<p> One of the primary problems that American drug law
enforcement must face is that the drug laws and drug policies
have been consistently oversold by public officials. Burglary
laws are not expected to eliminate burglary, and penalties for
armed robbery are not expected to eliminate that crime; yet drug
laws are expected to eliminate illicit drug sale and use- a
standard has been set for drug laws that was never set for other
laws. More has frequently been promised than could possibly be
delivered. Consequently, as long as illicit drug use has
persisted, the policies against it have been regarded by some as
abject failures. What is needed in any discussion of drug control
policies is a realistic notion of what they can and cannot
achieve, and what their costs and benefits are. Only when we
understand this will the long cycle of overreaction to the use of
particular drugs subside. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>Law Enforcement Activities</b> </p>

<p> Basically, there are two strategies by which law enforcement
seeks to discourage illicit drug use: The first seeks to disrupt
and discourage use by enforcing domestic laws against drug use
and internal trafficking; the second seeks to prevent supplies of
illicit drugs from entering the country, either by preventing
their cultivation abroad or by intercepting shipments to the
United States. The latter strategy is largely the work of federal
agents, although state and local agencies may occasionally
participate. The efforts to control illicit drug use within the
United States are conducted by federal, state, and local agents.
Occasionally these different levels of government join forces and
work together; all too frequently, however, they act
independently, jealously guarding their &quot;turf&quot; (i.e.,
their resources and sources of information) from one another. </p>

<p> At the federal level the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), at present the chief drug enforcement agency, has over
four thousand employees, of whom over two thousand are agents. 15
(While this number may sound impressively large, it merely
approximates the size of the New York City Transit Authority
Police, a force that patrols the subways and buses in that city).
Several other federal agencies play various roles in the
enforcement of federal drug laws: Among these are the Customs
Service, which attempts to screen incoming persons and freight
for illicit drugs; the Internal Revenue Service, which pursues
tax law violations of illicit drug traffickers; the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration, which provides research
and funding support for state and local drug enforcement; and the
U.S. Coast Guard, which patrols coastlines and harbor areas for
illicit drug trafficking. </p>

<p> At the state and local level there is a substantially larger
number of personnel actively engaged in drug enforcement-the
police; but an exact count is not available, since regular
-patrolmen generally enforce drug laws along with their other
duties. Special narcotics units have been established in
virtually every major-city police department as well as in many
state police departments; most major cities also give some drug
law enforcement training to their uniformed patrolmen. </p>

<p> The strategies for controlling both drug use and supplies
incorporate a number of variables. The analyses that follow
attempt to summarize each strategy and identify some of their
costs and benefits. </p>

<p> Controlling Drug Use. Drug enforcement is unlike most other
types of police enforcement activities where generally a crime is
committed and reported and the police investigate, gathering
evidence and making their case. The victim is central to this
process; he or she initiates the police investigation; it is
often the testimony of the victim during the trial that convicts
the offender. </p>

<p> In drug cases, police usually do not have victims on whom to
rely. Not only are there no complainants, but everyone involved
conspires to conceal the crime from the police. As a result most
illicit drug offenses go entirely undetected; the percentage of
violations which result in arrest are extremely low.17 </p>

<p> Of those drug violations which do result in arrest, more than
75 percent are &quot;spontaneous&quot; arrests involving no prior
police investigation. 18 These drug arrests are often incidental
to an another investigation. For example, if the driver of an
automobile is stopped for a traffic violation and the arresting
officer sees marijuana or suspects its presence and finds
evidence of a drug law offense, a drug arrest may follow. Such
arrests are not due to any overall drug enforcement strategy, but
are rather the result of normal, day-to-day police enforcement
activities. This helps explain why the overwhelming number of
drug arrests are for simple possession, with a majority of these
involving marijuana. </p>

<p> Arrests for simple illicit drug possession have little if any
impact on the overall availability of illicit drugs because they
largely fail to affect drug distribution. The major distributors
of illicit drugs conduct their drug transactions in secret, and,
as in other activities involving drugs, there are no
complainants. Major drug dealers have developed very
sophisticated methods of concealment, including drop systems and
other subterfuges. Even well-known dealers are usually able to
avoid creating probable cause for arrest. Because of this secrecy
and the absence of complainants, the fundamental problem police
face in making arrests for drug trafficking is proving that
something illegal took place. While this can be difficult enough
in cases of simple possession, it is extremely difficult with
drug trafficking, particularly in developing the so-called
&quot;high-level&quot; cases. While many who use illicit drugs
participate to some degree in drug distribution (whether for
profit or not), those who import and deal in large quantities of
particular illicit drugs are not easy to identify, apprehend, or
successfully prosecute. </p>

<p> Undercover Investigations. Narcotics officers at the federal,
state, and local levels often work undercover, and may become
participants in aspects of the offense in order to gather
sufficient evidence to prove a crime has been committed. This
work is hazardous, time-consuming, and, as one former Deputy
Attorney General told Congress, &quot;a dirty, miserable
business.&quot;&quot;' The most serious practical shortcoming of
undercover operations is that, despite the publicity such
operations receive when successful, they result in the arrest of
only a miniscule proportion of those engaged in major drug
trafficking. Moreover, each undercover operation is so
time-consuming, and the number of policemen with the temperament
and skill for this work so limited, that the percentage of major
arrests would not increase substantially even if every undercover
operation were successful. </p>

<p> These problems of investigation are as true at federal as at
state and local levels. In fact, one of the persistent criticisms
of the federal drug enforcement effort is that the overwhelming
majority of arrests are of relatively low-level dealers. A 1975
analysis by the Government Accounting Office of 1974 Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) arrests revealed that only 604
(3.6 percent) of the total 16,796 arrests were Class I violators,
and of these only 63 were convicted. 20 (Class I violators are
major international drug traffickers, drug laboratory operators,
or wholesalers.)&quot; In addition, GAO found only 5 percent of
the arrests to be Class 11 violators, a lesser but still
significant category of offenders. However, following
congressional hearings and considerable public criticism, DEA
appears to have made a major effort to pursue more Class I and H
offenders even at the expense of overall arrest figures. DEA
statistics for 1976 show only 6,143 total drug arrests, but of
these 15 percent were for Class I and 1 1. 9 percent for Class 11
offenses. Still, nearly three-quarters of the arrests were Class
III and IV arrests, a statistic that indicates that major drug
trafficking arrests continue to be elusive in spite of increased
efforts . 22 </p>

<p> An important consequence of undercover operations is that
with arrest and trial of the suspect the undercover officer's
cover is &quot;blown&quot; and his usefulness in that line of
work in that region is usually ended. This is a serious problem,
because good undercover officers are few and far between.
Undercover operations also pose a number of legal problems; for
example, defense attorneys often argue, sometimes successfully,
that the undercover officer is guilty of &quot;entrapment&quot;
by having enticed the defendant into committing the crime in
question. </p>

<p> Another hazard here is the potential for police corruption.
The possibility of corruption through payoffs is always present,
because the sums of money involved in illicit drug traffic are
enormous-generally estimated to involve several billions of
dollars nationally per year-and because the salaries of policemen
are generally rather low. Additionally, substantial amounts of
&quot;buy&quot; money are provided by law enforcement agencies
for this work; in fiscal year 1976, for example, the DEA budget
called for $9 million for &quot;buy&quot; money to be used in
procuring information and allowing agents to &quot;buy into&quot;
drug transactions in the gathering of evidence .23 All major-city
and state narcotics enforcement agencies have substantial amounts
of this &quot;buy&quot; money. With these great sums of money the
possibilities for corruption can be great. Temptation can be
abetted by the fact that the undercover agent is operating in a
lawless environment where one's normal sense of right and wrong
can become distorted. In New York City the corruption of
narcotics investigators reached serious proportions .24 After the
Knapp Commission revelations, the New York City Police Department
instituted a procedure whereby any undercover officer on the
Street Crime Unit is required to obtain specific approval by a
superior officer to make a drug arrest, and, furthermore, that
arrest must be witnessed by the superior officer. This rather
cumbersome policy is still in effect today. </p>

<p> Not all forms of corruption involve money, however. As
mentioned above, there can also be a corruption of attitude
caused by a police officer's constant exposure to the mores of
the underworld. In Buy and Bust Mark Moore writes, &quot;They
[undercover agents] will know more about the violation and the
violators they attack than police usually do, and will sometimes
have personal interests at stake in the arrests. This invites
them to exercise their authority in accordance with their
intimate knowledge rather than what the law requires. 1125 For
example, in some cases undercover police might protect certain
dealers who have acted as informants and select others for
arrest. Such choices are made not on the basis of law but upon
past collaboration or even friendship. Close relationships bred
by undercover ' work can influence a police officer to change his
views on the law, what it means, and his requirements to uphold
it. 211 </p>

<p> Intelligence Gathering. Many critics have argued that if drug
enforcement agencies were to gather and organize intelligence in
a more systematic way, more could be done to successfully
investigate major drug traffickers. Such intelligence presumably
would give more detailed information about the methods drug
traffickers employ and accordingly provide a better overall
picture of trafficking operations. However, the assumption that
better intelligence would lead to more successful enforcement
here is open to question. Nevertheless, this debate does
highlight another basic problem: That drug enforcement agents
traditionally have been hostile toward intelligence functions
performed by special units within their own agencies. As Moore
notes, &quot;No investigator would be happy to admit [to an
intelligence analyst] that he had not mined the files of his
organization for every nugget of relevant information. 1117 One
result is that different agents with different items of
information, which if systematically collected and analyzed might
provide greater information about drug transactions and networks,
often do not share it. Thus the efforts of intelligence units
within the DEA and other drug enforcement agencies are often
thwarted. </p>

<p> I Lack of Coordination. Although many state and local police
agencies rely on federal help to train and establish their
narcotics units, there is a notable absence of uniformity and
coordination between the various levels of law enforcement
agencies. As a police chief in one large American city has
remarked, </p>

<p> It's always been a problem over the years to sort out the
roles of federal, state and local agencies. My obligations to the
citizens of my city are not the same as the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs [now the DEA], for example. They take a
systems approach, then make a management by objectives analysis,
they can target people and work on them. In the metropolitan
police departments, such as this one, we're at the low rung of
the law enforcement ladder, and we can't do that. We have to be
responsive to the citizen who calls in with just a meager amount
of information but expects and is entitled to action on it. 28 </p>

<p> Overlapping jurisdictions, as well as the different emphases
given to different drugs and to various aspects of enforcement
models, have created conflict. As a result, some local police
believe federal drug enforcement should confine itself to
interstate and international trafficking and should not involve
itself in &quot;local&quot; investigations. </p>

<p> While the basic assumption has been that local police will
enforce laws against small-time street dealers and users, state
police will enforce laws against the larger dealers, and the
federal government will concentrate on the major traffickers and
wholesalers, this has not always been the case. The federal
government investigates cases throughout the country, sometimes
informing state or local police agencies and sometimes not doing
so; its cases do not necessarily involve truly major interstate
or international violations. Because of these overlaps, the three
levels of drug enforcement remain to this day uncoordinated,
competitive, and at times conflicting. This continuing lack of
coordination, coupled with the other pitfalls of domestic drug
enforcement, have at times led to an acute sense of frustration
on the part of police, policymakers, and the public. As a
consequence, excessive measures periodically find support. One
recent, well-known example of this process of frustration and
overreaction involved the now defunct Office of Drug Abuse Law
Enforcement. </p>

<p> ODALE: A Case History. The Office of Drug Abuse Law
Enforcement (ODALE) was established in early 1972 by executive
order of President Nixon and charged with the mission of waging
an even tougher &quot;war&quot; on illicit drug users and dealers
than had been attempted in the past.211 The brief history of this
short-lived agency illustrates the excesses to which a &quot;war
on drugs&quot; philosophy can lead. It also highlights the
difficult position of drug law enforcement in attempting to
enforce the law justly without overstepping constitutional
safeguards. </p>

<p> ODALE was criticized from its inception for being an
&quot;election-year stunt&quot; while being simultaneously lauded
as a bold attempt to fight drug traffickers. ODALE was ostensibly
controlled by the justice Department but actually operated by
direction of the White House. Its initial creation was something
of a curiosity in that the federal government already had two
competing agencies, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD) and the Customs Bureau, in the forefront of its drug
control effort. ODALE's potential for engendering yet more
bureaucratic rivalry was soon realized; within the space of a few
months, the agency had eclipsed the other traditional federal
drug enforcement efforts in influence. 30 </p>

<p> ODALE was staffed by employees from a number of federal
agencies, including BNDD, Customs, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. The
agents from these departments were deployed into &quot;strike
forces&quot; which were authorized to use &quot;no-knock&quot;
search warrants, court-authorized wiretaps, and other search
privileges when &quot;incidental to arrest.&quot; Furthermore,
ODALE could forward the names of suspected drug traffickers to a
special committee in IRS which could then initiate special audits
or investigations of them.31 </p>

<p> ODALE received most of its funds from the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (LEAA), which is empowered by Congress
to fund state and local law enforcement units. While it was not
within the authority of LEAA to directly fund ODALE, a federal
agency, this barrier was skirted by having LEAA make grants to
local police departments participating in drug raids with ODALE
agents. This funding process also allowed ODALE to circumvent
budget appropriation proceedings in Congress. These steps, while
apparently within the letter of the law, were not in its spirit,
but they went largely unchallenged in the name of fighting
&quot;drug abuse. &quot;32 </p>

<p> One of ODALE's first acts was to establish the &quot;heroin
hotline,&quot; a toll-free number which people could call if they
knew or suspected someone of dealing in illicit drugs. Although
the &quot;hotline&quot; received abundant publicity its
accomplishments in aiding drug enforcement were minimal at most.
Only a few months after it was installed, &quot;hotline&quot;
callers were told by a recording to call another number; the
&quot;hotline&quot; was out of business .33 </p>

<p> The excesses this new agency fostered came vividly to light
on the night of April 23, 1973 in Collinsville, Illinois, when
ODALE agents broke into the house of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert J.
Giglotto, asleep at the time, routed them out of bed, roughed
them up, and accused them of drug dealing. But the ODALE agents
had made a mistake and come to the wrong house. They made a
second mistaken raid in another home that very night. These
events led to the suspension of the involved agents. Eventually
they were brought to trial on criminal charges, but were
acquitted.34 </p>

<p> The adverse publicity generated by the Collinsville raids
crippled ODALE's effectiveness and power. But the creation of
that agency and the extraordinary powers given to it demonstrate
how the impulse to combat the use of particular drugs and the
uncritical attitude accompanying that impulse can lead to an
overzealous approach which can seriously erode constitutional
safeguards. The excesses of ODALE were almost predictable, as in
past instances when the climate for stamping out illicit drug use
was equally extreme. </p>

<p> A number of questions surround ODALE even after its
bureaucratic demise. Was it created solely to combat illicit drug
use? Why was such a unique agency with unique powers believed to
be needed? The answers to these questions are not and may never
be clear, because of different interpretations of what ODALE was
or attempted to be. What does seem to be clear, however, is that
ODALE represented one more attempt to allay public fears by
striking hard at illicit drug use with tough enforcement. What is
also clear is that in spite of the hoopla surrounding its
inception, ODALE's arrest statistics reveal that virtually every
individual arrested by the agency was a minor, street-level
dealer of little or no consequence. 35 </p>

<p> Controlling Drug Supplies. In addition to efforts to control
the numbers of users and distributors of illicit drugs through
the criminal justice process, the federal government also has
sought to reduce the quantity of illicit drugs available for use.
There are two ways American law enforcement agencies have sought
to control the supply of illicit drugs: intercepting them as they
come into the country, and destroying them at their source in
other countries. </p>

<p> Interdiction. Many of the illicit drugs used in this country
are produced in foreign nations. One exception is marijuana,
which is grown both within and without the United States,
although the bulk of it is produced in foreign countries; other
exceptions are synthetic psychoactive drugs produced in
laboratories (rather than refined from a harvested plant)-e.g.,
amphetamines, barbiturates, and some hallucinogens. Cocaine and
heroin, officially considered to be the major illicit drugs of
abuse in the United States, originate in other countries. An
obvious --some might say simplistic-drug control strategy is to
try to prevent these illicit substances from reaching this
country. Upon closer examination, this strategy proves to be an
awesome task. </p>

<p> Anyone who has ever passed through American Customs at the
Canadian or Mexican borders or our sea- or airports realizes that
there is rarely any thorough inspection. The vast numbers who
daily cross into and out of American jurisdiction make thorough
inspection of every traveler a practical impossibility. In
addition, American borders have traditionally been open;
constitutional safeguards define the manner and circumstances of
searches. Successful seizures of illicit drugs therefore depend
more on intelligence information than on the luck of random
searches. This intelligence information is usually supplied by
American drug agents in foreign countries, who attempt to
identify drug traffickers to later be either arrested at the
border or kept under surveillance and arrested within the United
States. * </p>

<p> However, even with good intelligence information, preventing
illicit drugs from entering this country is a difficult, indeed
nearly impossible task .311 When the estimated amount of illicit
drugs consumed in this nation is compared with amount seized at
our borders or other ports of entry, it is clear that only a very
small percentage of the drugs being smuggled into the country are
confiscated. </p>

<p> It is estimated, for example, that from twelve to twenty
thousand pounds of high-purity heroin are smuggled into this
country each year&quot;; but in fiscal year 1974 only 115 pounds
of high-purity heroin was seized at all U.S. borders and ports.
This means that, combining this with the amount of heroin seized
internally by the authorities in domestic operations, only 670
pounds of heroin were confiscated that year .38 By fiscal year
1976, after intensive effort, domestic seizures had increased to
a total of 1,124 pounds of heroin, still far short of the total
incoming amount. The publicity accorded these seizures, however,
often has conveyed the impression that law enforcement agencies
are making major inroads against illicit drug smuggling. To a
large extent this publicity has been generated by the agency
involved in the seizure, for both political and bureaucratic
reasons. </p>

<p> Perhaps the most widely used technique for embellishing the
importance of a seizure of illicit drugs is to state the
&quot;street value&quot; of the seized drug.311 A seizure of
fifteen pounds of heroin, therefore, might not be merely a
fifteen-pound seizure, but a seizure of &quot;thirty million
dollars' worth of drugs.&quot; The &quot;street value&quot;
figure is elastic and sometimes exaggerated; it often reflects
the most optimistic price a dealer might possibly ask for his
drugs. This is analogous to estimating the value of rustled
cattle by the price they would bring as steaks at the best
restaurants. What is omitted in these claims of the &quot;street
value&quot; of drugs seized is the fact that between $5 and $11
billion worth of illicit drugs is sold in this country each year
.40 Thus, $30 million or even $300 million, while significant, is
still but a tiny fraction of the total, and has little if any
impact on the total amount of illicit sales. However, when
seizures drop, enforcement agencies frequently also use the
decline to indicate the success of their efforts. </p>

<p> *Additionally, international interdiction also has included
investigations by U.S. agents abroad in cooperation with foreign
governments, and the arrests of drug traffickers in certain
countries. However, U.S. agents are now prohibited by law from
participating in the arrest of individuals in foreign countries. </p>

<p> By this self-serving logic, the drug law enforcement agencies
nearly always can appear to be successful. </p>

<p> Although drug seizure data have often been misused by
competing drug agencies to enhance their public images, seizures
can have a disruptive effect and present an economic risk to drug
traffickers. In addition, limited amounts of these drugs are of
course kept out of the illicit market. </p>

<p> Historically, border interdiction has been a major source of
rivalry among the federal agencies charged with controlling
illicit drugs-specifically, between the Customs Bureau and the
justice Department's drug agencies, from the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to the
present Drug Enforcement Administration.&quot; Government
reorganizations, as well as a number of other attempts to
reconcile these disputes-such as specifying which international
areas each agency should be responsible for-have not completely
succeeded in quieting this rivalry, although DEA's incorporation
of some of the drug enforcement duties of Customs has certainly
allayed it. </p>

<p> These jurisdictional disputes have appeared at many critical
points in the federal drug enforcement effort. For example, when
drug agents in a foreign country obtain information regarding a
significant drug-smuggling attempt, this information would
ideally be relayed to the U.S., in order to effect an arrest on
U.S. territory; here, however, the federal drug law enforcement
process often broke down. In some cases Customs would insist that
the drugs be intercepted at the border, to make certain they did
not enter the country, while FBN, BNDD, or DEA would insist that
the smuggler be allowed through the border, whence he might lead
to &quot;higher ups&quot; in the smuggling operation. In point of
fact, however, many times the true reason for these differences
was the desire of each agency to make the drug seizure and arrest
itself. The competing agencies eventually began circumventing one
another, refusing to reveal what they were doing or whom they
were investigating. Sometimes one agency would deliberately
interrupt the investigation of another with a premature arrest.
In one celebrated instance, two agencies, unknown to one another,
were involved in the same investigation; in a showdown shooting
erupted, with agents from two federal agencies of the United
States government mistakenly shooting at each other.&quot; How
often disruptions of this kind occurred is difficult to estimate,
but it is clear that the rivalry was a serious impediment to
effective federal drug control and an embarrassment to the
government generally. </p>

<p> Another problem with border interdiction is simply that our
borders with both Mexico and Canada are so easily accessible;
trying to make them less accessible in order to seize more drugs
would not only erode freedom of entrance and egress, but probably
would not work anyway. As noted, the major border drug seizures
generally result from intelligence information supplied to border
agents. Few illicit drugs are uncovered in random searches, as
Operation Intercept-an attempt to cut off drug supplies at the
Mexican border-amply demonstrated in September 1969. That effort
affords another illustration of the ineffectiveness of extreme
measures taken in the name of fighting illicit drugs. </p>

<p> Operation Intercept: A Case History. The Mexican border has
traditionally been a major trafficking point, both because large
quantities of illicit drugs are produced in Mexico and because
the 1,945-mile border is mostly unguarded. In addition to bridge
and river crossings, it is believed that 200 aircraft carrying
illicit drugs daily fly illegally from Mexico into the United
States. 43 </p>

<p> In September 1909 President Nixon ordered &quot;the country's
largest peacetime search and seizure operation by civil
authorities&quot; along the United States-Mexico border. 44 Two
thousand Customs and border patrol agents began systematically
searching all cars and persons coming from Mexico into the United
States. There were delays of several hours in what is normally a
very quick crossing process over the border. Individuals who
appeared suspicious or argumentative were often stripped and
bodily searched. The tourism traffic between the two countries
was seriously interrupted. And although more than five million
people passed over this border during the three weeks Operation
Intercept was in full gear, virtually no heroin or any other
illicit drug was confiscated. In defense of the project, the
government later explained that its primary intention was not to
interdict drugs at the border, but rather to pressure Mexico into
eradicating its crops of marijuana and Opium.41 While it may have
had this effect eventually, the project had little direct impact
on illicit drug trafficking. </p>

<p> Elimination of the Supply. The most recent major American
supply reduction strategy is &quot;eradication at the
source.&quot; This policy was created in part because of the lack
of success in controlling supply through traditional domestic
enforcement and international interdiction and in part because
advanced technology seemed to make it more feasible than before.
In brief, the objective is to eliminate the crops which furnish
illicit drugs to the American market. </p>

<p> Bolivia, Peru, and Columbia are the major U.S. sources of
cocaine, while opium (the raw material for heroin) is grown in
many countries throughout the world, including Thailand,
Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, India, and Iran. Marijuana is
grown throughout Mexico and Central and South America in addition
to the United States. However, heroin is the major drug priority
of the federal government, and the most advanced
&quot;eradication at the source&quot; program underway now is
against the opium poppy. Although substantial amounts of
cocaine-from fifteen to one hundred tons annually-regularly flow
into the United States, cocaine remains a lower priority .411 No
major cocaine eradication program has been attempted, because of
the hardy nature of the coca plant (from which cocaine is
derived) and because these plants are grown near drinking water
supplies and closely intermingled with food crops, making
eradication programs extremely difficult if not impossible to
accomplish in safety. Marijuana, despite official disclaimers of
interest, results in the greatest annual seizures47 and is the
object of current American-supported eradication efforts in
Mexico .41 </p>

<p> The key to any eradication program's success is the
cooperation of the foreign government in whose country the drug
is grown and the ability of that government to effect an
eradication policy in its rural areas. Basically, the theory of
eradication rests on the simple premise that if opium poppies or
marijuana plants are-eliminated in sufficient numbers the drug
they produce will also be largely eliminated. To this end, the
United States now actively participates in eradication programs
for both of these illicit drugs. </p>

<p> Opium poppies are grown in many regions of the world; no
special climate or soil conditions are needed. The main
requirement is cheap, abundant manual labor to do the painstaking
work of harvesting. It is estimated that only sixty to one
hundred tons of raw opium are required each year to supply the
entire illicit U.S. market with heroin, an amount which could be
produced from only ten square miles of opium poppies.&quot; (One
hundred tons of opium yields approximately ten tons of pure
heroin5O; the raw opium, which is extracted directly from the
opium poppy, is converted into a morphine base and then into
heroin by a relatively simple cooking and chemical-bonding
process.) </p>

<p> There are two other significant factors which work against
the success of the eradication strategy. First, the opium poppy
has a long tradition in many cultures where it is grown; it is
used for fodder, fuel, oil, and as a pain-killing agent. In many
regions of the world indigenous families have been growing opium
poppies for centuries. Second, opium poppies are a valuable cash
crop in those regions. Even when sold legally, the poppy crops
support many farmers and their families. There are few substitute
crops that will earn more per unit of land.51 </p>

<p> Although the United States has encouraged worldwide
prohibition of illicit opium cultivation through bilateral and
multilateral agreements for more than sixty years, these efforts
have largely failed. One of the reasons for this is that our
prohibition of heroin has inflated the price of the drug, thereby
making it even more profitable to cultivate opium poppies
illegally. </p>

<p> In 1971 this country launched a major effort to restrict the
cultivation of foreign opium when it reached an agreement with
Turkey to ban the cultivation of opium poppies there. In return,
the United States agreed to reimburse the Turkish government $35
million for lost revenues. </p>

<p> (Ultimately, only part of this amount was actually paid to
Turkey. )52 Although the United States selected Turkey as the
site for trying its new policy because Turkish opium was believed
to account for 80 _percent of the illicit heroin used in the
U.S., there was no way to verify this estimate, since it is
nearly impossible to trace heroin back to its original source. 53
It is in fact uncertain that Turkish opium poppies did supply 80
percent of American heroin, since it is also believed that Turkey
grew only about 8 percent of the world's opium poppies.54 In
addition, the existence of other opium-growing areas and the
profitability of the American heroin trade would make the
long-term impact of such a ban questionable; other countries
growing larger amounts of opium had controls as lax as Turkey's,
and much of the opium from these countries also found its way
into the black market. It has also been suggested that Turkey was
selected because, as a NATO ally, it was more susceptible to U.S.
leverage than many other countries. </p>

<p> Whatever the reasons for choosing Turkey, the results of the
opium ban not only failed to stop the flow of heroin into this
country but seriously strained relations between the two
countries until Turkey unilaterally rescinded the ban in 1975 .
5-1 In place of the opium-growing ban, the Turkish government at
this time initiated a centralized poppy-harvesting method called
the &quot;poppy straw process&quot;: This process requires that
the opium poppies be harvested whole rather than lanced, meaning
that the raw opium is brought to secure, central locations before
the extraction process is carried out, and forbids farmers to
lance the poppy pods themselves. This change has reduced if not
eliminated the export of illicit Turkish opium. This stoppage of
Turkish opium, however, led to a substantial increase in illicit
heroin from Mexican sources. As one study noted, </p>

<p> Although the opium ban in Turkey, together with a major
enforcement effort in France which broke up a ring of French and
French-Corsican chemists and traffickers in 1973, did put a
temporary crimp in the supply of heroin in the U.S., Mexican
opium growers and traffickers rapidly took over the market. By
1975 the U.S. government was declaring that over 80 percent of
the heroin available in the U.S. came from Mexico, instead of
Turkey. &quot; </p>

<p> As the illicit Turkish opium supply dwindled and the price of
heroin rose in response, the economics of heroin trafficking thus
became even more favorable, and new suppliers were attracted to
it. For example, in opium-producing countries an investment of
$250 now buys one ounce of 90 percent pure heroin; when cut with
forty dollars' worth of quinine, thereby converting the original
ounce of heroin into one kilo of 21/2 percent purity (an average
level for American heroin), the value becomes $15 per gram, or a
total of $15,000 for the original investment of $290. 57 These
economics keep the international heroin market flourishing and
make significant and lasting eradication extremely difficult to
accomplish. </p>

<p> Mexican heroin-noted for its brown color, a result of the
refining process which has no effect on the quality of the
heroin-quickly filled the vacuum created by the Turkish poppy
ban. In fact, heroin is a great economic boon to regions in
northern Mexico; that mountainous and largely inaccessible region
produces some twenty tons of heroin a year. As noted in one
report on the Mexican heroin trade, </p>

<p> Assuming, however, that only the 10 tons of heroin (from the
tri-state area) reached the border where it would sell in 1975 at
$45,000 a kilo (border value), the value of that crop alone would
be $450 million. The heroin crop alone is thus Mexico's most
valuable commodity. Sugar, shrimp, coffee and cotton, the next
four most valuable commodities, do not total $450 million
together. '8 </p>

<p> In response to this new influx of heroin, the United States
and Mexico agreed in 1973 to attempt another type of eradication
strategy. Essentially, the United States agreed to provide
technical assistance and equipment for a herbicide-spraying
program to eradicate illicit Mexican drug producing crops.
Although marijuana was included, the opium poppy was the primary
target of the eradication program from the American point of
view. This program remains the United States' most ambitious
eradication effort. 59 </p>

<p> During the early phases of the program less than ten thousand
opium poppy fields per year were destroyed manually. These ten
thousand fields represented approximately three to four thousand
acres. In November 1975 aerial spraying began, and by 1976 the
total number of fields reportedly destroyed had risen to twenty
thousand. In 1977, some forty seven thousand poppy fields,
representing an estimated fourteen thousand acres, were
destroyed. This increase was primarily due to the change from
manual to aerial herbicide spraying.60 </p>

<p> The spraying program is conducted year-round and affects
large sections of Mexico, including nearly half of the western
coast. At the present time the herbicide paraquat is used to
eradicate marijuana-a major goal of the Mexican government-and
the chemical &quot;2,4-D,&quot; is used on opium poppies. The
program is assisted by the U.S. government in a number of ways. A
State Department official recently described the Mexican
eradication effort to a congressional committee thus: </p>

<p> The principal forms of State Department-administered support
to the Mexican drug effort have included the furnishing of
aircraft and telecommunications equipment, together with the
requisite training to enable the Mexicans to use them in modern
applications to drug detection, poppy eradication, and
enforcement work. Our technical assistance together with certain
commodities, is also helping them to establish and administer a
network of forward bases in the important eradication areas and
to improve intelligence collection, retrieval, and analysis.
Training and salary supplements are provided to aid. the Mexican]
Federal judicial Police to develop and hold a cadre of qualified
narcotics agents.&quot;' </p>

<p> The United States provided Mexico with approximately $50
million in assistance funds for marijuana and opium poppy control
from 1973 to 1977. Proposed assistance for 1978 was estimated to
be about $13.3 million. Most of these funds are used to purchase
aircraft and support services for the aerial eradication program.
Aircraft supplied by the United States includes more than forty
helicopters and thirty-five fixed-wing aircraft. In addition,
some twenty to twenty-five DEA agents are assigned full time with
the Mexican eradication effort to provide technical assistance.
112 </p>

<p> As an enforcement strategy, eradication at the source may
have some advantages over other reduction and control strategies.
First, there is less potential for domestic police corruption.
Second, as compared to interdiction and undercover efforts it is
a relatively inexpensive way of preventing illicit drugs from
entering the United States. </p>

<p> However, the criteria for determining the success of such an
operation are uncertain. For instance, it is not known what
quantity of illicit drugs were smuggled into this country from
Mexico either before the program or now. However, the State
Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration report that
Mexican brown heroin, which formerly accounted for 80 to 85
percent of the heroin available in this country, has dropped to
60 to 65 percent of the total. Also, the retail and wholesale
prices of heroin have reportedly increased as much as 50 to 75
percent along the U.S.-Mexican border, and increases of as much
as 150 percent have been noted. 113 However, a rise in heroin
prices is not in itself a totally accurate indication of the
effects of a control strategy on heroin use. In fact, higher
heroin prices may be, at best, a mixed blessing. </p>

<p> Eradication policies, when they successfully interrupt
illicit drug production, as the Mexican opium poppy program has
apparently done, may reduce the American heroin supply for a
time, perhaps two or three years. In 1977, heroin-related deaths
dropped approximately 40 percent in this country, a possible
indication that the eradication program was having a beneficial
effect.114 It was also reported by enforcement officials that
American heroin supplies in 1978 were at their lowest level in
several years; however, they admit they have little hard evidence
on which to base that estimate. Moreover, as will be discussed
later, reducing the heroin supply may lead to other social
problems. </p>

<p> There are a number of possible side-effects to such an
eradication program which must also be considered. For example,
Mexican marijuana sprayed with paraquat has reached the United
States; samples seized near the border after the eradication
program began showed that 21 percent were contaminated with
significant levels of paraquat.115 It has been indicated that
paraquat may pose a significant health danger to those who ingest
it. The Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare announced a National Institute on Drug Abuse study in
March 1978. </p>

<p> The report's preliminary findings suggest that if an
individual smokes three to five heavily contaminated marihuana
cigarettes each day for several months, irreversible lung damage
will result. The report cautions, however, that there could be a
risk of lung damage for individuals who use marihuana less often
or in smaller amounts. Although these results are preliminary,
the report concludes that Paraquat contamination may pose a
serious risk to marihuana smokers. 66 </p>

<p> Although one might argue that anyone who uses an illegal
substance like marijuana must bear the consequences and the
risks, the fact remains that as many as forty-five million
Americans have tried marijuana and approximately eleven million
are regular users. The preponderance of medical evidence to date
shows that marijuana is a relatively harmless intoxicant when
used moderately. Therefore, it seems ironic that an official
program may itself produce a serious health risk for the
individual smoker, when the ostensible reason for prohibition in
the first place was to protect users from harming themselves. </p>

<p> The eradication strategy has another shortcoming as well:
Experience has shown that as one opium supply system is
diminished, another develops to take its place, at even more
attractive profits due to the rise in heroin prices caused by the
temporary shortage. Shortly after the Mexican eradication program
began, for example, white heroin from the &quot;Golden
Triangle&quot; in Southeast Asia began to enter the country. Drug
enforcement officials suspect that many Turkish nationals are
involved in this Southeast Asian traffic, which suggests that the
Turkish opium ban may have been more effective with the crop than
with the traffickers. </p>

<p> There is a larger problem, however, which holds the greatest
potential danger. If the country designated for crop eradication
efforts-in this case Mexico-is not part of a vigorous ongoing
program, then its illicit opium production will probably be
revived after the eradication efforts slow or stop. And it may
revive at a time when other areas of the world are also producing
large amounts of illicit heroin for the U.S. market. Then, rather
than facing illicit heroin smuggling from only one major area,
this country could be faced with two or more major supply
sources. This possibility remains a strong one, because the
eradication program depends upon the internal policies and
politics of foreign governments, any one of which for any reason
could end existing agreements and permit the former state of
affairs to reappear. </p>

<p> <b>Drugs and Crime</b> </p>

<p> The persistent belief that illicit drug use is inextricably
linked to crime has traditionally been advanced as a reason for
laws and policies against particular drugs. A 1972 survey by the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse found that 58
percent of adults believed that marijuana users often commit
crimes they would not have committed had they not used marijuana.
In that same survey, more than 90 percent of those interviewed
believed that, in the commission's words, &quot;Heroin users
often commit crimes to get the money to buy more heroin. -117 </p>

<p> Crimes that relate to illicit drugs can generally be placed
into four categories.&quot;&quot; Two of these are not germane to
this discussion; these are crimes among individuals involved in
the illicit-drug distribution system-e.g., drug or money thefts
by one drug dealer from another-and the crimes of simply using,
possessing, or selling the drug itself, activities which are
criminal by definition, since they are illegal. </p>

<p> Generally, the perceived drug and crime relationship which
most concerns the public falls into two basic categories. The
first category involves the pharmacological effect of a drug on
the user. Historically, the presumed pharmacological connection
between illicit drug use and assaultive crime has been the
impetus behind antidrug laws. However, the evidence to date shows
that alcohol and secobarbital-both legally produced psychoactive
substances-are the drugs most likely to be involved with
subsequent assaultive behavior. There is no substantial evidence
to link the use of any other drug, licit or illicit, with
assaultive crime. Some stimulant drugs, such as the amphetamines,
have reportedly led to aggressive behavior in some individuals,
but there is insufficient evidence to show a causal link between
their use and assaultive crime. </p>

<p> The second category consists of revenue-producing crimes like
burglary, shoplifting, and larceny. More recently, the use of
heroin has been linked to crimes of this sort. The assumption is
that the use of heroin invariably results in addiction; that
heroin addicts require ever-increasing amounts of the drug; and
that, due to the high cost of the drug on the American market,
they must commit various crimes to support their use. As pointed
out by the press and electronic media, the stereotypic portrait
of the heroin user is of a dishevelled, trembling individual
without motivation or legitimate source of income. However, while
there is evidence to suggest that many heroin users may commit
property crimes to support use, 70 nobody really knows how much
crime is actually committed to obtain money to support heroin
habits. Police and court records do not contain this information,
and estimates-which are not particularly reliable-vary, calling
it anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of all revenue-producing
crimes, depending upon the type of offense and the location .71 </p>

<p> A survey by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of
ten thousand inmates of correctional facilities concluded that 13
percent of the inmates had used heroin at the time of their
arrest. The same survey estimated between 13 and 60 percent of
incarcerated criminals to have been heroin users ' 12 Although
this kind of data suggests links between heroin use and crime,
nothing was established in that survey to demonstrate that these
individuals began to commit crimes because of their heroin use,
nor does the study indicate whether the correctional population
surveyed was typical of all those arrested, or of all committing
crimes. It may indicate a tendency to jail heroin users in
disproportionate numbers. </p>

<p> The studies which indicate that after the onset of opiate
addiction individuals generally increase their criminal activity
come closest to demonstrating a causal link between drug use and
crime .73 These studies suggest that although an individual may
have been a criminal before he used heroin, his heavy use led to
an increase in criminal activity to meet the new income need. On
its face, this implies a connection between heroin use and crime.
However, there is an across-the-board increase in crime among men
between ages eighteen and twenty-five, irrespective of drug use.
74 Thus, any data suggesting increased crime because of heroin
use would have to correct for the general increase in crime for
this age bracket. </p>

<p> The evidence relating to a heroin-crime link could best be
described as showing that regular, heavy opiate use in the United
States probably means a higher rate of revenue-producing crime by
the addict. Because of its broad political appeal, however, this
connection has been repeatedly overstated and even misrepresented
to support tough enforcement policies. For example, Governor
Rockefeller of New York told the legislature, by way of
introducing a &quot;get tough&quot; drug law, that addicts were
&quot;robbing, mugging, murdering day in and day out for their
money to fix their habit. &quot;75 The state estimated that drug
addicts committed a total of $6.5 billion per year in crime. ff
that were in fact the case, it would have meant that these
addicts were committing on the order of 44 million robberies,
muggings, and murders each year in New York to support their
habit, 400 times more than all of the reported crimes in New
York, well beyond any conceivable total of reported and
unreported.crimes in that state .711 </p>

<p> Other data indicate that such figures had little factual
basis. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1971 Uniform Crime
Index reported a total of $1.3 billion in theft in 1970 for the
entire nation. Thus, New York State's claim of $6.5 billion in
crime losses for New York alone exceeded the national figure by
five times .77 Another study, an economic analysis by the Hudson
Institute of New York of the extent of heroin use nationwide,
estimated that in 1970 there were 250,000 addicts who were
responsible for a maximum cf $1.7 billion in crime .78 </p>

<p> The New York figures disseminated by Governor Rockefeller's
office were misleading in another important respect. In New York
City, which is generally acknowledged to have more illicit drug
use than any other American city, only a small percentage of the
110,000 reported crimes in 1973 (the year of the
&quot;tougher&quot; New York drug law's passage) were attributed
by police to heroin users. The New York Police Department
estimated only 4.4 percent of those arrested for felonies against
a person-which would include robbery, muggings, and murder-could
be classified as heroin users, and only a small percentage of
those users could be classified as addicts .79 </p>

<p> In a 1974 study by the Crime Analysis Unit of the New York
City Police Department it was found that among arrested criminal
heroin users and nonusers, the 'rates of property crime were
about the same, suggesting that there is little difference in
patterns of property crime between them. However, the percentage
of nonusers who committed serious crimes against a person was
substantially higher than for heroin users.80 A Hudson Institute
study reported even lower figures for assaultive property crimes
among heroin users in New York City. It reported that less than 2
percent supported their heroin use by either robbery or
muggings.81 </p>

<p> These studies call into question the more dramatic statements
about the extent of crime committed by those who use illicit
drugs, particularly heroin. It does seem that property crimes
are. committed by some unknown proportion of regular heavy heroin
users not as a result of the drug itself but of the high cost of
obtaining it in America's black market. Little hard statistical
evidence exists to show a cause-and-effect relationship between
the use of any drug and criminal behavior. </p>

<p> The Impact of Demand and Price. One goal of drug enforcement
is to cut back the supply of heroin and thereby raise the street
price, which in theory will drive heroin addicts into treatment.
This concept has proved to be more unpredictable and complex than
simple cause-and-effect scenarios generally concede. There are
studies which demonstrate that such law enforcement policies may
be a double-edged sword, at least in the short run. </p>

<p> A study of heroin prices in Detroit indicates that as heroin
prices rise because of diminished supply there is a consequent
increase in property crime. The study, performed by the Public
Research Institute of the Center for Naval Analyses noted, </p>

<p> The relationship between drug addiction and criminality is
complex and, because of the lack of data, hard to supply. This
study has shown that the level of property crime in Detroit is in
part affected by the price of heroin. When the price rises, crime
rises. When the price falls, crime falls. This finding supports
the general hypothesis that criminal heroin users as a class try
to maintain their level of consumption in the face of price
increases, and that they rely partly on property crime for the
additional funds. The level of personal crime is little affected
by the price of heroin. 82 </p>

<p> The Detroit study also found that the areas hardest hit by
the crime increases were the poor neighborhoods. It said,
&quot;We have preliminary evidence that poor people are
victimized by addict criminals; thus, law enforcement policies
that tend to raise the price of heroin hurt this income class
.&quot;83 The impact of many national policy shifts is often felt
most acutely in neighborhoods with the least political power;
this phenomenon is particularly profound with drug policies. </p>

<p> The reason why diminished heroin availability may lead to
more crime relates to the economics of the illicit heroin market,
which lies at the raw edge of laissez-faire capitalism. It rests
on the fundamental economic principle of supply and demand: When
the supply is less, the price is more. It should be kept in mind,
however, that supply is but one factor governing the price of
heroin; the purity of the drug and experience of the dealer, as
well as other factors, also affect its price. Supply of the drug
remains, however, one of the strongest single influences on
price. A 1971 East Coast dock strike, for example, is believed
responsible for a temporary heroin shortage and a consequent rise
in street-level prices. After settlement of the strike, supplies
increased and prices dropped, from a high in New York of
sixty-two dollars per gram (for a two-gram purchase at 10 percent
purity) to fifty dollars, all over a period of three months. 84 </p>

<p> The predicted crime increase is of course based on the idea
that if it costs more for a heroin user to support his use and he
has no other income sources than crime, he will need to commit
more crimes to support use at the same level. Also, because many
users support themselves by selling small quantities of drugs
there is the possibility that they could turn to other forms of
crime besides dealing. </p>

<p> The American experience in Vietnam in attempting to eradicate
use of a drug without fully considering the possible consequences
is also instructive. When the army clamped down on marijuana use
the demand for a drug among soldiers who had used it did not
decrease; when they could not get marijuana, they turned in large
numbers to another easily purchased and more easily concealed
drug-heroin. It was a classic example of attempting to control
supply without addressing demand.,&quot;* </p>

<p> *The Vietnam drug experience also underscores other important
points about illicit drug use, i.e., the setting and the
availability. The setting in Vietnam, at once boring and very
dangerous, created a situation which encouraged many individuals
to use drugs there. Also, the fact that drug supplies were so
plentiful contributed to their widespread use. </p>

<p> Despite these occurrences the notion persists that use of
illicit drugs can be brought under control with enforcement
policies, and that bringing it under control will in great
measure solve the crime problem. In part, this notion persists
because of the common stereotype of the heroin user as an
unscrupulous individual willing to commit any crime for his next
fix. Like all stereotypes, it does not encompass the diversity of
the individuals who use drugs compulsively. Many illicit drug
users and opiate addicts hold steady, legitimate jobs. Not all
heroin users are, as previously assumed, heroin
&quot;addicts.&quot; Some, perhaps many, enjoy the euphoric
effects of heroin but do not have a compulsive need for
it.&quot;' Many, perhaps most, of these would not consider
stealing in order to buy their drugs. These occasional heroin
users, sometimes called &quot;chippers,&quot; may, if
mathematical projections are correct, outnumber compulsive heroin
users by as much as six to one. 117 The very notion that they can
exist is frequently met with skepticism because it is contrary to
the well-entrenched belief that to use heroin is to be addicted
to it. </p>

<p> Because heroin users are a diverse group with no uniform
patterns of drug use and widely different ways of earning money,
one cannot simply multiply estimated users by a single monetary
figure to arrive at an accurate estimate of the amount of crime
they commit. It is interesting, however, to speculate on what
might happen to the crime rate if no heroin were available in
this country. The Nixon administration, which like other
administrations before it adopted the conventional assumption of
a direct link between heroin and crime in many of its public
utterances, did not find such a link in a private study it
commissioned. While stating publicly that American drug-related
crime amounted to $18 billion a year, a 1971 White House Domestic
Council decision paper circulated within the Executive Office
noted, &quot;Even if all drug abuse were eradicated, there might
not be a dramatic drop in crime statistics on a national level,
since much crime is not related to drug abuse. -811 </p>

<p> The difficulty of threading through all of the data on drugs
and crime and arriving at any certainties will persist, as will
the unpredictability of the effects of various enforcement
policies. Despite these uncertainties, however, the drug-crime
issue often invokes emotional responses having little to do with
the facts. It is therefore likely that the presumed drug-crime
link will continue to inspire &quot;get tough&quot; approaches to
drug law enforcement in the future. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The New York Drug Law</b> </p>

<p> During the early 1970s, a period when the country was greatly
concerned about illicit drugs, New York State embarked on the
strictest &quot;get tough&quot; enforcement approach to illicit
drugs in the country. It is difficult to discern with precision
how much of the zeal for the new law came from an angry and
frustrated citizenry and how much came from the state's leaders,
or how much they coincided. In any case, the new law received
wide national publicity and was passed amid bold promises that it
would squarely address the drug problem in that state. </p>

<p> There was general agreement that the practice of the 1960s of
diverting low-level drug users into treatment and meting out
harsher penalties for higher-level traffickers had largely
failed. New York had heavily committed its resources to
&quot;civil commitment&quot; during the 1960s, a prograin
described -at the time as a model for other states to adopt.
However, 1972 overdose deaths in New York were six times greater
than they had been in 1960; the tougher new laws were regarded by
many as a solution. </p>

<p> The new legislation, which went into effect on September 1,
1973, had two principal objectives. First, it sought to frighten
illicit drug users out of using and drug dealers out of
trafficking. Second, it aimed to reduce crimes commonly
associated with drug addiction, i.e., burglaries, robberies, and
theft; it was believed that potential illicit drug users would be
frightened off by the law and that hardened criminals would be
given long prison sentences, thus reducing the crime rate.119 </p>

<p> The new law was aimed primarily at heroin trafficking, in
particular at the lower-level &quot;street&quot; dealers. The law
divided-heroin dealers into three groups, placed them in the
highest felony category in the state, and required minimum
periods of imprisonment plus mandatory lifetime parole
supervision for each group. The groups were: </p>

<p> I. The highest level dealers. Those who sell one ounce or
more, or possess more than two ounces. These dealers were
subjected to the most severe penalty: a prison sentence of
indefinite length, but with a minimum of between fifteen and
twenty-five years and a lifetime maximum. </p>

<p> II The middle level dealers. Those who sell one-eighth of an
ounce or more, or possess one or two ounces. These offenders were
subjected to prison sentences of indefinite length, with a
minimum term of between six and eight-and-one-third years, and a
lifetime maximum. </p>

<p> III. Street level dealers, also referred to as
&quot;sharer-pushers.&quot; Those who sell less than one-eighth
of an ounce or possess up to an ounce with the intent to sell.
These dealers were made liable to prison sentences of indefinite
length, with a minimum term of between one year and eight-and
one-third years, and a lifetime maximum.110 </p>

<p> The mandatory minimum prison sentences were made a major
provision of the New York law, even though such sentences had
previously been abandoned in federal and state drug laws.
Restrictions on plea bargaining were another controversial aspect
of this law; a person indicted on a low-level felony charge was
not permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, a provision which
eventually led to court congestion and a slowdown of the judicial
process as well as precluding any cooperation of suspects with
police seeking information on higher-level dealers and suppliers.
</p>

<p> New York State became in effect a laboratory in which the
effectiveness of a &quot;get tough&quot; drug law could be
examined. By comparing the drug-related statistics for New York
before and after the new law went into effect, and by examining
similar statistics from neighboring states whose laws had not
changed, comparisons could be drawn and evidence could be
weighed. A study commissioned by the Association of the Bar of
the City of New York to find out the effects of the law concluded
that neither heroin use nor the crime commonly associated with it
declined in New York State as a result of the tough new
legislation. With respect to heroin use, the study found the
following: </p>

<p> Heroin use [in New York City] was as widespread in mid-1976
as it had been when the 1973 revision took effect, and ample
supplies of the drug were available. </p>

<p> The pattern of stable heroin use in New York City between
1973 and mid-1976 was not appreciably different from the average
pattern in other East Coast cities. </p>

<p> The new law may have temporarily deterred heroin use [in New
York City and other New York State jurisdictions]- </p>

<p> There is no evidence of a sustained reduction in heroin use
after 1973 [in New York State as a whole or in upstate New York].
</p>

<p> Most evidence suggests that the illegal use of drugs other
than narcotics in New York City was more widespread in 1976 than
in 1973, and that in this respect New York was not unique among
East Coast cities.&quot; </p>

<p> With respect to crime, the study found: </p>

<p> Serious property crime of the kind often associated with
heroin users increased sharply [in New York State] between 1973
and 1975. The rise in New York State was similar to increases in
nearby states. </p>

<p> There was a sharp rise in non-drug felony crimes between 1973
and 1975 [in New York City]. However, the rise was apparently
unconnected with illegal narcotics use: non-drug felony crimes
known to have been committed by narcotics users remained stable
during that period. </p>

<p> The available evidence suggests that the recidivist
sentencing [predicate felony] provisions of the 1973 law did not
significantly deter prior felony offenders from committing
additional crimes [in New York City].92 </p>

<p> In addition, the study found little enthusiasm for the 1973
law within the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> Many judges and prosecutors felt that the mandatory minimum
sentencing provisions reduced the of individual treatment of
offenders and, therefore, the quality of justice. </p>

<p> Some were troubled because the penalties level drug
traffickers were more severe than those applicable to crimes that
most citizens consider heinous.... New York City prosecutors
tended to believe that the 1973 law was forcing them to scatter
their limited resources on what they considered relatively minor
offenses. (Note: The Class III (lowest level) felony accounted
for 41% of all drug indictments in New York City and 61% of the
trial workload.) ... As for the police, the New York City Police
Department believed that a policy of all-out street level
enforcement would be only marginally productive and would
hopelessly inundate the courts. 93 </p>

<p> Because of the large volume of street-level drug activity in
New York City, the New York City Police Department had the
opportunity to make large numbers of street-level arrests under
the new drug law. It did not elect to do so, for the reason that
past efforts had been perceived as ineffective. As the study
recorded, </p>

<p> In 1969, the Department had implemented a policy similar to
the one implied by the new law. Large numbers of low-level drug
arrests had been encouraged, and the number of felony drug
arrests had risen from 7,199 in 1967 to 26,379 in 1970. In 1971,
however, Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy abandoned this policy
because (a) only a small percentage of the arrests were resulting
in prison or jail sentences and (b) the mass arrest policy did
not appear to be having a significant impact on the drug traffic.
In the Department's view, the mass arrest policy was also
creating serious workload problems for the courts. Immediately
after the change in policy, arrests fell sharply; in 1973, there
were only a little more than one-third as many as two years
earlier.... According to Donald Cawley, New York City Police
Commissioner when the 1973 law became effective, the Department
decided not to change its enforcement policies in response to the
1973 legislation. The Department continued to focus its
enforcement activities on the middle and upper levels of drug
distribution rather than upon street-level drug activity.&quot; </p>

<p> The study concluded, &quot;The key lesson to be drawn from
the experience with the 1973 drug law is that passing a new law
is not enough. What criminal statutes say matters a great deal,
but the efficiency, morale, and capacity of the criminal justice
system is even more of a factor in determining whether the law is
effectively implemented.&quot;95 In addition, the study noted
that implementation of the new law, which included the hiring of
new narcotics case judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and
support staff, cost the state of New York $32 million. </p>

<p> What the study of the New York law indicates is that there
are serious limits to what any law can control. It is apparent
now that the rhetoric which helped create a climate for the new
law-i.e., statements which attributed exaggerated amounts of
crime to drug addicts-was also in part responsible for the
failure of the law to live up to expectations. This is not to
suggest that law enforcement approaches to illicit drug use
should be abandoned because they fail in what they attempt to do.
Rather, it means that our expectations should be realistic,
because our ability to deal with these complex problems is
limited. In New York, administrative problems, court congestion,
the doubts which many judges and prosecutors had about the new
law, and the difficulties of policing illicit drugs under any
circumstances all joined together to reduce the law's
effectiveness. The conclusion is that this law changed very
little in New York. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>The Impact of Drug Law Enforcement on Drug Using Behavior<br>
</b> </p>

<p> An interesting contrast to the New York &quot;get tough&quot;
law is the Oregon law of 1973 which &quot;decriminalized&quot;
the possession of a small quantity of marijuana. The state took
this action following the recommendations of the National
Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. The new Oregon law-and
those in other states which subsequently enacted similar
legislation-eliminated the possibility of imprisonment for simple
possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. A civil fine,
similar to a traffic citation, was substituted for the former
criminal penalties. There were to be no criminal arrests for such
offenses nor would there be court arraignment. </p>

<p> Critics of the new law predicted an explosion of both
experimental and regular marijuana use in Oregon. This prediction
was rooted in the persistent belief that it is primarily the law
that restrains people from using illicit drugs-the same view
which in part prompted the tough New York law. </p>

<p> However, annual surveys conducted in Oregon during the four
years following enactment of the new law have shown little change
at all in marijuana use patterns.&quot;&quot; Marijuana users
have increased gradually in number, but this is true across the
nation. Regular users have remained relatively constant, a
pattern that is also typical of other state and national trends. </p>

<p> Since Oregon passed its law, only ten other states have
adopted the reduced penalty for possession of small amounts of
marijuana, despite the preponderance of available evidence that
marijuana is not a major health hazard when used moderately and
that criminal laws apparently do not deter millions from using
it. </p>

<p> The New York law was aimed primarily at heroin, and did
little, if anything, to change use patterns there. The Oregon law
was aimed at marijuana, and it too did little, if anything, to
change use patterns. What both these experiences suggest is just
how little the criminal law influences an individual's decision
to use a particular drug, illegal or not. Similarly, the
prohibition of alcohol in the early part of this century did
little to prevent millions of Americans from consuming it. </p>

<p> These recent legislative developments underscore another
point. Generally, the public and its policymakers have focused
narrowly on eliminating the consumption of one or two drugs in
particular, without giving much thought as to the effect of this
restricted concentration. These policies seem to be based upon
the theory that once marijuana or heroin or cocaine is eliminated
then the problems of drug abuse in the United States will be
solved.<br>
</p>

<p> In 1971 the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), an
organization established by the joint Chiefs of Staff to develop
independent information and analysis, examined aspects of illicit
drug use in this country. The IDA study concluded that heroin
addicts are probably willing to switch to amphetamines,
barbiturates, and other drugs should heroin become prohibitively
expensive or unavailable .97 Through studies of the urinalysis
screening program of inmates of the Washington, D.C. jails, the
Institute found that before the East Coast dock strike of 1971
nearly 20 percent of the inmates tested positive for opiates.
During the strike, however, this percentage dropped to zero while
that for barbiturate and amphetamine use rose from its former 3
or 4 percent level to nearly 20 percent.,,,, While it is not
conclusive, the study did underscore the fact that we have very
little hard data on the habits, preferences, alternatives, and
attitudes of heroin users. Models, analyses, and other
information offer a limited glimpse of these factors, and then
for only a limited time frame. </p>

<p> This study and other more recent ones&quot;&quot; have
suggested that the usage patterns for heroin may be more flexible
than is generally believed, and therefore less vulnerable to
strategies that focus on the elimination of supply. Although
better domestic enforcement, border control, and foreign
eradication efforts might tighten the heroin market to some
extent, any long-range improvement as regards drug-related
problems remains uncertain. Despite this, and the limited ability
of the criminal justice system to alter human behavior, when laws
fail to discourage an activity' that the majority in a society
deems undesirable the natural impulse is to toughen them to
attain the desired effect.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p> <b><font size="5">Concluding Thoughts<br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> Since federal antinarcotics laws have been in force in this
country for more than sixty years-and local ordinances for more
than a century-it seems appropriate to ask what such laws can or
have accomplished. if we were expecting our drug laws to
eradicate illicit drug use, then the local, state, and federal
antidrug effort must be judged an abject failure. Tough laws have
not been a solution to the drug abuse crisis. If, however, one
was hoping for a containment policy, then enforcement efforts
might be judged a partial success, because only a relatively
small number of people use heroin, the drug with which we seem
most concerned today. This conclusion, of course, is impossible
to prove. Moreover, mere containment of heroin use was never the
stated goal of our drug control efforts. </p>

<p> The best way to judge the value of our present drug control
policies is to weigh their benefits and costs. This may give us
some clues with which to better analyze our current policies and
reach a clearer understanding of their worth. In making this
assessment, it is natural that drug law enforcement be examined
more critically than other approaches, such as treatment or
education. Drug enforcement has received the majority of the
available time, money, technology, and hope and faith for the
past seven decades. It is not unreasonable to say that law
enforcement efforts have been given the greatest possible
opportunity to respond to illicit drugs, and that those efforts
ought to be evaluated in light of their performance. </p>

<p> What then are the costs of drug law enforcement? Several can
be identified: money outlays for enforcement; such side effects
as the stigma of arrest, the risk of impure drugs and associated
health hazards, the creation of a black market, a potential rise
in non-drug crime rates, and the risk of police corruption; the
alienation of many segments of society; selective enforcement
patterns; diversion of scarce resources; erosion of the rule of
law; invasion of privacy; reduction of personal freedom;
hostility between police and the community; and potential police
perjury and official deception. These are some costs generally
ascribed to the current prohibitionist policy approach to
particular drugs. </p>

<p> The benefits are less specific and less provable. We can
point to the arrest of individuals who traffic in illicit drugs
as a benefit, at least in the small percentage of cases where
arrest is followed by conviction and punishment But we cannot
point to drug enforcement generally and argue that it has had a
dramatically successful impact in prohibiting these activities.
One benefit often cited is the channeling into treatment by means
of criminal justice diversion of illicit drug users who might
otherwise not have entered; however, this process may have a
negative impact in deterring voluntary applicants from seeking
help (see Staff Paper 3, &quot;Heroin Treatment&quot;, below).
Law enforcement efforts may also have had an impact in containing
the spread of illicit drug use during years when strong penalties
have been on the books and substantial efforts were made to
enforce those laws. While drug law enforcement efforts
undoubtedly do harass some low-level operatives in the illicit
drug market and make them afraid to deal openly on the street,
this may be a marginal benefit, in that it makes it likely that
users will only become more cautious and harder to detect. While
ease of availability does appear to have some influence on the
numbers who will use a particular drug, making availability
harder does not eliminate the demand for a particular drug or
psychoactive substances generally. </p>

<p> The key question remains: Is the current system of drug
control worthwhile? An abundance of data has been collected-some
of it presented in this chapter-but it is consistently
contradictory, imprecise, of questionable reliability, and laden
with the values we impute to it. Nevertheless, we would conclude
that the costs are greater than the benefits derived. Part of the
difficulty with criminal law as a control measure lies in the
fact that it has been consistently oversold as a cure for illicit
drug use. A serious consequence of this is that drug law
enforcement has rarely been viewed dispassionately; rather, it
has been the object of either heated attack or staunch defense,
and rarely the object of thoughtful analysis. </p>

<p> Our current drug control policies exact a heavy toll in
social costs, while data showing a solid return on the investment
are difficult to find. This imbalance has been known for some
time, but the knowledge of it has not materially changed our drug
control policies and laws. The basic policy established a century
ago continues today, and there are no immediate prospects of the
government, federal or state, seriously reconsidering its heavy
reliance on the criminal justice system to deal with illicit
drugs.<br>

<h1>Legislative Options for Cannabis Use in Australia </h1>

<h1>Executive summary<br>

<p><img src="../../../Graphics/blueline.GIF" width="562"

</p>

<h2><a href="can_ch1.htm">Chapter 1: Introduction</a> </h2>

<p>This paper is concerned with the legislative options available
for cannabis, and the impact of those options on the community at
large and on the law enforcement sector. It has been prepared by
the Australian Institute of Criminology at the request of the
National Task Force on Cannabis; the Task Force plans to use this
paper in developing its recommendations to the National Drug
Strategy Committee. This paper, along with other commissioned
Task Force papers, may in future be used to inform the
development of a national policy on cannabis. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch2.htm">Chapter 2: Policy goals</a> </h2>

<p>Given the importance which is assigned to setting clear goals
for any major social policy, it is surprising how infrequently
discussion of drug policy is preceded by a precise specification
of what the policy is intended to achieve. Too often, goals are
either global (e.g. to reduce drug use) or unattainable (e.g. to
eliminate drug use), and as such they allow for many
interpretations. Similarly, goals are often stated in such a way
that they could be achieved through a number of quite
contradictory strategies and at vastly differing costs. </p>

<p>This report starts from the proposition that it is important
to know what are the requirements for rational drug policy in
general, and what are the objectives of cannabis policy
specifically. In this context, it is important to address the
issue of drug policy, as well as drug legislation. The link
between policy, legislation and implementation is important and
must be factored into these considerations. The development of
policy and legislation relating to cannabis should take into
account the following issues: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Arguments that apply to the most appropriate control
        regime for one drug need not &quot; and often do
        not&quot; apply to others. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Drug policy should be crafted to take account of the
        different patterns and types of harms caused by specific
        drugs.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The details of control regimes are crucial determinants
        of their outcomes. Such details should not be left
        undefined. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Any analysis of control regimes should attempt to
        estimate their effects on both consumption levels and
        patterns of use. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Control regimes should not be considered in isolation
        from the problems of implementation and enforcement. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Arguments about the consequences of drug use should be
        separated from arguments about morals.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Options should be evaluated on the basis of evidence of
        damage. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Any policy should recognise the changing nature of the
        drug problem and be able to change with it. Additionally,
        all policies should be reviewed periodically to ensure
        that they are still relevant to current circumstances.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Policy should be made in the light of the costs of
        control as well as the benefits.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The goals of drug policy should be realistic.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Discussion of policy options should include a
        specification of which harms they are intended to reduce.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Discussion of cannabis policy (and drug policy generally)
        should recognise the existence of multiple and sometimes
        contradictory goals.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Policies to discourage cannabis use should be shown to be
        effective or be changed.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The harms caused by the control regimes themselves should
        not outweigh the harms prevented by them.<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The application of these principles in a given situation
should lead to the development of explicit policy goals relating
to cannabis. It is likely that priorities will need to be
assigned between the available goals, as they are frequently
inconsistent. Nevertheless, the explicit specification of the
goals which policy and legislation are intended to achieve is
essential if they are to be properly articulated and evaluated. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch3.htm">3. Cannabis in context: history, laws
and international treaties</a> </h2>

<p>Cannabis has been used for many thousands of years. It has
been used for the production of material products such as
clothing and rope; for its medicinal properties; and for its
psychoactive properties. Cannabis was used medicinally in
Australia until the mid-1960s and is currently used in many parts
of the world, in the form of hemp, for the production of cordage,
clothing, etc. </p>

<p>Australian drug laws, like those of many other countries,
closely followed the development of international drug treaties.
The influence of the United States of America in the conception
and development of treaties and related international instruments
has been enormous. The 1925 Geneva Convention on Opium and Other
Drugs was the first such convention to cover cannabis. The
Convention required the parties to limit the availability of
cannabis to medical and scientific purposes only. This remains
the status of cannabis in the international community. </p>

<p>Numerous enquires into drug use and trafficking have been
conducted both in Australia and overseas. Australian committees
have generally been very cautious about recommending changes to
the legal status of drugs. Nevertheless, a number of high level
Australian committees of inquiry have recommended the
liberalisation of legislation relating to cannabis, or at least
that such liberalisation be carefully considered. The most recent
of these at the national level was the Parliamentary Joint
Committee on the National Crime Authority which reported in 1989,
and at the State/Territory level, the Australian Capital
Territory Legislative Assembly's Select Committee on HIV, Illegal
Drugs and Prostitution, which reported in 1991. </p>

<p>In the main, cannabis was little known or used in Australia
until the 1960s. Nevertheless, the drugs legislation which was
introduced in most of the States and Territories towards the end
of the 1800s and early 1900s (primarily concerned with the
smoking of opium by Chinese people) provided a framework for the
prohibition of cannabis. The first Australian controls on
cannabis use were introduced in Victoria in 1928 legislation
which penalised the unauthorised use of Indian hemp and resin.
This was followed by corresponding legislation in the other
jurisdictions as the years passed. From the 1960s, however, the
Commonwealth has become increasingly involved in legislation
relating to cannabis (particularly with regard to its
importation). The penalties relating to cannabis cultivation,
possession and use were generally quite severe during the 1960s
and 1970s but have tended to lessen since then in most
jurisdictions, at least with regard to the minor offences of use
and possession of small quantities. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant recent legislative changes have
been the introduction in 1987 in South Australia and in 1992 in
the Australian Capital Territory of expiation notice schemes.
Under these schemes, a person found committing a minor offence
relating to cannabis is given what amounts to an
&quot;on-the-spot&quot; notice. If the prescribed penalty is paid
within the prescribed time then no court appearance is required
and no conviction is entered. If the person receiving the
expiation notice fails to respond to it, however, normal court
processes follow. </p>

<p>People considering the legal status of drugs and the
possibility of legislative change need to be cognisant of
Australia's international treaty obligations. Although some
difference of opinion exists with regard to the range of
legislative options for cannabis which are available to Australia
within the scope of the international treaties, it is clear that
the policy of total prohibition currently followed by most States
and Territories is only one of a number of options which are
available. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4: Five legislative options for
cannabis in Australia</a> </h2>

<p>Many legislative options are available for cannabis, and much
confusion exists in the terminology used to describe them. In our
view, the South Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical
Use of Drugs (the Sackville Commission) which reported in 1978
provided the most useful categorisation of these options. The
language used avoids the terms 'decriminalisation' and
'legalisation' as these expressions have quite different meanings
for different authorities. The five options discussed below
capture all the approaches which people have in mind when they
refer to 'decriminalisation' and 'legalisation', as well as other
options which these two words may or may not encompass. The
options are total prohibition (with and without an administrative
expediency principle), prohibition with civil penalties for minor
offences, partial prohibition, regulation and free availability. </p>

<p>Under the system of total prohibition the use, possession,
cultivation, importation, sale and distribution of any amount of
cannabis are treated as criminal offences. Total prohibition can
take a number of forms. In the United States, for example, the
eradication of all illicit drug use is a central aim of drug
policy and it is thought that total prohibition is the most
effective means of reaching this goal. Cannabis use is seen as
part of a larger drug problem and is dealt with as such. The
total prohibition policy, as implemented in the United States,
many other countries and most of the Australian States and
Territories, has clearly not achieved its intended goal of
substantially reducing cannabis consumption. This is despite an
increasing amount of resources directed towards achieving this
goal. Both the financial and social costs of law enforcement
under an active policy of total prohibition are high. The policy
fails to meet a number of the crucial criteria for good drugs
policy, enunciated above. Cannabis policy has not been separated
from that of other drugs; arguments about the consequences of
drug use have not been separated from arguments about morals; the
goals of the 'war on drugs' are unrealistic; it appears that the
harms caused by the control regimes outweigh the harms caused by
the drug itself. </p>

<p>The Netherlands provides an example of a quite different
application of the total prohibition policy from that observed in
the United States and elsewhere. In The Netherlands, legislation
makes a clear distinction between 'drugs presenting unacceptable
risks', on the one hand, and 'cannabis products', on the other.
In addition, a clause in The Netherlands Code of Criminal
Procedure, known as the 'Expediency Principle', states that the
Prosecution Office may decide whether or not to enforce certain
laws, to prosecute or to initiate criminal investigation on the
basis of whether or not such action would be 'in the public
interest'. Using this clause, the Minister of Justice issued
guidelines in 1976 for the enforcement of drug laws and the
investigation and prosecution of breaches of drug laws.
Essentially it is these guidelines, rather than the total
prohibition legislation, that determines drug policy in The
Netherlands. According to the guidelines, dealing, possessing or
producing small amounts of cannabis do not require police
investigation, arrest or prosecution. </p>

<p>A low priority is also given to the investigation and
prosecution of retail dealing in cannabis, and police are only
required to confront cannabis dealers when they advertise
publicly or conduct their business in a provocative manner. This
is part of a broader government policy of 'normalisation', under
which efforts are made not to marginalise drug users, but to
ensure that the harm related to their drug use is minimised and
that they are able to avail themselves of community services to
the optimum extent. Evaluative studies have shown that cannabis
use has not increased in The Netherlands since the liberalisation
of its policy relating to cannabis. Indeed, levels of cannabis
consumption are far lower than those of the United States, where
the total prohibition policy is rigorously enforced. The policy
of the separation of the drug markets (i.e. separating cannabis
from other drugs which can have more serious consequences) has
apparently been successful. In a number of ways The Netherlands'
drug policy meets many of the criteria for good drug policy
discussed above. </p>

<p>The second policy option is that of prohibition with civil
penalties. Under this option, the penalties for the possession
and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis for personal use are
dealt with by civil sanctions such as paying a monetary penalty,
rather than by criminal sanctions such as fines or imprisonment.
Criminal sanctions still apply to the possession, cultivation and
distribution of large quantities of cannabis. The South
Australian Cannabis Expiation Notice Scheme, introduced in 1987,
and the similar scheme introduced in the Australian Capital
Territory in 1992 are examples of this option in practice. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, under the South Australian and ACT
systems, minor cannabis offences such as the possession of small
quantities, cannabis consumption, or the cultivation of a small
number of plants are expiable offences, i.e. if the prescribed
penalty is paid within the specified period, the offender does
not have to appear in court and avoids a criminal conviction. If
the penalty is not paid then the normal court appearance and
possibility of conviction ensues. </p>

<p>The evaluations conducted to date indicate that the cannabis
expiation notice schemes go a long way towards achieving their
goals and meeting the criteria for effective drugs policy
discussed above. This option takes account of the different
patterns of use and harms relating to cannabis, compared with
other drugs. The policy and legislative development has been
accompanied by attention to the details of implementation, rather
than being expressed in general terms only. It reflects an
understanding of the patterns of harm associated with cannabis,
recognising that much of the harm relates to the patterns of
enforcement of cannabis legislation, rather than to the use of
the drug itself. The approach is realistic and the goals
attainable, focusing on minimising the negative impact on users
of cannabis-related involvement in the criminal justice system,
along with producing society-wide benefits in terms of lessening
the financial costs to the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>The major concern associated with this approach (at least in
South Australia where most experience has been gained) is that
there could be a social class differential in terms of the
application of the policy. In other words, people from lower
socioeconomic classes could be disproportionately represented
among those who fail to expiate the offence and, consequently,
obtain criminal records. This concern is balanced by the
observation that, at a society-wide level, it appears that the
patterns of cannabis consumption are similar in South Australia
and the ACT to those found in the other jurisdictions which
operate policies of total prohibition. </p>

<p>The third legislative option is partial prohibition. This is
an option which seeks to maintain controls on the production and
distribution of cannabis while at the same time avoiding the
costs of criminalising the use of the drug. Under partial
prohibition, it would remain an offence to grow or deal in
cannabis in commercial quantities. It would not be an offence to
use cannabis or to possess or grow it in quantities judged
appropriate for personal use. A number of variations are possible
within this broad outline. A small number of countries, for
example Spain, have followed this model. Other countries, such as
Italy, have made possession and use unlawful, but not criminally
punishable. In none of these cases does it seem that an increase
in cannabis use has resulted from the establishment of this
legislative approach. </p>

<p>The partial prohibition model attempts to use legal
restrictions to discourage cannabis use by concentrating on the
prohibition of the commercial cultivation and supply and on the
advertising of the availability of the product. At the same time,
the model attempts to minimise the personal and social costs of
the total prohibition policy by allowing the use and personal
possession of cannabis. It assumes, therefore, that the harms
associated with cannabis are sufficiently serious to justify some
level of restriction on its availability and that criminal
sanctions remain an appropriate instrument to achieve this
restriction. </p>

<p>Since this model has not been fully implemented and evaluated
in any country, no empirically based information is available as
to the likely outcomes of this model. Nevertheless, it is likely
that the main outcome would be to reduce the financial and social
costs of having personal possession and use a criminal offence.
The possibility of an increased level of use of cannabis, under
this model, has been suggested as a potential limitation on its
effectiveness. It appears, however, that this fear is unfounded
owing to such factors: as the limited role of deterrents in a
situation where only a low probability of detection occurs;
evidence that fear of arrest is not a significant factor in
people's decision not to use cannabis; and evidence that reducing
or eliminating penalties does not generally lead to any increase
in cannabis consumption. This option meets the criteria of
effective drugs policy to a greater extent than some of the other
options considered here. It separates cannabis from other
(potentially more harmful) drugs. It seeks to minimise the
negative impacts of enforcement regimes. It acknowledges the
contradiction between the goals of limiting cannabis use while
minimising the negative aspects of enforcement. Finally, its
goals are realistic and attainable. </p>

<p>The fourth legislative option is regulation. In this approach,
the production, distribution and the sale of cannabis would be
controlled to a greater or lesser extent by government agencies.
Trafficking outside the regulated system would continue to be a
criminal offence and attract penalties. Activities associated
with personal use, however, would not be penalised. While no full
working model of this option is available, cannabis control in
The Netherlands exhibits some elements of the regulatory option.
While the Dutch Government does not license production,
distribution or sale of cannabis, youth centres and coffee shops
selling hemp products operate openly under certain clearly
defined conditions. Examples of regulatory systems for drugs
other than cannabis exist within Australia. For instance, opium
poppies are cultivated under government licence in Tasmania. A
regulatory regime applies to the drugs tobacco, alcohol and many
pharmaceutical products. </p>

<p>The two major regulatory models for currently illicit drugs
are regulated commercial sale and government monopoly. The option
exists, within this broad approach, for a range of initiatives to
limit the attractiveness of cannabis, including setting high
prices through taxation and limiting the availability of the
product. The primary rationale for the regulatory option is the
recognition that the eradication of all cannabis use is an
unrealistic goal and that, since cannabis use will occur, it
should occur in the safest possible environment. It recognises
that the gateway theory of drug use (that cannabis users have an
increased likelihood of progression to more dangerous drugs as a
direct result of using cannabis) is not supported by empirical
evidence. </p>

<p>The outcomes of a regulatory policy would depend very much on
the regulatory framework established. To achieve its goals, the
regime would need to be structured in such a way as to remove the
incentives for the operation of a black market in cannabis. While
considerable financial and social costs could be avoided by the
operation of this policy, it could entail a complex system of
licensing and monitoring which could involve high administrative
costs. These implementation details would need to be clearly
worked out to attain a satisfactory balance. </p>

<p>A number of policy goals might be satisfied by a well-designed
regulatory system. These include the separation of drug markets,
a separation of arguments about the consequences of drug use from
arguments about morals, the adoption of a realistic approach to
drug use and a reduction in harm. Two important factors must,
however, be kept in mind. The first is the need to mould any
policy of regulation to fit the particular drug  in this case
cannabis. Secondly, regulatory policy must take into account not
only legislative frameworks but also appropriate measures of
social control, such as appropriate drug education and
prohibitions on advertising, so that the goals of reduction of
harm can continue to be pursued. </p>

<p>The final option discussed here is the free availability of
cannabis. Like the total prohibition option, this is an extreme
legislative option. Free availability would mean the absence of
any legislative or regulatory restrictions on the substance's
cultivation, importation, sale, supply by other means, possession
or use. This legislative option is not practised in any countries
at the moment but was the approach used in Australia until the
1920s. It must be noted, however, that very little cannabis use
occurred up to this time. </p>

<p>Although a strong lobby exists for the liberalisation of
cannabis legislation in Australia, few lobbyists advocate totally
free availability. Perhaps for pragmatic reasons, at least some
form of regulation is generally deemed acceptable. This reflects
concerns about the quality of cannabis (e.g. the presence of
health-impairing pesticide residues), driving or operating
machinery while intoxicated by the drug, its use by children,
etc. Those who advocate totally free availability do so on the
basis of an extreme libertarian position. </p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the free availability option ever
being fully implemented, particularly in Australia. To do so
would require governments to abrogate all responsibility in the
area of consumer protection, to forego taxation revenue and to
take no action to protect particularly vulnerable groups. </p>

<p>Considering the position of other drugs in Australian society,
it is difficult to maintain an argument for the free availability
legislative option. This is because governments have both the
right and the responsibility to act to mitigate sources of harm
to society. The culture shift in most Western nations to minimise
the harm caused by currently licit drugs, especially tobacco and
alcohol, means that the free availability of cannabis is not a
viable contemporary option. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch5.htm">Chapter 5: Diversion and compulsory
treatment</a> </h2>

<p>The terms of reference for this study include a review of
diversion and compulsory treatment as they relate to cannabis
users. Diversion of cannabis users can take a number of forms,
including pre-arrest diversion, pre-court diversion, pre-sentence
diversion or post-conviction diversion. Compulsory treatment may
or may not be a feature of diversionary process, that is,
compulsory treatment is sometimes mandated as a condition of the
diversion of an offender or an alleged offender from the criminal
justice system, but sometimes operates independently of that
system. </p>

<p>Pre-arrest diversion is essentially the discretion exercised
by police at the point of contact with an alleged offender. In
addition to this form of diversion, a variety of more or less
formal diversionary programs are in place in Australia and
overseas. As indicated above, they operate at a range of points
in the processing of alleged and convicted offenders and take a
wide variety of forms. In the Australian Capital Territory, for
example, legislation provides, as a sentencing option, that
anyone found guilty of an offence may being sent for assessment
as to whether the person is drug dependent and suitable for
referral to treatment. In these instances, an offender may be
referred to a treatment assessment panel consisting of a legal
practitioner and two others with extensive knowledge of alcohol
and other drug treatment. In conjunction with the offender and
relevant treatment agency, the panel makes a recommendation to
the court which will determine the length of time the person
should spend at the treatment centre and the pattern of periodic
reviews. If the person consistently fails to appear for review or
fails to undertake the treatment program, a summons may be issued
and the person dealt with by the court in the normal way.
Diversionary programs mandated by legislation also exist in South
Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The
method of operation of the diversionary programs differs from
case-to-case. Diversionary systems in other countries illustrate
a further variety of options. </p>

<p>Although only a tiny minority of cannabis users report
problems with the drug serious enough to require treatment, it is
widely accepted that a prison sentence is an unsatisfactory
option for many offenders with drug problems, and diversion for
the purpose of treatment is a widely used alternative, one
welcomed by judges and magistrates. Criminal justice system
involvement is seen as providing an opportunity to intervene in
drug users' lives in order to confront them with their drug
problems and to bring them into contact with treatment agencies.
In some cases, merely attending for assessment is sufficient to
bring about a change in a person's attitude. While some dispute
exists about the value of coercion, the fact that involuntary
clients tend to spend longer in treatment programs than do
voluntary clients frequently contributes to their exhibiting more
successful treatment outcomes. It should be noted, however, that
few cannabis users need treatment for dependence on cannabis as
such. Rather, their needs are more likely to centre around their
lifestyles and psychological needs generally. </p>

<p>A number of countries, and within Australia the State of
Victoria, have legislative provisions relating to civil
commitment for the compulsory treatment of drug users, generally
people deemed to be drug dependent. In Victoria, for example, a
person who is dependent on alcohol and/or other drugs and who is
considered suitable for treatment may be committed for treatment
for a period of seven days, and at the discretion of the medical
officer in charge of the assessment centre, for a second seven
days. Civil commitment is widely used for drug users in the
United States. It is generally applied to people who come to the
attention of the criminal justice or the health systems, and who
refuse to enter treatment voluntarily. The individual is referred
for medical examination and, on the basis of that examination,
may be committed to compulsory treatment. Naturally, this raises
serious issues regarding the civil rights of the individuals
involved, as decisions are made about their liberty without
referral to a court. The relevance of such programs to
legislative options for cannabis in Australia are limited, owing
to the fact that very few cannabis users have problems with
dependence on the drug, and there is little evidence that
treatment, as it is generally understood, has much to offer
cannabis users. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch6.htm">Chapter 6: Evaluating new legislative
approaches to cannabis</a> </h2>

<p>The principle of evaluating new policy and legislation is
widely accepted but is less frequently observed in practice. In
Australia and most other Western nations, insufficient has been
done, especially by government agencies, to monitor and evaluate
their national drug policies. This is the case in instances where
drugs legislation has been developed incrementally, and also
where new approaches have been implemented following detailed
policy reviews. Too often evaluation is considered relevant only
after a policy has been in place for some time and changes are
being considered. To be of most value, new initiatives should be
designed and implemented with an explicit and adequately
resourced monitoring and evaluation component built into the
initiative from the outset. Policy evaluation is a different
process from program evaluation, having different goals and
research techniques. </p>

<p>Australia's National Drug Strategic Plan 1993-97 provides the
framework within which we base our recommendations relating to
monitoring and evaluation. The plan points out that 'the overall
mission of the National Drug Strategy is to minimise the harmful
effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society'. Policies
and programs in specific areas, including cannabis, should be
evaluated in a manner consistent with this national goal. </p>

<p>Decision-making relating to legislative options for cannabis
in Australia can be conducted in an ad hoc manner, but clearly
the application of more systematic policy choice models is
preferable. Two groups of such decision-making models are
available to governments, the 'rational' and the 'incremental'
approaches. A rational decision-making model is one which goes
through logical steps to clarify the context of the legislative
initiative, its goals, the rationales for the goals and the
likely impacts on key stakeholders. It includes a careful
analysis of the data available to evaluate the proposed approach.
The process would end in making judgments regarding the
appropriateness of the goal or goals, how achievable the goals
are and, if the goals are judged to be achievable, how effective,
efficient and appropriate are the implementation options
available. This systematic, rational approach to policy
evaluation is not often enough seen in the development of drugs
policy. Nevertheless, the National Drug Strategic Plan provides a
clear framework for engaging in this type of analysis. The
information presented in this report, along with the research
reports prepared by other groups for the National Task Force on
Cannabis, provides a firm base for the making of rational policy
choices. </p>

<h2><a href="can_ch7.htm">Chapter 7: Conclusion</a> </h2>

<p>Australia's National Drug Strategy provides a policy framework
within which new legislative approaches may be developed. Both
existing and newer approaches have the possibility of both
enhancing and detracting from the achievement of the mission of
the National Drug Strategy, that of minimising the harmful
effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society. </p>

<p>No best single option for cannabis legislation exists. What is
most appropriate will depend upon what goals both policy makers
and the community are seeking to achieve. Our review suggests
that two of the five legislative options discussed above are
inappropriate in contemporary Australian circumstances. They are
the options which we have characterised as total prohibition and
free availability. Australia experiences more harm, we conclude,
from maintaining the cannabis prohibition policy than it
experiences from the use of the drug. We also reject the
legislative option of the free availability of cannabis. Our
society is one that accepts that governments and others have both
the right and the responsibility to intervene in diverse ways to
protect people from harm and to advance the common good. It would
be unreasonable, therefore, to argue that cannabis should be
available in an uncontrolled manner. </p>

<p>We conclude that cannabis law reform is required in this
country. Many options for policy, legislation and implementation
processes exist within the broad categories of prohibition with
an administrative decision that it is inexpedient to prosecute
people for minor cannabis offences, prohibition with civil
penalties, partial prohibition and regulated availability. We
believe, on the available evidence, that widely accepted social
goals, well attuned to the needs of contemporary Australian
society, will be attained through the adoption and implementation
of policies which lie within these options. </p>

<p> <b>Chapter 1. </b> </p>

<h1>INTRODUCTION </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Australia's National Drug Strategy is widely acclaimed, both
in this country and internationally, as a world leader. It
features a balance between action addressing the demand for and
supply of drugs. It involves a partnership between the government
and non-government sectors. It addresses all drugs, both
currently licit and illicit. Above all, its overarching goal is
to minimise the harmful effects of drugs and drug use in
Australian society (MCDS 1993). It does not have the
impossible-to-achieve goal of eliminating drug use nor the
simplistic approach of addressing just one class of drugs (the
currently illicit ones), the approaches taken by some other
nations. </p>

<p> The project to which this paper contributes is part of
Australia's National Drug Strategy. Under the auspices of the
[1]Commonwealth/State Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, a
National Task Force on Cannabis was formed, to prepare a paper
summarising current knowledge about cannabis use; the paper will
be used by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy to assist it
in developing a national statement on cannabis. As part of this
process, the Australian Institute of Criminology has been
commissioned by the National Task Force on Cannabis to prepare
this paper addressing the legislative options available for
cannabis in Australia. </p>

<p> We have approached the project with an interdisciplinary
orientation, drawing on legal, criminal justice and social
science perspectives. Much of the material presented is factual
information that we believe will assist policy makers and the
community at large to think systematically about cannabis policy
and legislation in Australia; where we have expressed our
opinions on legislative options, this has been made clear. The
paper is structured as follows. </p>

<p> After these introductory remarks, in [2]Chapter 2 we discuss
the issue of policy goals regarding cannabis, arguing that
legislation should not be seen independently from the policies it
implements. We seek to clarify the key issues which underpin
cannabis policy, focusing on the goals of those policies, since
much of the confusion about cannabis policy options and their
effects reflects confusion concerning the policy goals. [3] </p>

<p> Chapter 3 places cannabis in context. A brief overview of the
history of cannabis in Australia and elsewhere is presented. We
then describe the legislative context of Australia's cannabis
policies: domestic legislation and international treaty
obligations are discussed. [4] </p>

<p> Chapter 4 addresses the range of legislative options
available. It describes the options, discusses their rationales,
presents information on the impacts of those options and reviews
them in terms of the goals which they seek to achieve. Five
distinct options are dealt with. At the specific request of the
National Task Force on Cannabis we include, as [5] </p>

<p> Chapter 5, a discussion of the diversion, from the criminal
justice system, of cannabis offenders, and the related topic of
the compulsory treatment of cannabis users. This chapter, like
the previous ones, draws upon both Australian and overseas
experience in these areas. The focus of [6] </p>

<p> Chapter 6 is the process for evaluating legislative options
for cannabis. We discuss both policy evaluation and program
evaluation, as they are usefully dealt with separately. [7] </p>

<p> Chapter 7 concludes the main part of the paper. There we
revisit the central issues of the preceding chapters and make
recommendations regarding the legislative options for cannabis
which we consider most appropriate for contemporary Australia.
Consistent with our consultancy brief, we do not make detailed
recommendations along these lines. Rather, being researchers and
not policy makers, the approach that we have taken is to indicate
those legislative options that we consider to be inappropriate,
and to indicate the dimensions of the policy making task for
dealing with the remaining options. </p>

<p> Three appendixes (touching upon the medical and
horticultural/industrial uses of cannabis, and information about
the authors) are included, along with a listing of source
material that the authors found particularly useful. </p>

<p> We are conscious of the fact that this paper is one of four
being prepared for the National Task Force on Cannabis. The
others address the health impacts of cannabis use, consumption
patterns in Australia and public opinion concerning cannabis. The
findings of the other research teams in their respective areas
should be considered concurrently with the information set out in
the following chapters. Reference Ministerial Council on Drug
Strategy 1993, National Drug Strategic Plan 1993-97, AGPS,
Canberra. </p>

<h2>POLICY GOALS </h2>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Given the importance which is assigned to setting clear goals
for any major social policy, it is surprising how infrequently
discussion of drug policy is preceded by a precise specification
of what the policy is intended to achieve. Too often, goals are
either global (to reduce drug use) or unattainable (to eliminate
drug use) and allow many interpretations. Similarly, goals are
often stated in such a way that they could be achieved through a
number of quite contradictory strategies and at vastly different
costs (economic, social, and personal). Only infrequently does
the discussion address the issue of the costs we are willing to
tolerate in order to achieve stated goals. Rarely is detailed
consideration given to how we might go about measuring the costs,
both of drug use itself and of attempts to control it. </p>

<p> In examining the range of potential regimes for the control
of cannabis use, it is important to have a clear idea of the
criteria against which we might evaluate their effects. Yet
unambiguous and meaningful statements of the objectives of
cannabis policies are difficult to find anywhere. Most official
statements about drug policy generally, and most discussions
about drug control strategies, suffer from one or more of a
number of limitations. They may fail to proffer specific goals.
They may state goals which are known to be unattainable. They may
fail to recognise the existence of multiple goals or, if they do,
they may fail to acknowledge contradictions between them or to
provide a means for assigning priorities when the goals clash. </p>

<p> All of these failings contribute to a policy debate which
lacks precision and intellectual rigour, and whose outcomes
depend more on rhetoric and emotion than on logical argument and
empirical data. This report starts from the proposition that it
is important to know what are the requirements for rational drug
policy in general and what are the objectives of cannabis policy
specifically. Only when these issues are articulated clearly and
can be subjected to full public scrutiny can it be said that the
cannabis policy debate has become a comprehensive and rational
one. The issues discussed in this chapter can be applied, with
suitable modifications as to specifics, to any area of drug
policy. In this chapter we do not take any position on particular
policy options. Our intention is to provide a comprehensive
framework within which any option can be evaluated. </p>

<p> We intend in this chapter, too, to address the issue of drug
policy, rather than drug legislation. As our discussion of
legislative options will show, similar-looking laws may have
quite different implications for cost and effectiveness depending
on the way in which they are administered. In other words, the
policy context may be more important than the legislation in
understanding the impact of a particular approach to cannabis
control. For example, in both the United States and The
Netherlands it is illegal to possess and sell personal-use
quantities of cannabis. The way in which the legislation is
interpreted and enforced, however, puts these two countries at
different ends of the cannabis policy spectrum (Wardlaw 1992). </p>

<p> In its turn, the policy framework adopted in any particular
country can only be understood fully if the observer is aware of
the social and political context within which social problems are
viewed, and with a knowledge of the nature and dimensions of the
drug problem in that country. Some conceptual clarifications
Kleiman and Saiger (1992) suggest that discussion of options for
drug control policy should be preceded by agreement on some basic
conceptual clarifications. These clarifications are intended to
define the nature of a satisfactory debate about drug control
options. </p>

<p> The following list is a modification and extension of Kleiman
and Saiger's suggestions. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Arguments that apply to the most appropriate control
        regime for one drug need not - and often do not apply to
        others. There has been considerable resistance to the
        idea that use of different drugs may best be controlled
        by different strategies. Certainly, a dominant theme in
        the drug control policies of many countries is that it is
        necessary to have consistent policies towards illicit
        drug use. It is argued that treating different illicit
        drugs differently, especially when 'differently' implies
        that one drug will attract less law enforcement attention
        or less social disapproval than another, will undermine
        the general authority and credibility of anti-drug
        messages. This approach overlooks at least one important
        consideration. That is that there are a number of
        approaches to the notion of consistency. Consistency does
        not necessarily imply that we have to have a monolithic
        approach to drug problems. We can, for example, have the
        goal of reducing the harm caused by illicit drug use, but
        can achieve that goal by a number of avenues. There is no
        logical reason why these avenues have to be the same for
        all drugs, as long as we can justify why we are treating
        different drugs differently, and as long as we can
        articulate these reasons to the public. The belief that
        we must maintain a rigid adherence to one set of
        strategies for all illicit drugs ignores the reality that
        we already quite successfully accept inconsistencies and
        contradictions in drug policy across the board. The most
        obvious example is the fact that we allow a number of
        drugs, foremost amongst which are tobacco and alcohol, to
        be used legally despite their causing the same types of
        damage against which we try to protect individuals and
        society by banning the use of other drugs. There is
        general agreement that it is the goal of policy on licit
        drugs to reduce the harm caused by their use. We seek to
        achieve this by attempting to persuade people not to take
        up drug use, to decrease their consumption of these
        drugs, or to alter their manner or pattern of use.
        Although the simplest way to reduce harm would be to
        reduce the number of people using the drugs (assuming for
        the argument here that remaining users continued their
        existing consumption levels and patterns), we do not see
        attempts to get others to move to less dangerous patterns
        of use (rather than giving up use) as undermining the
        message that use of drugs is not socially desirable.
        Rather, we recognise that the overall goal of reducing
        harm can be achieved by persuading some people not to
        take up drugs, others to discontinue their use, and yet
        others to moderate their use or to change to less
        dangerous drugs or methods of administration. Strategies
        aimed at moderation are not seen as undermining
        strategies aimed at abstinence. We simply accept that
        different strategies are appropriate for different groups
        in the community and that they can all contribute to the
        overall goal of harm minimisation. There is no logical
        reason why we cannot adopt the same approach with illicit
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Drug policies should be crafted to take account of the
        different patterns and types of harms caused by specific
        drugs. Attempting to impose across-the-board strategies
        for illicit drug control in the name of consistency
        (ignoring for the moment the glaring inconsistency in not
        treating licit drug use similarly) seems to assume that
        all drug problems are, in fact, equally susceptible to
        the same measures. We know, however, that this is not the
        case. Each drug has its own consumption patterns; each
        drug harms users and others in different ways and to
        different degrees; and each has its own demand patterns,
        supply systems and market characteristics (Kleiman &amp;
        Saiger 1992). Not only do drugs differ in these ways, but
        the same drug may exhibit different characteristics in
        different geographical, socioeconomic or cultural
        contexts (Haaga &amp; Reuter 1990). Accordingly, it is
        not logical to expect that there will be uniform
        solutions to drug problems. 'Consistency for the sake of
        it should not be able to stifle the ability of local
        areas, states or nations to deal with drug problems in a
        manner which is appropriate for their circumstances,
        cultural context, dimensions of the problem and so forth'
        (Wardlaw 1992, p154). It follows that decisions about how
        best to deal with problems in relation to a specific drug
        should be made on the basis of the circumstances
        surrounding use of that drug and the practical
        possibilities for intervening in them. </li>
    <li>The details of control regimes are crucial determinants
        of their outcomes. Such details should not be left
        undefined. Much of the confusion over what is the most
        appropriate regime for the control of cannabis use stems
        from poor definition of terms such as 'decriminalisation'
        and 'legalisation', and lack of specification of the
        details of alternative control regimes being debated. As
        the South Australian Royal Commission into the
        Non-Medical Use of Drugs ([1]South Australia 1978)
        commented, people use these terms in a variety of senses
        and are often unaware of the significant differences that
        exist between various methods of control that have been
        proposed under them. We agree with the Commission that
        these terms are not very helpful. The word
        'decriminalisation' sounds as though it refers to the
        removal of cannabis control from the criminal law. In
        practice, however, it usually refers to changes to the
        law which either allow possession of specified amounts of
        cannabis for personal consumption or reduce the penalties
        for such possession to minor fines or administrative
        sanctions involving no criminal record. As such,
        decriminalisation refers to reducing penalties, rather
        than removing them altogether ([2]Single 1989). Under
        most so-called decriminalisation proposals, dealing in
        cannabis would remain a serious criminal offence. The
        term 'legalisation' presents similar difficulties. It
        covers proposals which would literally remove the drug
        from the criminal law, to those which would limit
        availability to adults (much as alcohol and tobacco are
        now regulated), to more specific proposals which would
        allow access through clinics or other health services
        only to those with established habits. Discussing
        'decriminalisation' or 'legalisation' without specifying
        the details of the particular model being proposed is not
        likely to be very productive (Kleiman &amp; Saiger 1990).
        No sensible discussion of any of the options can take
        place without specification of such details as to whom
        proposed changes would apply and under what
        circumstances, rules about advertising, place and time of
        consumption, whether or not the changes would apply to
        all preparations and forms of cannabis (or, for example,
        be restricted to those falling below a certain potency),
        and the type of regulatory arrangements which would
        replace the current law enforcement ones, together with
        details of their methods of operation and costs. 'Such
        details should not be dismissed as easily determined or
        postponed as a problem requiring future thought' (Kleiman
        &amp; Saiger 1992, p225). This report will discuss policy
        options under the broad headings suggested by the South
        Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical Use of
        Drugs, i.e. the total prohibition model; the
        prohibition/'civil penalty' model; the partial
        prohibition model; the regulatory model; and the free
        availability model ([3]South Australia 1978). Any
        analysis of control regimes should attempt to estimate
        their effects on both consumption levels and patterns of
        use. A major concern about any lessening of the current
        controls on cannabis is that it might lead to increases
        in consumption. While this is a serious concern, it is
        not the only dimension which needs to be monitored. It is
        also important to estimate how patterns of consumption
        might change under different control options. For
        example, if numbers of users rose slightly, but
        consumption per person fell, or less dangerous forms of
        the drug were used, or less harmful methods of use were
        employed, the overall amount of harm occasioned might be
        reduced and the policy might be judged more successful
        than the status quo. Similarly, if under one option, it
        seemed that numbers of users might fall, but that heavier
        use patterns would emerge, or more potent forms of the
        drug would become more popular, the option might be
        judged less desirable, even though a decrease in numbers
        of users had been achieved. </li>
    <li>Control regimes should not be considered in isolation
        from the problems of implementation and enforcement. In
        attempting to predict the outcomes for users of various
        alternatives to the current methods of cannabis control,
        it is important to specify the costs and problems of
        regulation that would accompany them. In all options
        which have any political reality there remains the need
        to licence, to tax or to regulate to ensure that
        restrictions are observed on such things as sale to
        minors, use in conjunction with the operation of vehicles
        or machinery, potency levels, amounts purchased etc. The
        costs and practical problems of implementation should be
        included in any debate about control options. </li>
    <li>Arguments about consequences of drug use should be
        separated from arguments about morals. Much confusion has
        been engendered in the drug policy debate because of a
        failure to separate the negative consequences of drug use
        from moral considerations. It is quite legitimate for a
        community to invoke moral arguments in determining the
        proper course of drug policy (Wilson 1990). But it must
        be clear that the arguments are moral ones, not morality
        disguised as concern over consequences. If opposition to
        cannabis use is based on the view that it is illegitimate
        to use a drug to alter one's perception, to seek pleasure
        or to become intoxicated (a moral argument), then it
        should be clearly stated as such so that the proposition
        can be debated in those terms. It confuses the issue and
        injects unproductive emotion into the argument if that
        concern is disguised by reference to the harms caused by
        cannabis use. These need also to be debated separately.
        We need to know whether there would still be opposition
        to cannabis use on moral grounds even if we could
        eliminate the health costs. </li>
    <li>Options should be evaluated on the basis of evidence of
        damage. We should require that policies that seek to
        impose expensive control regimes on any drug be based on
        evidence of harm occasioned by use of the drug. The cost
        and restrictiveness of the control regime should be
        clearly related to the damage caused by use of the drug,
        and there should be empirical evidence of the type and
        extent of the damage. </li>
    <li>Any policy should recognise the changing nature of the
        drug problem and be able to change with it. Additionally,
        all policies should be reviewed periodically to ensure
        that they are still relevant to current circumstances. A
        major drawback to current approaches to drug policy is
        that they are generally poor at adapting to changes in
        the nature of the drug problem or to changes in our
        levels of knowledge and understanding of drug use
        processes and patterns and their interactions with
        different control strategies. All policies should have
        in-built capacity for evaluation to enable them to be
        adjusted in a timely manner to emerging patterns of use
        or changes in our understanding of the problem. </li>
    <li>Policy should be made in the light of the costs of
        control as well as the benefits. Discussion of any policy
        option should clearly identify any costs associated with
        it. An attempt should be made to inventory all of the
        direct and indirect costs associated with the option,
        including social costs. It is particularly important to
        include any unintended consequences predicted or
        discovered. For example, what are the substitution
        effects of a particular policy (does enforcement success,
        for example, result in fewer users or do the users turn
        to other, more dangerous drugs)? </li>
    <li>The goals of drug policy should be realistic. Enunciating
        unrealistic goals for drug policy can have a number of
        negative consequences. Foremost amongst these are the
        undermining of the credibility of the policy and the
        justification of extreme methods in their pursuit
        (Wardlaw 1992). </li>
    <li>Discussion of policy options should include a
        specification of which harms they are intended to reduce.
        Specifying the harms intended to be reduced by the
        overall policy and the options within it clarifies
        thinking about goals and provides a necessary basis for
        evaluation. If possible, effects should also be discussed
        according to the dimensions of time (short-, medium-, and
        long-term effects), duration (temporary or permanent),
        and scale (minor, moderate, or major). </li>
    <li>Discussion of cannabis policy (and drug policy generally)
        should recognise the existence of multiple and sometimes
        contradictory goals. It may be necessary to choose
        explicitly between goals, to assign them to a hierarchy,
        or to accept that different goals (and, therefore,
        different strategies and programs) may be appropriate for
        different sub-populations or areas. Examples include
        accepting that it is appropriate to teach established
        users safer methods of use while trying to discourage
        other groups from starting use, or police not arresting
        cannabis users because it is considered to impose an
        unwarranted burden on the court and corrections systems. </li>
    <li>Policies to discourage cannabis use should be shown to be
        effective or be changed. Sound social policy should be
        robust enough to withstand critical scrutiny. The costs
        of current approaches to cannabis control are
        considerable and their continuation should be guaranteed
        only if data can be provided which demonstrate their
        effectiveness. The same criterion should be applied to
        any alternative approach. </li>
    <li>The harms caused by the control regimes themselves should
        not outweigh the harms prevented by them. It is very
        difficult to measure accurately the costs both of
        cannabis use and of efforts to prevent it. Nevertheless,
        it is not good enough merely to assert that a policy is
        the correct one, or to fail to investigate alternatives
        when there is evidence of ineffectiveness (the large
        number of users) and cost (the cost of law enforcement,
        the intrusions on civil liberties, violence and
        corruption caused by forcing sales onto a black market,
        and so on). Any social policy should be reviewed when
        there is reason to believe that the costs of
        administering it outweigh the harms reduced. The goals of
        cannabis policy In deciding upon the appropriate model to
        adopt to control cannabis use, it is necessary to specify
        the goals of the policy, as they will constitute the
        criteria against which selection will be made (and
        against which eventual evaluation of performance will be
        made). The following list comprises possible goals which
        have been mentioned in the literature on cannabis policy.
        It is intended as illustrative of the range of goals
        which might be considered and is not a set of goals
        proposed by this report: </li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>to reduce the total amount of cannabis consumed; </li>
    <li>to reduce use among young people; </li>
    <li>to reduce the supply of cannabis to the market; </li>
    <li>to increase the cost of cannabis to the buyer; </li>
    <li>to increase the probability of arrest for a cannabis
        offence; </li>
    <li>to promote safer methods of consumption of cannabis; </li>
    <li>to limit use of cannabis to smaller amounts; </li>
    <li>to limit sales of cannabis to specialist sellers (and not
        to have it sold by dealers in other, more dangerous,
        drugs, for example); </li>
    <li>to limit progression from cannabis use to use of other
        drugs; </li>
    <li>to serve as a symbol of community disapproval of drug
        use; </li>
    <li>to limit the amount of violence in the cannabis
        distribution system; and </li>
    <li>to limit the substitution of other (more damaging) drugs
        for cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> This list is not intended to be comprehensive. It is merely
indicative of the range and detail which needs to be considered
when deciding on policy directions and on the resulting
legislation and implementation strategies. Examination of such a
list makes a number of things apparent. One of these is that to
make sense of it requires the assignment of priorities.
Priorities may be of two types. The first is simply to assign a
ranking in order of importance as judged by some defined
criteria. This is useful when attempting to assign resources to
different parts of a total strategy. A consideration which may
also play a part here is the impact that a particular strategy is
estimated to be capable of having. The second involves deciding
between two or more conflicting goals. Considerations here are
likely to include harms caused or prevented, as well as
considerations such as cost and effectiveness. Laying out goals
in this fashion also alerts us to the need for high quality data
for decision-making, and to the need for sound evaluation
methodologies to be able to measure the impact of our policies
and their resulting implementation strategies. Examination of the
list above makes it immediately apparent that extensive empirical
data are required to be able to assign priorities and measure
impacts. The list also provides a practical example of the sorts
of considerations which policy makers should include in their
deliberations as they attempt to apply the conceptual tools
discussed earlier in this chapter. </p>

<p> In 1978 the South Australian Royal Commission into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs issued a comprehensive discussion paper
on cannabis ([1]South Australia 1978). It proposed a general and
a specific definition of cannabis along the following lines.
Cannabis generally refers to 'the cannabis plant and any
preparations made from the plant, including the dried leaves and
flowering tops, resinous material separated from the plant and
refined oil' ([2]South Australia 1978, p.i). </p>

<p> Like the word 'marijuana', 'cannabis' is also used to refer
specifically to the 'dried preparations of the plant itself'
([3]South Australia 1978, p.i). The words 'cannabis resin' and
'hashish' are used when referring to the resin of the cannabis
flower. Cannabis is a Latin word meaning hemp. The expressions
'hemp' or 'Indian hemp' are particularly used in older documents
cited in this chapter and refer to the whole of the cannabis
plant. </p>

<h3>Cannabis in history </h3>

<p> From its earliest recorded uses, cannabis has been important
in commerce and warfare. Its fibrous stems have been used to make
textiles, paper, ropes and bowstrings. Cannabis has been employed
as a medicine and as a psychoactive drug for social and religious
purposes. Cannabis seeds have been used as an ingredient in the
manufacture of soap, lamp oil, paint and varnish ([4]Abel 1980,
p.x) and as bird seed. </p>

<p> According to[5] Abel (1980), the earliest recorded use of
cannabis occurred in Taiwan, approximately 10,000 years ago. It
also appears to have been used in China as early as the second
century BC for clothing, shoes, bowstrings and for its
anaesthetic properties. In India, it is known to have been
utilised for its psychoactive properties in religious ceremonies
and was an ingredient in three preparations - bhang, ganja and
charas. Its use has been documented in Asia Minor - in Turkey -
as early as 1,000 BC. Both the Greeks and Romans recorded its
efficacy as a medicine - especially for treating earache. One
particular example of its use in the Middle East must be detailed
because of its influence on misconceptions about the properties
of the drug. Between the 11th and 13th centuries AD, a sect known
as the Assassins, followers of Hasan-ibn-Sabah, dominated the
Middle East through a reign of terror. Marco Polo reported that
the Assassins used a drug. He did not identify hashish as this
drug and it appears, in any case, that the drug used by the
Assassins was not used to rouse them to bloody deeds. However, in
the 19th century a number of European writers claimed that the
word 'Assassin' was a derivation of the word 'hashish'. A link
was thus forged and popularised associating cannabis and
violence; an association that was repeated in the 20th century in
the anti-cannabis writings of Harry Anslinger, chief of the
United States Federal Bureau of Narcotics [6](Abel 1980). </p>

<p> In the Middle Ages cannabis was used for its psychoactive
effects as well as commercially. Its use as a mind-altering drug
was widespread in Egypt and seems to date from around the 13th
century. In medieval Europe cannabis appears to have been
employed as a folk medicine, particularly for the treatment of
toothache and rheumatism, and in childbirth. Its role in
witchcraft resulted in a Papal fiat in the 15th century which
condemned witchcraft and the use of hemp in the satanic mass
[7](Abel 1980). Its major use in Europe during the Middle Ages
and into the time of the colonial expansion of the European
powers was to produce ropes and cordage - especially for ships'
rigging and anchor ropes. In Italy, hemp was a major crop,
particularly important in establishing states such as Venice as
seafaring powers. The Venetians operated a state-run hemp factory
as a way of achieving quality assurance. </p>

<p> The historical importance of hemp is evidenced by a decree
issued by Henry VIII in 1533 that 'for every sixty acres of
arable land a farmer owned, a quarter acre was to be sown with
hemp. The penalty for not doing so was to be three shillings and
four pence' [8](Abel 1980, pp72-3). Hemp cultivation was clearly
a vital ingredient in enabling aspiring maritime powers to
exploit the riches of the New World. However, despite the threat
of penalties, the British had little success in stimulating the
production of cannabis domestically. They were more successful in
their American colonies: </p>

<p> 'During the 17th century Indian hemp was the basis of the
American Colonialists' trade and commerce, and so great was the
need to equip the British Navy that James I issued a Royal Decree
to instruct colonialists to increase their hemp production'
[9](Hindmarch 1972, p254). It appears that more widespread use of
cannabis in Europe for its psychoactive effects dates from the
period of colonial expansion. </p>

<p> Interest in cannabis and other drugs was stimulated by the
diaries and journals of travellers who described the use of
cannabis and other drugs in Africa, India and Asia Minor, and by
reports from soldiers in colonial armies who experimented with
cannabis while serving overseas. One of the first Western
publications on drugs was Garcia Da Orta's Colloquies on the
Simples and Drugs of India published in 1563, which described the
effects of bhang (a concoction containing cannabis). This
publication was followed by several other books by European
adventurers published in the latter part of the sixteenth
century. These works were not only important in spreading
knowledge of cannabis' psychoactive properties, but in
popularising misconceptions about the drug. </p>

<p> For example, a widespread belief that the effects of
consuming opium and bhang (which contained both opium and
cannabis) were identical can be dated from this period. It
appears both in the works of the Dutchman John Huyghen van
Linschoten and the Portuguese Fray Sebastien. The linkage between
cannabis and violent and dangerous behaviour also dates from
around this time - in particular, from the writings of the
Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy. Colonial expansion and colonial
wars also brought with them new understandings in Europe of the
medical uses of cannabis. [10]Abel (1980) claims that by the 17th
century 'the medicinal properties of the plant were fairly well
known to the medical profession' (p116) and by 1682, cannabis
seeds were listed in the New London Dispensatory as a remedy for
coughs and jaundice. </p>

<p> In addition to increasing interest in cannabis being shown by
scientists and doctors, hashish (and other drugs such as opium)
became known to European students, writers and artists. In
England, Egyptian hashish sweets such as Turkish Delight were
eaten by university students. In the 19th century, hashish was
used by the French Hashish Club which numbered among its members
Theophile Gautier, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and Eugene
Delacroix. While not so popular among English writers and
artists, it was used around the turn of the century by the
Decadents including WB Yeats and Ernest Dawson. For French and
English writers, hashish, like other drugs, was taken to give
them new experiences to write about, as a plot device, and it was
employed to enhance creativity. </p>

<p> Another important aspect of the colonial experience in the
spread of cannabis to Western Europe is seen in the work of W.B.
O'Shaughnessy, an Irish doctor posted to India who is credited
with introducing cannabis to Western medicine [11](Abel 1980).
While in India he experimented with cannabis in the treatment of
a wide range of diseases including rheumatism, cholera, tetanus
and epilepsy, and was enthusiastic enough about its usefulness to
commission its conversion to a form suitable for medicinal use.
This extract was widely prescribed for childbirth, migraine,
insomnia, coughs and the treatment of opium withdrawal [12](Abel
1980). </p>

<p> However, Western use of cannabis for medicinal purposes did
not extend much beyond the first few decades of the 20th century.
The medical profession turned its attention to other drugs and
other methods of administration. The science of organic chemistry
enabled drugs like morphine and cocaine to be isolated, and
chemical synthesis of drugs such as heroin to occur [13](Musto
1991). The hypodermic syringe was invented in 1845 and enabled
more efficient administration of drugs. Morphine was isolated in
1803 and unlike cannabis was water soluble and thus injectable
[14](Abel 1980). </p>

<p> Further, the growth of the pharmaceutical industry enabled
the new drugs to be mass produced, advertised and distributed
[15](Musto 1991). In addition, the strength of commercially
available cannabis varied considerably, and administration of the
same amounts of the drug appeared to elicit different responses
in different patients. There were reports of adverse effects in
patients [16](Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> In contrast, drugs like morphine and later heroin were
enthusiastically embraced by doctors because they were
fast-acting, and provided reliable and very effective pain
relief. Some use of cannabis for medical purposes did remain.
Until the late 1930s 'Parke Davis, Eli Lilly and Squibb ...
marketed preparations of cannabis extract and promoted them for
the treatment of asthma, tension and pain' [17](South Australia
1978, p98). Cannabis appeared as 'extractum cannabis' in the
United States Pharmacopoeia until 1942 (Australia 1977). In
Australia, tincture of cannabis was used until the mid-1960s
[18](Caswell 1992). </p>

<p> Medical and scientific interest in cannabis has largely been
dormant until recently. In the United States renewed attention is
being given to its possible therapeutic properties, particularly
as an anti-emetic for cancer chemotherapy patients and as an
agent for reducing intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma sufferers
([19]Trebach &amp; Zeese 1990). Some scientific debate is also
occurring in Australia [20](Caswell 1992; see also [21]Appendix
1). </p>

<p> If non-medical consumption of cannabis in the 19th and early
20th centuries was regarded as a problem at all, it was in
respect of its use by colonised peoples and minority groups.
However, in relation to colonised peoples, the attitudes of the
Western powers were far from consistent. For example, cannabis
was widely used in India and Egypt - both subject to British
rule. In Egypt, local officials and foreign rulers, including the
Turks, attempted to suppress its use in the 19th century. The
British, who received no revenues from Egyptian cannabis
production, supported these attempts. </p>

<p> The situation was more complex in India. The British
government initially appears to have had little interest in
cannabis use among Indians. British complacency was no doubt
largely due to the fact that, since 1798, the government had
licensed the manufacture and sale of hemp drugs in India and
received considerable revenues as a result. However, pressure
from local Indian administrators and later from their British
counterparts - concerned that cannabis use was contributing to
crime, illness and social unrest - finally resulted in the
establishment of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1893. The
Commission reported in 1894. Loss of revenue if cannabis were to
be banned was a factor in the Hemp Commission's conclusion that
prohibition would not be justified. Other important
considerations for the Commission were lack of evidence about the
ill effects of cannabis, the difficulties of enforcing
prohibition and the important place of the drug in the religious
and social life of the sub-continent. </p>

<p> The use of cannabis by Black Africans was largely ignored by
the colonial powers. However, South Africa had concerns about
cannabis use among Indians brought to work in the colony. In 1870
a law was passed forbidding the smoking, use or possession of
hemp by Indians. </p>

<p> In the United States, anxiety about cannabis use was
associated with its possession by poor ethnic groups. It appears
to have been used first by Mexican refugees fleeing into the
south-western states from the 1910 Revolution. The earliest US
laws proscribing the use of cannabis can be found in those
states. Cannabis use later spread to the Black population. By
1937 there were prohibitions on cannabis across the country. </p>

<h3>Development of international treaties </h3>

<p> Australian drug laws, like those of many other countries,
closely follow the development of international drug laws, so in
this section the growth of international drug treaties will be
described. These treaties are designed to control the
international traffic in certain drugs and to encourage domestic
restrictions on their supply and use. </p>

<p> The influence of the United States in the conception and
development of these instruments has been enormous. Justice
Michael Kirby has characterised the degree of international
cooperation brought about by the fear of drugs as 'exceptional'
(1992, p312). However, fear was not the only ingredient in early
crusading by the United States for international action. A
complex array of factors was at work. </p>

<p> The first international meeting on drugs was concerned with
opium and, in particular, with Britain's opium trade with China.
It was attended by 13 nations and held in Shanghai in 1909. At
the Shanghai Conference the United States argued for a total
prohibition on opium, and was opposed by the United Kingdom.
According to [22]Abel (1980) the background to the meeting was as
follows. </p>

<p> In 1882 the United States Congress passed the Chinese
Exclusion Act. In retaliation, China prohibited the importation
of American manufactured goods: Faced with the loss of the
lucrative Chinese market, and aware of China's efforts to
eradicate its own domestic opium problem, President Theodore
Roosevelt convened an international conference in 1909 in
Shanghai to help China eradicate the problem of opium addiction
among its inhabitants. By trying to impress China with its
goodwill and concern about her drug crisis, the United States
hoped to change China's attitude towards American goods'
[23](Abel, p193). </p>

<p> While economic factors were undoubtedly important in
precipitating US action, they were not the only considerations.
Fear of social unrest, racist attitudes and moral crusading all
played a part. In addition: Missionaries from the United States
in China had long been publicising the source and the pernicious
effects of opium smoking among the Chinese. Given the role of
England in that trade, the [Indian Hemp Commission] report seemed
like a whitewash for British commercial purposes and fanned
American progressive opinion even further against the European
imperialists in Asia [24](South Australia 1979, p42). </p>

<p> The 1909 conference did not produce an international treaty.
Another international drugs conference was held in 1912. At the
1912 Hague Conference some 46 nations discussed morphine,
cocaine, cannabis and heroin, as well as opium. The outcome of
the conference was the Hague Convention for the Suppression of
Opium and Other Drugs. It required the parties to 'confine to
medical and legitimate purposes the manufacture, sale and use of
opium, heroin, morphine and cocaine' [25](quoted in Manderson
1993, p63) Both the United States and Italy wanted cannabis
included in the Convention, but they were unsuccessful. </p>

<p> The 1925 Geneva Convention on Opium and Other Drugs was a
more significant document. As a result of lobbying by Egypt,
Turkey and South Africa, who were supported by the United States,
cannabis was included in the Convention. The Convention also
created an international scheme for the monitoring and control of
traffic in narcotic drugs, together with an administrative agency
- the Permanent Central Opium Board. Import and export quotas
were established, as well as statistical reporting requirements.
The Convention required the parties to 'enact effective laws to
limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the
manufacture, import, sale, distribution, export and use of
cannabis in the form used for medical purposes at the time'
[26](South Australia 1978, p34). Significantly, the word
'legitimate' which appeared in the 1912 Hague Convention was
removed from the 1925 Geneva Convention. </p>

<p> Finally, the Narcotics Limitation Convention of 1931 targeted
the manufacture of narcotics and required the parties to limit it
to scientific and medical purposes. Controls on licit manufacture
were seen as important, because apart from illicit imports from
abroad, leakage from the licit market was a source of illicit use
in Western nations. . </p>

<h3>Inquiries into drug use and trafficking </h3>

<p> The number of inquiries into drug use and trafficking have
been legion - both in Australia and overseas. Three common
features are seen in many of them. First, many question the
alleged ill effects of cannabis use. Second, some make
recommendations for law reform. Third, most inquiries have had
little impact on public policy or legislative change in relation
to cannabis use. </p>

<p> In Australia, for example, governments have generally
preferred to rely on law enforcement, treatment and education in
their quest to reduce drug use [27](Hartland et al. 1992). They
have been far less ready to embrace a philosophical shift in
policy towards minimising the harm resulting from drug use or to
tackle politically sensitive issues such as cannabis law reform.
As mentioned earlier, the first inquiry relating to cannabis
dates from 1893 when the British administration in India
established the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission. The Commission
heard nearly 1,200 submissions, both oral and written. It had a
wide mandate, including the effects of cannabis use on 'the moral
and social life of the people of India' [28](Abel 1980, p127).
While the Commission found that excessive use of cannabis could
lead to mental disorders, immorality and susceptibility to
disease, it concluded that the evidence demonstrated 'most
clearly how little injury society has hitherto sustained from
hemp drugs' [29](quoted in Abel 1980, p131). In particular, the
Commission reported that moderate use had no appreciable physical
or mental effects, did not induce immoral behaviour and had
little connection with crime. </p>

<p> Other major overseas inquiries that failed to discover any
dependence-producing properties in cannabis, harm as a
consequence of moderate use, a strong link with crime or a
progressive effect leading inexorably to use of drugs such as
heroin, cocaine or morphine were: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the Panama Canal Zone Military Investigations
        (1916-1929); </li>
    <li>the La Guardia Committee Report 1944 - United States; </li>
    <li>the Report of the Hallucinogens Sub-Committee of the
        United Kingdom Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence 1968
        (Wootton Report); </li>
    <li>the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the
        Non-Medical Use of Drugs 1972 (Le Dain Commission) -
        Canada; and </li>
    <li>the report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
        Drug Abuse 1972 (Shafer Commission) - United States. </li>
</ul>

<p> In addition, both the Le Dain and Shafer reports contained
proposals for law reform. The Shafer report recommended
decriminalisation of: </p>

<ul>
    <li>possession of marijuana for personal use in private; and </li>
    <li>casual distribution in private of small amounts of
        marijuana for no or insignificant remuneration
        ([30]United States 1972, pp152-4). </li>
    <li>It also recommended that possession in public of an ounce
        or less of marijuana should not be an offence but should
        be subject to seizure [31](United States 1972, pp152-4). </li>
    <li>The Le Dain Commission recommended that simple possession
        offences be repealed. </li>
</ul>

<p> Other overseas investigations which failed to uncover
unequivocal evidence about the harmful effects of cannabis were a
study of the United States Institute of Mental Health entitled
Ganja in Jamaica (1975), and a United States government study on
Costa Rica (1975). It should not be surmised, however, that
overseas investigations have all concluded that cannabis use
presented no risks to drug users. United Nations reports
published between 1973 and 1974 found that cannabis use was
likely to lead to dependence, and resulted in public health and
social problems. A 1974 US Senate report on Marihuana-Hashish
Epidemic and its Impact on US Security reported that cannabis use
resulted in brain damage, amotivational syndrome, and genetic and
reproductive defects. </p>

<p> In Australia, there have been a large number of Parliamentary
inquiries and Royal Commissions into drug use and drug
trafficking. In 1971 the Senate Select Committee on Drug
Trafficking and Drug Abuse (the Marriott Committee) was
established. Its brief included investigation into the incidence,
distribution and causes of drug use, and the adequacy of
legislation and educational programs. It concluded that penalties
for drug use should be commensurate with the different degrees of
harm presented by different drugs, that young, first offenders
should be treated leniently and that penalties for trafficking
should be severe. However, its recommendations were cautious:
that, pending further sociological and medical research, 'present
restrictions on the use of cannabis drugs should be retained in
Australia' (Australia 1971, p91). </p>

<p> The Marriott Committee report was followed in 1977 by one of
the most significant Australian inquiries into drugs. In that
year, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare (the Baume
Committee) produced its report Drug Problems in Australia - an
Intoxicated Society? which looked at the use of licit and illicit
drugs in Australia. Like other reports, before and since, it
recognised differing harms produced by different drugs and
concluded that drug use was more a social/medical problem than a
legal one. It also considered the social and personal harms
flowing from the illegal status of some drugs and recommended
that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>'legal controls [should] not [be] of such a nature as to
        inhibit rehabilitation of the user or to cause more
        social damage than use of the drug causes' (Australia
        1977, p164); </li>
    <li>cannabis legislation should be enacted that 'recognises
        the significant differences between opiate narcotics and
        cannabis in their health effects and in the criminal
        impact on users and the community' (Australia 1977,
        p164); </li>
    <li>possession of marijuana for personal use should no longer
        be a criminal offence and should attract only a fine; </li>
    <li>penalties for possession of hashish, hashish oil and
        purified THC should remain at their present levels
        because of the potency of these drugs. </li>
</ul>

<p> Commonwealth Government response to the Baume Committee
report was both tardy and hostile. [32]Hartland (1991) quotes
Senator Baume's view of that response: </p>

<p> The Prime Minister of the day, rather than come and say I was
a fink, did something cleverer. He appointed a learned
conservative Judge to head up a Royal Commission into Drugs with
terms of reference which virtually made it inevitable that the
learned Judge would bring out a report which said we need more
social control, heavier penalties, more enforcement authorities,
and don't change the laws (p63). </p>

<p> In 1978 the New South Wales Joint Parliamentary Committee
upon Drugs handed down its Report into Drug Abuses. Its mandate
was to examine the effects, use and supply of drugs of dependence
together with policy issues. Alcohol and tobacco were not
included in the Committee's terms of reference. The Committee
expressed concern about 'the growing social stress that must be
arising from the fact that a great many young adults, by
indulging in a drug which they see as less damaging than alcohol,
run the risk not only of involvement with the criminal law, but
also have the prospect of ruined careers' [33](New South Wales
1978, p76). The report and the Committee's earlier Memorandum to
the New South Wales Parliament recommended that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>personal use of cannabis no longer be a criminal offence;
    </li>
    <li>first offenders be given bonds and probation and on
        successful completion of these, all records be expunged;
        and </li>
    <li>penalties for trafficking in cannabis be severe. </li>
</ul>

<p> The next major inquiry was the Australian Royal Commission of
Inquiry into Drugs (Williams Royal Commission). Its multi-volume
report was released in 1979. Rather than considering the degree
of harm produced by different drugs, the Williams Royal
Commission took the view that cannabis was not a harmless drug
because it produced an intoxicating effect. It concluded that
removal of prohibitions against cannabis would depart from the
intention and spirit of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,
have a 'domino effect' in that it would stimulate calls for the
relaxation of prohibitions on other drugs, and send a signal to
the community that drug use was acceptable. </p>

<p> The Williams Royal Commission recommended that consideration
of relaxation of prohibitions on cannabis not occur for 10 years,
during which time information about the drug and its use would be
collected by National and State Drug Information Centres.
Although the Commonwealth government set up a National Drug
Information Centre, the State and Territory centres were not
established - making the review recommended by Williams
impossible. </p>

<p> Like the Baume Committee report that preceded it, the report
of the South Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical Use
of Drugs (the Sackville Royal Commission) prompted little
government response to its recommendations. In relation to
cannabis, the Commission dismissed the progression theory and
remarked that where cannabis users also consumed other illicit
drugs, this was due to the illegal status of cannabis itself. </p>

<p> The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations, including
the repeal of the offence of use or administration of drugs, and
the establishment of drug assessment and aid panels. Some of its
most radical proposals related to cannabis and cannabis resin. It
recommended that 'cultivation [of cannabis] for personal use, use
in private and small-scale gratuitous distribution in private to
adults ...[should] not be a criminal offence ... No distinction
... [should] be made between cannabis and cannabis resin, but
cannabis oil ... [should] remain subject to a policy of total
prohibition' ([34]South Australia 1979, p375). </p>

<p> The Commission found no evidence to 'support the view that
cannabis [was] associated with a tendency towards aggression and
violent crime' ([35]South Australia 1979, p51). In addition, the
Commission questioned some of the psychological and physiological
ill effects attributed to cannabis, such as amotivational
syndrome and psychosis (though it concluded that there was some
small risk of brain damage). In general, it did not dramatise the
possible adverse effects of cannabis use, recognising the
existence of equivocal research findings and insufficient data. </p>

<p> The next major Australian inquiry which touched on cannabis
was the investigation by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the
National Crime Authority which reported in 1989. Its terms of
reference included the scope and nature of the trade in illegal
drugs, the efficacy of law enforcement, and the costs and
efficacy of prohibition. It concluded that: 'If the aim of the
policy [of prohibition] was to reduce the use of prohibited
substances, or even to minimise access to them, it has clearly
failed' (Australia 1989, p92), And it concluded that 'should the
latest initiatives fail to make any significant inroads on the
market then it would be appropriate to consider some relaxation
of the present prohibitionism as an alternative policy' (p123).
Before concluding this section, a number of recent inquiries into
drugs should be mentioned. </p>

<p> In 1991 the ACT Legislative Assembly Select Committee on HIV,
Illegal Drugs and Prostitution tabled its report on Marijuana and
Other Illegal Drugs. The focus of the report was on the
'effectiveness of the current legal and social controls on drug
taking, with particular reference to marijuana' [36](Australian
Capital Territory 1991, p1). Proceeding from a belief in harm
minimisation and the view that drug use can never be completely
eliminated, the Committee recommended that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>possession of up to 25g of cannabis no longer be an
        offence; </li>
    <li>possession of more than 25g of cannabis and less than
        100g of cannabis attract a fine of $150; </li>
    <li>possession of more than 100g of cannabis should incur a
        penalty of $5,000 or two years imprisonment, or both; </li>
    <li>cultivation of five cannabis plants should no longer be
        an offence; and </li>
    <li>there should be no offence of self-administration in
        respect to cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> Another recent inquiry into illicit drugs was undertaken by
the New South Wales Legislative Council's Standing Committee on
Social Issues. However, at the date of writing, the Committee's
report had not been completed and there have been suggestions
that it will not be (Symonds 1992). In South Australia, a
Legislative Council Select Committee on the Control and Illegal
Use of Drugs of Dependence has been established. Among other
things it has been charged with reporting on the effectiveness of
current drug laws in controlling drug trafficking, the costs of
enforcing anti-trafficking laws and the social impacts of
criminal activity flowing from illicit drug use and trafficking.
In Queensland, an Advisory Committee on Illicit drugs was
established in the aftermath of the Fitzgerald Committee of
Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police
Misconduct. The Committee made cannabis the subject of its first
discussion paper for a number of reasons. Among these were the
fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug and the
illicit drug having the greatest impact on the criminal justice
system. The Committee is now seeking submissions on 'preferred
legislative, enforcement and social responses to the issues of
cannabis use and production' [37](Queensland 1993, p3). </p>

<h3>Australian laws </h3>

<p> Before embarking on a description of the development and
present content of Australian drug laws, it should be stated that
the Australian Constitution contains no general power to
legislate on crime. While many Commonwealth criminal laws have
been enacted incidental to the heads of power enumerated in the
Constitution, criminal laws have largely been the province of the
States. For this reason, the focus of this section is on State
and Territory legislation. </p>

<p> As[38] Manderson (1993) has remarked, consumption of drugs in
the 19th century was largely a matter of personal choice. Drugs -
including the opiates - were available from a wide variety of
sources including medical practitioners, pharmacists,
homoeopaths, sellers of patent medicines and grocers. Unlike the
opiates, however, cannabis was little known or used in the
Australia until the 1960s. There were some exceptions. For
example, medicinal use of cannabis occurred in the 19th century
and to a minor extent, in the 20th century. Cigares de Joy
(cannabis cigarettes) were sold over the counter in Australia
into the 20th century [39](Manderson, 1993). </p>

<p> However, according to [40]Manderson (1993) 'As late as 1938
Smith's Weekly reported &quot;the first appearance in
Australia&quot; of &quot;a Mexican drug that drives men and women
to the wildest excesses ... distorts moral values and leads to
degrading sexual extravagances&quot;' (p72). This drug was, of
course, cannabis. </p>

<p> A number of forces coalesced in the development of drug laws
in Australia. The first laws - poisons acts - specified certain
drugs required to be sold by medical practitioners or chemists
and stipulated labelling requirements [41](Carney 1981). However,
these labelling requirements did not apply to drugs sold under
medical prescription, to patent medicines or to homoeopathic
preparations [42](Manderson 1993, p9). </p>

<p> According to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (Australia
1989) these early controls were instituted in response to the use
of arsenic in suicides, poisonings and homicides. In 1862, South
Australia enacted the first Australian statute regulating the
sale and use of poisons [43](Carney 1981). In 1876 New South
Wales and Victoria followed with Sale and Use of Poisons Acts.
Most importantly, these early laws generally did not stipulate
who could use drugs or for what purposes [44](Fox &amp; Mathews
1992). </p>

<p> The first laws conceptualising drugs as a problem were
enacted in the 19th century and were the product of racism and
the temperance movement [45](Carney 1981). This phase of
legislative controls on the supply and use of prohibited drugs
has been characterised as involving 'the application of criminal
penalties to certain activities related to drugs, particularly
the supply of opium, which had not previously attracted legal
sanctions' [46](South Australia 1978, p33). Early laws singled
out opium smoking - a practice of Chinese immigrants who had come
to Australia in the mid-19th century during the Gold Rush. There
were two targets - the Chinese themselves and the Aboriginal
people believed to be financially and sexually exploited by the
Chinese who provided them with opium. </p>

<p> In 1891 Queensland passed the Sale and Use of Poisons Act
which proscribed the supply of opium to Aboriginal people, except
for medicinal purposes. Later other States enacted laws directed
at opium smoking - South Australia passed the Opium Act 1895, and
Victoria passed the Opium Smoking Prohibition Act 1905 and the
Police Offences (Amendment) Act 1908. The Commonwealth, by a 1905
Proclamation, banned the importation of opium suitable for
smoking. </p>

<p> While racism was a very significant force in the development
of early Australian drug laws, other influences were also at
work. The late 19th century witnessed a movement away from
laissez-faire attitudes towards greater interventionism and a
belief in the efficacy of law in promoting social and moral goals
[47](Manderson 1993). It witnessed a struggle for supremacy
between the medical professional, other health professionals and
the sellers of patent medicines. It also saw the growth of the
prohibitionist movement. Prohibitionist movements were not
confined to the United States nor to alcohol - patent medicines
and tobacco were also prohibitionist targets (Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> The second phase in the history of Australian drug laws
involved domestic implementation of international agreements
[48](South Australia 1978). The growth of international
conventions led an inexorable, although very gradual expansion of
Australian drug laws to cover cannabis. Australia was not alone
as a nation in feeling the pressure to conform to these
international instruments. However, it was subject to additional
pressures from the British government. The United Kingdom
represented its colonies and dominions at international meetings
and insisted that they comply with international controls.
Following the 1925 Geneva Convention, the Commonwealth was the
first government to succumb to the exhortations of the United
Kingdom. It proscribed the import of cannabis in 1926 through the
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Proclamation and at the same time
banned the export of cannabis. Efforts to bring the States into
line were less successful. Cannabis use in Australia was not a
problem and there appears to have been little domestic agitation
in support of proscription. However, while the response of the
States was slow, it was nevertheless inevitable: It was enough
that international organisations had called for controls and that
the calls had been heeded by the United Kingdom Parliament, whose
attitudes in this as in other matters were of paramount
importance to Commonwealth and State legislators (South Australia
1978, p6). </p>

<p> The first State controls on cannabis use were introduced in
Victoria in the Poisons Act 1928, which penalised the
unauthorised use of Indian hemp and resin. This was followed by
the Dangerous Drugs Act 1934 (SA), the Police Offences Amendment
(Drugs) Act 1935 (NSW), the Health Act 1937 (Qld), a 1950
Proclamation under the Police Offences (Drugs) Act 1928 (WA) and
the Dangerous Drugs Act 1959 (Tas). Australia's attitude to drugs
and drug laws became entrenched at an early stage. Manderson
(1993) has described it very clearly - lack of a domestic problem
(and this particularly applied to cannabis) meant that
legislation was accepted uncritically; no pressure groups existed
to stimulate debate or mount opposition, and the absence of a
drug problem meant that it was impossible to evaluate the costs
and benefits of the prohibitionist model - it was simply assumed
that the model worked effectively: </p>

<p> As the structure of modern drug laws ... took shape, each
brick depending on those beneath it for support and validity, few
remembered or even thought to question why they had ever been
laid. So effective had the gradual process of entrenchment been
that alternative approaches soon became unthinkable. What counted
was the preservation of the laws already in place. If they were
failing, the answer was simple - more of the same' [49](Manderson
1993, p75). </p>

<p> The impact of drug use in the 1960s has been well-documented
and was an international phenomenon. But until this time, drug
use was not viewed as a widespread social problem in Australia -
rather as contained and containable. The consumption of drugs
such as morphine, pethidine, opium and heroin by dependent users
was chiefly confined in Australia to those with a dependence that
was therapeutic in its origins or to minority groups - for
example, very old Chinese members of the community. </p>

<p> In 1960 Australia reported to the Commission on Narcotic
Drugs that some Indian hemp use was occurring in the 'theatrical
world' (quoted in Manderson 1993, p144). But during the 1960s,
the nature and extent of illicit drug use - including the use of
cannabis - changed dramatically. It became more widespread, it
became matter of choice (rather than 'necessity' through
therapeutic dependence), it was embraced by students and youth,
and it was associated with changing moral values and practices,
alienation, and challenges to societal values and the political
order. It brought increasing numbers of otherwise law-abiding
Australians into contact with the criminal law, criminal
penalties and associated stigmatisation. The use of drugs such as
cannabis and heroin came to be regarded both as a symptom of
social malaise and a cause of it. </p>

<p> The third phase in the history of Australian drug laws
commenced during the 1960s. From that time 'the States began
overhauling their drug laws and the Commonwealth became much more
actively involved in the field, both by ratifying new conventions
and by revising the provisions of the Customs Act' ([50]South
Australia 1978, pp35-6). In addition, in response to treaty
obligations, the Commonwealth introduced new federal laws on
drugs - the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 was the first of these. At
state level, control of recreational drugs was gradually removed
from poisons statutes, whose original purpose was to 'regulate
and control the supply and distribution of pharmaceuticals and
poisons on public health grounds' ([51]Kirby 1992, p315), and
placed into special legislation. Drug laws and drug policies from
this time onwards can be characterised as follows. </p>

<p> First, a law enforcement approach became firmly entrenched at
Commonwealth level with the important role played by Customs,
which had no interest in any medical or public health model of
drug use or supply. </p>

<p> Second, penalties were increased. </p>

<p> Third, there were changes to basic principles of criminal law
- such as reversal of the onus of proof - in order to make
convictions easier ([52]Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> Last, there was a shift in legislative emphasis away from
drug users to drug traffickers. Both Commonwealth and some State
laws distinguished between traffickable quantities of drugs
(including cannabis) and amounts deemed as being less than
traffickable quantities. For the most part, penalties for
cultivation, production and manufacture, possession and use of
cannabis, and possession of drug paraphernalia were substantial
during the 1960s and 1970s. For example, in South Australia the
penalty was $4,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment for knowingly
cultivating cannabis (s5(2)(b)) and $2,000 and/or two years
imprisonment for knowingly being in possession, using or
administering (s5(1)). </p>

<p> Debate about cannabis, research that showed the widespread
nature of cannabis use, alarming law enforcement statistics, the
work of the early Parliamentary and other inquiries, and
difficulties in administering some drug laws, led to the first
legislative changes in the middle to late 1970s. These
distinguished between simple possession of cannabis and other
drugs. The first jurisdiction to change law enforcement practices
and then legislation was the Australian Capital Territory. A
non-enforcement policy in relation to simple cannabis possession
offences was instituted following a number of court cases in
which the police failed to secure convictions because the Public
Health (Prohibited Drugs) Ordinance did not contain a definition
of cannabis. </p>

<p> In 1975, the Ordinance was amended to include a definition of
cannabis. At the same time the maximum penalty for possession of
less than 25g of cannabis was reduced to $100. Some reforms also
occurred in the Northern Territory. Under the Prohibited Drugs
Ordinance 1977 (NT), a first offender was liable to a fine of
$500; while second or third offences of possession were more
heavily penalised, imprisonment was not provided as a sanction.
Further legislative change occurred in the 1980s. The Drugs,
Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic) contained
slightly less severe penalties for cannabis trafficking than for
trafficking in other illicit drugs. The Drugs, Poisons and
Controlled Substances (Amendment) Act 1983 set the maximum
penalty for possession of less than 50g of cannabis at $500. In
addition, s76 of the Act empowered magistrates to award an
adjourned bond in certain circumstances in the case of an offence
of possession of up to 50g of cannabis. No conviction could be
recorded in the case of a first offender. Section 76 applies only
to cannabis, not to other drugs, and it does not apply to
trafficking offences in respect of any drug. </p>

<p> In South Australia, the Controlled Substances Act was passed
in 1984. As originally formulated, the Act distinguished between
offences involving cannabis or cannabis resin and offences
involving other illicit drugs. The Act proscribed (and still
proscribes) the possession, smoking, consumption, administration
or self-administration, manufacture, sale or supply of drugs of
dependence or prohibited drugs, and the possession of drug
paraphernalia. Under the 1984 Act, the penalty for possession,
smoking or consumption of small quantities of cannabis or
cannabis resin was a maximum of $500. For any other drug of
dependence or prohibited drug the maximum penalty was $2,000
and/or two years imprisonment. Similarly, some distinctions were
made between cannabis and other drugs in respect of trafficking
offences. More significant reforms came in 1986 with the
Controlled Substances Act Amendment Act which provided for an
expiation notice scheme. The expiation notice scheme commenced
operation on 30 April 1987. Section 45a(2) of the Act enables
expiation notices to be issued to adults in certain cases - for
example, when less than 100g of cannabis or less than 20g of
cannabis resin is involved. Notices can be issued in respect of
cultivation that is not for commercial purposes, for smoking or
consumption of cannabis or cannabis resin except in a public or
prescribed place, and for possession of equipment used for the
smoking or consumption of cannabis or the preparation of cannabis
resin. Payment of the expiation fee before the expiration of 60
days from the date of the notice means that no conviction is
recorded against the alleged offender. The fees are $50 for
possession of less than 25g of cannabis and $150 for less than
100g of cannabis. In the case of cannabis resin the expiation
fees are $50 for possession of less than 5g and $150 for amounts
ranging between 5g and less than 20g of resin. Cultivation of 10
plants or less incurs a fine of $150. It should be noted that at
the same time that the cannabis expiation notice system was
introduced, amendments to the Act also substantially increased
penalties for trafficking offences. In addition, amendments to
the Controlled Substances Act in 1990 provide severe penalties
for offences such as sale, supply and administration of
prohibited drugs and drugs of dependence, including cannabis, to
a child. </p>

<p> Although some jurisdictions reformed the law relating to
personal consumption of cannabis, heavier penalties were
introduced for trafficking offences and a scale of trafficking
offences was commonly provided - for example, traffickable,
indictable and commercial quantities. Manderson (1993) puts it
this way: </p>

<p> The emphasis on Mr Big as an evil in his own right allowed a
less severe approach to drug users by removing them from the
centrality of drug laws. The harsh penalties imposed on marijuana
smokers and other users of drugs could be softened without
undermining 'the war on drugs' (p185). </p>

<p> The focus on the Mr Bigs of the drug world has also enabled
legislatures to enact drug laws which give extensive powers of
search and seizure to the police, and which give considerable
powers in relation to the use of listening devices and telephone
taps. While some reforms were put in place in the 1970s and
1980s, the picture that emerges nationally is an uneven one. </p>

<p> The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), for example,
distinguishes only between cannabis and other drugs in the case
of commercial trafficking. In the case of cannabis the maximum
penalty that can be imposed is $500,000 or 20 years imprisonment,
or both. For commercial trafficking in any other drugs, a life
sentence can be imposed. In New South Wales, possession,
administration and self-administration of prohibited drugs,
including cannabis, are proscribed, as is the possession of
equipment for the administration of prohibited drugs. Personal
consumption offences (involving less than five plants or less
than 25g of cannabis) make an offender liable to a penalty of
$2,000 and/or two years imprisonment. Cultivation, manufacture
and production, and supply are prosecuted on indictment. The
Drugs Misuse Act 1986 (Qld) assigns dangerous drugs to Schedules
under the Act. Drugs like heroin and cocaine appear in the First
Schedule and cannabis sativa is listed in the Second Schedule.
Offences relate to trafficking (s5), supply (s6), production of
dangerous drugs (s8), possession (s9), and possession of drug
paraphernalia (s10). </p>

<p> In addition, penalties vary in the case of aggravated supply
which is defined in s6(2) of the Act as including supply to a
minor, an intellectually handicapped person, and supply in an
educational or correctional institution. While there are
differences in the statutory penalties applicable to First and
Second Schedule drugs, they are minor. </p>

<p> Under the Drugs Misuse Act Amendment Act 1990, the penalty
for unlawful trafficking in cannabis carries a penalty of 20
years imprisonment, while for First Schedule drugs the penalty is
25 years (s5). Possession of cannabis carries a penalty of 15
years imprisonment, or 20 years imprisonment if the quantity
equals or exceeds 500g or 100 plants (s9). The penalty for
possession of drug paraphernalia is imprisonment for two years.
Offenders may be fined in addition to or instead of being
imprisoned (s54) and may be prosecuted summarily for minor
offences (s13). </p>

<p> In 1989 the Australian Capital Territory remodelled its drug
control legislation, and the Drugs of Dependence Ordinance was
introduced with the idea of it being used as a model for all
other jurisdictions. The Act establishes two classes of drug: </p>

<ul>
    <li>prohibited drugs which are subject to special treatment.
        (According to the Act's Explanatory Statement, prohibited
        drugs have no medical use and are harmful for
        recreational purposes); and </li>
    <li>drugs of dependence, which are distinguished from
        prohibited drugs in the Explanatory Statement, in that
        they are said to have a medical use. </li>
</ul>

<p> The Act defines cannabis, cannabis fibre, cannabis oil,
cannabis plants and cannabis resin. Schedule 2 to the Act lists
cannabis, cannabis oil and cannabis resin as prohibited drugs and
defines commercial and traffickable quantities of the drug. In
addition, cannabis is listed in Schedule 5 as a prohibited
plant.1 </p>

<p> The Act makes clear distinctions between personal use
activities and trafficking. It reserves extremely harsh penalties
for the latter and contains deeming provisions. It also makes
distinctions in penalties between cannabis and other prohibited
drugs. Cultivation of prohibited plants, including cannabis, is
an offence (s162(2)), as is cultivation for the purposes of sale
or supply (s162(3)), sale or supply, or possession for sale or
supply (s165(1)). Possession, self-administration and
administration of cannabis are offences under s171. </p>

<p> The harshest penalties are reserved for sale or supply of
commercial quantities of cannabis - life imprisonment (s165), and
cultivation of more than 1,000 plants - life imprisonment
(s162(3)). </p>

<p> In the Northern Territory, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1990
prescribes a penalty of $2,000 or two years imprisonment for
administering cannabis. Possession of less than a traffickable
quantity 'attracts penalties ranging from a $10,000 fine to
imprisonment for 14 years; possession of a commercial quantity
attracts penalties ranging from 14 to 25 years imprisonment. The
penalties for cultivation offences also depend on the quantity
cultivated; commercial quantities carry a 25-year prison term;
traffickable quantities carry a seven-year prison term; and other
cases attract a penalty of a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for
two years' (Australian Capital Territory 1991, p35). </p>

<p> Like Queensland, Northern Territory legislation creates
separate offences and penalties in respect of supplying illicit
drugs to children. In the Northern Territory, the penalty is 25
years or imprisonment for life (s5). Offences and penalties
relating to illicit drugs are covered by the Poisons Act 1971 and
the Criminal Code in Tasmania, and in Western Australia by the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1981. </p>

<p> In the Australian Capital Territory, changes to the law on
cannabis were introduced by the Drugs of Dependence (Amendment)
Act 1992. These amendments were by no means as far-reaching as
those envisaged by the Legislative Assembly's Select Committee on
HIV, Illegal Drugs and Prostitution (outlined earlier) which
recommended the removal of personal possession offences involving
small amounts of cannabis. However, the amendments do introduce
an expiation notice scheme that applies to both adults and
juveniles (s171A). Under the amendments, a simple cannabis
offence is defined as: * an offence under s162(2) of cultivating
or participating in the cultivation of not more than five
cannabis plants; * an offence under s171(1) of possessing not
more than 25g of cannabis. A police officer is empowered to serve
an offence notice on a person believed to have committed a simple
cannabis offence. If the prescribed penalty of $100 is paid
within 60 days, then the offence is discharged and no conviction
is recorded. The prescribed penalty of $100 is the same as that
previously applying under the Act for possession of small amounts
of cannabis. </p>

<p> Drug law reform is still an active issue for some
Australians. In 1993, interest in drug laws and social policy
resulted in the establishment of an Australian Parliamentary
Group on Drug Law Reform - a group whose membership includes
current and former politicians from different political parties
and a range of jurisdictions, medical practitioners, researchers
and members of the legal profession. Among the short-term goals
being considered by the Committee are the rejection of criminal
sanctions for personal use of drugs and the nationwide adoption
of an expiation scheme model for personal use of cannabis
([53]Van Raay 1993). </p>

<h3>Overseas legislation </h3>

<p> In many European countries, no distinction exists in law
between the so-called 'hard' and 'soft' drugs. In a recent study
of 12 EC nations, only the following nations distinguished
cannabis from other drugs: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Spain distinguishes between 'substances which can cause
        serious damage to health and cannabis and its
        derivatives' ([54]Leroy 1991, p58); </li>
    <li>Ireland distinguishes between 'cannabis and other
        narcotic products' ([55]Leroy 1991, p58); </li>
    <li>The Netherlands distinguishes between 'substances
        presenting an unacceptable risk' ([56]Leroy 1991, p58)
        and cannabis; </li>
    <li>Italian law distinguishes between 'highly addictive drugs
        (Schedules I and III) and drugs with lesser addictive
        properties AND cannabis (Schedules II and IV)' ([57]Leroy
        1991, p58); and </li>
    <li>the United Kingdom Misuse of Drugs Act contains three
        Schedules in which drugs are placed according to their
        level of risk. Cannabis, some opiates, barbiturates and
        some amphetamines are classified as Schedule B drugs. </li>
</ul>

<p> Drug use (involving both 'hard' and 'soft' drugs) is not
proscribed in Spain, Ireland, Italy or The Netherlands.
Possession for personal use is prohibited in Spain, Ireland,
Italy and The Netherlands, but lesser penalties are provided when
possession involves cannabis. In the case of trafficking
offences, laws in Spain, Ireland, Italy and The Netherlands
impose less severe penalties when trafficking involves cannabis. </p>

<p> In the United States, the federal Controlled Substances Act
lists cannabis in Schedule 1 - where drugs with a high dependency
potential and no accepted medical use are located. Possession of
a controlled drug attracts a lighter penalty than does
trafficking. Even so, penalties for possession are substantial -
a first offender being liable to up to one year's imprisonment
and a fine of between $1,000 and $5,000. </p>

<p> During the 1970s, at State level, 11 States adopted a civil
penalty model for possession of small amounts of cannabis for
personal use. Oregon was the first State to introduce civil
penalty laws in 1973. In general, the maximum penalty for
possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use in
the 'decriminalised' states is $100. Exceptions are Mississippi
($250) and Nebraska ($200). </p>

<p> Efforts to recriminalise these activities have been described
as 'concerted' ([58]Reuter 1992), with William Bennett, the
National Drug Control Director, personally appearing before a
number of state legislatures to argue for recriminalisation. In
1990, Alaska reintroduced criminal penalties for possession of
small amounts of cannabis. </p>

<p> In Canada, the federal Narcotic Control Act 1961 has remained
largely unaltered to this day. There are six basic offences under
the Act. These are: simple possession, trafficking, possession
for trafficking, cultivation of opium or cannabis, import or
export of scheduled drugs, and prescription shopping ([59]Solomon
1988). According to Solomon, apart from the offence of
cultivation, the Act does not differentiate between scheduled
drugs. Cannabis possession can be tried summarily or on
indictment. In the case of simple possession offences, summary
conviction of a first offence renders the offender liable to a
fine of $1,000 and six months imprisonment. In the case of a
subsequent offence, summarily prosecuted, the penalty is $2,000
and one year's jail. On indictment, an offender is liable to
seven year's imprisonment. </p>

<p> The Canadian Government did not respond positively to the Le
Dain Commission recommendation that possession of cannabis no
longer be a criminal offence. However, in 1972 the Criminal Law
Amendment Act gave judges a discretion to direct that an offender
be discharged absolutely or on probation. It appears that law
enforcement officers rarely proceed on indictment in the case of
possession offences, and that 'judges rarely impose the maximum
sentence or anything close to it in cannabis cases' ([60]Solomon
1988, p126). </p>

<p> In this section, particular attention is devoted to the laws
and enforcement practices of The Netherlands and the United
Kingdom. Illicit drug laws in both countries have been influenced
by existence of international conventions. Initially both
countries enacted drug laws in the absence of a domestic drug
problem. </p>

<p> In The Netherlands illicit drug laws were first introduced in
the Opium Act 1919. Apart from amending legislation in 1928, drug
laws remained unchanged until the present Opium Act was passed in
1976. Current Dutch attitudes towards illicit drug use -
manifested in the Prosecution Guidelines that govern the
enforcement of the Act - are said to arise from a number of
factors peculiar to Dutch society and history. First, realism and
pragmatism. Second, a belief in social pluralism. Third, an
ideology of normalisation in which 'illicit drugs are seen as a
limited and manageable social problem rather than an alien threat
forced on an otherwise innocent society' ([61]Leuw 1991, p2).
Fourth, is the context of the criminal law itself. Dutch writers
stress that the criminal law is not perceived as enforcing social
morality but rather as 'an instrument of social control, whose
results must be assessed from case to case' ([62]Ruter 1988, p6).
</p>

<p> They further report that the criminal law has a minor role in
The Netherlands. Until the introduction of the Opium Act 1976,
drug offences in The Netherlands appear to have been actively
prosecuted and severely sanctioned. According to [63]van de
Wijngaart (1991), cannabis appeared in The Netherlands in the
1950s; harsh sentences were handed down, for example - 12 months
imprisonment for minor cannabis offences; and media coverage was
sensationalist. </p>

<p> However, despite sentencing practices, an increase in
cannabis use was reported, especially among Dutch youth. During
the 1960s pressure for law reform increased and culminated in
1976 with new opium legislation. The present Opium Act
distinguishes between drugs posing unacceptable risks such as
heroin, cocaine, LSD and cannabis oil, and hemp products -
marijuana and cannabis resin.2 It also decreased penalties for
possession of drugs for personal use, but increased penalties for
trafficking in hard drugs. Overlying the offences and penalties
in the Opium Act are police and prosecution guidelines which have
produced a situation that some commentators have described as de
facto decriminalisation. These guidelines relate to the
'intensity of police custody and preventive detention,
prosecutorial alternatives (dismissal, fine, or prosecution) and
penalties involving violations of the Opium Act, and were
established by the Procurators-General in 1976' (Marshall et al.
1990, p395). The guidelines are made possible by the Expediency
Principle set out in Articles 167 and 242 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. This principle operates where the public good is
served by refraining from prosecution. It can operate for both
individual offenders and categories of offence. In the case of
the Opium Act, a number of activities are designated as 'not for
prosecution, detection or arrest'. These include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the sale of less than 30g of hemp products; and </li>
    <li>dealing in, possessing or cultivating up to 30g of
        cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> High priority is given under the guidelines to the detection
and prosecution of traffickers. In Britain, like Australia and
The Netherlands, drug laws were in existence long before the
existence of a widespread domestic drug problem. During World War
I concerns about drug taking by soldiers led to the issuing of
Army Council orders forbidding the supply of cocaine, heroin,
Indian hemp, morphine, and other substances to soldiers except by
medical practitioners. </p>

<p> The existence of international conventions resulted in the
enactment of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920 - as a signatory of the
Treaty of Versailles, Britain undertook to incorporate the 1912
Hague Convention into domestic law. Even at this early stage
penalties were severe. Illegal possession of listed drugs could
result in a 200 fine or six months imprisonment, or both.
Penalties were higher for repeat offenders. The Dangerous Drugs
Amendment Act 1923 raised these penalties. However, '... at most
the total annual convictions and known addicts numbered only a
few hundred until the second half of the twentieth century'
([64]Howitt 1990-91, p357). </p>

<p> The present Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 creates different
classes of drugs according to their potential for harm and
penalises activities such as possession and cultivation. Cannabis
and cannabis resin are Class B drugs and, while subject to lesser
penalties than Class A drugs, still carry substantial penalties.
For example, summary prosecution for an offence of possession of
a Class B drug can result in three months imprisonment and/or a
500 fine. If the offender is convicted on indictment the
maximum penalty is five years jail or a fine, or both.
Cultivation of a Class A, B or C drug exposes the offender to a
penalty of six months incarceration and/or a 2000 fine on
summary conviction, and up to 14 years imprisonment or a fine, or
both, if convicted on indictment ([65]Fortson 1992). Like The
Netherlands and Australia, the most substantial penalties are
available for drug trafficking. While imprisonment is available
as a sanction for cannabis possession in Great Britain, it
appears that custodial sentences are not imposed for possession
of cannabis for personal use. In addition, enforcement of the
Misuse of Drugs Act may vary considerably throughout the nation,
especially where cannabis is involved: In an urban area if a
policeman finds a young person in possession of a few grammes of
cannabis he may deal with the matter informally or offer a
caution, and no official record will be made. In a country town
possession of exactly the same quantity of the drug might lead to
prosecution, a fine, and headlines in the local newspaper'
([66]Royal College of Psychiatrists 1987, p125). </p>

<p> As in Australia, drug law reform continues to be an issue in
Europe. Some reforms to European drug laws have been
foreshadowed. [67]Wodak (1993) reports that: the lead has come
from municipal authorities. Thirteen cities in Europe have signed
a document known as the Frankfort [sic] Declaration which commits
these municipal authorities to a programme of drug policy reform.
Thirty-three other cities have signed an expression of interest
and are considering their position. In November, this Declaration
will be signed by the Mayor of Baltimore in the United States
(p7). </p>

<p> In Italy, voters were asked in a referendum held on 18 April
1993 whether drug users should be imprisoned. The referendum was
the result of changes to drug laws in 1990 which enabled courts
to imprison drug users found guilty of possession of more than
the 'average daily dose' of a drug (dose media giornaliera)
(UNICRI, pers comm). As a consequence of the referendum, such
drug users are now liable only to administrative sanctions such
as a fine or the confiscation of their driver's licence. Drug
traffickers are still liable to imprisonment. </p>

<h3>Current international treaties </h3>

<p> The international treaties relating to cannabis are the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 as amended by the 1972
Protocol, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971 and the
1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances (Vienna Convention). The Convention on
Psychotropic Substances includes THC, the psychoactive
constituent of cannabis. As THC is rarely extracted for illicit
drug use ([68]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992), no further attention will
be devoted to it. </p>

<p> The Single Convention consolidated a number of previous
Conventions on narcotic drugs and amalgamated a number of
monitoring organisations to create the International Narcotics
Control Board. Australia ratified the Single Convention on 1
December 1967. Cannabis is not a narcotic drug, but is classified
as such for the purposes of the Single Convention. </p>

<p> This classification has been important in shaping public and
political perceptions - that cannabis is dangerous to personal
health and community safety. Narcotic drugs are listed in
Schedules to the Convention. Schedule I contains the major
opioids, as well as cocaine and cannabis. Schedules II and III
contain less powerful drugs such as codeine. Schedule IV contains
drugs regarded as having particularly dangerous properties.
Cannabis, as well as drugs like heroin, is part of Schedule IV.
Articles 36, 4 and 2(5) of the Single Convention are of
particular importance for the purposes of this report. Article
36(1) of the Convention provides that, 'subject to its
constitutional limitations', each Party shall adopt measures to
ensure that activities such as manufacture, possession,
distribution, sale, transport, importation and exportation of
drugs 'contrary to the provisions of this Convention ... shall be
punishable offences when committed intentionally ....'. </p>

<p> In addition, Article 4 provides that: (c) Subject to the
provisions of this Convention, [Parties are] to limit exclusively
to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture,
export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of
drugs. Cannabis is also located in Schedule IV of the Convention.
Article 2(5) requires that: (a) A Party shall adopt any special
measures of control which in its opinion are necessary having
regard to the particularly dangerous properties of a drug so
included; and (b) A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing
conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of
protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the
production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in,
possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may
be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including
clinical trials herewith to be conducted under or subject to the
direct supervision of the Party. </p>

<p> It must be emphasised, however, that Article 2(5) is not
mandatory. Rather, special measures of control can be imposed if,
in the opinion of the Party, they are 'necessary' or
'appropriate'. Under the Single Convention Parties are required
to criminalise activities relating to trafficking, subject to
their constitutional limitations. In the past, however, questions
have also arisen about the need for Parties to criminalise
activities associated with personal use and possession. The
Williams Royal Commission concluded that to remove prohibitions
against cannabis would depart from the spirit and intention of
the Convention. In Canada, the Le Dain Commission regarded
possession for personal use as falling within the ambit of the
Convention. Woltring (1990) also takes this view on the grounds
that 'possession could relate to both possession for trafficking
or possession for personal consumption' (p20). </p>

<p> However, there is authority (e.g. [69]United States 1972,
[70]Noll 1977, [71]South Australia 1978) that 'the Convention
does not require signatories to make either use or possession for
personal use punishable offences, although the creation or
retention of such offences would be consistent with the treaty.
This is because &quot;use&quot; is not specifically covered by
Article 26 and the term &quot;possession&quot; in that Article
and elsewhere can be read as confined to possession for the
purpose of dealing' ([72]South Australia 1978, p46). </p>

<p> Further, the requirement that Parties limit the use of drugs
to medical and scientific purposes does not require them to
'attain that goal by providing penal sanctions for unauthorized
&quot;use&quot; or &quot;personal consumption&quot; of drugs'
([73]Noll 1977, p44). In the view of the Shafer Commission,
measures such as 'an educational program and similar approaches
designed to discourage use' could be employed (1972, p167). While
the International Narcotics Control Board appears to be equivocal
about this interpretation of the Convention in respect of
personal possession, it does not appear to condemn it, merely
remarking in relation to the Single Convention, that Parties: may
take the view that they are not required to establish such
activities as criminal offences under law. The basis for this
view appears to be that, since obligations relating to penal
provisions appear among articles relating to illicit traffic, the
obligations only apply to cultivation, purchase or possession for
the purpose of illicit trafficking (1992, p6). The 1972 Protocol
provides for measures to treat and rehabilitate drug users in
addition, or as an alternative to, punishment. </p>

<p> It also contains provisions relating to the International
Narcotics Control Board, and international narcotics trafficking.
Australia ratified the Protocol on 22 November 1972. Australia's
international treaty obligations must now be read taking the 1988
Vienna Convention into account. Australia ratified the Convention
without reservations on 16 November 1992. While the Single
Convention attempts to contain the supply of illicit drugs by
limiting the use of scheduled drugs to medical and scientific
purposes, the Vienna Convention is directed particularly at drug
trafficking and is designed to provide a system of international
cooperation to counter trafficking activities. It must be read
subject to the Single Convention. The Vienna Convention was made
against a background of international horse-trading, and was
ratified domestically in the face of a measure of opposition. </p>

<p> An International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Traffic
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was convened in
1987. At the Conference there was debate between the consumer,
producer and transit states about the content of the treaty.
Consumer nations felt that the Convention should target the
movement of illicit drugs between states, while producer
countries argued that the Convention needed to address drug
consumption - in other words, create obligations for drug-using
nations. As a result, provisions relating to domestic drug
consumption are included in the Convention. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the major thrust of the Convention is towards
trafficking and international cooperation in matters such as
extradition, mutual legal assistance, and transfer of
proceedings. Paragraph 1 of Article 3 relating to trafficking
offences states that 'Each Party shall adopt such measures as may
be necessary to establish [them] as criminal offences under its
domestic law, when committed intentionally'. Paragraph 2 of
Article 3 deals with cultivation, possession or purchase for
personal use. </p>

<p> In relation to the establishment of criminal offences its
wording is different to and more qualified than that in paragraph
1. It states: </p>

<p> Subject to its constitutional principles and the basic
concepts of its legal system, each Party shall adopt such
measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence
under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the
possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic drugs or
psychotropic substances for personal consumption contrary to the
provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended
or the 1971 Convention. </p>

<p> In addition, paragraph 4(d) of Article 3 provides that: The
Parties may provide, either as an alternative to conviction or
punishment, or in addition to conviction or punishment of an
offence established in accordance with paragraph 2 of this
article, measures for the treatment, education, aftercare,
rehabilitation or social reintegration of the offender. Not
surprisingly, there are a number of different interpretations
that can be placed on the provisions of the Vienna Convention as
they relate to personal consumption activities. </p>

<p> The International Narcotics Control Board states that the
1988 Vienna Convention requires criminal offences to be
established in relation to possession, purchase or cultivation
for personal use. However, it adds: None of the conventions
requires a party to convict or punish drug abusers who commit
such offences even when they have been established as punishable
offences. The party may choose to deal with drug abusers through
alternative non-penal measures involving treatment, education,
after-care, rehabilitation or social reintegration
([74]International Narcotics Control Board 1992, p4). </p>

<p> Other commentators take the view that the Vienna Convention
is a trafficking convention and that, with respect to personal
use activities, a Party may choose not to retain or introduce
criminal offences for those activities if such an approach does
not accord with matters such as 'the basic concepts of its legal
system'. What then are the implications of the Single Convention,
the 1972 Protocol and the 1988 Vienna Convention for public
policy options relating to cannabis? </p>

<h3>Total Prohibition </h3>

<p> Total prohibition is the policy pursued by many of the
Parties to the Conventions - including the Australian
jurisdictions of Queensland, Northern Territory, Victoria,
Western Australia and Tasmania. </p>

<p> Some writers describe the Single Convention as prohibitionist
in nature ([75]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992); others as 'regulatory as
opposed to merely prohibitionist' ([76]Woltring 1990, p19).
Whatever the case, extremely stringent measures can be employed
by the Parties. In both the Single Convention and the Vienna
Convention provisions exist that enable the Parties to 'adopt
more strict or severe measures than those provided for by the
convention if, in [their] opinion, such measures are desirable or
necessary to prevent or suppress illicit trafficking'
([77]International Narcotics Control Board 1992, p4). Civil
penalty option. As described earlier, this policy option removes
criminal penalties for personal use activities such as possession
and instead imposes civil penalties - most commonly fines.
Australia ratified the Vienna Convention after consultations with
the States to ensure that legislation in all jurisdictions
conformed with treaty obligations. </p>

<p> While some commentators ([78]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992) argue
that civil penalties such as those provided in the South
Australian legislation represent a minor breach of international
treaty obligations, this does not appear to be the view of the
Commonwealth or of other commentators. There appear to be no
international law impediments to the civil penalty approach. </p>

<h3>Partial prohibition. </h3>

<p> As described by the [79]Sackville Royal Commission (South
Australia 1978), partial prohibition distinguishes between
trafficking in cannabis and activities associated with personal
use such as possession. Partial prohibition would remove all
penalties, both civil and criminal, in respect of personal use
and possession activities. These activities would no longer be
criminal offences. The removal of offences and penalties for
personal use and possession activities can be seen as
inconsistent with the conventions. Such a conclusion might be
reached on an interpretation of the Single Convention along the
lines suggested by [80]Woltring (1990), and of the Vienna
Convention. </p>

<p> It can also be argued that partial prohibition can be
accommodated under the Conventions. The Sackville Royal
Commission (1979, p311) took this view in regard to the Single
Convention - on the basis that the Convention did not encompass
personal use and possession activities. Partial prohibition could
be reconciled with the Vienna Convention on the basis of two
interpretations. For those who take the view that the Vienna
Convention is a trafficking convention and that there is no
requirement that personal use and possession activities be
criminalised, there is no obstacle to partial prohibition. It
could also be argued that partial prohibition could encompass an
option where a criminal offence existed for personal use and
possession activities, but no criminal or civil penalties were
provided. The existence of a criminal offence would be a signal
of society's disapproval of cannabis use. Treatment, education,
rehabilitation or social reintegration could be provided instead
of criminal or civil penalties, it being up to State Parties to
determine whether these measures are provided administratively or
by statute. </p>

<h3>Regulatory option </h3>

<p> Regulatory options might include regulated commercial sale or
a government monopoly. In 1979 the Sackville Royal Commission
took the view that regulation could not be accommodated under the
Single Convention (p311). The advent of the AIDS epidemic and
concern about injecting drug use and disease transmission may
have contributed to recent interpretations of treaty obligations
that differ from this view. [81]Woltring (1990) states that it is
open to Parties, within the context of 'medical or scientific
purpose', to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>provide for the cultivation of cannabis by a government
        agency; </li>
    <li>provide for the manufacture of cannabis by a government
        agency or private concern under government licence; </li>
    <li>trade in and distribute cannabis through a government
        agency or private enterprise under government licence; </li>
    <li>'supply or dispense drugs to drug abusers or
        AIDS/Hepatitis B risk users under appropriate programs'
        (p20). </li>
</ul>

<p> He goes on to remark that 'While any Party could adopt such
options on the basis that they serve the medical or therapeutic
objective of treating drug addiction or abuse, the options could
not be adopted if their ultimate purpose was to enable
recreational use as distinct from medical or therapeutic use'
(p20). </p>

<p> Under [82]Woltring's model, regulation could co-exist with
treaty obligations, but only to a limited extent - within a
medical model. Supply or dispensation of drugs to drug users for
medical purposes is considerably easier to reconcile with treaty
obligations in the context of injecting drug use than in relation
to cannabis. It might be argued that high THC content of illicit
cannabis represented a health risk to users 3, that could be
overcome through regulated supply, or that separation of drug
markets would make it less likely that cannabis users would be
exposed to and thus move on to more dangerous drug use involving
injecting drugs. However, these propositions would be unlikely to
convince most governments or commentators. </p>

<h3>Free availability. </h3>

<p> This policy option could not be accommodated under the
Conventions and would place Australia in breach of its treaty
obligations. This discussion of international instruments
suggests that Australia has some flexibility in considering and
implementing policy options in the context of treaty obligations.
However, for some options it might be thought necessary to seek
amendments to the Conventions or, indeed, denounce them.4 </p>

<p> An important question to be answered is whether Australian
drug laws, so long dominated and directed by influences beyond
our shores, and so little attuned to Australia's own
circumstances, should continue to be determined externally. As
cautious an inquiry as the Williams Royal Commission commented,
in relation to the Single Convention, that the spirit and
intention of the treaty was 'a secondary matter in the sense that
Australia must first decide what is the correct domestic policy
and then shape its international course accordingly' (1980,
pC263). </p>

<h1><a name="OLE_LINK1">FIVE LEGISLATIVE OPTIONS </a></h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> Many legislative options are available for cannabis and, as
indicated in [1]Chapter 2, much confusion exists in the
terminology used to describe them. In this chapter, we outline
the five broad options available to Australian decision-makers,
namely: </p>

<ul>
    <li>total prohibition; </li>
    <li>prohibition with civil penalties for minor offences; </li>
    <li>partial prohibition; </li>
    <li>regulation; and </li>
    <li>free availability. </li>
</ul>

<p> Some readers will be aware that this is the classification
used by the South Australian Royal Commission into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs (the Sackville Commission) which
reported in 1978. We have adopted their approach as it is, in our
view, both precise and comprehensive. It avoids the semantic
problems that often cause much confusion in debates about drug
policies. In particular, it avoids the terms 'decriminalisation'
and 'legalisation', terms which have different meanings for
different authorities. </p>

<p> The five options listed capture all the approaches which
people have in mind when they refer to 'decriminalisation' and
'legalisation', as well as other options which these two words
may or may not encompass. The five legislative options are
discussed in turn. We follow a consistent format to facilitate
comparisons between them. First we describe the option; an
example of it in operation follows (or, if there is no such
example, we describe what it would look like if the option were
implemented); we then outline the rationales which are given or
are imputable (both philosophical and pragmatic rationales are
covered); discuss the outcomes and impacts (observed or likely)
flowing from its implementation; and in conclusion we evaluate
the appropriateness of the option. </p>

<h2>Option 1: Total prohibition </h2>

<p> Under the system of total prohibition the use, possession,
cultivation, importation, sale and distribution of any amount of
cannabis are treated as criminal offences. People importing or
dealing in cannabis may be liable to severe sanctions, and those
using or found in possession of the drug are subject to arrest
and prosecution. If convicted, they acquire a criminal record and
may be subject to a variety of sanctions including imprisonment. </p>

<p> 'Total prohibition' can take a number of forms. For example,
although both The Netherlands and the United States have
legislation that can be described as total prohibition, the
differences in the strategies used to enforce, or not enforce,
the legislation mean that the drug policies in these two nations
are dramatically different. This section will outline the
background and rationale of American and Dutch drug policies, and
will evaluate them in light of the goals outlined in [2]Chapter
2. </p>

<h3>PART A: THE UNITED STATES: </h3>

<h4>Total legislative and administrative prohibition: Drug law
and policy in the United States </h4>

<p> This examination of drug policy will focus on the US Federal
Government's strategy of total prohibition.5 </p>

<p> The Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) groups drugs into
five categories. These categories are said to be based on the
drugs' perceived potential for abuse, accepted medical use and
propensity to create physiological and psychological dependency,
for users (Inciardi 1990). The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
is responsible for classifying drugs and for periodically
updating classifications. Cannabis is listed in Schedule 1 of the
classification scheme. Schedule 1 drugs are seen to have a high
potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the
United States and no acceptable safe level of use under medical
supervision. </p>

<p> Violations of the CSA are separated into two offence
categories: first, the possession of controlled substances; and,
secondly, the manufacture, delivery or sale of controlled
substances. All first possession offences carry a penalty of up
to one year's incarceration and a fine of $1,000 to $5,000.
Second offences are punishable by more severe sanctions. The
basic penalty for the manufacture, delivery or sale of less than
50kg of marijuana, 100 or more marijuana plants, less than 10kg
of cannabis resin (hashish) or less than one kilogram of cannabis
oil is punishment by up to five years incarceration and/or a
$250,000 fine. Second or subsequent offences are punishable by up
to 10 years incarceration and/or a $500,000 fine. The penalty for
the manufacture, sale or delivery of between 50kg and 100kg of
marijuana is a sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment and/or a
fine of up to $1 million. Second or subsequent violations of
manufacture/delivery/sale provisions are punishable by up to 30
years imprisonment and/or up to $2 million in fines for
individuals and $30 million for others. </p>

<p> The CSA also provides for other sanctions against people who
profit from drug dealing. An offender can be required to forfeit
to the state all controlled substances, raw materials or
equipment used to manufacture, import or export controlled
substances, all conveyances used to transport controlled
substances, all money and property gained through contravening
the CSA, and all property used to facilitate violations of the
CSA. The proceeds of forfeiture are used to fund drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p> Drug policy in the US has, in part, been conceptualised in
the economic terms of supply and demand. Primarily the focus has
been on reducing the supply of illegal drugs, including cannabis,
through such measures as destroying crops at the source or
interdicting supplies as they enter the US. Cannabis crops, for
example, may be spotted from the air by helicopter, sprayed with
herbicide or eradicated by ground teams. Destroying cannabis
crops in other countries, particularly South American, and
encouraging other governments to participate in law enforcement
efforts, have formed an important part of the American drug
strategy of reducing the supply of drugs. </p>

<p> Central to the US Government's policy on reducing demand is
the idea of creating a climate of intolerance towards all drug
use through concepts such as 'user accountability' and 'zero
tolerance'. 'User accountability' is the idea that individual
users should be made to recognise that their drug use, no matter
how minor it may appear to be, is part of a drug problem that
eventually results in the death of some users ([3]Wardlaw 1992).
The notion of 'zero tolerance' holds that no drug offence should
be allowed any degree of tolerance and makes little distinction
in terms of culpability between the different scales of drug
offences ([4]US Bureau of Justice Statistics 1992). </p>

<h3>Rationales </h3>

<h4>Pragmatic rationales </h4>

<p> The eradication of all illicit drug use is the central aim of
US drug policy and it is thought that prohibition is the most
effective means of reaching this goal. Cannabis use is seen as a
part of a larger drug problem. Prohibition is thought to decrease
cannabis usage in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
    <li>prohibition discourages people from experimenting with
        drugs and </li>
    <li>deters people convicted of drug offences from
        re-offending; and </li>
    <li>prohibition causes the price of illicit drugs to
        increase, making them more difficult to obtain. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Philosophical rationales </h4>

<p> Drug policy in the US is based on a deeply held belief that
all illicit drug use is extremely harmful, both in terms of the
dangers that it poses to users and in terms of the dangers that
it poses to the social fabric of American society. There is very
little distinction made between cannabis and other drugs. In
1971, President Richard Nixon declared that drug abuse was
'public enemy number one' ([5]Wijingaart 1991, p95) and, more
recently, one commentator has claimed that: Drug use in America
today is a major threat to our health, productivity, and quality
of life (Du Pont 1984: xvi, [6]cited in Wijingaart 1991, p101). </p>

<p> Section 801 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act states
that: The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and
possession and improper use of controlled substances have a
substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general
welfare of the American people. </p>

<p> In the US, official analysis of the social problems
associated with drug use has been narrow, and American policy
makers have tended to see drugs themselves as the central source
of all the ills associated with drug use in that country.
Analyses of the social context of drug taking or of the
relationship between drug taking and poverty have apparently had
little impact on the development of drug policy. </p>

<p> Central to the official American idea of 'harm' caused by
drugs is that all drugs are 'addictive', and that any
experimentation with drugs will inevitably result in dependency.
Associated with the fear of dependence is the fear, in many cases
unrealistic, of the effect that drug use has on individuals.
Although not accepting this characterisation, James Inciardi has
described the stereotype of the American drug user in the
following terms: 'Dope fiends', as they were called, were
sex-crazed maniacs, degenerate criminals, and members of the
'living dead'. 'Narcotics', including marijuana and cocaine ...
destroyed morality, addicts were sexually violent and criminally
aggressive, they were weak and ineffective members of society;
addiction was contagious since users had a mania for perpetuating
the social anathema of drug taking; and finally, once addicted,
the user entered into a lifetime of slavery to drugs ([7]Inciardi
1986, p100). </p>

<p> It has been claimed that those debating drugs policy in the
US have blurred the distinction between the effects of drug use
and the effects of the prohibition of drug use ([8]Wardlaw 1992).
Drug use is therefore thought to be inextricably linked to
violent crime, users are conceptualised as criminals, and policy
towards any level of drug use is punitive and coercive. This
philosophy of drug use is evident in the rhetorical language of
US policy makers who talk about 'zero tolerance' and who have
called their drug strategy a 'war on drugs'. </p>

<h4>Outcomes </h4>

<p> Although the price of cannabis has increased with the
policies of prohibition, the increase has not had the intended
effect of significantly reducing cannabis consumption. Despite
half a century of total prohibition, cannabis is still the most
widely used of illicit drugs in the US. Household surveys of drug
use conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse have found
that almost 68 million people in the US reported that they had
used cannabis, including 9.7 million who reported that they had
used it in the past month. In other words, some 33 per cent of
the household population aged 12 years or older reported they had
used marijuana in their lifetimes and 5 per cent reported having
used the drug in the past month. (NIDA, National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse: Population estimates 1991; cited in [9]US Bureau
of Justice Statistics 1992, p26). </p>

<p> It could be concluded that the prohibition of cannabis has
not been successful in eradicating or even significantly
decreasing cannabis use in the United States. On the other hand,
it could be argued that the policy has prevented an even higher
level of use occurring. From 1981 to 1987, 5.3 million kilograms
of marijuana were seized, however Customs, Coast Guard and the
DEA believe that they seized only 10 per cent of the marijuana
entering the country ([10]Inciardi &amp; McBride 1990, p284).
Despite the fluctuations in price that law enforcement efforts
may cause to cannabis markets from time to time, demand for
cannabis has, it is claimed, remained relatively unchanged.
Nadelmann has argued that 'the greatest beneficiaries of the drug
laws are organised and unorganised drug traffickers. The
criminalisation of the drug market effectively imposes a 'value
added tax' ([11]Nadelmann 1991). </p>

<p> The law enforcement program associated with prohibition has
also been costly, both in financial and social terms. In 1986 the
Federal expenditure on cannabis enforcement was estimated to be
around $800 million, and it is thought to have significantly
increased since then (Kleiman 1986). This figure does not include
state and local expenditures on law enforcement and criminal
justice. Every year there are 350,000 arrests for cannabis
possession alone, making this the third most common cause of
arrest in the US ([12]Kleiman 1992, pp267-8). </p>

<p> The social costs of the law enforcement program are also
high. [13]Kleiman (1992) claims that the majority of people who
are arrested for buying and using cannabis rarely do anything
else that might bring them to the attention of the criminal
justice system and that, for many users, being subject to arrest
and criminal justice processing is the most substantial risk of
using cannabis. The consequence of this is that large numbers of
people acquire criminal records and are stigmatised for what many
would see as relatively minor offences. </p>

<p> Kleiman also argues that the prohibition of cannabis
undermines the symbolic value of the criminal law. Since arrest
is the most immediate and frequent part of the punishment process
for all crimes, it is important that arrest should retain its
social meaning both as involving some substantial risk of further
punishment (to maintain its deterrent value) and as resulting
from the doing of some substantial harm (to maintain its moral
force). The fact that simple possession of marijuana is the third
most common cause of arrest puts strain on both of these symbolic
links. This contribution to the devaluation of arrest as a
sanction ought to be counted as a sizeable cost of current
marijuana laws ([14]Kleiman 1992, p268). </p>

<p> It has also been claimed by some opponents of the 'war on
drugs' that one by product of prohibition is the abuse of civil
liberties (e.g. [15]Boaz 1990). In the United States, property
can be seized if a police officer alleges that a small amount of
a controlled substance, including cannabis, is found in the
property. Forfeiture can occur without indictment or conviction
of the owner of the property, a practice that Boaz claims is a
violation of civil rights. </p>

<p> The prohibition of cannabis has also had a number of
unintended consequences. It is argued that the patterns of
cannabis use have become more dangerous and the amount of
violence associated with the cannabis market has increased.
First, it is argued that the successful interdiction of cannabis
entering the US from overseas has resulted in increased
cultivation and production of cannabis within the country.
Nadelmann has claimed that the US has emerged as one of the
world's leading producers of cannabis ([16]Nadelmann 1991, p787).
He also argues that international drug traffickers have
redirected their attention from cannabis to cocaine, resulting in
a 'glut of increasingly potent cocaine being available and a
shortage of comparatively benign marijuana' ([17]Nadelmann 1991,
p787). </p>

<p> It is also argued that prohibition has caused an increase in
the crime and violence associated with cannabis markets and an
increase in the content of THC (the major psychoactive
ingredient) of cannabis. When the majority of cannabis used was
imported from other countries, the distribution system for
cannabis was much smaller. The production of cannabis within the
US, it is argued, leads to more small and medium producers with a
wider, more competitive and possibly more violent distribution
system (Kleiman 1986; [18]Wardlaw 1992). Domestic enforcement
has, it is argued, resulted in more technology-intensive methods
of cultivation and an increase in the potency of cannabis
([19]Reuter 1987). The fact that the sale of water pipes for
smoking cannabis is illegal means that users more often consume
cannabis in cigarette papers, which is the form of consumption
most damaging to their lungs (Reuter 1987). </p>

<p> Given the costs of this form of prohibition, and its relative
lack of success, it is perhaps surprising that the US drug
strategy enjoys widespread support from the American people. In
Gallup surveys conducted from 1969 to 1985, people were asked:
'do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?'.
In 1985, 23 per cent of respondents were in favour, 73 per cent
opposed and 4 per cent expressed no opinion ([20]Inciardi &amp;
McBride 1990, p295). In October 1989 a Time/CNN poll found that
79 per cent of the population would be willing to pay higher
taxes if the money were used for fighting the 'war on drugs'
(Inciardi &amp; McBride 1990, p295). The 'war on drugs' is
supported by liberal and conservative politicians alike, public
debate on drug strategy is rare, and discussion of the
appropriateness of drug strategy has been described as 'a parlour
sport for intellectuals' rather than a subject of general public
concern. </p>

<p> As noted above, during the 1970s a number of US states
removed the penal penalties for possession of small amounts of
cannabis for personal use (a process referred to in the USA as
'decriminalisation'), but this move towards a more liberal
approach was subsequently abandoned. Little information is
available on the basis of the policy reversal, referred to as
'recriminalisation'. Apparently the decisions were made not on
the basis of factual research into the impact of
decriminalisation, but rather on ideological grounds.
Opportunities were available for research comparing the
experiences of the various states, but apparently such research
was not undertaken, leaving policy to be made without a firm
information base.6 </p>

<h4>CONCLUSION - THE USA APPROACH </h4>

<p> The US drug policy does not seem to have met many of the
policy goals identified in the early part of this report. </p>

<p> First, cannabis policy has not been separated from that of
other drugs. Policy makers see only the larger 'drug problem' and
have not recognised the need to have different policies for
different drugs. </p>

<p> Secondly, in the USA the arguments for the total prohibition
of all drugs are highly emotive; arguments about the consequences
of drug use have not been separated from arguments about morals.
Consequently, this has led to the idea that is implicit in much
US drug policy, that all illicit drugs and consequently all drug
users are inherently criminal and even evil. The
conceptualisation of the drug problem in such uncompromising,
black and white terms means that there is little room to make
exceptions for arguably 'soft' drugs such as cannabis. </p>

<p> Thirdly, the goals of the 'war on drugs' are not realistic.
Kleiman has argued that US drug policy amounts to a 'holy war'
against drugs, and as such it is not surprising that the policy
goals are far from realistic ([21]Kleiman 1992). Those creating
and implementing the US drug strategy do not talk of 'minimising
the harm' arising from drug use (as in Australia's National Drug
Strategy); rather they aim to completely eliminate drug use, a
goal that many would consider to be unreachable. </p>

<p> Finally, in [22]Chapter Two of this report, we have suggested
that the harms caused by the drug control regimes themselves
should not outweigh the harms prevented by them. With respect to
cannabis use it has been argued that the harm caused by control
regimes clearly outweighs the harm caused by the drug
([23]Kleiman 1992). It has also been argued that those developing
policy in the US have failed to make the distinction between the
problems created by drugs and the problems created by prohibition
(e.g. [24]Wardlaw 1992). The USA has a number of severe social
problems associated with drug use, including forcing users into
the criminal milieu, demeaning the criminal law in the eyes of
users, increasing the number of people with criminal records,
increasing the level of imprisonment, and increasing the level of
transmission of the AIDS virus. These problems, and the
relatively limited achievements in reducing drug use and
drug-related problems, have prompted ever increasing efforts in
the 'war against drugs'. It is likely, however, that many of the
social problems are created not by the drugs themselves but by
the strategy of total prohibition. </p>

<h3>Part B: The Netherlands: </h3>

<p> <b>LEGISLATIVE PROHIBITION WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPEDIENCY
PRINCIPLE </b> </p>

<h4>Background </h4>

<p> Between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s in The Netherlands,
the use of illegal drugs grew from 'almost non-existent to
constitute a serious health and public order problem in urban
areas' ([25]van Vliet 1990). Although the use of cannabis in The
Netherlands came to public attention in the late 1950s, debate on
drug policy only began in earnest when heroin use and the
problems associated with it became increasingly visible between
1972 and 1975. </p>

<p> Amendments to the Opium Act were introduced in 1976 and can
be seen as heralding a new era in drug policy. Until this time
drug policy in The Netherlands was much like that of other
countries ([26]Wijingaart 1990, p668, cited in [27]Wardlaw 1992,
p16). Drug law and policy in The Netherlands The Opium Act of
1976 makes a clear distinction between 'drugs presenting
unacceptable risks' (heroin, cocaine, LSD, amphetamines) and
'cannabis products'. The changes introduced in this legislation
increased penalties for dealing in 'drugs presenting unacceptable
risks' and decreased the penalties for possession and dealing in
cannabis products. </p>

<p> The purpose of the legislation was to separate drug markets
and user groups in an effort to prevent cannabis users from
involvement in the 'hard' drug scene. Although the legislation
falls clearly within a total prohibition framework, as Dutch
commentators have pointed out 'law in practice is more relevant
than law in books' ([28]Leuw 1991). A clause in The Netherlands
Code of Criminal Procedure, known as the 'expediency principle',
states that the prosecution office may decide whether or not to
enforce certain laws, to prosecute or to initiate criminal
investigation on the basis of whether or not such action would be
'in the public interest'. Using this clause, the Minister of
Justice issued guidelines in 1976 for the enforcement of drug
laws and the investigation and prosecution of breaches of drug
laws. </p>

<p> Essentially it is these guidelines rather than legislation
that determines drug policy in The Netherlands. [29]Marshall et
al. (1990) have noted that the priorities in the guidelines
correspond to the distinctions made between 'hard' and 'soft'
drugs in the Opium Act. High priority is given to detecting the
importation and exportation of drugs that are seen to represent
an 'unacceptable risk'. </p>

<p> Investigation and prosecution of 'soft' drug violations, with
the exception of the import and export of large amounts of such
drugs, are assigned a low priority (Marshall et al. 1990).
According to the guidelines, dealing, possessing or producing
small amounts (30g or less) of marijuana, do not require police
investigation, arrest or prosecution. A low priority is also
given to the investigation and prosecution of retail dealing in
cannabis, and police are only required to confront dealers when
they advertise publicly or conduct their business in a
provocative manner. As long as there is no sale to minors, no
advertising, no sale of 'hard' drugs, and if the dealing takes
place without causing a public nuisance, then (generally
speaking) there will be no police intervention. Where there are
breaches of the type outlined above, administrative measures,
such as the withdrawal of permits to serve drinks and food, are
imposed. If the parties involved persist in contravening the
guidelines, they are issued with a warning. Confiscation of the
drugs may be another consequence of continuing breaches of the
guidelines. [30]Marshall et al. (1990) report that only very
rarely is imprisonment the consequence of such violations. The
extent to which the guidelines, or the Opium Act, are followed
depends on local circumstances. Sanctions imposed may vary
between different districts of The Netherlands. </p>

<h4>Rationales </h4>

<h5>Pragmatic rationales </h5>

<p> The goals or rationales for Dutch drug policy include the
following: </p>

<ul>
    <li>to promote safer methods of consumption of cannabis; </li>
    <li>to limit sales of cannabis to specialist sellers; </li>
    <li>to limit progression from cannabis use to other drugs; </li>
    <li>to limit the amount of violence in the cannabis
        distribution system; and </li>
    <li>to limit the substitution of other (more damaging) drugs
        for cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Philosophical rationales </h5>

<p> The 'drug problem' in The Netherlands has always been
recognised as a complex social problem and as such, law
enforcement and penal sanctions alone have never been seen to
represent a complete solution . During the parliamentary debate
on the revised Opium Act of 1976 Irene Vorrink, the Minister of
Public Health, identified the following aims that form the basis
of drug policy in The Netherlands: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the central aim is the prevention and amelioration of
        social and individual risks caused by the use of drugs; </li>
    <li>a rational relation between those risks and policy
        measures; </li>
    <li>a differentiation of policy measures which will also take
        into account the risks of legal recreational and medical
        drugs; </li>
    <li>a priority of repressive measures against the trafficking
        of drugs other than cannabis; and </li>
    <li>the inadequacy of the criminal law with regard to any
        other aspect of the drug problem ([31] Handelingen 1976,
        cited in Leuw 1991, p10). </li>
</ul>

<p> The aims outlined above illustrate that The Netherlands drug
policy is characterised by a number of factors. First, the
criminal law was never thought to be a solution to the drug
problem. Government policy with respect to 'hard' drugs is
broadly based and focuses on treatment and assistance for the
user and punishment for the commercial dealer ([32]Marshall et
al. 1990). Secondly, it is recognised that the basis of drug
policy should be to minimise harm rather than eradicate drug use,
and thirdly, it is argued that drug policy should not be the same
for all illicit drugs. Cannabis is seen in a different light from
other drugs. Clearly there are pragmatic reasons for this
separation, as the user markets for different drugs are divided
and users of cannabis are, it is argued, less likely to progress
to the use of 'harder' drugs. </p>

<p> However there is also evidence that suggests that the use of
cannabis was never perceived by Dutch society to be a
particularly compelling social problem. Leuw claims that: In
accordance with the legal differentiation between cannabis
products and hard drugs, drug policy encompassing prevention and
assistance developed primarily in reaction to the emerging heroin
problem. The cannabis problem - if there ever had been one seemed
to have disappeared from the face of the earth even before the
amended Opium Act became effective ([33]Leuw 1991, p725). </p>

<p> The separation of cannabis from other drug problems also has
had the effect of making the drug problem more manageable.
[34]Van Vliet (1988) is critical of the US style of drug policy
that makes no moral or legal distinction between different types
of drug offences or different types of drugs and claims that 'by
lumping all these different phenomena together, societies and
governments help to create a problem which is unsolvable' (van
Vliet 1988). Conversely, The Netherlands breaks down the
'inextricable' problem into 'manageable bits'. </p>

<p> In the mid-1980s, a Government-sponsored research project led
to the development of the concept of 'normalisation' or 'cultural
integration' which added to the sophistication of Dutch drug
policy ([35]van Vliet 1990;[36] Leuw 1991). 'Normalisation'
recognises that some type of drug use is natural to all human
societies and argues that the eradication of all drug use is an
unrealistic policy goal. The reduction of drug use and the social
and individual problems associated with it are felt to be far
more reasonable policy goals. Central to the concept of
'normalisation' is the idea that drug users should not be
marginalised from the rest of society. In a speech to the Dutch
Parliament, the State Secretary of Health stated, in 1985, that:
Normalisation ... includes the cultural integration of drug users
in society ... This does not mean the elimination of the drug
phenomenon as a social reality: it means a change of context
which clears the way for a different approach ... drug addicts
should be treated neither as criminals nor as dependent patients
but as 'normal' people to whom we can make 'normal' demands and
who should be offered 'normal' opportunities ([37]van Vliet 1990,
p727). </p>

<p> The implications for cannabis policy of 'normalisation' are
clear. According to the Dutch, the eradication of cannabis use is
an unrealistic policy goal and the creation of a 'deviant status'
for drug users means that users are more likely to 'drop out' of
main stream society and perhaps start using more dangerous drugs.
The use of the criminal law to deal with cannabis use would
marginalise cannabis users and this would be seen as
unnecessarily destructive in terms of its social costs. </p>

<h4>Outcomes </h4>

<p> Today it is possible to openly buy and use cannabis in a
number of coffee shops in Amsterdam and other regional centres.
Most of these coffee shops do not sell any other drugs and many
do not even sell alcohol. However, the public consumption of
cannabis has been subject to criticism from other countries, who
seem to equate public consumption with increased use. Downes
(1988) has claimed that the image of The Netherlands portrayed in
the international media is one of 'a blinkered liberalism
belatedly struggling to cope with the results of its own
permissiveness' and cites an example of a British journalist who
wrote in the Sunday Times that 'Amsterdam has a long history of
free-thinking and tolerating most things except law and order ...
But the city's tolerance has been worn thin by crime, drug abuse
and militant squatters' ([38]Downes 1988, p123). </p>

<p> Unsurprisingly, Dutch commentators do not subscribe to the
view that their society is on the brink of collapse. They argue
that the 'hash cafes' have been integrated as normal urban
facilities and do not pose a threat to public order ([39]Leuw
1991). The point has also been made that visible drug use only
signals failure if maintaining an image of a drug-free society is
an aim of drug policy (Leuw 1991). In contrast, the Dutch, who
aim to prevent drug users from being marginalised, may see
visible drug use as a sign of success. </p>

<p> Despite the impression presented in the international media,
most studies suggest that the policies implemented in The
Netherlands have not resulted in any significant increase in drug
use or changes in patterns of use ([40]Engelsmann 1989;
Wijingaart 1988a cited in [41]Wardlaw 1992, p23). A recent study
combined the results of over 20 Dutch studies that examined the
percentage of the population who had 'ever used' cannabis and
compared them with data from Norway, Sweden and the USA. The
period from 1970 to 1988 was examined and the authors concluded
that: </p>

<p> The results of the time analysis show that the prevalence of
cannabis use since 1970 decreased, whereas the policy became more
tolerant. Since 1979 a slight increase in the use of cannabis can
be observed. A comparison with data from other countries with a
more restrictive policy reveals that the use of cannabis in The
Netherlands is on the same level as in Sweden and Norway (around
10-15 per cent), but far lower than that in the US (exceeding 50
per cent). However the downward trend in these three countries
since 1984 did not occur in The Netherlands ([42]Driesen, van Dam
&amp; Olsen 1989, p11 cited in Leuw 1991). </p>

<p> The savings made to law enforcement and criminal justice
budgets of not processing large numbers of cannabis offenders are
substantial and should be seen as one of the primary benefits of
the Dutch approach to drug policy. In addition, the cannabis
market and distribution system is free from violence ([43]van
Vliet 1990). </p>

<p> It has also been argued that the Dutch approach has led to
safer patterns of cannabis use. First, the fact that users of
cannabis do not seem to turn to other more dangerous drugs is
used as evidence that the policy of the separation of drug
markets is working ([44]van Vliet 1990). [45]Cohen (1988) argues
that Dutch cannabis users, unlike their counterparts in the USA,
are not likely to ingest the herbicide paraquat in the cannabis
that they consume, and are also more likely to consume the drug
in a safer way because the sale of drug paraphernalia such as
water pipes is legal in The Netherlands (Cohen 1988). Cohen has
also argued that 'the knowledge of how to regulate cannabis use
has become an inconspicuous part of local Dutch youth culture
because the development of drug use rules was not pushed out of
the mainstream and into deviant sub cultures' (Cohen 1988, p24). </p>

<p> In terms of the goals that Dutch policy makers identified,
drug policy in The Netherlands has been moderately successful.
However, the Dutch approach to drug policy has not been popular
internationally: Germany and the USA in particular have been
vocal in their opposition. In recent times this has led to the
introduction of tougher drug policies with respect to 'hard
drugs' ([46]Marshall et al. 1990), however these pressures have
not yet had any impact on cannabis policy. Indeed, it has been
speculated that Dutch cannabis policy is unlikely to change as a
result of international pressure ([47]Wardlaw 1992). </p>

<h4>CONCLUSION - THE DUTCH APPROACH </h4>

<p> In a variety of ways The Netherlands drug policy meets many
of the criteria outlined in [48]Chapter 2. </p>

<p> First, Dutch policy makers have recognised the need to have
different policies for different drugs. The idea of separating
'drugs of unacceptable risk' and cannabis is based on the idea
that the control regime that appears to be appropriate for one
illicit drug need not apply to others. </p>

<p> Secondly, policy makers have managed to separate arguments
about the consequences of drug use from arguments about morals.
In fact, Dutch policy was intended to be 'non-moralistic'
([49]Leuw 1991). It has been claimed that, in The Netherlands,
drug use has never been seen as a 'moral' issue and it is argued
that: Political speeches elaborating on the abhorrence of illegal
drugs have seldom been staged. They would appear as quite
misplaced in Dutch political culture. Consequently there are no
votes to be won or positions to be conquered by rallying an
anti-drug theme ([50]Leuw 1991). </p>

<p> Thirdly, this non-moralistic approach to drug policy has led
to the development of realistic policy goals with respect to
cannabis use. [51]Leuw (1991) notes that in The Netherlands there
has been no pledge of 'solving the problem' of drug use. Instead
of attempting to eradicate drug use Dutch authorities have
adopted the more pragmatic goal of minimising the risks and
damaging effects of drug use. Of concern to some observers,
however, is the Dutch approach of formalising inconsistency
between the provisions of legislation and its implementation. An
argument can be advanced that this conveys confusing messages to
the community. It is preferable, some would argue, for
legislation and policy on implementation to be aligned so that
both permit (or proscribe) the use of cannabis in certain
circumstances. Having legislation creating an offence of cannabis
use, along with policy declaring that it is inexpedient to
prosecute such offences, seems to be acceptable in the Dutch
context, although it would possibly be unacceptable in other
cultures. We return to this apparent difficulty in the concluding
chapter of this report. </p>

<h2>Conclusion - the total prohibition options </h2>

<p> The Netherlands has been successful in terms of the goals
identified by Dutch policy makers. Their policy has not resulted
in the increased use of cannabis; indeed levels of cannabis use
are markedly lower than those seen in the United States or
Australia. There is little violence associated with the cannabis
distribution system, cannabis users do not seem to progress to
using more serious drugs and the drug is consumed in a manner
whereby the risks of harm are minimised. </p>

<p> Dutch policy is also relatively successful in terms of many
of the policy goals that we discussed above. The separation of
cannabis from other drugs ensures that The Netherlands has a more
manageable drug policy. The goals of policy are realistic and
policy makers have not confused moral arguments with arguments
about the consequences of drug use. </p>

<p> In contrast, the US drug strategy with respect to cannabis
does not seem to be particularly successful. Despite considerable
economic and social costs, cannabis use is far from being
eradicated in the USA. Cannabis users may be consuming the drug
in a particularly dangerous manner, the illicit drugs
distribution system (of which cannabis is a part) is associated
with violence, and law enforcement, criminal justice processing
and the imprisonment of cannabis-related offenders costs American
tax payers millions of dollars every year. </p>

<p> The USA has not emerged favourably in relation to the goals
identified in the first part of this report. Apparently American
policy makers have not recognised the need to consider different
policy strategies for different drugs, leaving cannabis part of
the larger, seemingly unsolvable 'drug problem'. Moral arguments
have been confused with arguments about the consequences of drug
use, and this has led to the development of unrealistic policy
goals and a failure to recognise that the control regime imposed
to deal with the problem of cannabis use may be causing more harm
than the cannabis use itself. Examples from the USA and The
Netherlands demonstrate that the legislative option of total
prohibition can be implemented in very different ways. The two
countries have very different philosophical and pragmatic
rationales for their policies and, unsurprisingly, the outcomes
of the policies have varied considerably. </p>

<p> In developing policy, international examples are of benefit
to Australian policy makers. It should be remembered, however,
that the relative success or failure of drug policies depend as
much on cultural factors, existing patterns of drug use, and
public views of drug use, as they do on the soundness of the
policy. </p>

<h1>CHAPTER 5: DIVERSION AND COMPULSORY TREATMENT </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"> </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> This chapter covers the two related fields of diversion and
treatment - including compulsory treatment - for drug offenders,
particularly where cannabis is involved. Such diversion may
simply involve diversion from the criminal justice system for
individuals involved in minor cannabis offences; it may also
involve diversion to treatment for those who either want, or are
judged by others, to need treatment for drug use sufficiently
serious to bring them into contact with the criminal justice
system. </p>

<p> Diversion is a form of intervention in the lives of offenders
primarily based on humanitarian grounds (i.e. to keep them out of
prison), but also, more pragmatically, to relieve the burden on
the courts and the prisons imposed by the very large numbers of
people charged with very minor offences. While diversion from a
court appearance is a mild form of intervention receiving broad
community support, diversion to treatment, particularly when
mandated by the court, raises philosophical issues relating to
the degree of intervention the state should be empowered to
exercise over people's lives. Compulsory treatment when it takes
the form of civil commitment is the most extreme form of
intervention, and, where ordered for drug offenders, is morally
distasteful to many and the subject of much controversy.
Nevertheless, there are legislative provisions for civil
commitment of drug offenders in many countries, including
Australia. </p>

<p> We begin the chapter with a discussion of the concept of
diversion, then review existing diversion programs in Australia
and overseas, with particular reference to programs involving
treatment. The subject of compulsory treatment, including civil
commitment for drug offenders, is dealt with next, with an
overview of international legislation and treatment programs,
along with such evaluations as exist. The implications of this
for offenders whose primary drug is cannabis are discussed and
some conclusions are drawn regarding treatment for repeat
offenders. </p>

<p> Finally, we present a summary of the major findings for
cannabis users resulting from our review of the key Australian
and international literature dealing with diversion and treatment
for drug offenders. The concept of diversion In the US, according
to Tomasic ([1]1977, cited in Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p6),
official use of the term 'diversion' occurred for the first time
in the US President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice. The following are two definitions of
diversion from the US literature: ... the disposition of a
criminal complaint without conviction, the non-criminal
disposition being conditioned on either the performance of
specified obligations by the defendant, or his participation in
counselling or treatment, ([2]Nimmer 1974, cited in Dept of
Attorney-General 1982, p6). ... those formally acknowledged and
organised efforts to utilize alternatives to the initial or
continued criminal justice processing of alleged offenders, which
are undertaken prior to adjudication but after a prosecutable
action has occurred, ([3]Rovner-Pieczenik, cited in Dept of
Attorney-General 1982, p6). Due to fears, in the case of
non-trial disposition, of unfairness, lack of procedural
protection and lack of follow-up treatment to prevent recurrence
of the offence, the Commission recommended formalising the
procedure and adding extra-legal services such as treatment and
preventative education as an integral part of the non-trial
disposition. The total package came to be known as 'diversion'
([4]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p8). </p>

<p> The early justifications for diversion included: </p>

<ul>
    <li>relief of overburdened courts; </li>
    <li>avoiding the further criminalisation of first offenders; </li>
    <li>avoiding the disadvantaging of first offenders on
        re-entry to society by their being labelled as criminals;
    </li>
    <li>providing a preferable way of dealing with certain
        offenders such as juveniles or drug users, who could be
        better dealt with in the community than in prisons; and </li>
    <li>providing cost-benefits to the community and a more
        humane way of dealing with certain categories of
        offenders ([5]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p9). </li>
</ul>

<p> The term 'diversion' when used in relation to the Australian
criminal justice system may incorporate a 'range of related but
relatively exclusive procedures some of which are seen as
potential alternatives to &quot;due process&quot; others as
additions to it' ([6]Williams 1981, p3). Those falling into the
'alternatives' classification include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>pre-arrest diversion: this amounts to discretionary
        measures taken by police at the point of apprehension of
        an offender; and </li>
    <li>pre-trial diversion (or 'pre-court', in Australia): in
        this case certain conditions have to be satisfied by the
        offender, following which the alleged offences are struck
        off the record. </li>
</ul>

<p> Those falling into the 'additions' classification include: +
pre-sentence diversion: this is essentially remand for assessment
and/or treatment; and + post-conviction diversion: in this case
offenders are directed to some form of treatment-related
supervision as a part of their sentence (presumably in lieu of
imprisonment). Prisoners may also be diverted from jail to
treatment as a condition of their parole. These additions to due
process, therefore, function as increased sentencing options
([7]Williams 1981, p3). </p>

<p> The subject of diversion has been a neglected area in
Australia, although there have been 'official' diversionary
programs operating at least since 1977 (in NSW). The term
diversion is applied to a wide variety of programs, and in
Australia can occur pre-court or pre- or post-sentence. Pre-court
diversion can vary from a police warning or an expiation notice
for a minor drug offence, to referral for drug-treatment as an
alternative to a punitive sentence. </p>

<p> Unlike some countries, in Australia cannabis use and
possession offences are not regarded as very serious in
comparison with offences involving 'harder' drugs, and the
subject of treatment for cannabis use has similarly not been
considered much of an issue. In fact the legislation in some
States does not cover diversion for treatment on the grounds of
cannabis use alone. If cannabis users are diverted for treatment
it is usually because they are polydrug users, as many of the
more serious users are. </p>

<p> The main diversion programs operating in Australia will be
briefly described, and an overview presented of diversion in the
US and other countries, with reference to their relevance for
cannabis users. Key features of treatment programs for drug users
are discussed, along with the issue of compulsory treatment and,
what is known in the United States as, civil commitment. </p>

<h2>Diversion programs in Australia (10) </h2>

<h3>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY </h3>

<p> The ACT Drugs of Dependence Act 1989 (as amended in 1992 and
1993) allows as a sentencing option anyone found guilty of a
crime to be sent for assessment as to whether they are
drug-dependent and therefore suitable to be referred for
treatment. Those brought to court usually appear on a combination
of charges of different degrees of seriousness. Often a community
service order may be the sentence or a conviction on
recognisance, which can include a good behaviour bond or a
partially or fully suspended sentence. Assessment or treatment
orders are rare and are typically given for such offences as
unlawful possession, stolen property offences, burglary and motor
vehicle theft (where drug dependence is believed to have
contributed to the criminal behaviour).11 </p>

<p> The DODA (Drugs of Dependence) Referral Program works in the
following way: anyone committing an offence requiring a court
appearance who seems to defence counsel to have a drug problem
(or who claims to have a drug problem) is entitled to have this
fact raised before sentencing. If the court issues an assessment
order, the client then has to contact the DODA Referral Program
where a counsellor takes a case history to be sent to the
Treatment Assessment Panel. The panel consists of a legal person
(usually a solicitor) and two others with extensive knowledge of
drug and alcohol treatment in the ACT, who are appointed for a
year. The client is assessed and options for treatment put
forward. The client then goes to the chosen treatment centre
which reports back to the panel as to whether the client is
suitable or not suitable for treatment. The client then goes back
to the panel for a second time at which time the panel looks at
the information from the treatment centre and listens to what the
client has to say, since the client has high input and
responsibility throughout the process. If the client fails to
come back (or fails to attend at any stage) an arrest warrant may
be issued, or the panel may suggest a Breach of Assessment Order.
This information goes to the court, where a warrant for arrest
may be issued, or the failure to attend may be brought up when
the client next comes before the court and the client may lose
the right to the alternative to sentencing. This does not happen
very often, as the court usually chooses the treatment order when
they have the option. The court specifies the length of time at
the treatment centre and periodic reviews by the panel, which can
be every three months. The program tries to be lenient if the
client misses one or two reviews, as the objective is harm
minimisation rather than abstinence (unless the client has opted
for abstinence). If the client consistently fails to appear for
review or is not doing well (this is not the usual outcome) it is
possible to breach them. The breach is issued in court but DODA
provides the report on behalf of the panel. Then a summons can be
issued and the usual court process (arrest warrant issued) is
followed. </p>

<p> The magistrate primarily concerned with diversion made the
following observations: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Most drug-related offences are caused by alcohol, often
        used in conjunction with cannabis, which is particularly
        dangerous if the offender is driving. The DODA Program
        does not cover alcohol. </li>
    <li>There is concern about the danger posed by offenders
        combining alcohol and cannabis prior to driving (many
        alcohol-dependent people coming before the DODA treatment
        panel are also cannabis-dependent). </li>
    <li>Clients should not be referred for treatment in the case
        of cannabis use unless assessed as 'seriously dependent
        on cannabis', in order to screen out those seeking simply
        to avoid conviction. </li>
    <li>A distinct preference was expressed for post-court
        diversion, as opposed to pre-court diversion, so that the
        court has the opportunity to assess offenders. </li>
    <li>Offenders may be diverted more than once. The goal is
        'harm reduction', and total rehabilitation is not
        expected after the first treatment. </li>
</ul>

<p> It was confirmed by the magistrate and treatment personnel
that there have been clients coming to the program who complain
of cannabis dependence. Personnel at the DODA Referral Program
report that there is very little treatment for cannabis users. It
is usually outpatient treatment and 'is not 100 per cent
successful'. The treatment they use is adapted from the treatment
for tobacco, i.e. a process of slow cessation, while keeping a
diary of the situations and times of use, with counselling once a
week. Ideally the treatment should be tailored to the
individual's needs. Very few cannabis users would be referred to
a residential facility such as Karralika, and if so, it would be
on the grounds of polydrug use. </p>

<p> The DODA program is the only one of its sort in Australia,
and mainly deals with fairly longstanding opiate users with
lengthy records. There is a juvenile panel, but this has not been
used much. If magistrates send more juveniles in future, the
program would be especially relevant for alcohol use. A formal
evaluation has not yet been done, but program staff claim the
following desirable results: a reduction in criminal activity on
the part of its clients; monitoring their progress rather than
seeing them go to jail; and reducing their drug use. Very few
become drug-free, but there is significant harm reduction from
the social, personal and economic viewpoint. </p>

<h3>SOUTH AUSTRALIA </h3>

<p> The drug diversion scheme operating in South Australia was
established when the Controlled Substances Act 1984 provided for
the South Australian Drug Assessment and Aid Panel (the panel) as
an alternative to the criminal law for illicit drug users.12 The
panel is only one of 13 penalty outcomes for drug offenders in
South Australia, ranging from a $50 expiation fee for possession
of small amounts of cannabis and cannabis resin to $1 million and
life imprisonment for the most serious trafficking offence. The
underlying philosophy is to make a clear distinction between the
drug dealer and the drug user (Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
1992). </p>

<p> The new Act came about primarily as a result of the
recommendation of the Sackville Commission that drug assessment
and aid panels should be established to which all persons charged
with simple possession offences involving drugs must be referred
before a prosecution may proceed. Juvenile Aid Panels were also
established - as an alternative to the juvenile court system -
which continue to operate and to provide for the diversion of
some, but not all, young offenders out of the criminal justice
system ([8]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992). </p>

<p> The panel provides for absolute diversion in so far as the
panel and its clients, not the courts and prosecutors, determine
the outcome of proceedings. All persons charged with a 'simple
possession' offence (i.e. involving personal use of illicit drugs
other than cannabis and cannabis resin and including use or
possession of implements for the use of an illicit drug) must be
referred to the panel, thus precluding any issue of discretion on
the part of courts or prosecutors, and removing the offender from
the court system ([9]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p129). </p>

<p> The panel, however, considers only a limited number of
offences, and although an amendment to the Act permitted courts
to refer matters to the panel for the preparation of pre-sentence
reports, this power has rarely been exercised ([10]Gray, Reynolds
&amp; Rumbold 1992, p130). The panel consists of a lawyer and two
people with extensive knowledge of the problems and/or treatment
of illicit drug use. Hearings are private and proceedings
confidential in order to create an atmosphere of trust. Clients
are referred from either the police or the courts, more often the
former. Before being dealt with by the panel, the client must
have admitted to the offence and be willing to undertake the
assessment and any treatment or counselling which may be
required. The client may choose the option of being dealt with by
the courts. Those who do not appear willing to change their lives
and those who do not respond to the initial letter from the panel
or attend their appointment are referred back to court. </p>

<p> Those dealt with by the panel must undertake to comply with
the directions of the panel and attend panel sessions as
requested over a six-month period.13 At the end of this period
the panel instructs the court and the police to withdraw the
matter, and no record of any drug offence may be used
subsequently against the client ([11]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
1992, p129). </p>

<p> The major findings of an evaluation of the panel were that: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Out of the 1,400 clients seen between May 1985 and
        September 1991, most were male and in their 20s, directed
        to the panel for illegal possession of, mostly,
        amphetamines followed by heroin. </li>
    <li>The panel did not provide the early intervention hoped
        for. Although most clients were being offered the
        opportunity for assessment for treatment for the first
        time, many already had criminal histories. Intervention
        at an earlier stage is desirable for a more successful
        outcome. </li>
    <li>The amount of polydrug use 'should be seen as a matter of
        significance and concern. This includes the dangerous -
        though legal - drugs, alcohol and tobacco, which will
        often prove more of a problem and potentially more
        destructive to clients than the illicit drug problem that
        brought them to the attention of the panel in the first
        place' ([12]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p133). </li>
    <li>While cannabis and cannabis resin offences were excluded
        from the panel's jurisdiction, 'there were indications of
        extensive and potentially harmful levels of cannabis use
        among many clients' ([13]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
        1992, p132). </li>
    <li>The characteristics of most of the clients were such that
        the treatment required was based on coping and lifestyle
        skills 'rather than strategies influenced by models of
        physiological addiction' ([14]Gray, Reynolds &amp;
        Rumbold 1992, p132). </li>
    <li>The panel is only as effective as the treatment and other
        social supports which are available. </li>
    <li>The statutory barrier allowing only people over 18 to be
        seen by the panel means that many have had drug habits
        for years. Although structured to deal with these cases,
        the Childrens Aid Panel is not sufficiently a specialist
        drug assessment and aid body, nor are drugs its primary
        concern. </li>
</ol>

<p> Overall 'the justification for the panel as a means of
diverting offenders from the criminal justice system and
providing intervention opportunities is overwhelming' ([15]Gray,
Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p134). Interviews with criminal
justice personnel indicated that the panel is satisfactory from
the point of view of cutting down on court congestion and from
the point of view that it is treatment-focused rather than
punitive. There is also no stigma of a conviction being recorded.
However, it seems that within the confines of the Act, the police
have the discretion as to what charge to lay, e.g. if the
offender is known by the police and has an amount of the drug
which could be trafficked, he may instead be charged with
trafficking. </p>

<h3>NEW SOUTH WALES </h3>

<p> Offences relating to alcohol or drug use in New South Wales
are covered by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
This Act distinguishes between cannabis and other drugs only in
the case of commercial trafficking. Possession and administration
of cannabis are prosecuted summarily and offenders are liable to
a penalty of $2,000 and/or two years' imprisonment. Cultivation,
manufacture and production, and supply are prosecuted on
indictment, an offender being liable to a fine of $2,000 and/or
two years imprisonment if there are less than five plants or less
than a quantity of 25g. New South Wales was the first State in
Australia to introduce a drug diversion program. </p>

<p> Its current program, the Drug and Alcohol Court Assessment
Programme (DACAP) is a post-conviction, pre-sentence program
where offenders on drug-related charges (such as possession of an
illicit substance) or drug-involved crime (such as property crime
to finance drug use) are bailed/remanded to attend a treatment
agency and undergo a comprehensive assessment which forms the
basis of a pre-sentence report for the magistrate, containing
recommendations for sentencing, including treatment options
([16]Desland &amp; Batey 1990, p796). </p>

<p> Successful completion of the treatment program, the length of
which is determined by a health worker, finalises the matter
([17]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993). A further objective is to
'provide drug offenders with a comprehensive assessment that may
encourage them to consider improving their health and social
functioning' ([18]Schlosser 1984, pxi). </p>

<p> DACAP further attempts through these assessments to match the
individual's drug-related problems to the most appropriate range
of therapeutic interventions within a legal/health framework
(Schlosser 1984).'... the diversion from the Criminal Justice
System to the health care system provides to the offender in many
cases, the initial insight and confrontation that criminal
activities are directly related to their health. Often this
insight initiates motivation to address the problems of substance
abuse' ([19]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p92). </p>

<p> DACAP statistics between 1990 and 1992 indicate that, while
heroin was the main drug of concern (after alcohol) in about one
case in five, both in 1990-91 and 1991-92, cannabis was the next
ranking drug ([20]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p96).14 An interview with
one of DACAP's clients who had been arrested for possession and
supply of a large amount of cannabis revealed that, although he
knew that he had 'a big marijuana problem', he had never been
prepared to do anything about it and that DACAP provided the
opportunity and a reason to 'address the issue'. The magistrate
placed this client under supervision, fined him, imposed a
sentence of periodic detention, with 20 hours at an Attendance
Centre and the requirement to undertake a series of courses on
issues such as personal development, money management, drug and
alcohol information and education. The client fulfilled these
requirements ([21]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p118). </p>

<p> MSJ Keys Young's recent evaluation of DACAP included the
observations that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Magistrates generally agreed that a DACAP report might be
        considered appropriate in cases involving a relatively
        serious and/or repeated offence, where a custodial
        sentence was a realistic possibility (some used it even
        where a custodial sentence was unlikely), and where it
        appeared that drug/alcohol dependency might be a
        significant factor (1992, p113). </li>
    <li>It was very desirable to use the pre-sentence 'crisis'
        period to get the dependency problem acknowledged and, if
        possible, to start treatment, as if left until after
        sentence, the chances of success were much less (1992,
        p105); sometimes it takes a long time for a drug user to
        recognise dependency (e.g. in the case of cannabis) and
        an intervention such as that of DACAP can be very
        beneficial in confronting this. </li>
    <li>Some magistrates observed that they did not see many
        people who had been through the DACAP process coming
        before the court for repeat offences. Important issues
        were availability of places in treatment and skilled
        counsellors with broad views of dependency. Regarding the
        issue of coercion, several evaluations of DACAP have
        'tentatively concluded' that the legal coercion into
        treatment as evidenced in the DACAP program was effective
        in acting as an early intervention into drug use,
        generating a younger client less involved with drugs, who
        is more amenable to an abstinent outcome (Desland &amp;
        Batey 1988; [22]Schlosser 1984; [23]Bush &amp; Scagliotti
        1983; [24]Williams 1981; all cited in Desland &amp; Batey
        1988, p51). This is consistent with other studies of
        court-ordered assessment/treatment for substance use
        ([25]Salmon &amp; Salmon 1983, cited in Desland &amp;
        Batey 1987, p51). </li>
</ul>

<h3>VICTORIA </h3>

<p> Victoria appears not to have any government-implemented
pre-court drug diversion programs ([26]Walters &amp; Coventry
1993). The Alcoholics and Drug Dependent Person's Act 1968 (Vic),
s13 provides for bonds under which offenders may be ordered to
attend treatment as an alternative to a custodial sentence (Skene
1986, cited in [27]Walters 1993, p11). Programs are available for
offenders who are detected to be intoxicated at the time of the
offence and considered by the court to be 'habitually using
intoxicating liquor or drugs of addiction'. </p>

<p> The Court Advice and Assessment Programme precipitates a
court report which makes recommendations on the suitability of a
community-based order, and provides a management plan based on
the offender's level of substance use. Referral to the program is
at the discretion of the court, and applies only at the
magistrate's jurisdiction, but is not limited to particular
offences ([28]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p130). In
addition, s67 of the Act allows for a good behaviour bond for
first offenders so that the number of drug users ending up in
court is not large. </p>

<p> A current study being carried out in Victoria by the National
Centre for Socio-Legal Studies ([29]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993)
for the Victoria Police, is considering a pilot pre-court drug
diversion program for 'all first-time drug offenders apprehended
for use and possession offences regardless of the illicit
substance'. At the time of detection and arrest these offenders
would be considered 'recreational users', and one option for
processing such offenders would be a diversion panel. In this
case it would be up to the panel to assess the nature and extent
of drug use and recommend a course of action ([30]Walters &amp;
Coventry 1993, p7). </p>

<h3>WESTERN AUSTRALIA </h3>

<p> In Western Australia, the Bail Act 1982 provides for
treatment as a condition of bail in the case of a defendant who
is suffering from alcohol or drug dependence. Their pre-court
diversion system, the Court Diversion Service (CDS) has been
operating since 1988 as a cooperative venture between the West
Australian Alcohol and Drug Authority (WAADA), the Department of
Corrective Services and non-government drug treatment agencies,
coordinated by the WAADA. Any person with a drug dependency
problem who is charged with a criminal offence is entitled to
apply to the court for inclusion in the CDS program. However, it
is important to note that persons are disqualified whose primary
drug problem is alcohol or cannabis unless there is evidence of
other current substance use that is a contributing factor.
Informal referral and preassessment does occur and clients may
voluntarily engage with a treatment agency prior to a formal
referral by the court (CDS 1993). CDS policy requires only that a
person admit to substance use, not to an alleged offence, thus
the person can be formally engaged in treatment for an admitted
drug problem and maintain a not guilty plea throughout the legal
proceedings. </p>

<p> If formal referral does not occur, the CDS is not empowered
to oversee the defendant's drug treatment and no CDS reports can
be provided to the courts on the defendants progress (CDS 1993). </p>

<p> When formal referral to the CDS does occur, defendants are
informed of the relevant drug treatment agencies and their
philosophies, and must choose. They are then required to remain
with that agency unless otherwise instructed by the CDS officer.
Court appearances after formal referral are accompanied by
interim reports regarding progress, and at the point of plea or
of a finding of guilt the defendant is generally remanded for a
full pre-sentence report. The coercive nature of the CDS in
engaging drug dependent persons in treatment programs during
times of legal crisis is acknowledged, and it is emphasised to
potential clients that progress in treatment is only one aspect
taken into consideration by the sentencing judge or magistrate
(CDS 1993). </p>

<p> CDS personnel expressed the view that, whereas in the early
days of the program there were mostly self-referrals, now most
are court-generated. People have always had the option of
treatment but clearly the catalyst is often a legal charge. The
more familiar the courts become with the process the more it is
used, and it is regarded as being generally well accepted. </p>

<p> Pre-court or pre-sentence diversion? As long as personal
cannabis use/possession/cultivation remains illegal, the
fundamental problem exists of the involvement of police
discretion and variation in enforcement policies from one officer
to another and from one jurisdiction to another. Any contact
between the cannabis user and the police (at street level) or
between the user and the court has the potential for the
individual to have continuing involvement with the criminal
justice system. Police discretion at street level at the point of
arrest (or non-arrest) is inevitable. Police officers have the
discretion regarding whether or not to issue an expiation notice
(in jurisdictions such as South Australia) or (in jurisdictions
such as Victoria) to choose which (if any) of a number of
possible charges they will lay, which can vary from possession to
trafficking. </p>

<p> While this could work in the interests of the offender, it
may also act in a discriminatory fashion, which is why many would
make the argument in favour of diversion systems which bring all
offenders before the court, thus guaranteeing them due process.
Many lawyers tend to support leaving the conventional criminal
processing intact 'to ensure that the diversion program does not
result in more coercive treatment of offenders through the
non-judicial exercise of discretion' (Dept of Attorney General
1982, p78). In the case of expiation fines, it appears that many
fines are not being expiated.15 Therefore the objective of
relieving the burden on the courts, while achieved to a
substantial degree, has not yet been 100 per cent successful, and
there is room for improvement in terms of reducing the number of
non-expiators and consequently removing more offenders from the
criminal justice system. </p>

<h2>Diversion programs in other countries </h2>

<h3>UNITED STATES </h3>

<p> The most prominent drug diversion programs in the US are the
Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime (TASC) programs,
established primarily to try to reduce the crime associated with
drug use (mainly heroin). This national pre-trial diversion
program was expanded to include all drug users (except those
dependent on alcohol), including juveniles, recruited at all
points of entry to the criminal justice system (e.g. through
pre-sentence referral, conditional probation, police diversion
and conditional parole). The program varies with the different
legal systems and drug problems existing from State to State. For
instance, marijuana users and juveniles were excluded in
Colorado, whereas in Michigan marijuana users were preferred.
Overall, however, most programs concentrated on heroin users
([31]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, pp10-11). </p>

<p> Such programs were not particularly amenable to satisfactory
evaluation and usually were restricted to an examination of how
well program objectives had been met. The results indicated: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Dissatisfaction among law enforcement officials because
        of reduced opportunities for information from defendants
        regarding drug supplies (an example of the clash of
        philosophies between health authorities and law
        enforcement, which can be a factor contributing to
        failure in many diversion programs; this also indicates
        the emphasis on the supply reduction approach in the US,
        which is greater than that in Australia). </li>
    <li>Most of those diverted did not totally abstain from
        marijuana use although they reported reduced use (again
        this was not acceptable from the US total prohibition
        point of view, but a reduction in use can be seen as a
        successful program outcome in many treatment programs in
        Australia). </li>
    <li>There were fewer arrests and convictions (though
        marginally) among those diverted. </li>
    <li>There was some reduction in workload in the case of the
        prosecutor and the court but greatly increased workloads
        for the probation service. </li>
    <li>Purely from the treatment outcome point of view for the
        individual, the results were encouraging (though lack of
        adequate data precluded assessment of recidivism over the
        long term). Individuals' characteristics prior to program
        entry are an important determinant to successful program
        outcome (Rovner-Pieczenik cited in [32]Dept of
        Attorney-General 1982, p14). </li>
</ul>

<p> Criticisms of the program also include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The argument that the workloads of courts and prisons are
        not really reduced because people are being brought into
        the criminal justice process who would not have been
        processed at all, since they would have been handled in
        the community. </li>
    <li>Diversion programs are sometimes utilised by prosecutors
        and courts when less official procedures might accomplish
        the same objective with less intervention and use of
        court time. </li>
    <li>The court is saved time only if the accused would have
        gone to trial and then to jail. </li>
</ul>

<p> However diversion appears to be more an 'alternative to
dismissal of charges or probation than to incarceration'
(Gorelick 1975 cited in [33]Dept of Attorney General 1982, p16).
This view was also shared by the Canadian Law Reform Commission
(Dept of Attorney-General 1982). Further criticisms were: </p>

<ul>
    <li>That diversion might also come to carry with it a social
        stigma if it is an 'institutionalised element of the
        criminal justice system'. </li>
    <li>Unsuccessful participants may be disadvantaged when
        returned to the court system. </li>
    <li>Legal analysts are concerned about the exercise of
        judicial discretion by non-judicial bodies. </li>
    <li>Diversion could be seen as an expansion of social
        control, and the concept of 'need for treatment' has no
        inherent limitation ([34]Dept of Attorney-General 1982,
        pp16-17). </li>
</ul>

<p> All of the points made above are also valid for Australian
diversion schemes. A very recent form of pre-court intervention
(for the purpose of treatment) operating in the US is the Weekend
Intervention Program (WIP) which is reported to be 'highly
effective in identifying and intervening with persons charged
with alcohol- and other drug-related driving offences' (Siegal
&amp; Cole 1993). </p>

<p> The underlying philosophy of the program is that the crisis
nature of an encounter with the criminal justice system, if
successfully managed, provides a valuable opportunity to
intervene in an individual's life by identifying the clinical
needs of substance users who are not yet receiving treatment, and
in a non-punitive way 'gently' confronting participants with the
consequences of their own drug and alcohol use. The individual is
provided with a diagnostic assessment and treatment program
recommendation 'with a specificity unavailable through
traditional settings' ([35]Siegal &amp; Cole 1993, p133). The
program consists of a three-day residential program to which
persons involved in a drug or alcohol offence may be remanded by
a court or other supervising agency. It consists of 'Marathon
substance abuse counselling sessions using a
cognitive-behavioural-oriented approach combined with
presentations structured around a modified health belief model'.
This participation in the assessment and referral process itself
is regarded as being able to help prepare the substance user for
any treatment to be received ([36]Siegal &amp; Cole 1993,
pp133-4). </p>

<h3>NEW ZEALAND </h3>

<p> New Zealand has an adult pre-trial diversion scheme which
commenced operation in 1988. It was developed and is managed by
the New Zealand Police as part of a wider program which entails
an increasing emphasis on the use of discretion by police in
their handling of minor offenders. The scheme is not, at present,
statutorily based although the Government is considering this
option. </p>

<p> The scheme is widely accepted by police officers, members of
the judiciary and practising lawyers, as well as the offenders
who are offered pre-trial diversion. The New Zealand Police have
described the scheme in the following terms: The key steps in the
scheme are that the offender must be a first offender (there are
limited exceptions in special cases), there is sufficient
evidence to charge the offender, and information is then laid and
at that stage the offender is considered for diversion. If the
offender meets the criteria [see below] and admits the offence to
the diversion coordinator (a police prosecutor) the court is
asked to adjourn the case until the offender has completed the
requirements of the diversion scheme. Those requirements may
consist of paying money to a charity, doing community work,
and/or attending specialist counselling depending on what problem
they may have, e.g. drugs, alcohol, anger management, etc. Once
the requirements have been completed the police ask the court to
withdraw the information (personal communication, New Zealand
Police, 17 December 1993). If the court agrees to withdraw the
information, the offender is not convicted and the police destroy
the offender's records, including fingerprints. </p>

<p> The criteria for diversion are not rigid; they include the
following: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The offender should be a first offender. </li>
    <li>There should be special circumstances which make the
        offender suitable for diversion. </li>
    <li>The offence must be non-serious. </li>
    <li>The offender must admit guilt, show remorse, and be
        prepared to pay full reparation to the victim. </li>
    <li>The victim must agree to diversion. </li>
    <li>The officer in charge of the case [generally the
        arresting officer] must agree to diversion. </li>
    <li>The offender must agree to diversion ([37]Young &amp;
        Cameron 1991, pp9-10). </li>
</ol>

<p> The use of cannabis and the possession of small quantities
for personal use are considered to be minor offences, making an
offender eligible for consideration for diversion. (Clearly the
criterion relating to the consent of the victim is not relevant
in such cases.) Consultants reviewed the scheme for the New
Zealand Police in 1991. They reported that approximately 12 per
cent of the people dealt with through the diversionary process
had been charged with cannabis possession ([38]Young &amp;
Cameron 1991, pp41-6). The review indicated that the scheme was
generally very well received by all the parties involved and also
pointed to existing and potential difficulties and to ways in
which it could be strengthened. The police and the Government are
currently reviewing the scheme, considering the option of giving
it a legislative base and ensuring that it operates in a similar
manner throughout the country. This diversionary scheme, combined
with an actively implemented policy of cautioning minor offenders
whenever possible (rather than charging them), comprises an
enlightened approach to the handling of minor offenders such as
cannabis users. </p>

<h2>OTHER COUNTRIES </h2>

<p> An overview of international legislation relating to
diversion, in countries covered by the World Health Organization
([39]Porter, Arif &amp; Curran 1986), indicates that many
countries provide for diversion to drug- and alcohol-dependence
treatment programs both separately and in combination, the
covering legislation falling into a variety of categories (e.g.
mental health, public health, criminal or specialised treatment
laws).16 </p>

<p> The legal disposition of drug- or alcohol-dependent persons
is frequently covered by the criminal law (e.g. under specified
statutory offence) or mental health legislation. In Victoria, for
example, treatment programs for drug and alcohol dependence
include provision for both voluntary and involuntary admission,
while other provisions governing treatment may be found in road
traffic laws and the mental health legislation (Porter, Arif
&amp; Curran 1986, pp36-37). Porter et al. emphasise the
importance of treatment as a service to the public and the
individual concerned, which should be available at every stage of
the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> Initial contact between the offender and the police can be
very important, as it may create the kind of crisis that
motivates a person to undergo effective treatment, and the police
should be 'both legally entitled and encouraged to refer the
person directly to a treatment program, in lieu of arrest, for a
short time until the emergency passes'. They claim that there are
definite advantages in including treatment provisions in drug
control legislation because of the flexibility it gives to the
courts in imposing alternatives to penal sanctions ([40]Porter,
Arif &amp; Curran 1986, p116). </p>

<p> To summarise some relevant points raised by Porter et al's
overview of international diversion legislation: 1. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Cannabis is rarely named specifically in legislation
        relating to diversion for drug users who commit offences.
        Usually the legislation refers to 'narcotics', 'opiates',
        'alcohol' or 'other drugs'. Although cannabis is usually
        not specifically singled out (as distinct from alcohol,
        for example, which is mostly treated in a special class
        of its own with specialised treatment), it falls within
        the general class of substances for which many countries
        legislate compulsory reporting and/or registration
        followed by referral into a treatment program. 2. </li>
    <li>There are many precedents among overseas countries for
        diversion and voluntary or non-voluntary commitment to
        treatment. There are also examples of such diversion
        occurring at every stage of the criminal justice process.
        3. </li>
    <li>There is a clear lack of evaluation of programs, which
        means results cannot be quantified, but the general
        impression is one of diversion to treatment being more
        acceptable all round than imprisonment without
        rehabilitation, which would otherwise be the situation in
        countries with a total prohibition policy. 4. </li>
    <li>Civil commitment appears to be common internationally,
        but in Australia legislative provisions for civil
        commitment exist only in certain States, e.g. NSW and
        Victoria. (This is discussed further under the heading
        Compulsory Treatment for Drug Offenders: Criminal Justice
        System-Initiated Treatment and Civil Commitment.) 5. </li>
    <li>There are a wide variety of legislative approaches to
        treatment and many different routes. </li>
</ol>

<p> Among the problems raised are: 1. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The different objectives (sometimes conflicting) of
        health professionals and legal practitioners, when
        diversion for treatment is involved. 2. </li>
    <li>The clear need for evaluation programs and for planning
        for these when the program is established. The importance
        is stressed of evaluating treatment programs in terms of
        the objectives stated in the legislation. It is important
        to establish realistic and concrete objectives for
        treatment in addition to the overriding goal of reducing
        morbidity and mortality. 3. </li>
    <li>With regard to compulsory treatment, it is acknowledged
        that it is in conflict with individual liberty and
        freedom of decision, and it is emphasised that the
        legislation should lay down the conditions governing
        participation in voluntary treatment programs, e.g.
        should the 'voluntary' status be ended if the client is
        not cooperating? 4. </li>
    <li>On occasions there may be legislation that is not used or
        does not work because of lack of suitable treatment
        facilities and resources. </li>
</ol>

<p> Drug diversion schemes of various types operate in overseas
countries. In France, for example, an offender who complies with
a court-determined treatment order is not liable to prosecution;
in Germany, a period of treatment can be credited against a
custodial sentence; in Massachusetts, a court-appointed diversion
scheme operates to stay court proceedings ([41]Porter 1986,
p171). In some countries, e.g. France and Italy, a person
voluntarily undergoing treatment, on completion is issued with a
certificate as evidence to protect against subsequent prosecution
for offences committed prior to treatment ([42]Leroy 1991). Of
the 51 jurisdictions surveyed by the WHO, 22 diverted persons for
treatment at one or more of these stages in the criminal justice
process: (a) instead of arrest; (b) after arrest, pending trial;
(c) after trial in lieu of imprisonment (e.g. suspended
sentence); and (d) correction with imprisonment (e.g. during
confinement or as a condition of parole) (Porter, Arif &amp;
Curran 1986, p57). </p>

<p> A major issue for legislators is whether such diversion
should be mandatory. If diversion is mandatory prior to or
instead of trial, this amounts to decriminalisation of the
offending behaviour.17 In Sweden, which allows for compulsory
commitment, there is now legislation in place criminalising drug
use and widening the powers of the authorities to take adult
alcohol and drug-dependent people into care. Sweden is a country
with a strong temperance tradition which has led to 'an obsession
with substance misuse generally'. Faced with the problem of AIDS
and with economic difficulties, a 'new moralism' has developed in
this country leading to these harsher drug measures (Gould 1989,
p731). </p>

<p> Another approach to the handling of cannabis offenders is
that taken in the United Kingdom, where more than half of the
police constabulary areas have allowed police officers to take
note of drug users found in possession of quantities of drugs
consistent with personal use. Police then have the option not to
proceed with a legal charge unless the individual has been
cautioned on more than two occasions previously ([43]Wodak 1993).
</p>

<p> A recent example of a pre-court initiative involving an
attempt to bring drug users into contact with treatment is the
'Southwark Arrest Referral Pilot Program', funded by the British
Home Office Local Drug Prevention Team. This three-year pilot
program, commenced in March 1991, is being carried out to
establish the effectiveness of arrest as an intervention for drug
users wanting help. Police provide arrestees with information on
local drug referral agencies and cards are sent to all charged
offenders. Also, drug workers are on call to visit the relevant
police stations. Though referrals were not numerous, most of
those participating in referral programs reported reduced drug
use in the following 12-month period. </p>

<p> The flaw in the program to date is the lack of effort and
encouragement on the part of the police. However, it reflects an
attempt to bring into a closer working relationship police and
local welfare agencies in a harm reduction effort rather than
simply to exercise law enforcement against drug users
([44]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993, p12). Although the British
Criminal Justice Act was proclaimed in 1991 with specific
sections relating to the treatment of drug and alcohol dependent
offenders (Criminal Justice Act 1991, s69, schedule 1, cited in
Walters and Coventry 1993, p11) and allowing for referral and
assessment procedures as components of non-custodial orders, it
does not establish diversionary programs for drug offenders. </p>

<h3>Compulsory treatment for drug users </h3>

<p> <b>CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM-INITIATED DRUG TREATMENT AND CIVIL
COMMITMENT </b> </p>

<p> A number of literature reviews have concluded that treatment
can effectively reduce drug use as well as the criminal activity
which often accompanies it ([45]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990; Gerstein
1990; Office of Technology Assessment 1990 in Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p244). There is also increasing evidence that those coerced
into treatment by way of the criminal justice system achieve the
same success as those entering voluntarily (Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p244). </p>

<p> The issue for makers of social policy is how to increase the
number entering treatment, since 'the nature of drug use,
especially at abusive and addictive levels, often inhibits or
precludes self-motivation in the user toward voluntarily seeking
treatment' (Anglin &amp; Hser 1991, p247). </p>

<p> Many would say that 'when offenders, such as arrestees,
probationers, inmates or parolees, are identified as substance
abusers by the criminal justice system, remanding to treatment is
a necessary and logical action ... One of the most successful of
coercive efforts has been civil commitment' (Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p247; see also discussion below of countries which employ
civil commitment). Carney, in his Drug Users and the Law in
Australia (1987), points out that, in Australia, civil commitment
policies for drug-dependent people date back to the 19th century,
and were based on the early view of drug use as a 'disease' for
which in-patient therapy should be compulsory (1987, p1). </p>

<p> As early as 1867, Victoria copied Scotland's move to amend
its lunacy laws to allow inebriates to be admitted to 'lunatic
asylums', and in 1872 passed the Victorian Inebriates Act, which
was the first comprehensive Inebriates Act to be enacted outside
America. The other Australian States followed, with legislation
in Tasmania in 1873, in South Australia in 1874, in Queensland in
1898, in New South Wales in 1900 and in Western Australia in 1903
(1987, p3). Much of the Australian State legislation has survived
to the present time. When Queensland was debating its legislation
in 1896, the subject of drugs other than alcohol, i.e. 'opium,
chloral and other drugs', came up for the first time (1987, p13).
Legislation providing for voluntary or compulsory civil admission
to treatment facilities of alcohol or drug-dependent people is in
force in most of the major Australian jurisdictions - but is not
much utilised. Carney (1987, pp52-53) outlines four approaches to
the regulation of entry to civil treatment schemes for dependent
drug users - the fourth 'applies the classic justifications for
the enactment of criminal law, namely that the actions of the
prospective patient constitutes an intolerable degree of harm to
other members of the community. Judicial commitment of offenders,
and some third party proceedings initiated by police officers,
fit this model' (1987, p53). </p>

<p> Moving to the United States, the origins of 'civil
commitment' for opiate-dependent (and also alcohol-dependent)
people date back to the second half of the 19th century when some
of the laws enacted to provide for the civil commitment of the
mentally ill also permitted civil commitment of people dependent
on narcotics ([46]Rosenthal 1988). In the United States civil
commitment generally takes the form, described by [47]Brown
(1988, p664), of the direct remanding of the individual to the
health care system in which civil procedures alone are brought
into play ... This administrative/judicial action need not
involve provision of legal counsel, the potential for judgment by
one's peers, access to witnesses for one's defense, etc. </p>

<p> With some exceptions (see Newman 1986, cited in [48]Brown
1988), diversion from the criminal justice system for drug
treatment seems to be acceptable to both health and criminal
justice authorities. However, in democratic countries, civil
commitment of the drug user conflicts with many people's views
regarding civil rights, the proper relationship of the individual
to the State and the use of the health care system for social
control. Regardless, legislation in a number of countries
provides for such civil commitment for drug use. [49]Porter et
al. (1986) point out that in 27 (comprising 32 separate
jurisdictions) of the countries they surveyed, there was
provision for civil commitment under certain conditions, as there
are in 35 American States. </p>

<p> It has been argued (Bejerot 1983 &amp; Webster 1986, cited in
Brown 1988) that such extreme measures to deal with drug use must
have wide public support. Generally the rationale for such action
is that drug use is a threat to the country's stability (as in
Singapore in the case of heroin dependence among young males) or
a threat to the country achieving its economic goals, e.g.
Malaysia, where the Government decided that the drug problem was
a threat to national security as the country was 'losing its
manpower to drugs' ([50]Rysavy 1990).18 </p>

<p> In 1983, due to an increasing heroin problem in Malaysia, the
powers of police and drug rehabilitation officers were extended,
allowing them to arrest and detain persons suspected of using
illegal substances. A positive urine sample resulted in mandatory
drug treatment. Ten per cent of those in treatment in 1989 were
undertaking rehabilitation for cannabis use only. All programs
were the same, lasting a maximum of two years with two years'
compulsory aftercare, an important part of which was the
assignment of a drug-free 'guardian' to act as a role model and
to provide positive support. Any infringement of rules during
treatment resulted in severe punishment, and any drug use after
release from treatment resulted in incarceration (Rysavy 1990).
Needless to say the program has a high success rate, but is
unlikely to fit other countries with cultures differing from that
of Malaysia. </p>

<p> Brown summarises the conditions that 'on the basis of other
societies' actions, have been described as necessary to the
implementation of civil commitment procedures: </p>

<ul>
    <li>there needs to be the appearance of risk to the larger
        society through the subgroup's (i.e. drug users')
        inappropriate behaviours; </li>
    <li>there needs to be the capacity to marshal public support
        for such action; </li>
    <li>there must be a capacity to identify and isolate the
        subgroup demonstrating the offending behaviour; </li>
    <li>the subgroup must be without sufficient political support
        to withstand the competing political pressure; </li>
    <li>there must be the machinery to process, detain and
        confine those whose behaviour is inappropriate or
        threatening; and </li>
    <li>there should be a belief in the ability of the community
        to put in place initiatives that will humanely change
        individuals' behaviour for their own and for the larger
        society's well-being ([51]Brown 1988, p676). </li>
</ul>

<p> Brown goes on to say that it is likely that jurisdictions
will retain the option to call upon civil commitment in the event
of a situation arising which has the capacity to 'disrupt the
normal course of society and for which criminal prosecution may
be seen as either inappropriate, unwarranted or infeasible'. At
the same time, only with the greatest conservatism will civil
commitment be likely to be employed, due to a general distaste
for such emergency measures ([52]Brown 1988). The contribution to
the spread of AIDS of intravenous drug use, and its repercussions
for individual drug users and the wider society, is potentially
one such situation. </p>

<p> Throughout the wide variety of countries providing for civil
commitment for drug use, there have been few studies of the
efficacy of such treatment ([53]Brown 1988). However, some
studies have been produced by the US and these are discussed
below. Generally, in the majority of countries, grounds for
commitment are provided either in mental health legislation or
specific drug legislation. Countries using mental health
legislation usually include provision for commitment for threats
both to others and to self. Germany, Japan and Somalia, for
example, provide for civil commitment if the drug-related
disorder 'constitutes an imminent threat to public safety, or
when individuals pose a danger to their own life and health'
([54]Brown 1988, p666). Bangladesh, on the other hand, specifies
only the existence of psychiatric disturbance without elaboration
of threat, and Trinidad and Tobago emphasise the individual's
inability to provide for himself (Brown 1988). Fifteen out of 43
countries surveyed by [55]Porter et al (1986) provide for civil
commitment under legislation specific to drug use, where the
criteria may be limited to evidence of dependence (as in Mexico,
Columbia, Peru, Thailand and Malaysia). Some (i.e. Argentina,
Italy, Australia and Sweden) also include reference to the threat
posed to others and/or to the need for treatment. In Victoria
(Australia) under the Alcoholics and Drug Dependent Persons Act
of 18 December 1968, an alcohol- or drug-dependent person
'suitable for treatment' (i.e. 'who habitually uses drugs of
addiction to such an extent that he has lost the power of
self-control with respect to the use of drugs of addiction'
(Porter et al 1986, p126), may be committed for seven days and,
at the discretion of the medical officer in charge of the
assessment centre (the decision-making authority), for another
seven days. </p>

<p> A consensus statement issued by the participants at a meeting
in the US to examine research findings relating to civil
commitment and mandatory treatment, particularly in relation to
hindering the spread of AIDS, found that 'treatment is effective
in reducing intravenous drug abuse and that the length of time in
treatment is positively related to treatment success, the
criminal justice system is important for identification and
retention of drug abusers in treatment' ([56]Leukefeld &amp; Tims
1988). It was further recommended at this meeting that 'the term
&quot;compulsory treatment&quot; be used rather than &quot;civil
commitment&quot; to capture a wider range of possible
interventions, since civil commitment is only one type of
compulsory treatment. Further, it is essential that candidates
for compulsory treatment receive appropriate legal protections.'
In the US, despite interest in the early 1970s due to 'high rates
of recidivism and criminal justice system over-crowding and the
shift away from a rehabilitative philosophy in corrections,
programs for drug-abusing offenders have languished in the 1980s
until fairly recently' ([57]Anglin and Hser 1990, p424). </p>

<p> However, the 1960s saw the beginning of civil commitment for
drug-abusing offenders in some States of the US. These were based
on the therapeutic community philosophy. There are few
evaluations of treatment for offenders except for these civil
commitment programs, and such programs as have been developed are
so recent that they have not been evaluated. </p>

<h4>CIVIL COMMITMENT IN THE US </h4>

<p> Compulsory treatment of drug users has been a controversial
issue worldwide for decades. In response to two forces, one aimed
at more effective treatment of problem drug users and the other
at social control of the problem user, civil commitment
legislation was enacted in the US in the 1960s and 1970s
([58]Rosenthal 1988). </p>

<p> Following this, three major treatment programs were
established: the California Civil Addict Program, the New York
Civil Commitment Program and programs under the federal Narcotic
Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA) ([59]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990,
p425), enabling large-scale commitment of drug-dependent people.
However, relatively few persons were committed under the
Massachusetts law, one of the earliest in the country, and
despite civil commitment laws in many other jurisdictions they
remained only statutes on the books (Rosenthal 1988). </p>

<p> Since involuntary civil commitment involves a substantial
deprivation of liberty, various aspects of the California and New
York programs were challenged quite early - the federal program
for involuntary civil commitment of drug users not charged with a
crime was not challenged in this way, presumably because the
federal program permitted only relatives to initiate commitment,
and few relatives did. Despite challenges to the
constitutionality of involuntary treatment, the Californian and
New York courts held in its favour. They were, however,
influenced by the Supreme Court case of Robinson v. California
which did not really involve the constitutionality of involuntary
commitment at all but rather the question of whether it was
constitutional for a State to make 'addiction' a crime:
'Nevertheless, the Supreme Court declared (in a dictum) that a
State might establish a program of compulsory treatment for
opiate addicts either to discourage violation of its criminal
laws against narcotic trafficking or to safeguard the general
health or welfare of its inhabitants' ([60]Rosenthal 1988, p641).
</p>

<p> It has been suggested that because this case did not involve
the constitutionality of involuntary treatment of opiate users,
the Supreme Court did not go into that question as deeply as it
might have and, in turn, the California and New York courts
relied too much on the Supreme Court dictum without delving
deeply enough into the question. The Supreme Court decision
therefore meant almost inevitably that in future cases the
substantive validity of involuntary civil commitment would be
upheld (Rosenthal 1988, p643). </p>

<p> Under the legislation discussed here anyone found in a
medical examination to be dependent on drugs (usually heroin)
could be committed. Mostly those committed had been arrested for
property crimes or drug trafficking and were diverted from the
usual criminal processing. Usually there were two phases of
treatment, initially one of imprisonment, plus a period of parole
or monitored community release. During both phases the goal was
reduced drug use and criminal behaviour; vocational training was
sometimes added. </p>

<p> The California Civil Addict Program was more successful than
the New York State program, primarily due to better management.
The main results of evaluations were that program participants
reduced 'narcotic use and associated property crime' to one-third
compared with those not in the program ([61]Lindblad 1988).
Overall, studies of the California CAP concluded that civil
commitment and other drug treatment programs, particularly
methadone maintenance, were effective in reducing narcotics
dependence and minimising the associated adverse social effects,
the important issue being that the dependence should be brought
into an environment where intervention can occur over time. </p>

<p> In this respect, civil commitment and other legally coercive
measures were found to be useful where the dependent person would
not enter treatment voluntarily ([62]Anglin 1988a). A vital issue
is the implementation strategy employed, which can 'ensure or
sabotage success' (Anglin 1988a, p539). Although NARA was a
comparatively short-lived program superseded by other
legislation, it provided a national network of treatment
providers and was regarded as an effective way of bringing
narcotic dependent people into treatment. NARA allowed treatment
for offenders as a pre-trial civil commitment, rather than
prosecution for drug-dependent people convicted of a specific
crime and for voluntary applicants. Those admitted to the program
did as well or better than those in other programs (Lindblad
1988). </p>

<h4>TASC PROGRAMS IN THE US </h4>

<p> More recently in the US, coordinated programs have been
developed in a number of States to refer 'drug-abusing offenders
to community-based treatment in lieu of prosecution or probation
revocation', e.g. the Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime
(TASC) program ([63]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p428), begun in 1972
and by 1988 operating in 18 States (Cook et al. 1988 in Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p428). This provides community-based treatment
for drug-dependent offenders who 'otherwise might become
progressively more involved with the criminal justice system'
(p428). Diversionary dispositions such as deferred prosecution,
creative community sentencing, and pretrial intervention are used
to motivate offenders to enter and remain in treatment.
Evaluation Such limited evaluation as has taken place (through
the Treatment Outcomes Prospective Study) indicates that criminal
justice referred clients, because they were monitored, tended to
stay in treatment longer than voluntary clients, which is usually
associated with more successful treatment outcomes ([64]Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p429). </p>

<p> Although evaluations of treatment are positive, it remains a
question as to whether improvements would have occurred over time
anyway due to maturation or other outside influences. In terms of
client characteristics and treatment effectiveness, it was found
that 'addicts who have a more stable family background, an intact
marriage, a job, a history of minimal criminality, less evidence
of alcohol or polydrug abuse, and less severe psychiatric
disorders are more likely to achieve a better outcome in most
programs' (Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p429). </p>

<p> Many studies have shown that, while older clients, mostly
opiate users, tend to stay in treatment longer and therefore
benefit most (possibly due to the 'maturing out' effect noted by
Winick (1962 in Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p435), those under 25
tend to leave treatment prematurely, thus limiting their
prospects for effective results. In terms of program factors
which appeared to be most beneficial, the significant ones were:
psychotherapy, urine testing, and legal coercion. 'Clients
referred from the criminal justice system have been shown to stay
in treatment longer than other clients' (Collins et al., cited in
[65]Leukefeld &amp; Timms 1988, p57) and longer retention
suggests better treatment outcomes than with other clients (but
see above). </p>

<p> Some argue that treatment cannot be effective if the client
is coerced, and the findings are not consistent on this issue.
However, the best-designed studies 'generally support the
proposition that a collaborative relationship between the
criminal justice system and community-treatment delivery systems
produces, at an aggregate level, enhanced treatment outcomes'
([66]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p439). While length of retention in
treatment is an important predictor of success it appears that
'for many drug abusers, repeated exposure to treatment is more
effective than one episode' (McLellan &amp; Druley 1977 in Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p441). </p>

<p> Total time in treatment may be more important, when accrued
across treatment episodes, than retention in a single program
(p441). In a number of other countries, any illegal drug use
including that of cannabis is sufficient grounds for recommending
or ordering treatment, implying that some other countries regard
cannabis use more seriously than Australia does, and deserving of
treatment. The mode of treatment depends on the profile of the
individual user and on such factors as are mentioned elsewhere in
this report, e.g. whether the person is a polydrug user, length
of time of use, degree of psychopathology and so forth.
Outpatient non-methadone programs which involve clients with all
types of drug use who tend not to have serious criminal
histories, are the most obvious option for treatment of cannabis
dependence. Therapeutic communities are not necessarily specific
to any class of drug and could also therefore potentially be of
benefit to certain cannabis-dependent persons. </p>

<p> Since the numbers of cannabis users who have problems is
still small and very few are likely to be seriously enough
dependent to be referred by the court, it is unlikely that
treatment facilities could not incorporate them. </p>

<h2>Summary of findings </h2>

<p> A summary of findings from Australian and international
literature concerned with diversion and treatment for drug
offenders suggests the following conclusions with relation to
cannabis users: </p>

<ul>
    <li>While the vast majority of cannabis users do not report
        any problems, there are increasing reports of individuals
        both in Australia and in other countries (e.g. the United
        States and New Zealand) who are seeking treatment for
        cannabis dependence. </li>
    <li>It is generally accepted that a prison sentence is
        unsatisfactory for offenders with drug problems, and
        diversion with the purpose of treatment is a widely used
        alternative, welcomed by judges and magistrates. Usually
        the illegal drug involved is heroin but occasionally
        cannabis is the offender's primary drug. </li>
    <li>Criminal justice involvement is seen as providing an
        opportunity to intervene in drug users' lives in order to
        confront the users with their drug problems and to bring
        them into contact with treatment agencies, often for the
        first time. </li>
    <li>The earlier the intervention in the users' lives the
        better, and the longer (or more frequent) the periods of
        treatment, the more successful the treatment outcome. </li>
    <li>In some cases merely attending for assessment is
        sufficient to bring about a change in attitude since the
        users are often confronted with their drug problem for
        the first time. </li>
    <li>While some dispute the value of coercion in getting drug
        users into treatment, it is often the only way, and there
        is more evidence to indicate successful treatment results
        for involuntary than for voluntary clients. This is
        primarily due to the length of time spent in treatment.
        Frequently the attitude of an unwilling client will
        change quite quickly once treatment has begun. </li>
    <li>The success of diversion to treatment programs depends on
        the skill and experience of the drug counsellor, the
        availability of sufficient places in suitable treatment
        facilities, and close cooperation between health and
        criminal justice agencies. </li>
    <li>It would be more cost effective to provide additional
        funds for the training of counsellors and the provision
        of suitable facilities than to continue to send repeat
        drug offenders to prison. </li>
    <li>Conclusions regarding treatment for cannabis offenders,
        particularly repeat offenders, are as follows: </li>
    <li>There are reports from most diversion programs/treatment
        agencies of individuals being referred for other drug use
        who also have serious problems in reducing or ceasing
        their cannabis use. Some of these may also be
        alcohol-dependent. There appears then to be some demand
        for cannabis treatment in this country. </li>
    <li>Interpreting treatment in its broadest and most ideal
        sense (i.e. as a program personally selected by the
        client in consultation with a counsellor, tailored to the
        needs and characteristics of the particular individual),
        for a repeat offender facing a prison sentence, treatment
        is a preferable alternative. Treatment appears to have
        the potential to help offenders restructure their lives
        in such a way as to avoid breaches of the law which bring
        them continually into contact with the criminal justice
        system. In the sense that treatment may be 'compulsory'
        (i.e. court mandated), while the client must be assessed
        as suitable for treatment (genuinely motivated to
        participate, although there may be some initial
        resistance), the advantage of the compulsory nature of
        the treatment is that it provides the 'crisis' generally
        acknowledged as necessary to get most drug users into
        treatment and to keep them there long enough for a
        successful outcome. In the case of cannabis use, the
        earlier the intervention the better, since there is
        likely to be less criminal involvement and therefore more
        likelihood of a successful outcome for the client. Young
        users, particularly juveniles, should receive more
        attention than they appear to be getting at present in
        Australia from, for instance, juvenile 'panels' (such as
        those in South Australia) for whom this is not a major
        focus. </li>
    <li>A final consideration regarding the treatment option for
        cannabis users is the availability of treatment programs
        and facilities and counsellors of sufficient quality and
        in sufficient numbers to accommodate those referred from
        the court system, since this is vital for successful
        treatment outcomes. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> In this chapter we have discussed the two related fields of
diversion and treatment for drug offenders. We believe that few
people would disagree with the wisdom of diversion from the
criminal justice system for minor cannabis offenders. Further,
though some would object that treatment of drug offenders is a
form of social control and that the concept of the 'need for
treatment' has no inherent limitation, the evidence suggests
that, although methodological problems exist in the evaluation of
treatment programs, most of the programs outlined here have
achieved a certain level of success in terms of meeting their
objectives - which generally means, in the Australian context,
reducing the drug use, and associated involvement with the
criminal justice system, of the individual undergoing treatment. </p>

<p> Disagreement arises regarding the degree of intervention
which should be exercised by the criminal justice system, as an
agent of the State, in coercing drug offenders into treatment -
in its most extreme form, through civil commitment. While the
United States, for example, indicates considerable support for
civil commitment, in Australia, although commitment exists as a
legislative option, there has been reluctance to use it. This
decision with respect to the balance between protecting society
and infringing the rights of individuals is a matter for the
particular society involved and the prevailing mores at the time.

<h1>Chapter 6: EVALUATING NEW LEGISLATIVE APPROACHES TO CANNABIS </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The principle of evaluating new policy and legislation is
widely accepted, but is less frequently observed in practice. In
Australia and most Western nations, little has been done,
especially by government agencies, to monitor and evaluate, in a
systematic manner, their national drug policies. This is the case
in instances where legislation has developed incrementally (as in
most of Australia's States and Territories) and where new
approaches have been implemented following detailed policy
reviews (e.g. the Australian Capital Territory's cannabis
expiation notice initiative). Too often evaluation is considered
relevant only after a policy has been in place for some time and
changes are being considered. </p>

<p> To be of most value, new initiatives should be designed and
implemented with an explicit and adequately resourced monitoring
and evaluation component built into the initiative from the
outset. In the context of evaluating new legislative approaches
to cannabis, we suggest that policy evaluation and program
evaluation be considered separately. The bulk of this paper has
addressed the evaluation of policies, as reflected through
legislative options. The details of evaluating the implementation
of policies, focusing on the programs themselves, are matters
which need to be addressed after the broad policy issues are
settled and particular new approaches are agreed upon. </p>

<p> We provide below an overview of the steps involved in both
evaluative tasks. The National Drug Strategic Plan 1993-97
(Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy 1993) provides the
framework within which we base our recommendations relating to
monitoring and evaluation. The Plan is explicitly goal-attainment
focused, the approach that we argued for in [1]<a
href="can_ch2.html">Chapter 2</a>, where we highlighted the
importance of clarity in the specification of the goals of drug
policy, legislation and program implementation. The Plan provides
an overarching goal (or 'mission') for Australian drug policy:
'The overall mission of the National Drug Strategy is to minimise
the harmful effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society'
(MCDS 1993, p6). </p>

<p> Policies and programs in specific areas, including cannabis,
should be evaluated in a manner consistent with this national
goal. Applying goal attainment models of evaluation is a more
complex task than it sometimes seems to be initially. Substantial
technical difficulties exist in both designing and conducting
evaluation research; part of this is the often complex task of
identifying policy and program goals. </p>

<p> Our discussion in [2]<a href="can_ch2.html">Chapter 2</a>
referred to the fact that, in practice, a particular cannabis
policy can relate to goals which are inconsistent: the attainment
of one may militate against the attainment of another. Needs
change over time; often policy and legislation are far behind.
For a given policy, it is likely that a hierarchy of goals will
exist: the mission statement of the National Drug Strategic Plan
is an overarching goal, one which must be articulated in terms
which encompass other goals such as those concerned specifically
with cannabis. Policy evaluation and decision-making </p>

<p> In [3]<a href="can_ch4.html">Chapter 4</a> we outlined five
broad policy and legislative options for cannabis in Australia.
The approach taken there is a contribution to policy evaluation
in this area, and, by extension, a contribution to
decision-making. But how are decisions about drug policy to be
made? </p>

<p> One approach is the making of ad hoc decisions. This must be
rejected in favour of more systematic policy choice models. The
literature differentiates two groups of decision-making models
for use by governments: 'rational' and 'incremental' approaches
(see, e.g. Corbett 1992, pp59-76; Davis et al.1993, pp157-81).
The rational approach, illustrated below, is something of an
ideal. It is not always easy to implement in practice, but the
alternative (making decisions incrementally without ever
reconsidering the overall needs and patterns of policy responses)
is much less attractive. Applying a rational approach to
decision-making in evaluating new legislative approaches to
cannabis use (as different from evaluating the actual
implementation of new legislation and resulting programs), we
suggest that the following issues be taken into account: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The need to examine the sources of the proposal and the
        context within which it has been presented. </li>
    <li>The need to clarify just why that approach (rather than a
        different one) is proposed. </li>
    <li>The need to identify the goals which the new approach, if
        implemented, would attain. The philosophical and
        pragmatic goals should both be specified. Multiple goals
        may be identified and inconsistencies between them made
        explicit. </li>
    <li>The need to assess the likely impacts on key
        stakeholders, if the approach were to be implemented. For
        each key stakeholder, assess the likely costs and
        benefits, both intended and unintended. </li>
    <li>The need to review the depth, breadth, relevance and
        quality of the data currently available to assist the
        evaluation of the proposed approach. Determine whether or
        not it is, in fact, feasible to reach a conclusion on the
        value of the proposed policy, given the availability of
        data to answer questions about the proposal's likely
        outcomes and impacts. </li>
    <li>The need to make judgments regarding: (a) the value of
        the goal or goals; (b) how achievable the goals are; and
        (c) if the goals are judged to be achievable, how
        effective, efficient and appropriate are the
        implementation programs. </li>
</ol>

<p> This systematic approach to policy evaluation is not often
seen in the development of drugs policy. Nevertheless, in the
area of legislative options for cannabis in Australia, policy
makers have the capacity to apply such a process. This should be
undertaken as part of the National Drug Strategic Plan's project
to develop a national statement on cannabis, one which includes a
contemporary perspective on the most appropriate legislative
option or options for cannabis. Program evaluation It is beyond
the scope of this report to present details on the techniques of
program evaluation. These are to be found in standard textbooks
(Brinkerhoff et al. 1983; Hawe et al. 1991; Guba &amp; Lincoln
1989; Morris 1987; Patton 1990; Rossi &amp; Freeman 1989). </p>

<p> One point to be made, however, is that the evaluation
research model and techniques employed should be selected on the
basis of answering a precisely defined evaluation question. If
the evaluation question is, for example, 'What has been the
impact on policing of a new legislative approach to cannabis',
quite different evaluation techniques will be used from a
situation where the evaluation question is 'How cost-effective
has the new approach been', or 'How relevant is current
legislation to contemporary needs?'. No single approach covers
all circumstances. </p>

<p> Again, the National Drug Strategic Plan emphasises the
importance of monitoring and evaluation. Under the heading
'Policy Approach', it states: The National Drug Strategic Plan
explicitly identifies policy objectives and indicators to enable
the effectiveness of the program to be evaluated. The National
Drug Strategic Plan is committed to the application of
needs-based planning and evaluation activities to ensure the
effectiveness and efficiency of strategies employed to minimise
drug-related harm (MCDS 1993, p5). We commend those responsible
for this emphasis, but note that this policy cannot be
implemented without the allocation of a significant level of
resources. The oft-stated policy that evaluation should be an
integral part of all drug-related programs can only be realised
if program budgets include sufficient funds to cover the design
and conduct of monitoring and evaluation, and if reporting time
frames are appropriate to the evaluation model being employed.
Indicators A related strength of the National Drug Strategic Plan
which is highly relevant to the present review is its focus on
indicators of program implementation, short-term outcomes and
longer-term and broader impacts. The indicators selected for this
purpose will depend on the particular initiative being evaluated;
accordingly, they cannot be comprehensively described here.
Within Australia, the work of Sarre, Sutton and Pulsford (1989)
and of Christie (1991) in evaluating the South Australian
cannabis expiation notice scheme, and of the Queensland Criminal
Justice Commission's Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs (1993)
are examples of the effective use of indicators in the monitoring
and evaluation of cannabis legislation. Single's (1989) review of
the USA experience of marijuana 'decriminalisation' demonstrates
the dearth of information available in that country to evaluate
the legislative changes initiated over the last 20 years.
Elsewhere in this paper we have referred to such evaluation data
as are available relating to other nations. Without seeking to be
exhaustive, we list here some examples of indicators which are
significant inputs to policy and program evaluation relating to
new legislative initiatives concerned with cannabis: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The impact on social justice in Australian society of the
        implementation of cannabis legislation. </li>
    <li>Costs of cannabis controls, including the transfer of
        resources. </li>
    <li>The effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of
        policies and legislation. </li>
    <li>Public opinion concerning cannabis. </li>
    <li>Cannabis consumption patterns and levels. </li>
    <li>Numbers and characteristics of the people presenting to
        treatment agencies with cannabis-related health and
        social problems. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related offences. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related driving and motor vehicle crashes. </li>
    <li>THC levels of the cannabis available to consumers. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related workplace accidents. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> In this section we have discussed the evaluation of new
legislative approaches to cannabis use in Australia. We have
differentiated between policy evaluation and program evaluation,
and have pointed to the need to develop indicators, tied to
specific initiatives, of activities, outcomes and impacts.
Undertaking high quality, systematic policy evaluation concerning
cannabis is essential and this paper contributes to that process.
Research aimed at developing evaluation techniques and program
indicators will be needed as part of the development and
implementation of new legislative approaches in this area. </p>

<h1>Chapter 7. Conclusion </h1>

<h1><img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</h1>

<p> This paper has addressed the legislative options available
for cannabis in Australia, and has argued that choosing from
among these options requires a process of policy evaluation.
Accordingly, the paper first considered the policy frameworks
within which decision-making occurs, emphasising the necessity
for clarity in the goals that society seeks to attain through
legislating in this area. </p>

<p> The paper places contemporary Australian cannabis legislation
within its broader context: historical and international. Despite
the work of numerous Royal Commissions and other official
inquiries, much of Australia's legislation concerning cannabis
reflects the dynamics of earlier times, when Australia tended to
mimic other nations' policies without taking sufficient account
of local circumstances. Our framework of legislative prohibition
was put in place at a time when there was virtually no cannabis
use in Australia. In the 1990s, when over four million
Australians report having used the drug and nearly half of them
report having done so during the last year, most jurisdictions
maintain total prohibition as their legislative stance, even
though only a tiny proportion of the offenders against their
legislation will ever be prosecuted. </p>

<p> We have reviewed the range of legislative options available,
classifying them as: total prohibition; prohibition combined with
a civil penalty for personal use, etc; partial prohibition
whereby personal use, etc., is not an offence, but trafficking
and large-scale growing of cannabis remains prohibited; the legal
availability of cannabis under various forms of regulation; and,
finally, the option of unregulated, free availability. Each of
these options is reviewed in terms of its rationale, experiences
with it to date and its impacts. </p>

<p> The related topics of the diversion from the criminal justice
system of people who come to the attention of the police for
cannabis offences, and the compulsory treatment of cannabis
users, have also been discussed. Experience to date suggests that
well-resourced and managed diversionary programs can be
effective, and desirable, alternatives to imprisonment for some
offenders. Very few cannabis users will need treatment, as
conceived of through a medical model, simply because of their
cannabis use. Many users can benefit, however, from a helping
intervention, the success of which may be potentiated by the
crisis of a 'bust' for cannabis use or related offences. </p>

<p> Cannabis is used mainly as a recreational drug and this
pattern of use has been the focus of this paper. For
completeness, we have included in the appendixes information on
the medical and industrial/agricultural uses of the cannabis
plant and its by-products. In doing so, we remind readers that,
in drug policies, we are not faced with 'all-or-nothing' choices.
Within the range of available policy options lies the possibility
of prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis while permitting
its use for other purposes. (This occurs, of course, with
opiates: the opium poppy is grown in Tasmania to provide raw
material for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.) </p>

<p> Australia's National Drug Strategy provides a policy
framework within which new legislative approaches may be
developed. Both existing and new approaches have the possibility
of both enhancing and detracting from the achievement of the
mission of the National Drug Strategy, that of minimising the
harmful effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society. Our
review of the policy options, set out in <a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter
4</a>, demonstrates this. </p>

<p> No single 'best option' for cannabis legislation exists. What
is most appropriate will depend upon what goals both policy
makers and the community are seeking to achieve. It is not the
role of researchers to dictate policy goals; rather we have drawn
attention to their importance, outlined an approach to evaluating
them and described the likely outcomes, in terms of policy goals,
of the five broad categories of legislative options which are
available now. </p>

<p> Our review suggests that two of the five legislative options
discussed in <a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4</a> are
inappropriate in contemporary Australian circumstances. They are
the options which we have characterised as 'total prohibition'
and 'free availability'. The arguments for rejecting these
options will not be repeated here as they are detailed in <a
href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4</a>. </p>

<p> We point out, however, that the cultivation, possession and
supply of cannabis remain an offence in all Australian States and
Territories (and using it is an offence in most), even though
cannabis use is commonplace and little evidence exists that
cannabis itself causes significant harm when used in small
quantities. Australian society experiences more harm, we
conclude, from maintaining the prohibition policy than it
experiences from the use of the drug. </p>

<p> Widespread interest exists in the Dutch approach to drug
policies. We have categorised them, in this paper, under the
heading of total prohibition, as that is the Dutch legislative
position. However, as detailed above, the application of the
principle that it is, in their terms, 'inexpedient' to prosecute
people for minor drug offences (including selling cannabis in
certain coffee shops) means that Dutch policy and practice (as
contrasted to legislation) is closer to the regulatory option
than the total prohibition option. The regulatory option is one
of the approaches which we suggest is more appropriate to
Australian circumstances than is total prohibition. </p>

<p> It could be argued that the Dutch approach is a product of a
different culture and system of administration of criminal
justice. If the Australian States and Territories resolve not to
arrest and proceed against people using, possessing or supplying
cannabis, by far the best approach is for this policy to be
implemented through legislation, rather than through an
administrative decision not to prosecute cannabis offenders. This
is because the Australian system of legal justice is based upon
the principle of legal clarity and consistency in the
implementation of the law. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the reality is that, for a variety of reasons,
Australian governments may well prefer to implement the Dutch
approach. A number of precedents exist whereby, especially in
areas of moral contention, certain illegal activities, as a
matter of policy, are excluded from the purview of the criminal
justice authorities. In the Australian Capital Territory, for
example, we understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions
publicly announced that he would not conduct any prosecutions in
the area of prostitution. Abortion and certain types of gambling
(e.g. playing two-up on ANZAC Day) are or were similarly dealt
with. Police general orders frequently remind officers of the
desirability of exercising their discretion not to arrest or
summons a person found committing only a minor offence. Warnings,
formal cautions and referral to other agencies are encouraged
despite the existence of legislation prohibiting the behaviour
involved. </p>

<p> We suggest, then, that if governments agree that total
prohibition is not the most desirable approach, but are unwilling
or unable to legislate to enable a more preferable option to be
implemented, then the Dutch approach is a desirable alternative.
It would entail the government, the State/Territory Director of
Public Prosecutions, or another appropriate authority declaring
that, as from a certain date, no person would be prosecuted
before the courts for specified (minor) cannabis offences. We
suggest that this is a legitimate, but not optimal, pragmatic
option currently available to Australian governments. </p>

<p> We also reject the legislative option found at the opposite
end of the continuum from total prohibition, the totally
unregulated, free availability of cannabis. Our society is one
which accepts that governments and others have both the right and
the responsibility to intervene in diverse ways to protect people
from harm and to advance the common good. It would be
unreasonable, we suggest, to argue that cannabis should be
available in an uncontrolled manner: issues of quality control,
protection of the young, road safety, etc., demand at least some
degree of control over the drug's availability. </p>

<p> We conclude, then, that cannabis law reform is required in
this country. Numerous options for policy, legislation and
implementation processes exist within the broad categories of
prohibition with civil penalties, partial prohibition and
relatively free but regulated availability. We believe, on the
basis of the available evidence, that widely acceptable social
goals, well attuned to the needs of contemporary Australian
society, will be attained through the adoption and implementation
of policies which lie within these options. </p>

<p><b>APPENDIX 1. </b></p>

<h1>THE MEDICINAL USE OF CANNABIS (19) </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The medicinal use of cannabis in the ancient world has been
well documented (Abel 1980). In the United States, cannabis was
first mentioned as a medicinal drug in 1843 and by 1852 it was
included in the US dispensatory list of medicines. It was thought
to be beneficial in the treatment of 'neuralgia, gout, tetanus,
hydrophobia, cholera, convulsions, chorea, hysteria, depression
and insanity' (Wood &amp; Bache 1854, cited in [1]Abel 1980,
p182). In Australia, tincture of cannabis was used in medicine
until the 1960s, when it was declared a prohibited drug
([2]Cartwright 1983). </p>

<p>Since the introduction of legislation prohibiting the
recreational use of cannabis, its use for medicinal purposes has,
in most Western countries, not been popular. However, recently
the therapeutic benefits of cannabis have received close
attention in the United States. In 1991, Doblin and Kleiman
conducted an anonymous survey of the members of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology measuring the attitudes and
experiences of American oncologists concerning the use of
cannabis to treat nausea in cancer chemotherapy patients. They
found that, of those oncologists who replied to the survey (43
per cent), more than 44 per cent of them reported recommending
the illegal use of cannabis for the control of nausea to at least
one cancer patient. Some 48 per cent said that they would
prescribe cannabis to some of their patients if it were legal
([3]Doblin &amp; Kleiman 1991). </p>

<p>Cannabis has been used as an anti-emetic in the treatment of
AIDS patients and as a painkiller for those suffering from
chronic pain ([4]Grinspoon 1991). It has also been regarded by
some medical practitioners as being effective in reducing
intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma patients ([5]Caswell 1992) and
in treating epilepsy ([6]Cartwright 1983), Huntington's chorea
([7]Moss et al. 1989) and Parkinsonian tremor ([8]Frankel et al.
1990). </p>

<p>Despite the attention that the medical use of cannabis has
received in recent times, legislation in the United States does
not permit the medical use of marijuana. In the Federal
Controlled Substances Act, cannabis is categorised as a Schedule
1 drug, and as such is described as having a high potential for
abuse, no currently accepted medical use and no acceptable safe
level of use under medical supervision. </p>

<p>In 1989, organisations such as the (US) National Organization
for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), the Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics (ACT) as well as various individuals,20 applied to
have cannabis rescheduled so that it could be used for medical
purposes. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration rejected these claims and stated that: </p>

<p>It is clear that cannabis cannot meet the criteria ... for
safety under medical supervision. The chemistry of cannabis is
not known and reproducible. The record supports a finding that
marijuana plant material is variable from plant to plant. The
quantities of the active constituents, the cannabinoids, vary
considerably. In addition, the actions and potential risks of
several of the cannabinoids have not been studied ... (US
Government, Federal Register, vol. 54, no. 249, 29 December 1989,
p53,734). </p>

<p>This position has recently been restated by Robert C. Bonner,
a later Administrator of the US Drug Enforcement Agency, when he
responded to a subsequent petition lodged by NORML (US
Government, Federal Register, vol. 57, no. 59, 26 March 1992,
pp10,499-10,508). </p>

<p>Those in favour of rescheduling the drug argue that, for some,
the denial of cannabis as a medicine is particularly cruel.
Grinspoon argues that 'sick people are forced to suffer anxiety
about prosecution in addition to their anxiety about the illness
... Doctors are afraid to recommend what they know to be the best
treatment because they might lose their reputation or even their
licence' ([9]Grinspoon 1991). </p>

<p>The Australian medical community has not been as enthusiastic
about the therapeutic benefits of cannabis although many argue
that where the drug has been demonstrated to be effective its use
should be permitted. A study done at the Royal Children's
Hospital in Melbourne found that THC (the psychoactive ingredient
in cannabis) was an effective anti-emetic for some children
undergoing chemotherapy ([10]Cartwright 1983). Dr Lorna
Cartwright, a lecturer in Pharmacology at Sydney University
stated: </p>

<p>I think there are probably better drugs for medical uses. The
point is, though, I think it should be allowed to be used for
conditions in which it has been shown to have effect, such as for
glaucoma, for children having chemotherapy and for epilepsy. I
always feel that if something is good even for a small percentage
of patients, it should be allowed to be used (cited in
[11]Caswell 1992, p498). <br>
</p>

<p>Another pharmacologist, Dr Greg Chesher, argues that cannabis
clearly has therapeutic benefits but that research into the
possible uses of the drug is being hampered by the fact that
cannabis is a prohibited drug (cited in [12]Caswell 1992). The
position in Australia is different from that in the USA in that
in this country there is no legislation or binding administrative
ruling specifically stating that no medical use exists for
cannabis.21 Neither does the United Nations Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs, to which Australia is a party, specifically
forbid the medical use of cannabis. In fact the Convention
recognises that some otherwise illicit drugs may have medical
purposes and states that cannabis use should be 'subject to the
provisions of this Convention, to limit exclusively to medical
and scientific purposes the...use and possession of drugs'
(Article 4(1) (c)). Given that the United Nations Conventions do
not specifically proscribe the medical uses of cannabis,
introducing legislation that allowed the use of the drug for
medical purposes in Australia would be relatively simple. Clauses
authorising the therapeutic use of the drug could simply be
inserted into relevant drug legislation and therapeutic products
scheduling. Politically, however, such a change in policy could
be difficult. </p>

<p>As an illicit drug, cannabis has a negative image and is seen
as an being an inherently dependence producing, damaging drug
that has no possible benefits. Recognition of the medical
benefits of the drug may challenge this dominant view of
cannabis. </p>

<title>APPENDIX 2. INDUSTRIAL AND HORTICULTURAL USES OF CANNABIS </title>

<p> <b>APPENDIX 2. </b> </p>

<h1>INDUSTRIAL AND HORTICULTURAL USES OF CANNABIS </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Since ancient times the fibres from the cannabis or hemp
plant have been used to make fabric, rope and paper ([1]Abel
1980). In World War II, the USA grew 50,000 acres of hemp, as
part of their war effort ([2]see United States Government 1944,
Hemp for Victory), and hemp fibres were used to make rope for
ships and the canvas used in parachutes. </p>

<p> More recently, experimental crops of a low THC-content
species of cannabis have been grown in The Netherlands, Italy,
Spain, France and Tasmania. Its fibres have been used in the
production of paper and fabric. Australian groups such as the
Business Alliance for Commercial Hemp argue that Australia should
allow the cultivation of hemp for industrial purposes. The
position is that, if a State or Territory Government authorises
the growing of cannabis, the Commonwealth will issue a permit for
the importation of seeds, provided that the applicant for the
import permit meets the criteria set out in the Act, such as
being 'a fit and proper person'. </p>

<p> The trade magazine for the US paper industry recently argued
that hemp has a number of advantages over timber in the area of
paper production, and there are a number of strong environmental
arguments for the commercial cultivation of hemp. Every four
months, each acre of hemp grown will produce 10 tons of fibre. It
can produce four times the amount of paper per acre than
20-year-old trees can, it requires less bleaching than pulp from
timber and, because it is a very densely growing crop, weeds are
choked and there is less need for pesticides and herbicides
([3]Young 1991). In addition, hemp requires less watering and
pesticides than cotton and produces a fibre that is argued to be
more durable than cotton fabrics ([4]Cowperthwaite 1993). </p>

<p> The United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs allows
the cultivation of cannabis for industrial and horticultural
purposes. Article 28(2) states that 'this Convention should not
apply to the cultivation of the cannabis plant exclusively for
industrial purposes (fibre and seed) or horticultural purposes'.
Australian drug legislation permits the cultivation of cannabis
for scientific purposes and some limited experimentation has
already taken place in Australia. </p>

<p> However, groups such as the Business Alliance for Commerical
Hemp argue that the full benefits of hemp production can only be
obtained if hemp is grown on a wider scale, and that cannabis
with a very low THC content can be grown for industrial purposes.
Legislation permitting the cultivation of cannabis for industrial
purposes could be included in existing drug legislation, however,
as with the medicinal use of cannabis, introducing legislation
that recognises the industrial uses of a substance that is
thought of simply as a dangerous illicit drug may pose political
difficulties for those advocating legislative change. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> The abuse of licit and illicit drugs represents a major
public health problem in the United States. The costs to society
of such abuse include thousands of premature deaths annually due
to drug-related illnesses, accidents, and homicides; economic
costs related to health care, criminal justice, and lost
productivity; and the mental and physical pain suffered by
millions of Americans. Many ills plaguing the nation
today--including the AIDS epidemic, increased crime and violence,
and homelessness--in some cases, may be linked to individuals'
physical dependence on a variety of abusable substances. The
consequences of substance abuse and addiction have been felt by
people within every economic, social, racial, religious, and
political boundary. </p>

<p> What are the root causes of substance abuse and addiction?
Why and how does addiction occur? Who are the substance abusers?
What factors lead to addiction? What are the implications for
prevention and treatment? </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>ROOT CAUSES </b> </p>

<p> The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was asked to
identify the root causes of substance abuse and addiction. The
term root causes has been used in political discussions and
debate. To some, root causes of substance abuse and addiction are
framed in a moral context, in which decisions related to use,
abuse, and addiction are the responsibility primarily of
individuals. To others, root causes include a multitude of social
and economic problems, such as homelessness, poverty, and racism.
Many people have strongly held opinions as to what constitutes
the general root causes of substance abuse and addiction in
populations, but no consensus exists about the specific root
causes of substance abuse and addiction for particular
individuals. </p>

<p> The OTA report has four parts: necessary preconditions,
individual factors, community contexts, and policy options. The
first part, Necessary Preconditions, focuses on several factors
that are necessary for substance abuse and addiction to occur.
The second part, Individual Factors, focuses on risk and
protective factors in individuals that are thought to influence
substance use, abuse, and addiction. The third part, Community
Contexts, looks at how risk and protective factors play out in
subcultures and in major activity settings (home, school,
workplace, and recreation). The fourth part, Policy Options
addresses a range of legislative issues and options for Congress.
</p>

<hr>

<p> <b> NECESSARY PRECONDITIONS </b> </p>

<p> No single or general set of variables explains the misuse of
alcohol and other drugs for every individual; in other words
there are no &quot;root causes&quot; for substance abuse that
universally apply to everyone. Nevertheless, OTA has identified
three major sets of necessary preconditions that must be present
in order for substance abuse and addiction to occur: </p>

<ul>
    <li>biology and pharmacology, </li>
    <li>availability, and </li>
    <li>use and transitions to abuse and dependency. </li>
</ul>

<p> <b> Biology and Pharmacology </b> </p>

<p> The first major set of preconditions includes biological and
pharmacological factors, without which drug abuse and dependency
would be impossible. Underlying all alcohol and drug problems are
the actions and effects that drugs of abuse exert on the brain.
It is important to understand how drugs work in the brain, why
certain drugs have the potential for being abused, and what, if
any, biological differences exist among individuals in their
susceptibility to abuse drugs. </p>

<p> A wide range of psychoactive substances have the potential
for abuse (see box 1-1). The possession and use of several
substances (e.g., marijuana, heroin, cocaine) are illegal in all
50 states. Other addictive substances (e.g., tobacco and alcohol)
may be legally purchased, possessed, and consumed by many
Americans. Some abusable substances (e.g., a wide range of
prescription drugs) are available on a restricted basis, usually
by a physician's order, while others (e.g., inhalants) may be
legally purchased, possessed, and consumed by anybody. </p>

<p> Biological factors that contribute to substance abuse and
addiction fall into two groups: the effects drugs of abuse exert
on the individual in general, and the biological status of
specific individuals taking drugs. The effects the drugs exert
can be either acute or chronic and will vary depending on the
drug and its route of administration. Most drugs of abuse
influence the brain's reward system. The pleasurable sensations
that drug use can produce reinforce drug-seeking and drug-taking
behaviors. These actions differ with different drugs; thus, some
substances have greater potential for abuse and addiction than
others. While growing evidence suggests that the brain reward
system plays a role in the reinforcing properties of most drugs
of abuse, the precise mechanisms involved are complex and have
yet to be completely described (see figures 1-1 and 1-2). </p>

<p> Prolonged or chronic use of a substance or substances can
produce both biological and behavioral changes (some long-
lasting). Biological changes can include sensitization and/or
tolerance to a substance and, if use is discontinued, withdrawal
(see box 1-2). Behavioral changes also occur with continued drug
use. An individual's drug-craving, drug- seeking, and drug-taking
behaviors are reinforced through neuroadaptive changes in the
brain's reward system. </p>

<p> Environmental cues also play a large role in drug-seeking and
drug-taking behavior. On encountering certain environmental
stimuli (i.e., specific locations, smells, tastes), drug-craving
and drug withdrawal symptoms have been reported by former drug
users who have been drug-free for months and even years. </p>

<p> Through family, twin, and adoption studies, most researchers
agree that genetic factors play some part in the acquisition of
alcohol problems and, although less clear, other drug problems.
However, no conclusive evidence has been found to explain
precisely what is inherited or the overall importance of this
inherited material. It has been hypothesized that numerous genes
(as opposed to one) interact in complex ways, and expression of
those genes are affected by a myriad of environmental factors.
Thus, the presence or absence of a genetic factor neither ensures
nor protects against drug addiction. </p>

<p> <b> Availability </b> </p>

<p> The second set of preconditions for drug abuse and dependency
includes availability. A person cannot become a drug abuser
unless a drug is physically available. In addition, however,
availability is affected by social norms (e.g., factors within
the community conducive to drug use, including level of parental
or guardian supervision, lack of consequences for alcohol and
drug offenses, lack of alternative activities, and portrayals of
alcohol and other drug use by friends and the media as a
glamorous and healthy activity), prices (economic availability),
and personal values (subjective availability) (see table 1-1). </p>

<p> The primary focus of U.S. antidrug policy has been to attack
the physical availability of illicit drugs through law
enforcement efforts aimed at disrupting the production,
transport, and sale of drugs. While this focus has increased
drug-related arrests--nearly half of newly sentenced federal
inmates in 1991 were imprisoned on drug charges--illicit drugs
are still widely available. </p>

<p> Marketing techniques for both licit and illicit drugs can
alter social, economic, and subjective availability. Key
components of marketing include the promotion and advertising of
particular product lines to appeal to particular subpopulations
of the consuming public, development of a product line that can
be targeted to subpopulations within the larger community of
consumers, pricing strategies to attract new buyers, and
identification of retail outlets for sales. </p>

<p> Federal law regulates the merchandising of licit yet abusable
substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs by
placing a variety of restrictions on how such products may be
marketed. Despite current restrictions, debate continues as to
whether and how a variety of legal drugs should be marketed. </p>

<p> <b> Use and Transitions to Abuse and Dependency </b> </p>

<p> The third set of preconditions for drug abuse and addiction
is drug use, including the progression to heavier and more
harmful use. A person cannot become drug-dependent without first
using a drug and then progressing to more harmful levels of use.
Researchers have focused on stages in the progression of drug use
in several ways. They have studied stages in the initiation of
the use of different drugs, finding a sequence that moves from
the use of cigarettes and wine or beer, to the use of marijuana,
then hard liquor, and finally other illicit drugs. Because most
individuals who use drugs do not go on to abuse drugs, and
because the use of drugs at one level does not guarantee the use
of drugs at a higher level, these stages are descriptive but not
predictive. </p>

<p> Initiation is the first step in the progression to more
serious levels of drug use. Because drug use often begins during
adolescence, most drug use research has focused on drug use
initiation among adolescents. However, many individuals who
initiate drug use do not progress to harmful drug use. Also, the
factors associated with such progression may often differ from
the factors associated with initiation. Thus, the focus on the
initiation of drug use during adolescence is not sufficient for
an understanding of the progression from use to abuse and
dependency. </p>

<p> In addition to initiation, research has focused on other
identifiable stages in the full cycle of drug use and abuse,
including continuation of drug use, maintenance and progression
of drug use within a class of drugs, progression in drug use
across drug classes, and regression, cessation, and relapse
cycles. Research has also been done on the co- occurrence and
possible sequences in drug abuse and other problem behaviors,
with some studies finding that problem behaviors often precede
the onset of drug abuse. </p>

<p> <b> INDIVIDUAL FACTORS </b> </p>

<p> Much of the research on substance abuse and addiction has
focused on identifying individual risk factors for alcohol and
other drug use, specifically among adolescents and young adults
(see table 1-2). Risk factors have been identified as those
cognitive, psychological, attitudinal, social, pharmacological,
physiological, and developmental characteristics that foster
initiation of drug and alcohol use and/or abuse by an individual.
Protective factors are those characteristics that reduce the risk
of substance use and abuse and promote positive development, such
as appropriate role models, involvement in positive peer groups,
and a positive self-image and outlook for the future. </p>

<p> Because no individual risk or protective factor can be
categorized as a root cause of substance abuse and addiction, a
full analysis of each individual factor is beyond the scope of
this report. However, an overview of selected factors highlights
associations often present in substance abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> <b> Demographic </b> </p>

<p> <b> Age </b> </p>

<p> The preponderance of substance abuse research points to the
fact that children who use alcohol and other drugs before the age
of 15 have a greater likelihood of becoming problem alcohol and
other drug users, versus those youth who begin use at a later
age. </p>

<p> While most substance use and abuse occur during the
adolescent and young-adult years, older persons are not immune to
the addictive powers of these substances. For example, among
women, alcohol problems tend to appear on average several years
later than they do among men (although this trend may be
reversing). For black males, problem drinking patterns typically
occur after age 30, versus ages 18 to 25 for white males. </p>

<p> Although substance abuse problems are not exclusive to
adolescence, most prevention programs currently target youth. The
importance of these types of programs is obvious--to prevent or
decrease the use of alcohol, tobacco, cigarettes, and other drugs
by youth. Yet, adults can also be exposed to stressful life
situations, such as unemployment, divorce, or death of a spouse
or child, which could contribute to substance abuse problems. The
adult population presents unique and often overlooked challenges
for the planning and implementation of substance abuse prevention
programs. </p>

<p> <b> Gender </b> </p>

<p> Historically, the vast majority of biological and behavioral
studies were conducted on male participants; women substance
abusers were not commonly included in research studies. A
distorted picture emerged, in which women were assumed to misuse
the same substances, and for the same reasons, as men. Within the
past 10 to 20 years, however, some researchers have focused on
the causes and consequences of substance abuse problems among
women, and are beginning to report differences based on gender.
Basic gaps in knowledge remain, however, regarding substance use
and abuse among women. Until these gaps are addressed, the
inaccurate and misleading practice of transferring data garnered
from studies on men to women is likely to continue. </p>

<p> <b> Race and Ethnicity </b> </p>

<p> Historically, racial and ethnic minorities have been linked
with, and often blamed for, many of the substance abuse problems
within the United States (see box 1-3). Certainly, many urban
areas have high concentrations of minorities, and within many of
these areas the prevalence of substance abuse may be high. Often
overlooked, however, is the prevalence of substance abuse
problems in suburban and rural areas throughout the United
States. In the minds of many, the link between minority
populations and rampant substance abuse is inaccurate and
derogatory. </p>

<p> Adolescent research has documented substantial racial and
ethnic differences in substance use among high school seniors. On
average, licit and illicit substance use is highest among Native
American Indian youth, somewhat lower among white and Hispanic
youth, substantially lower among black youth, and lowest among
Asian youth. However, such findings do not include populations
most likely to be excluded from self-reporting studies (e.g.,
high school dropouts). </p>

<p> Until recently, much of the analysis of substance use and/or
abuse data has concentrated on the relationship between the use
of a substance and one or two variables such as race and
ethnicity and/or educational level. Often a positive association
was found between minority populations and the use or abuse of
certain substances. While statistically correct, these analyses
can be simplistic and misleading. Clearly many risk and
protective factors interact to produce substance use and abuse.
If the majority of these variables are excluded from the
analysis, a skewed picture may arise as to the importance of
certain variables as risk factors for substance use and abuse.
Additionally, to simplify the data collection, racial and ethnic
categories are often broad. The most popular groupings are black,
white non- Hispanic, Hispanic, and other. While each of these
categories contains many distinct cultures, gross generalizations
are commonly made. </p>

<p> Race and ethnicity have not been shown to be either
biological or genetic risk factors for substance use or abuse. To
date, the preponderance of investigative studies has focused on
racial and ethnic differences in response specifically to
alcohol. Few studies have been completed on differences in racial
and ethnic biological responses to other licit or illicit drugs. </p>

<p> <b> Economic </b> </p>

<p> Are poor individuals at greater risk of developing problems
related to substance abuse? While a relatively straight forward
question, its resolution is hampered by the fact that poverty is
difficult to define and drawing conclusions concerning an
individual's potential for future substance abuse based on one or
two variables such as family income or educational level is
overly simplistic and deceptive. </p>

<p> In recent years, attention has been paid to the plight of the
urban poor, many of whom are minorities. These inner- city
communities are often riddled with high rates of crime, violence,
unemployment, and inadequate social and medical services. For
individuals living in these localities, the consequences of these
problems are serious and far reaching. </p>

<p> To assess poverty and its relationship to substance abuse
problems, some researchers have used the federal guidelines for
poverty, while others employ measures of socioeconomic status
(SES) such as educational level and household income. To date,
the largest and most comprehensive analysis of SES variables and
substance use has been accomplished by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). While the analysis revealed associations
between certain characteristics and patterns of substance use, it
did not reveal causality. From this analysis, a straightforward
&quot;yes or no&quot; response to the initial question linking
poverty to increased individual risk for substance use or abuse
is clearly impossible. The NIDA analysis demonstrated that the
type and quantity of an individual's substance use is correlated
with a variety of both individual as well as geographic
characteristics. Furthermore, while the NIDA study was the
largest and most comprehensive to date, some segments of the
population (e.g., homeless, dropouts, institutionalized), many of
whom were possible alcohol and drug abusers, were excluded from
the survey. </p>

<p> <b> Psychosocial and Behavioral </b> </p>

<p> Many of the identified risk and protective factors relate to
psychological, social, and behavioral characteristics. Conditions
such as aggressiveness, delinquency, and mental disorders are
often linked with substance abuse and addiction. Experiences such
as physical and sexual abuse have also been identified as
potential risk factors. While relatively little research has been
accomplished on protective factors, several elements identified
within the resiliency literature, as well as religiosity and
spirituality, have been associated with decreased substance use. </p>

<p> However, the presence or absence of specific risk factors
neither predicates nor guarantees protection from substance
abuse. In addition, consensus is lacking within the substance
abuse field as to the importance, interaction, or order of the
factors. </p>

<p> <b> COMMUNITY CONTEXTS </b> </p>

<p> A growing body of research is focusing on factors and
interventions relevant to the onset and prevention of substance
use, abuse, and dependency in the four principal community
activity settings--homes and families, schools and peers,
workplaces, and recreational settings. </p>

<p> In framing prevention programs with divergent populations,
researchers are attempting to better understand qualitative as
well as quantitative research methods, and the variety of
settings in which substance abuse and addiction can take place
and can be combated (see box 1-4). </p>

<p> Despite the promise of community-based research, several
problems exist. First, much of the research does not address
substance abuse and addiction per se, but rather risk and
protective factors that can lead to a number of outcomes,
including substance abuse and addiction. Second, research studies
vary widely in methodology, making it difficult to draw
scientifically valid conclusions. Third, rigorous evaluation of
many prevention research programs is missing, leaving the
effectiveness of such programs open to debate. </p>

<p> <b> Homes and Families </b> </p>

<p> Although American society expects families in their homes to
take the lead in dealing with substance abuse and other problem
behaviors, families in this country generally receive only
limited support in protecting themselves against substance abuse.
This situation may result in part from the belief that most
nuclear families can raise their children largely independently
and therefore do not need outside support, and in part from the
belief that teens and young adults are more influenced by their
peers. The first belief, however, is not supported by
long-standing practices in most societies, where extended
families and life-long neighbors have traditionally helped raise
children (although in the United States many parents do not have
access to these additional child-rearing resources because of
urbanization, high technology, and family mobility). And the
second belief is being questioned by growing evidence that
certain parenting practices and family intervention programs can
significantly reduce the risk of substance abuse among
adolescents and young adults. </p>

<p> A growing body of research has identified risk and protective
factors that may be particularly relevant in home and family
situations (see table 1-3). Programs that enhance protective
factors include those providing parent education, prenatal and
infant care, preschool, and social support activities that help
strengthen involved and responsive parenting. Programs that seek
to decrease the presence of risk factors include those designed
to reduce drug trafficking (e.g., community policing, clean
sweeps of housing projects), physical and sexual abuse, the
impact of negative life events (e.g., mental health counseling),
and parental neglect. Substance abuse treatment programs that
include an addict's family members also address risk factors. </p>

<p> <b> Schools and Peers </b> </p>

<p> Schools have been the target for prevention programs to
curtail drug use at school sites (e.g., Drug Free School Zones)
as well as curriculum-based programs that target drug use in the
community as a whole. Because school-age youth are especially
likely to initiate the use of alcohol and other drugs, much of
the research has focused on use, rather than on abuse and
dependency. Such research is nevertheless relevant to an
understanding of abuse and dependency, since use is a
precondition and contributor to abuse and dependency and because
even experimental use can be harmful. </p>

<p> OTA conducted the most extensive compilation and examination
of survey research on school-aged substance use to date-- 9,930
statistical analyses from 242 separate studies. The studies
reported statistical relationships between substance use and its
postulated causes. Statistical findings from the study reports
were sorted into 11 major categories and 50 subcategories (see
table 1-4), and then analyzed to identify strong, moderate, and
weak statistical relationships, as well as those that had been
insufficiently studied. The four variables that dominated as
correlates of and possible contributors to substance abuse are:
1) prior and concurrent use of substances, 2) substance use by
peers and friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about substance
use, and 4) offers to use substances. The prominence of prior and
concurrent use is consistent with the reinforcing nature of
substance use itself. The prominence of the other three variables
emphasizes the importance of the social environment in
contributing to and reinforcing substance use among school- age
youth. </p>

<p> Schools primarily seek to prevent substance use and abuse
through curriculum-based drug prevention programs. Such programs
have dominated the field, largely because they are relatively
simple to understand, implement, and replicate, and because
methods to evaluate them have become standardized.
Curriculum-based prevention programs have been hampered, however,
by a lack of good evaluation data needed to prove their
effectiveness. </p>

<p> <b> Workplaces </b> </p>

<p> The prevalence of drug abuse among the employed remains
inadequately documented, based on a small number of studies.
Substance abuse contributes to workplace problems, such as
accidents, injuries, absenteeism, turnover, lost productivity,
compensation claims, and insurance costs. Substance abuse in
workplaces can be affected by nonworkplace factors and workplace
factors. The primary interventions are employee assistance
programs that help employees with personal problems by providing
services directly (through the work organization) or indirectly
(through a provider in the community); health promotion programs
that typically seek to prevent illness and promote wellness
through behavior change; and alterations to workplace
environments that seek to reduce stress and strengthen support
for workers. </p>

<p> <b> Recreational Settings </b> </p>

<p> Recreational activities and settings may also contribute to
the prevention of substance use and abuse or, by their absence,
increase the risk. Examples of recreational activities and
settings include Boys and Girls Clubs, Boy and Girl Scouts,
organized sports, and local park and recreation department
programs. </p>

<p> Research on the impact of organized youth activities on
substance use and abuse is limited, and only a few studies have
addressed the issue directly. However, existing research
indicates that involvement in youth programs and activities is
associated with fewer at-risk behaviors, including substance use
among youth. The youth development field, including the resources
of park and recreation departments, provides opportunities for
broad-based prevention interventions. </p>

<p> Involvement in activities does not by itself protect against
substance abuse. Some activities, such as those that are
unstructured and unsupervised, may even increase the risks of
substance use and abuse through association with a wider range of
peers, some of whom are using substances. In addition, activities
perceived as boring may not protect against substance use and
abuse. More research is needed to clarify the aspects of
recreational and other leisure activities that may protect
against substance use and abuse. Research might focus on whether
activities that are supervised, structured, drug-free,
empowering, skills- building, self-esteem-promoting, active,
shared, and nonboring (or some combination of those) are
associated with lower levels of substance use and abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b> POLICY OPTIONS </b> </p>

<p> Issues related to substance abuse and addiction have long
occupied the attention of the American public (see table 1- 5).
Congress has authorized a multitude of federal programs aimed at
reducing or preventing the supply and demand of illicit drugs and
regulating the availability of illicit substances, and has
appropriated billions of dollars each year to federal agencies,
provided oversight of federal programs, and passed broad-based
legislation to coordinate programs as part of the war on drugs.
In addressing what some policymakers term as the root causes of
substance abuse and addiction, the list of relevant statutes
expands significantly, as many domestic and social programs can
influence the risk and protective factors that can lead an
individual into or away from substance abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> A total of 12 executive branch departments, four independent
agencies, one multiagency program (Weed and Seed), one White
House office (the Office of National Drug Control Policy--
ONDCP), and the Judiciary, all receive federal funding as part of
national drug control strategy. These efforts include
interdiction, treatment, and prevention programs. </p>

<p> The federal substance abuse control policy has as its primary
focus the eradication of the supply of drugs. Congress currently
appropriates more than $12 billion annually on antidrug efforts,
with approximately two-thirds of this amount supporting drug
interdiction and law enforcement activities, and the remainder
supporting demand- side activities, such as drug treatment,
research, and prevention programs. </p>

<p> Drug demand reduction efforts focus on providing treatment
for abusers and addicts, prevention programs for various
populations, and biomedical and behavioral research on the causes
of substance use, abuse, and addiction. Of these, the federal
government spends the most on treatment, followed by prevention
and causality research. Drug treatment and prevention programs
are funded at both the federal and state levels, while causation
research is funded primarily by the federal government. A recent
General Accounting Office (GAO) study revealed that for studying
the causes of drug abuse, funding has remained comparatively
tiny. In 1990, for example, such research was funded at a level
of $6 million, about one-tenth of one percent of the nation's
drug control budget for that year. </p>

<p> OTA, in conjunction with GAO, surveyed federal agencies
identified as having substance abuse prevention efforts. OTA
finds that substance abuse prevention efforts are scattered over
a number of federal agencies, and that federal prevention efforts
are dictated by statutory mandates, rather than directed at
identifying causes of substance abuse and addiction per se. The
White House ONDCP, charged with coordinating federal antidrug
efforts, lacks the statutory mandate to forcibly integrate or
alter the multitude of programs that make up the federal
government's war on drugs. </p>

<p> Congress faces several fundamental difficulties in addressing
the causes of substance abuse and addiction: </p>

<ul>
    <li> o No scientific consensus exists as to what is the
        driving cause of substance abuse and addiction. A range
        of risk and protective factors have been associated with
        drug use, abuse, and addiction. </li>
    <li> o Federal antidrug efforts, though coordinated by ONDCP,
        are spread among many federal agencies, whose
        authorization and appropriations fall under the
        jurisdiction of numerous congressional committees and
        subcommittees. ONDCP efforts in drug demand reduction
        efforts alone involved federal agencies across at least
        11 Cabinet-level departments. This makes coordinated
        legislative action difficult to achieve. </li>
    <li> o The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the
        creation of new domestic programs or the enhancement of
        existing programs that target known risk and protective
        factors in individuals and communities. The framework and
        literature reviews presented in this report make clear
        that substance abuse and addiction can arise and be
        influenced by multiple factors in individuals, groups,
        and communities. Thus, effective intervention requires
        prevention practitioners to select from a variety of
        options, so they can target the specific factors that are
        especially important for the particular populations and
        communities they are addressing. This does not mean that
        everything must be done at once nor that everything be
        known in advance of taking action. To the contrary,
        policymakers and practitioners can take small steps at a
        time, and then, as resources and new knowledge permit,
        take additional steps that address a fuller range of
        factors and contexts in greater depth. </li>
    <li> o Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically
        accepted standards for determining their success or
        failure. Whatever methods are developed, tested, and
        incorporated into prevention programs, a critical
        component of success is careful, rigorous evaluation.
        Answering &quot;what works?&quot; is essential in making
        advances in preventing substance abuse. </li>
</ul>

<p> In choosing which policy issues to address, OTA focused on
those areas directly addressed in this study. OTA identified a
series of policy issues in four broad categories: federal focus
and prevention program structure, research needs, community
activity settings, and availability (see table 1- 6). A number of
policy questions and options for congressional action emerge from
these four categories (see table 1-7). A full discussion of the
policy issues and options for congressional action can be found
in chapter 9 of the full report. Given the broad nature of
federal antidrug efforts, many important issues relating to
federal antidrug efforts remain beyond the scope of this report.
Such topics include drug treatment, interdiction and enforcement,
and drug legalization. </p>

<p> BOX 1-1: Overview of Alcohol and Some Other Psychoactive
Substances </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> ALCOHOL (ethyl alcohol) </b> </p>

<p> Alcohol, one of the most widely used of all drugs, is a
central nervous system depressant with effects similar to those
of sedative-hypnotic compounds (see below). At low doses, alcohol
may be associated with behavioral excitation thought to be due to
the depression of inhibitory neurons in the brain. Alcohol
differs from sedative-hypnotic compounds in that it is used
primarily for recreation or social rather than medical purposes. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Beer. 2. Wine. 3. &quot;Hard&quot; liquor (e.g., whiskey,
gin). </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> SEDATIVES, HYPNOTICS, OR ANXIOLYTICS </b> </p>

<p> Sedative-hypnotics are drugs of diverse chemical structure
that exert a nonselective general depressant on the central
nervous system. In addition, they reduce metabolism in a variety
of tissues in the body, depressing any system that uses energy.
Depending on the dose, any sedative hypnotic compound may be
classified as a sedative (an agent that allays excitement), a
tranquilizer (an antianxiety agent), a hypnotic (a sleep-inducing
agent), or an anesthetic (an agent that eliminates pain).
Sedative-hypnotics are used medically as sedatives, anxiolytics
(antianxiety agents), hypnotics, antiepileptics, muscle
relaxants, and general anesthetics. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Barbiturates (&quot;downers&quot; or &quot;barbs&quot;):
pentobarbital sodium[NembutalR], secobarbital sodium [SeconalR],
amobarbital [AmytalR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> 2. Nonbarbiturate hypnotics: methaqualone [QuaaludesR]--
taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Tranquilizers: diazepam [ValiumR], chlordiazepoxide
hydrochloride [LibriumR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> CANNABIS (THC) </b> </p>

<p> THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) the active agent in marijuana,
alters perceptions, concentration, emotions, and behavior, though
the mechanisms of action are not entirely clear. Researchers have
found, however, that THC changes the way in which sensory
information is processed by the brain. It can be used medically
to relieve nausea and side effects of chemotherapy in cancer
patients; it is very rarely used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Marijuana (&quot;pot&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;)-- smoked
or eaten. 2. Hashish (&quot;hash&quot;)--smoked or eaten. 3.
Hashish oil (&quot;hash oil&quot;)--smoked (mixed with tobacco.
4. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-- taken orally in capsules. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> NICOTINE </b> </p>

<p> Nicotine, obtained naturally from tobacco, is a central
nervous system stimulant.(c) It exerts its action secondary to
stimulation of certain cholinergic (excitatory) synapses both
within the brain and in the peripheral nervous system. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cigarettes. 2. Smokeless tobacco (e.g., snuff or chewing
tobacco). </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> COCAINE </b> </p>

<p> Cocaine, obtained naturally from coca leaves, is a potent
central nervous system stimulant.(c) It stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system, which regulates the activity of
cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. It also produces
bronchodilation in the lungs. It is used medically as a topical
anesthetic for surgical procedures. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> <b> Examples </b> </p>

<p> 1. Cocaine hydrochloride powder (&quot;coke&quot; or
&quot;street cocaine&quot;)--usually snorted or injected
intravenously.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Cocaine alkaloid (&quot;freebase&quot; or
&quot;crack&quot;)--smoked.(e) </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED STIMULANTS(f) </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamines </p>

<p> Amphetamines are a group of three closely related compounds,
all of which are potent central nervous system and behavioral
stimulants.(c) Some amphetamines are used medically to treat
attention deficit disorder or minimal brain dysfunction in
children, narcolepsy (recurrent, uncontrollable, brief episodes
of sleep), or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;uppers&quot;
(BenzedrineR]--taken orally, injected, or snorted.(g) </p>

<p> 2. Methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;crystal
meth&quot; or &quot;ice&quot;) [MethadrineR]--taken orally,
injected, or snorted.(g),(h) </p>

<p> 3. Dextroamphetamine [DexedrineR]--taken orally, or injected.
</p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> 2. Nonamphetamine stimulants </p>

<p> Like amphetamines, nonamphetamine stimulates are central
nervous and behavioral stimulants. Some non-amphetamine
stimulants (e.g., PreludinR) are used for weight control, and
some (e.g., RitalinR and CylertR) are used medically to treat
hyperactivity, minimal brain dysfunction, narcolepsy, or (rarely)
depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Pheumetrazine hydrochloride [PreludinR]--taken orally or
injected.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Methylphenidate hydrochloride injected.(d) </p>

<p> 3. Pemoline [CylertR]--taken orally. [RitalinR]--taken
orally, or injected.(d) </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> HALLUCINOGENS </b> </p>

<p> Hallucinogens, or psychedelics, are a heterogeneous group of
compounds that affect a person's perceptions, sensations,
thinking, self-awareness, and emotions.(i) </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or
&quot;acid&quot;--taken orally or put in the eyes. </p>

<p> 2. Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethylox- phenylethyl amide) or
&quot;mesc&quot; and peyote--disks chewed, swallowed, or smoked;
tablets taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Psilocybin (&quot;magic mushrooms&quot;)--chewed and
swallowed. 4. MDMA (methylene dioxymethamphetamine)--taken
orally. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> INHALANTS </b> </p>

<p> Inhalants are chemicals that produce psychoactive vapors.
Although different in makeup, nearly all of the abused inhalants
produce effects similar to those of anesthetics, which act to
slow down the body's functions or produce feelings of dizziness.
At low doses, users may feel slightly stimulated. Amyl nitrite is
used for heart patients because it dilates the blood vessels and
increases blood supply to the heart. There are no medical
indications for most of the inhalants. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Solvents (model airplane glue, nail polish remover,
lighter and cleaning fluids, and gasoline)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 2. Aerosols (e.g., paints, hairsprays)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 3. Some anesthetics (e.g.,nitrous oxide)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Amyl nitrite (&quot;snappers&quot; or &quot;poppers&quot;)
and butyl nitrite (&quot;rush&quot;)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> OPIATES (NARCOTICS) AND RELATED ANALGESICS </b> </p>

<p> Opiates are natural or synthetic drugs that, like morphine, a
substance derived from the opium poppy, have analgesic
(pain-relieving) properties. Heroin is not approved for medical
uses in the United States. The major medical use of other opiates
is for the relief of pain (i.e., as analgesics); some narcotics
are used to relieve coughing (i.e., as antitussives) or to treat
diarrhea. Methadone is used in the treatment of narcotic
abstinence syndromes and as an analgesic in terminal illness. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Heroin (&quot;smack&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;)--
injected, smoked, or inhaled.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Codeine (codeine sulfate)--taken orally or injected.(d) 3.
Morphine (morphine hydrochloride)--injected, smoked, or inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Synthetic opiates (e.g., methadone [DolophineR]);
hydromorphone hydrochloride [DilaudidR], meperidine hydrochloride
[DemerolR], oxycodone and asprin [PercodanR]-- taken orally or
injected. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> PCP (PHENCYCLIDINE) AND SIMILARLY ACTING
SYMPHATHOMIMETICS </b> </p>

<p> Phencycyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, alters the
functions of the neocortex and has been called a dissociative
anesthetic. It was developed in the 1950s as an anesthetic but
was subsequently taken off the market in 1967 when it was
discovered that the drug caused hallucinations in some people.(j)
PCP is now used legally only in veterinary medicine as an
immobilizing agent. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> PCP (&quot;angel dust&quot; or &quot;lovely&quot;)--taken
orally, or smoked (sprayed on joints or cigarettes).(d) </p>

<p> (a) According to Julien, one could conceivably classify
psychoactive drugs by at least three methods: 1) mechanism of
action, 2) chemical structure, and 3) behavioral effects.
Probably the most useful approach would be to classify them by
mechanism of action, but knowledge of the brain's physiology is
too limited for this approach to be comprehensive. A limitation
of the second approach is that many drugs of apparently similar
structure exert quite different effects, and many drugs of
dissimilar structure exert quite similar effects. The
classification in this table largely reflects the behavioral
effects approach. The classification used here is based on the
categories in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., revised.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, all of the
classes of psychoactive substances listed in this box except
nicotine are associated with both abuse and dependence. Nicotine
is associated with dependence but not abuse. </p>

<p> (b) The potential physiological, psychological, and
behavioral effects of using the psychoactive substance shown are
discussed in the sources listed below. The consequences depend in
part on the specific drug used, the dosage level and mode of
administration. </p>

<p> (c) Central nervous system stimulants are drugs that can
elevate mood, increase alertness, reduce fatigue, provide a sense
of increased energy, decrease appetite, and improve task
performance. They can also produce anxiety, insomnia, and
irritability. The drugs differ widely in their molecular
structures and mechanisms of action. </p>

<p> (d) According to the American Psychiatric Association, the
route of administration of a psychoactive substance is an
important variable in determining whether use will lead to
dependence or abuse. In general, routes of administration that
produce more efficient absorption of the substance in the blood
stream (e.g., intravenous injection) tend to increase the
likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance uses that leads
to dependence. Routes that quickly deliver psychoactive
substances to the brain (e.g., smoking or intravenous injection)
are associated with higher levels of consumption and with an
increased likelihood of toxic effects. Use of contaminated
needles for intravenous administration of amphetamines, cocaine,
and opiates can cause hepatitis, HIV infection, and other
illnesses. </p>

<p> (e) Freebase cocaine is a form of cocaine made by converting
&quot;street cocaine&quot; (cocaine hydrochloride) to a purified
base that is smoked. The effect of smoking freebase is similar to
that of intravenous injection but smoking provides a shorter more
intense high than sniffing or ingestion because of the rapid
absorption of the drug through the lungs. &quot;Crack
cocaine&quot; is the street name given to freebase cocaine that
has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a chemical base
by cooking it with baking soda and water. The term crack refers
to the cracking sound that is heard when the mixture is smoked
(heated), presumably due to the sodium bicarbonate. </p>

<p> (f) Describing a drug as a stimulant does not adequately
describe its properties. Drug use surveys typically mean
amphetamines when they use the word stimulants. Some surveys
regard as stimulants both prescription (amphetamines) and
nonprescription substances (e.g., caffeine-based compounds used
in No-Doz, diet pills, and &quot;fake pep pills&quot;). Cocaine
and nicotine (described above) are also central nervous system
simulants. </p>

<p> (g) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
designer drugs are structural analogs of substances scheduled
under the Controlled Substances Act that are prepared by
underground chemists to mimic the psychoactive effects of
controlled substances or produce other psychoactive effects.
Because such analogs are not identical to their parent compound,
their manufacture and distribution does not violate the law. As
of June 1986, there were synthetic analogs of PCP, fentanyl and
meperidine, and amphetamine and methamphetamine. </p>

<p> (h) In the past, abuse of methamphetamine had been in the
form of tablets or intravenous injection. More recently,
&quot;ice&quot; (one of the common street names for
d-methamphetamine hydrochloride) has gained popularity in a form
suitable for smoking. </p>

<p> (i) Most of the agents in this class of drugs can induce
hallucinations if the dose is high enough. But the term
hallucinogen does not adequately describe the range of
pharmacological actions of the diverse group of substances
usually included in the class. The term psychedelic was proposed
by Osmond in 1957 to imply that these agents all have the ability
to alter the sensory perception and thus may be considered
&quot;mind expanding.&quot; The effects of hallucinogens are
unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the user's
personality, mood and expectations, and the surroundings in which
the drug is used. </p>

<p> (j) PCP is considered a hallucinogen in some surveys of drug
use. </p>

<p> BOX 1-2: Tolerance, Sensitization, Dependence, and Withdrawal
</p>

<p> Tolerance to a drug develops when, following a prolonged
period of use, more of the drug is required to produce a given
effect. Sensitization, the opposite of tolerance, occurs when the
effects of a given dose of a drug increase after repeated
administration. Dependence is a type of neuroadaptation to drug
exposure. With prolonged use of a drug, cells in the brain adapt
to its presence such that the drug is required to maintain normal
cell function. On abrupt withdrawal of the drug, the cell behaves
abnormally and a withdrawal syndrome ensues. Generally, the
withdrawal syndrome is characterized by a series of signs and
symptoms that are opposite to those of the drug's acute effects.
For example, withdrawal of sedative drugs produce excitation and
irritability. Conversely, withdrawal of stimulants produces
profound depression. </p>

<p> BOX 1-3: Drugs and Discrimination </p>

<p> In America, tensions between the majority and various
minorities often hinge on concerns raised by drug use. The groups
change over time and place, but the dividing issues remain
remarkably similar. Those in power decide which drugs are legal
and how rules should be enforced. Minorities charge that unfair
policies result from prejudice, ignorance, and hypocrisy. </p>

<p> When? 1850 Where? Boston Who? Irish Immigrants </p>

<p> Impoverished Irish immigrants brought the tradition of
drinking whiskey with them. In American cities, people often
blamed whiskey for neighborhood quarrels. In the mid-19th
century, clashes with Irish immigrants occurred so often that
police vans came to be known by the term &quot;paddy
wagons.&quot; </p>

<p> When? 1880s Where? San Francisco Who? Chinese Immigrants </p>

<p> Fear of immigrant Chinese often focused on their recreational
use of opium. In 1875, San Francisco outlawed opium smoking,
which most residents associated exclusively with the Chinese.
This citywide ban became nationwide in 1909. </p>

<p> When? 1882 Where? Ohio Who? German Immigrants </p>

<p> Beer drinking often brought Germans into conflict with
temperance advocates. Cincinnati's lively German community
gathered at beer gardens on Sundays to sing, dance, drink, and
argue politics. In 1882, Ohio's governor denounced Germans as
&quot;sabbath breakers, criminals, and free thinkers.&quot; </p>

<p> When? 1930s Where? Colorado, New Mexico Who? Mexican Migrant
Workers </p>

<p> The Southwest welcomed Mexican migrants during labor
shortages. But during the Depression, anxiety over competition
for jobs shifted to wildly exaggerated fears of the effects of
marijuana use customary among Mexicans. To placate fears,
Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which prohibited
recreational use of the drug. </p>

<p> When? 1991 Who? African Americans Police forces are largely
white and inner-city residents are mostly black. Between 1980 and
1990, the drug-arrest rate in the city of Rochester, New York,
was about five times that for suburban Monroe County. </p>

<p> BOX 1-4: Ethnography </p>

<p> Ethnographic techniques allow researchers to study how
environmental and cultural factors affect values, attitudes, and
behaviors of individuals and groups. For three decades,
researchers have documented societal and cultural influences on
the patterns of substance use, abuse, and addiction; using a
range of methodologies and working in diverse contexts,
ethnographers have contributed to the understanding of substance
abuse. Interacting with drug users under a wider set of
circumstances than do strict quantitative researchers,
ethnographers have expanded the framework of substance abuse
research hypotheses. They have also assisted in the evaluation
and interpretation of clinical and survey data to different
subcultures and populations. </p>

<p> Ethnographies also provide information on constantlychanging
substance use patterns. By collecting data from substance users
in their natural environments, ethnographers have been able to
document who uses drugs and how drugs are used. This type of
methodology is essential to the historical understanding of
substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Lastly, ethnographers have documented different styles of
substance use within American society as well as abroad.
Differences are cited in experience and use patterns based on
social class, cultural background, gender, and geographic
location. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 2 INTRODUCTION </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction are pervasive in our society,
with their consequences felt by people in every economic, social,
racial, and political boundary. </p>

<p> The United States has grappled with problems associated with
substance abuse and addiction for over a century (see appendix A
and table 2-1). In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan launched
what has become known as the war on drugs. Federal spending to
combat drugs increased from $1.5 billion in 1981 to more than $12
billion in 1994, with spending in 1995 projected to pass the $13
billion mark (see table 2-2). Nearly two-thirds of the federal
antidrug budget goes toward efforts to curb the supply of drugs
(e.g., border interdiction, law enforcement), with the remainder
being spent on drug treatment and prevention programs. While the
use of illegal drugs has declined in the United States in recent
years, a vigorous debate continues as to whether the nation is
indeed winning the war on drugs, and what the balance of federal
effort should be in formulating programs to decrease the supply
of drugs, treat drug abusers and addicts, and educate Americans
about problems associated with drug abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Congress has enacted a number of laws in an attempt to create
a national policy to fight the scourge of drug abuse and
addiction. As part of oversight responsibility for national drug
policy, several committees of Congress have requested the Office
of Technology Assessment (OTA) to undertake a study addressing
the socioeconomic, psychological, physiological, and genetic
underpinnings of substance abuse and addiction (see table 2-3). </p>

<p> OTA has been asked to address a number of questions: </p>

<ul>
    <li> o What are the root causes of substance abuse and
        addiction? </li>
    <li> o Why and how does addiction occur? </li>
    <li> o Who are the substance abusers? </li>
    <li> o What factors, scientific and social, lead to
        addiction? </li>
    <li> o What are the implications for prevention? </li>
</ul>

<p> ROOT CAUSES </p>

<p> At the outset, OTA was asked to address the root causes of
substance abuse and addiction. The term root causes has been used
in political discussions and debate (see box 2-1), and although
many people have strongly held opinions as to what constitutes
the root causes of drug abuse, no consensus exists as to what, if
anything, is inherent in every case of substance abuse and
addiction. OTA conducted a search of various bibliographic
databases, which revealed only limited discussion about root
causes of drug abuse (2). </p>

<p> Research into drug abuse looks not at root causes per se, but
rather at risk and protective factors that increase or decrease
the possibility that substance abuse and addiction will occur
(see table 2-4), and how these risk and protective factors affect
various subpopulations in different settings. </p>

<p> WHAT ARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION? </p>

<p> Drug consumption is divided into three levels or stages
commonly distinguished by clinicians and researchers: use, abuse,
and dependence (see figure 2-1). Each of these stages is, on
average, more hazardous, more obtrusive, and more likely to
provoke or induce social interventions (e.g., punitive sanctions,
attention by prevention programs, admission to treatment) than
the one before (4). A substance is abusable if it has the
capacity to induce dependence in those who use it. Dependence, a
term that is often used interchangeably with the term addiction,
can include psychological dependence (a form of obsessive
behavior whose objective is the attainment of pleasure or the
avoidance of unpleasantness) and physical dependence (development
of tolerance, causing the user to need increasing amounts of the
drug for it to have its desired effect, and withdrawal symptoms
if drug use is stopped) (5). </p>

<p> Nevertheless, there is considerable controversy about what
constitutes substance abuse and addiction. A number of issues
come into play, such as: </p>

<p> o What substance is being used? A wide range of psychoactive
substances has the potential for abuse (see box 2-2). The
possession and use of several substances--such as marijuana,
heroin, cocaine--are illegal in all 50 states. Other addictive
substances--such as tobacco and alcohol--may be legally
purchased, possessed, and consumed by a majority of Americans.
Other abusable substances--such as inhalants-- may be legally
purchased, possessed, and consumed by anybody. </p>

<p> o Does experimental use constitute abuse? Some maintain that
any use of an abusable or addictive substance constitutes abuse.
Others suggest that experimentation-- particularly with such
psychoactive substances as alcohol or tobacco that are available
for purchase by adults of legal age--is part of normal
development and does not necessarily have harmful consequences. </p>

<p> o In what context are substance abuse and addiction being
addressed? Four broad arenas that encounter substance abuse
related issues include: mass communications, criminal justice,
medicine, and public health. These entities often operate
independently of one another, and use substantially different
terms when describing the use of illicit substances or the
illegal use of licit substances (see appendix C). </p>

<p> Public Health Model </p>

<p> The traditional public health model incorporates the host-
agent-environment relationship. Each of these factors has an
individual, as well as an interrelated role in the potential use
and/or harmful use of a substance. Host factors may include
possible genetic, psychological, and biological susceptibility.
Agent factors incorporate the substance's abuse liability
capacity, as well as how the substance is marketed. Lastly,
environmental factors encompass not only the availability of the
substance, but the social, cultural, political, and economic
climate as well. The focus of the public health perspective is to
understand the importance social norms, environment, and
availability play in the shaping of alcohol- and drug-related
problems both on an individual and societal level. </p>

<p> The public health approach toward substance abuse has several
defining characteristics: </p>

<p> o The substance abuse problem is primarily one of health, and
risks for ill-health. In every recreational, mood- altering drug
user, use increases the risk of contracting one or more diseases
or conditions damaging to one's health. Drug use always creates
the potential, from great to small, for developing one or more
drug-related health problems. </p>

<p> o The legality or illegality of a drug is an artificial
barrier that is not as relevant as the health-related
considerations stemming from all types of drug use. Rather than
using legal/illegal, the public health approach categorizes drugs
by such characteristics as addictive potential and long-term
health risks. </p>

<p> o The drug abuse problem and the drug-related crime problem
are not one and the same. As two distinct, interrelated problems,
they have different, interrelated solutions. </p>

<p> o Dealing with the drug problem primarily as a moral problem
is considered inappropriate and counterproductive. </p>

<p> Medical Model </p>

<p> Within the fields of medicine, the two most frequently cited
texts for the definitions of substance abuse and dependence are
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
issued by the American Psychiatric Association and used widely in
American medical practice, and the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) published by the World Health Organization
(WHO). </p>

<p> The current ICD and DSM definitions of substance dependence
are nearly identical. However, the two manuals differ sharply on
the concepts of abuse, which DSM classifies as a maladaptive
pattern of substance use leading to impairment or distress, as
manifested by one or more of several events occurring over the
same 12-month period (e.g., failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home; recurrent substance-related
legal problems, such as arrests for substance-related disorderly
conduct. The current ICD-10 category of harmful use, while
applicable cross-culturally, is limited to a pattern of
psychoactive substance use that is causing damage to health. The
damage may be physical, as in cases of hepatitis from the
self-administration of injected drugs, or mental, such as
episodes of depressive disorder secondary to heavy consumption of
alcohol (see appendix C for a full discussion of DSM and ICD
definitions). </p>

<p> Criminal Justice Model </p>

<p> While it is well-known that many crimes are committed by
persons with substance use disorders and that these disorders can
be major contributors to their crimes, the criminal justice
system has no systematic policy for the evaluation of these
disorders. In many jurisdictions, whether federal, state, or
local, the prevailing sentiment is that any use of an illicit
substance and/or use of a licit substance in an illegal manner is
considered criminal abuse. A limited set of quantitative analyses
including blood, urine, and breath tests can be performed to
detect illegal levels of alcohol and/or the presence of illicit
substances. Besides the limited amount of testing and evaluation,
psychological screening examinations or structured interviews are
used infrequently to determine the level and severity of use,
abuse, or dependence. </p>

<p> For purposes of this report, OTA does not adopt any single
definition for the terms substance abuse or substance
addiction/dependence. The focus of this report, the underlying
causes of substance abuse and addiction, relates to each of the
definitions discussed above. </p>

<p> MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM </p>

<p> The abuse of licit and illicit drugs represents a major
public health problem in the United States. Abuse of alcohol and
other drugs has been associated with many problems (see figure
2-2) costing Americans an estimated $144.1 billion annually. </p>

<p> Federal survey data estimate that 11.4 million Americans aged
12 and older used illegal drugs in 1992, continuing a steady
decline from a peak of 24 million in 1979. Findings from the 1992
National Household Survey found the following about specific
drugs: </p>

<p> o Illegal drugs. Since 1979, overall rates of current use
(defined as use within the last 30 days) have dropped in all age
groups, except those aged 35 and older, whose use of drugs has
remained level. This has resulted in a general shift in the age
distribution of illegal drug users. In 1992, 23 percent of
illegal drug users were aged 35 and older, compared with only 10
percent in 1979. </p>

<p> o Cocaine. The number of cocaine users decreased 31 percent
from 1.9 million users in 1991 to 1.3 million in 1992. This is
down from a peak of 5.8 million in 1985. The number of occasional
users (defined as those who used the drug in 1992 but less often
than monthly) also continued a sharp decline from 4.3 million in
1991 to 3.4 million in 1992. This is down from a peak of 8.6
million in 1985. Frequent use of cocaine (defined as use on a
weekly basis) remained unchanged between 1991 and 1992. In fact,
no significant change has occurred in this number since it was
first estimated in 1985. </p>

<p> o Marijuana. This is the most common illegal drug--used by 78
percent of all illegal drug users in 1992. </p>

<p> o Other illegal drugs. No major changes in the prevalence of
the use of hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP), between 1991 and 1992. The survey
estimates that approximately 1.8 million Americans have used
heroin at least once. However, the data on these categories are
somewhat unreliable, as these users are less likely to be
contacted and reported in a household survey. </p>

<p> o Alcohol. In 1992, approximately 98 million persons over the
age of 12 had used alcohol in the last month, which is
approximately 48 percent of the population aged 12 and older.
This number is down from an estimated high of 106 million
drinkers in 1988. The number of heavy drinkers (defined as having
five or more drinks per occasion on five or more days in the past
month) has remained steady at an estimated 9 million people. </p>

<p> o Tobacco. An estimated 54 million Americans were smokers in
1992, a rate of 26 percent of the population aged 12 and older.
Cigarette smoking has declined since 1988, when an estimated 57
million Americans smoked cigarettes. </p>

<p> o Smokeless tobacco. An estimated 7.5 million Americans used
smokeless tobacco in 1992, the vast majority of whom (7.1
million) were males. </p>

<p> o Inhalants. The use of inhalants (e.g., gasoline, glue, and
nitrites) dropped slightly in 1992 as compared to 1991. </p>

<p> o Prescription drugs. The estimated current nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics (sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants, or
analgesics) dropped from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> The survey also provides demographic variables useful to
understanding substance use and abuse in the United States (see
box 2-3). However, these figures, as all data on drug use, are
suspect. Most surveys have strengths and weaknesses, which have
led stakeholders and policymakers to make widely divergent
conclusions based on the same sets of data. </p>

<p> MEASURING SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE </p>

<p> Like the old fable about blind men describing an elephant,
individual drug statistics usually tell us only part of the story
(13). Each survey provides useful information, but at the same
time, each survey is flawed. Currently, no single measurement can
by itself describe drug use and abuse in all its complexity.
Nonetheless, several useful indicators do provide information to
policymakers. </p>

<p> Three major national drug monitoring systems are the primary
data source for this review: The National Household Survey on
Drug Abuse (the Household Survey), the National Survey of High
School Seniors (the Seniors Survey), and the Drug Abuse Warning
Network (DAWN). These continuing data series have been sponsored
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) since the 1970s.
Supplementary data sources include the few small area studies
that compare drug use by poverty or income status and the Drug
Use Forecasting System (DUF), sponsored by the National Institute
of Justice, which provides quarterly estimates of drug use among
the criminal population in selected cities. </p>

<p> National Household Survey on Drug Abuse </p>

<p> Since 1974, NIDA has commissioned the Household Survey every
one to three years. The survey is based on a multistage random
sample of the household population in the 48 contiguous United
States. The sample excludes persons living in group quarters,
including institutions, prisons, military quarters, and college
dormitories, and those with no permanent address, including the
homeless. </p>

<p> Since 1985, a number of enhancements have been made to the
Household Survey. In 1985, blacks and Hispanics were oversampled
to provide additional cases for subgroup analyses, and new
measures of drug use frequency were introduced to identify
persons who used drugs monthly and weekly during the previous
year. In 1991, special supplementary samples were added for six
metropolitan areas with highly publicized drug problems.
Similarly, reports published since the early 1980s provide
greater detail on the demographic characteristics of users by
frequency of use. </p>

<p> National Survey of High School Seniors </p>

<p> Every year since 1975 researchers at the University of
Michigan have surveyed a nationally representative sample of
approximately 16,000 high school seniors. Beginning in 1976, a
followup survey of members from each graduating class, including
an over-sampling of drug users, has been conducted by mail. In
1990, the followup sample included young adults aged 19 to 32. </p>

<p> Drug Abuse Warning Network </p>

<p> DAWN, established in 1972, is the federal government's major
data system for tracking patterns and trends in the serious
health consequences of drug use. DAWN reports include statistics
on the total number of hospital emergency room visits (episodes),
separate counts of the number of drugs mentioned per episode
(drug mentions), and drug-related deaths. </p>

<p> Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the DAWN program focused
primarily on data from emergency rooms and medical examiners in
27 metropolitan areas. The selection of reporting facilities,
over 700 emergency rooms and 87 medical examiners by 1989, was
not random, however, and the number of facilities reporting
varied from year to year, with facilities in metropolitan areas
being overrepresented. Beginning in 1990, DAWN implemented a
national probability sample for the collection of drug-related
emergency room visit data to allow reporting of national as well
as metropolitan area information. </p>

<p> Drug Use Forecasting System </p>

<p> DUF, initiated in 1988 by the Department of Justice, provides
estimates of drug use among booked arrestees in selected cities
based on urinalysis tests. The tests, administered shortly after
arrest, measure very recent drug use among lawbreakers. Four
times a year, samples of about 250 male adult arrestees in
participating cities are tested; some areas also test female
arrestees and juveniles. The proportion of persons arrested
explicitly on drug charges is limited to 25 percent of the total
sample. </p>

<p> Limitations of the Data </p>

<p> The national drug monitoring surveys have several limitations
for studying drug use, abuse, and addiction: </p>

<p> o Most surveys rely on self-reporting. The results of such
surveys rely on the veracity of the person responding to the
survey. A major, and widely recognized, limitation in the
national surveys is that respondents may be unwilling or unable
to report their drug use accurately. Comparisons of self-report
and urinalysis results based on DUF data indicate that, among
arrestees, the tendency to underreport drug use is substantial
(12). As one Member of Congress noted, &quot;how in the hell can
you expect people who live in households to share with anybody,
let alone the government, how often they use drugs?&quot; (3). </p>

<p> o Surveys miss populations at risk for drug abuse.
TheHousehold Survey, by definition, excludes certain groups who
do not reside in households, such as the homeless and persons in
jail or prison. Although the excluded groups represent only 2
percent of the total population, drug use may be higher, or
different, among excluded groups such as the homeless and jail or
prison inmates. The Household Survey may also fail to capture
drug users within the target population. Although overall survey
response rates are high (82 percent in 1990), drugs users may
have been more difficult to locate and interview because their
lifestyles may involve irregular hours, avoiding authority, and
other behaviors that reduce the likelihood of survey response. In
addition, response rates tend to be generally lower among young
adults and residents of metropolitan and low-income areas, and
those not interviewed may be more likely to use drugs than those
who respond to the survey. </p>

<p> o Poverty indicators per se are not available. The national
drug monitoring systems contain very limited data on poverty, and
none that meet the official poverty definition (in 1991, the
poverty thresholds varied from $6,932 for a person living alone
to $27,942 for a family of nine or more members (6). The proxy
variables relating to employment, education, place of residence,
and race and ethnicity unsuccessfully separate the effects of
income from the effects of other correlated factors. Information
on drug use by income status is available only in the most recent
Household Surveys, and then only by family income without regard
to household size. More information is provided by the Household
Survey on other variables related to poverty, including
employment status, race and ethnicity, and neighborhood
characteristics. The Seniors Survey provides no income data. For
high school seniors, the only regularly reported indicators of
socioeconomic status are college plans and parental education. No
socioeconomic indicators are available for the followup sample of
young adults except current enrollment in college. Race and
ethnic status are not regularly reported for either sample, but
for high school seniors racial and ethnic patterns of drug use
are analyzed and published separately. DAWN has severe
limitations for an analysis of poverty and drug use. The only
indicators in DAWN related to poverty are race and ethnicity. No
data are available on income status of patients or the economic
status of areas served by the facility. </p>

<p> o Surveys may over- and underrepresent findings regarding
populations at risk for drug abuse. Populations at risk for both
poverty and drug abuse, for example, are excluded or
underrepresented in the major surveys and overrepresented in
reports from hospital emergency rooms. These problems mean that
the findings from these surveys are suggestive rather than
definitive (see box 2-4). </p>

<p> o Drug measures focus on use, rather than abuse or addiction.
The common measures of drug use employed by the Household and
Seniors Surveys--lifetime, past year, and past month use--are
insufficiently refined to distinguish between casual and
dependent drug use. Definitions of alcohol, drug abuse, and
dependency --such as those set forth in DSM (1)-- link the
quantity and frequency of use to indications of persistent,
uncontrolled consumption, impaired social and psychological
functioning as a result of use, and physical problems including
withdrawal symptoms. No published estimates of the number of drug
users meeting medical criteria for abuse or dependence by poverty
indicators are available, with the single exception of the DAWN
estimates of emergency room contacts for dependency, which are
reported by race and ethnicity. </p>

<p> o The surveys include few multivariate analyses. Since the
surveys do not examine variables while controlling for factors
related to drug use, an accurate link of drug use with the role
of income, race, education, and place of residence is impossible.
The dearth of such analyses results in part from sample size
limitations and in part from the fact that secondary analyses of
the national survey data have not been encouraged. </p>

<p> ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE REPORT </p>

<p> This report has four parts: necessary preconditions,
individual factors, community contexts, and policy options. </p>

<p> The first part, Necessary Preconditions (chs. 3-5), focuses
on several factors necessary for substance abuse to occur. The
second part, Individual Factors (ch. 6), explores research
conducted on risk and protective factors thought to be indicators
in assessing an individual's substance use, abuse, and addiction.
The third part, Activity Settings (chs. 7 and 8), looks at how
risk and protective factors play out in various population
subgroups and in various community settings (home, school,
workplace, recreation, and neighborhood). The fourth section,
Policy Options (ch. 9), addresses the range of legislative issues
and options for Congress arising from chapters 3 through 8. </p>

<p> This report focuses on factors that contribute to or protect
against substance abuse and addiction, and the implications for
prevention. It does not address in any depth drug treatment or
law enforcement issues and interventions. Based on the
literatures reviewed by OTA about causes and prevention, however,
it is clear that comprehensive prevention strategies will
generally need drug treatment and law enforcement components, if
they are to be effective. While drawing on data from federal
antidrug prevention programs, the effectiveness of such
approaches needs to be studied in greater depth than was possible
in this report. </p>

<p> This report is the second and final publication of this
assessment. The first publication, a background report on
Biological Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction, described
genetic, pharmacological, and abuse liability research issues
(9). Readers are also referred to earlier OTA reports that
address issues related to drug interdiction efforts (10);
alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse prevention and services issues
in adolescent health (7); the effectiveness of drug abuse
treatment in controlling AIDS/HIV infection (11); and alternative
coca reduction strategies (8).<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 2-1: Root Causes: Two Views From the Political Arena </p>

<p> &quot;Many states and cities are on shoe-string budgets and
must provide services and alternatives to substance abuse in
local communities. The failure to address the fundamental causes
of substance abuse and to provide immediate intervention
strategies will impact city residents most... The committee
recommends that the National Drug Control Strategy be framed by
broader social and economic problems which require dramatic
reforms in order to attack the root causes of substance abuse. We
need to begin to build the infrastructure necessary to improve
the quality of treatment services by requiring medical schools to
provide comprehensive training to identify and treat substance
abusers; provide adequate treatment services at the community
level, including after care, vocational, educational, and
psychiatric assessments; and develop alternative leisure
activities for youth and adults to replace `street life' and
assist individuals to escape the drug culture.&quot; </p>

<p> House Committee on Government Operations committee report </p>

<p> &quot;One of [the Democrats'] tactics was to talk about the
root causes of drug use, the `deeper and more profound problems,'
as they put it, of homelessness, poverty, helplessness, and the
like. The elites liked this shift in emphasis, too. It took the
discussion away from moral considerations to the (for them) more
comfortable ground of social theory. They wanted to talk about
`hopelessness' as a condition caused by lack of government
involvement. We talked about hopelessness, too, but talked about
it as a condition caused by social decomposition and the
breakdown of the family and a lack of law and order in these
communities . . . I found it shocking and disappointing that when
we argued for more police, jails, courts, and prisons because of
the exploding crime epidemic in some of America's inner cities,
some people responded by saying, `But what are the root causes of
this? `That's an interesting debate which should go on at an
elite university. But if there are drug dealers going around
shooting people in the affluent suburbs, the citizenry will not
call for a seminar on root causes. They will raise hell and
demand that the dealers be arrested. And they are right to do
so.&quot; </p>

<p> BOX 2-2: Overview of Alcohol and Some Other Psychoactive
Substances <br>
</p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> ALCOHOL (ethyl alcohol) </p>

<p> Alcohol, one of the most widely used of all drugs, is a
central nervous system depressant with effects similar to those
of sedative-hypnotic compounds (see below). At low doses, alcohol
may be associated with behavioral excitation thought to be due to
the depression of inhibitory neurons in the brain. Alcohol
differs from sedative-hypnotic compounds in that it is used
primarily for recreation or social rather than medical purposes. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Beer. 2. Wine. 3. &quot;Hard&quot; liquor (e.g., whiskey,
gin).<br>
</p>

<p> SEDATIVES, HYPNOTICS, OR ANXIOLYTICS Sedative-hypnotics are
drugs of diverse chemical structure that exert a nonselective
general depressant on the central nervous system. In addition,
they reduce metabolism in a variety of tissues in the body,
depressing any system that uses energy. Depending on the dose,
any sedative hypnotic compound may be classified as a sedative
(an agent that allays excitement), a tranquilizer (an antianxiety
agent), a hypnotic (a sleep-inducing agent), or an anesthetic (an
agent that eliminates pain). Sedative-hypnotics are used
medically as sedatives, anxiolytics (antianxiety agents),
hypnotics, antiepileptics, muscle relaxants, and general
anesthetics. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Barbiturates (&quot;downers&quot; or &quot;barbs&quot;):
pentobarbital sodium[NembutalR], secobarbital sodium [SeconalR],
amobarbital [AmytalR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> 2. Nonbarbiturate hypnotics: methaqualone [QuaaludesR]--
taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Tranquilizers: diazepam [ValiumR], chlordiazepoxide
hydrochloride [LibriumR]--taken orally.<br>
</p>

<p> CANNABIS (THC) THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) the active agent in
marijuana, alters perceptions, concentration, emotions, and
behavior, though the mechanisms of action are not entirely clear.
Researchers have found, however, that THC changes the way in
which sensory information is processed by the brain. It can be
used medically to relieve nausea and side effects of chemotherapy
in cancer patients; it is very rarely used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Marijuana (&quot;pot&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;)--smoked
or eaten. 2. Hashish (&quot;hash&quot;)--smoked or eaten. 3.
Hashish oil (&quot;hash oil&quot;)--smoked (mixed with tobacco.
4. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-- taken orally in capsules.<br>
</p>

<p> NICOTINE Nicotine, obtained naturally from tobacco, is a
central nervous system stimulant.(c) It exerts its action
secondary to stimulation of certain cholinergic (excitatory)
synapses both within the brain and in the peripheral nervous
system. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cigarettes. 2. Smokeless tobacco (e.g., snuff or chewing
tobacco). <br>
</p>

<p> COCAINE Cocaine, obtained naturally from coca leaves, is a
potent central nervous system stimulant.(c) It stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system, which regulates the activity of
cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. It also produces
bronchodilation in the lungs. It is used medically as a topical
anesthetic for surgical procedures. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cocaine hydrochloride powder (&quot;coke&quot; or
&quot;street cocaine&quot;)--usually snorted or injected
intravenously.d </p>

<p> 2. Cocaine alkaloid (&quot;freebase&quot; or
&quot;crack&quot;)--smoked.e <br>
</p>

<p> AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED STIMULANTSf 1. Amphetamines
Amphetamines are a group of three closely related compounds, all
of which are potent central nervous system and behavioral
stimulants.(c) Some amphetamines are used medically to treat
attention deficit disorder or minimal brain dysfunction in
children, narcolepsy (recurrent, uncontrollable, brief episodes
of sleep), or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;uppers&quot;
(BenzedrineR]--taken orally, injected, or snorted.(g) </p>

<p> 2. Methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;crystal
meth&quot; or &quot;ice&quot;) [MethadrineR]--taken orally,
injected, or snorted.(g,h) </p>

<p> 3. Dextroamphetamine [DexedrineR]--taken orally, or injected.
<br>
</p>

<p> 2. Nonamphetamine stimulants Like amphetamines,
nonamphetamine stimulates are central nervous and behavioral
stimulants. Some non-amphetamine stimulants (e.g., PreludinR) are
used for weight control, and some (e.g., RitalinR and CylertR)
are used medically to treat hyperactivity, minimal brain
dysfunction, narcolepsy, or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Pheumetrazine hydrochloride [PreludinR]--taken orally or
injected.d </p>

<p> 2. Methylphenidate hydrochloride injected.d </p>

<p> 3. Pemoline [CylertR]--taken orally. [RitalinR]--taken
orally, or injected.(d) </p>

<p> HALLUCINOGENS Hallucinogens, or psychedelics, are a
heterogeneous group of compounds that affect a person's
perceptions, sensations, thinking, self-awareness, and
emotions.(i) </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or
&quot;acid&quot;--taken orally or put in the eyes. </p>

<p> 2. Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethylox- phenylethyl amide) or
&quot;mesc&quot; and peyote--disks chewed, swallowed, or smoked;
tablets taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Psilocybin (&quot;magic mushrooms&quot;)--chewed and
swallowed. 4. MDMA (methylene dioxymethamphetamine)--taken
orally. </p>

<p> INHALANTS Inhalants are chemicals that produce psychoactive
vapors. Although different in makeup, nearly all of the abused
inhalants produce effects similar to those of anesthetics, which
act to slow down the body's functions or produce feelings of
dizziness. At low doses, users may feel slightly stimulated. Amyl
nitrite is used for heart patients because it dilates the blood
vessels and increases blood supply to the heart. There are no
medical indications for most of the inhalants. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Solvents (model airplane glue, nail polish remover,
lighter and cleaning fluids, and gasoline)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 2. Aerosols (e.g., paints, hairsprays)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 3. Some anesthetics (e.g.,nitrous oxide)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Amyl nitrite (&quot;snappers&quot; or &quot;poppers&quot;)
and butyl nitrite (&quot;rush&quot;)--vapors inhaled.<br>
</p>

<p> OPIATES (NARCOTICS) AND RELATED ANALGESICS Opiates are
natural or synthetic drugs that, like morphine, a substance
derived from the opium poppy, have analgesic (pain-relieving)
properties. Heroin is not approved for medical uses in the United
States. The major medical use of other opiates is for the relief
of pain (i.e., as analgesics); some narcotics are used to relieve
coughing (i.e., as antitussives) or to treat diarrhea. Methadone
is used in the treatment of narcotic abstinence syndromes and as
an analgesic in terminal illness.<br>
</p>

<p> 1. Heroin (&quot;smack&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;)--
injected, smoked, or inhaledd. </p>

<p> 2. Codeine (codeine sulfate)--taken orally or injected.d </p>

<p> 3. Morphine (morphine hydrochloride)--injected, smoked, or
inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Synthetic opiates (e.g., methadone [DolophineR]);
hydromorphone hydrochloride [DilaudidR], meperidine hydrochloride
[DemerolR], oxycodone and asprin [PercodanR]-- taken orally or
injected. </p>

<p> PCP (PHENCYCLIDINE) AND SIMILARLY ACTING SYMPHATHOMIMETICS </p>

<p> Phencycyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, alters the
functions of the neocortex and has been called a dissociative
anesthetic. It was developed in the 1950s as an anesthetic but
was subsequently taken off the market in 1967 when it was
discovered that the drug caused hallucinations in some people.(j)
PCP is now used legally only in veterinary medicine as an
immobilizing agent. </p>

<p> PCP (&quot;angel dust&quot; or &quot;lovely&quot;)--taken
orally, or smoked (sprayed on joints or cigarettes).(d) </p>

<p> ______________ (a) According to Julien, one could conceivably
classify psychoactive drugs by at least three methods: 1)
mechanism of action, 2) chemical structure, and 3) behavioral
effects. Probably the most useful approach would be to classify
them by mechanism of action, but knowledge of the brain's
physiology is too limited for this approach to be comprehensive.
A limitation of the second approach is that many drugs of
apparently similar structure exert quite different effects, and
many drugs of dissimilar structure exert quite similar effects.
The classification in this table largely reflects the behavioral
effects approach. The classification used here is based on the
categories in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., revised.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, all of the
classes of psychoactive substances listed in this box except
nicotine are associated with both abuse and dependence. Nicotine
is associated with dependence but not abuse. </p>

<p> (b) The potential physiological, psychological, and
behavioral effects of using the psychoactive substance shown are
discussed in the sources listed below. The consequences depend in
part on the specific drug used, the dosage level and mode of
administration. </p>

<p> (c) Central nervous system stimulants are drugs that can
elevate mood, increase alertness, reduce fatigue, provide a sense
of increased energy, decrease appetite, and improve task
performance. They can also produce anxiety, insomnia, and
irritability. The drugs differ widely in their molecular
structures and mechanisms of action. </p>

<p> (d) According to the American Psychiatric Association, the
route of administration of a psychoactive substance is an
important variable in determining whether use will lead to
dependence or abuse. In general, routes of administration that
produce more efficient absorption of the substance in the blood
stream (e.g., intravenous injection) tend to increase the
likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance uses that leads
to dependence. Routes that quickly deliver psychoactive
substances to the brain (e.g., smoking or intravenous injection)
are associated with higher levels of consumption and with an
increased likelihood of toxic effects. Use of contaminated
needles for intravenous administration of amphetamines, cocaine,
and opiates can cause hepatitis, HIV infection, and other
illnesses. </p>

<p> (e) Freebase cocaine is a form of cocaine made by converting
&quot;street cocaine&quot; (cocaine hydrochloride) to a purified
base that is smoked. The effect of smoking freebase is similar to
that of intravenous injection but smoking provides a shorter more
intense high than sniffing or ingestion because of the rapid
absorption of the drug through the lungs. &quot;Crack
cocaine&quot; is the street name given to freebase cocaine that
has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a chemical base
by cooking it with baking soda and water. The term crack refers
to the cracking sound that is heard when the mixture is smoked
(heated), presumably due to the sodium bicarbonate. </p>

<p> (f) Describing a drug as a stimulant does not adequately
describe its properties. Drug use surveys typically mean
amphetamines when they use the word stimulants. Some surveys
regard as stimulants both prescription (amphetamines) and
nonprescription substances (e.g., caffeine-based compounds used
in No-Doz, diet pills, and &quot;fake pep pills&quot;). Cocaine
and nicotine (described above) are also central nervous system
simulants. </p>

<p> (g) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
designer drugs are structural analogs of substances scheduled
under the Controlled Substances Act that are prepared by
underground chemists to mimic the psychoactive effects of
controlled substances or produce other psychoactive effects.
Because such analogs are not identical to their parent compound,
their manufacture and distribution does not violate the law. As
of June 1986, there were synthetic analogs of PCP, fentanyl and
meperidine, and amphetamine and methamphetamine. </p>

<p> (h) In the past, abuse of methamphetamine had been in the
form of tablets or intravenous injection. More recently,
&quot;ice&quot; (one of the common street names for
d-methamphetamine hydrochloride) has gained popularity in a form
suitable for smoking. </p>

<p> (i) Most of the agents in this class of drugs can induce
hallucinations if the dose is high enough. But the term
hallucinogen does not adequately describe the range of
pharmacological actions of the diverse group of substances
usually included in the class. The term psychedelic was proposed
by Osmond in 1957 to imply that these agents all have the ability
to alter the sensory perception and thus may be considered
&quot;mind expanding.&quot; The effects of hallucinogens are
unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the user's
personality, mood and expectations, and the surroundings in which
the drug is used. </p>

<p> (j) PCP is considered a hallucinogen in some surveys of drug
use.<br>

<p> BOX 2-4: Two Contrasting Surveys Measuring Cocaine Use </p>

<p> Because of populations not represented in the Household
Surveys (including homeless, run-away children, and
institutionalized populations such as the incarcerated), the
surveys may greatly underestimate the involvement of the poor in
drug use. Two years ago, for example, Abt Associates conducted a
study to determine the number of heavy cocaine users in the
United States. Two measures of heavy cocaine use were employed,
both of which measured use of cocaine in the very recent past.
Estimates of the number of regular weekly cocaine users from the
1990 Household Survey were compared to estimates of the number of
recent cocaine users based on urinalysis tests of arrestees from
the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program. DUF urinalysis tests were
conducted at the time of booking, and the results measured
cocaine use during the day or two before arrest. DUF estimates
therefore measured the prevalence of very recent drug use among
those involved with the criminal justice system in selected major
cities. </p>

<p> The two data systems generated significantly different
estimates. From the Household Survey, Abt estimated that there
were about 662,000 heavy cocaine users in this country in 1990.
This is substantially lower than the Abt estimate of 1.709
million heavy cocaine users derived from DUF data. Reasons for
the differences include both possible underreporting on the
Household Survey and the fact that many heavy cocaine users may
be excluded from the household population or may be exceedingly
difficult to locate and interview. Overall, the study indicated
that approximately two-thirds of the heavy cocaine users in this
country are not counted by the Household Survey and that
approximately 87 percent of all heavy cocaine users are involved
with the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 3 BIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY <br>

</p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction are complex phenomena that defy
simple explanation or description. A tangled interaction of
factors contribute to an individual's seeking out, use, and
perhaps subsequent abuse of drugs. Since more individuals
experiment with drugs than eventually develop substance abuse
problems, great interest persists in understanding what
differentiates these groups. Factors that can play a role in drug
abuse susceptibility include a person's psychological makeup
(e.g., self-esteem, propensity to take risks, impulsivity,
depression), biological response to drugs, environmental
situation (e.g., peer groups, family organization, socioeconomic
status), and the availability of drugs. The exact combination of
elements that lead to substance abuse varies among individuals. <br>
</p>

<p> Underlying all substance use, abuse and addiction are the
actions and effects that drugs of abuse exert. For a complete
understanding of drug abuse and addiction one must address how
drugs affect the brain, why certain drugs have the potential for
being abused, and what, if any, biological differences exist
among individuals in their susceptibility to abuse drugs. While
many other factors ultimately contribute to an individual's
drug-taking behavior, understanding the biological components is
crucial in understanding substance abuse, addiction, and
dependency.<br>
</p>

<p> Two biological factors contribute to substance use, abuse,
and addiction: the effects drugs of abuse exert on a person; and
the biological status of the individual taking drugs. The former
relates to the acute mechanisms of action of drugs in the brain
and the long-term effects that occur after chronic exposure. The
latter pertains to an individual's biological constitution, most
importantly the presence of inherited characteristics that affect
that person's response to a drug.<br>
</p>

<p> The biological mechanisms of substance abuse are complex and
interactive. A previously published background paper by the
Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) entitled Biological
Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction thoroughly discusses
the basic concepts, neuropharmacology, and genetics of drug
abuse. This chapter is a synopsis of the background paper.<br>
</p>

<p> DRUG ACTION <br>
</p>

<p> Acute Actions <br>
</p>

<p> Drugs of abuse alter the brain's normal balance and level of
biochemical activity (see box 3-1). In order to have these
affects, a drug must first reach the brain. This is accomplished
by the drug diffusing from the circulatory system into the brain.
The routes of administration, methods by which a drug enters the
bloodstream, affect how quickly a drug penetrates the brain. The
chemical structure of a drug plays an important role in the
ability of a drug to cross from the circulatory system into the
brain. The four main routes of administration for drugs of abuse
are oral, nasal, intravenous, and inhalation. With oral
ingestion, the drug must be absorbed by the stomach or gut which
results in a delay before effects become apparent. When the nasal
route of administration is used, effects are usually felt within
3 minutes, as the capillary rich mucous membranes of the nose
rapidly absorb substances into the bloodstream. Intravenous
administration usually produces effects in 1/2 to 2 minutes and
is slowed only by the detour back through the lungs that venous
blood must take to reach the brain. Lastly, the inhalation method
bypasses the venous system completely because the drug is
absorbed into the pulmonary circulation which goes directly from
the lungs to the heart and then to the brain. As a result,
effects are felt within 5 to 10 seconds, making inhalation the
fastest route of administration. The route of administration can
determine the drug's potency and the efficacy the drug will have
on affecting brain activity, thereby contributing to the abuse
potential of the drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Distinct from other psychoactive agents, drugs of abuse, in
part, affect those areas of the brain that mediate feelings of
pleasure and reward (see box 3-2). Evidence is accumulating that
positive sensations experienced during these activities are
mediated by the brain reward system. Studies have shown that
direct stimulation of the areas of the brain involved in the
reward system, in the absence of any goal-seeking behavior,
produces extreme pleasure that has strong reinforcing properties
in its own right (48,60). Animals with electrodes implanted in
these areas in such a way that electrical impulses produce a
pleasurable sensation will repeatedly press a bar, or do any
other required task, to receive electrical stimulation. The fact
that animals will forego food and drink or will willingly
experience a painful stimulus to receive stimulation of the
reward system attests to the powerful reinforcing characteristics
of the reward system. Most drugs of abuse, either directly or
indirectly, are presumed to affect the brain reward system.<br>
</p>

<p> Inducing activity in the brain reward system gives drugs of
abuse positive reinforcing actions that support their continued
use and abuse. Drug reinforcement is defined as increasing the
behavior that led to the taking of the drug. Put more simply,
individuals who use drugs experience some effect, such as
pleasure, detachment, or relief from distress which initially
establishes and then maintains drug self-administration. The
consequence of taking the drug enhances the probability that it
will continue to be used for some real or perceived effect and,
hence, tends to lead to continued compulsive self-administration.
In fact, the ability of a drug to support self-administration in
experimental animals is a measure of the drug's strength as a
reinforcer.<br>
</p>

<p> While growing evidence suggests that the brain reward system
plays a role in the reinforcing properties of most drugs of
abuse, the precise mechanisms involved are complex, vary among
substances, and have yet to be completely described (41,42,43).
For example, while some drugs of abuse directly affect the
chemical release of dopamine (see box 3-3), the interactions of
other neurotransmitters such as gamma amino butyric acid (GABA),
opioid peptides, and serotonin may also be important.<br>
</p>

<p> Chronic Actions <br>
</p>

<p> Chronic, long-term exposure to drugs of abuse can cause
changes in the brain that may take weeks, months, and possibly
years, to reverse once drug use has stopped.<br>
</p>

<p> Most drugs of abuse have complex actions in the brain and
other parts of the body resulting in a variety of behavioral
effects. In general, tolerance develops to many of the effects of
drugs of abuse and a withdrawal syndrome occurs on cessation
after prolonged use. However, the details of these phenomena vary
from drug to drug, and the specific details of the biological
mechanisms that underlie these phenomena are not completely
understood. Recent advances in neuroscience research have begun
to unravel how neuroadaptive responses manifest themselves for
various drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Tolerance to a drug develops when, following a prolonged
period of use, more of the drug is required to produce a given
effect (33,38). This response occurs with many types of drugs. It
is a common, but unnecessary, characteristic of drug abuse (see
box 3-4). For example, while tolerance develops to some of the
effects of cocaine and amphetamines, sensitization can also occur
to some of their other effects. Also, while it is unclear from
available data whether tolerance develops to cocaine's
reinforcing effects, the notion is supported by some experimental
evidence and anecdotal reports from cocaine users that the drug's
euphoric action diminishes with repeated use. In a recent study,
it has been shown that acute tolerance to dopamine response is
induced by binge patterns of cocaine administration in male rats
(51). Tolerance develops to most of the effects, including the
reinforcing properties, of opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p> Sensitization, the opposite of tolerance, occurs when the
effects of a given dose of a drug increase after repeated, but
intermittent, administration. Sensitization to a drug's effects
can play a significant role in supporting drug- taking behavior.<br>
</p>

<p> Dependence is a type of neuroadaptation to drug exposure.
With prolonged use of a drug, cells in the brain adapt to its
presence such that the drug is required to maintain normal cell
function. On abrupt withdrawal of the drug, the cell behaves
abnormally and a withdrawal syndrome ensues. Generally, the
withdrawal syndrome is characterized by a series of signs and
symptoms that are opposite to those of the drug's acute effects.
For example, withdrawal of sedative drugs produce excitation and
irritability. Conversely, withdrawal of stimulants produces
profound depression.<br>
</p>

<p> The magnitude of the withdrawal syndrome varies from drug to
drug. Although the severity varies, withdrawal is associated with
the cessation of use of most drugs of abuse. Opiates, cocaine,
amphetamines, barbiturates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines produce
pronounced and sometimes severe withdrawal symptoms
(20,24,56,68,74) while those for nicotine and caffeine are less
intense (1,31). A mild withdrawal episode is associated with
discontinued cannabis use, while none is associated with lysergic
acid diethylamide (LSD) use (12,63). No matter the severity of
the physical withdrawal syndrome, its existence can create a
craving or desire for the drug and dependence can play a very
strong role in recurrent patterns of relapse and maintaining
drug-seeking behavior to forestall withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> At one time, withdrawal was believed to peak within several
hours after drug-taking was discontinued and then dissipate;
similarly, common knowledge held that tolerance to most drugs was
thought to dissipate gradually with time, as the brain readapted
to the drug's disappearance. Substantial evidence now indicates
that persistent, residual neuroadaptations are present, which can
last for months or possibly years, and may or may not be
associated with the pathways that mediate physical dependence
(33,44,45,77). An important component of this phenomena may be
the learning which takes place during drug-taking behavior.
Moreover, with repeated cycles of abstinence and reinitiation of
drug use, the time required to elicit drug dependence grows
shorter and shorter. Evidence also indicates that the
administration of naloxone, a drug that blocks the actions of
opiates, may elicit a withdrawal syndrome in individuals who have
abstained from use for extended periods of time. These data
indicate the existence of long-lasting, drug- induced
neuroadaptive changes that persist for as yet undefined periods
of time. Although information explaining this effect is lacking,
these changes may help account for the relapses that sometimes
occur in long-term abstinent, drug-dependent individuals. <br>
</p>

<p> Abuse Liability <br>
</p>

<p> The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act
(Public Law 91-513) and the Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978
(Public Law 95-633) gives exclusive authority to the Secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services to determine the
abuse liability of substances and to make recommendations
concerning substance regulation and other drug policy decisions.
Although the Secretary receives advice from the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and
various other regulatory agencies, these laws explicitly state
that the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) must provide to
the Secretary information relevant to the abuse potential of
suspected drugs of abuse and all facts key to an assessment of
their abuse potential. On the basis of this information from
NIDA, and input from FDA and DEA, the Secretary makes a judgment
as to the dependence potential of new drugs. NIDA supports a
variety of activities in commercial and private laboratories
around the country to provide this information. <br>
</p>

<p> A drug's abuse liability is measured by the likelihood that
its use will result in drug addiction. Many factors ultimately
play a role in an individual's drug-taking behavior;
nevertheless, the abuse potential of a drug is related to its
intrinsic rewarding properties and/or the presumed neuroadaptive
motivational effects that result from its prolonged use. Drugs
can be tested and screened for their abuse liability in animals.
Four criteria can be evaluated to classify a drug as having
significant abuse potential:<br>
</p>

<p> o pharmacological equivalence to known drugs of abuse,<br>
</p>

<p> o demonstration of reinforcing effects,<br>
</p>

<p> o tolerance, and<br>
</p>

<p> o physical dependence.<br>
</p>

<p> The capacity to produce reinforcing effects is essential to
any drug with significant abuse potential, whereas tolerance and
physical dependence often occur but are not absolutely required
to make such a determination.<br>
</p>

<p> Testing new pharmaceuticals for their abuse potential is an
important step in new drug development. Many major pharmaceutical
firms today emphasize the development of new and safer drugs for
pain reduction and in the development of psychoactive compounds
for treatment of brain disorders. In particular, scientific
strides in understanding the brain, neurological disease,
psychiatric disturbances, and aging are fueling research into
treatment of brain disorders. As psychoactive compounds become
available, they must be screened for abuse potential. The abuse
liability assessment of new products is not simply at the
discretions of the manufacturer. Various federal regulatory laws
mandate such testing and federal regulatory agencies are charged
with seeing that testing is carried out. The College on Problems
of Drug Dependence (CPDD), and, specifically, its Drug Evaluation
Committee (DEC), provides the majority of abuse liability testing
information to NIDA.<br>
</p>

<p> Animal models are generally used to screen for the abuse
potential of new drugs in earlier stages of drug development or
to evaluate abuse potential in drugs that cannot be readily
studied in humans (2). Laboratory methods for abuse potential
evaluation in humans are also well developed and is an area of
active research (21). However, factors such as the heterogeneity
of drug-using populations, the use of multiple drugs, and the
other biological, social, and environmental factors involved in
human drug use make human studies complex.<br>
</p>

<p> In terms of the validity of animal models as a means of
studying human drug addiction, an excellent correlation exists
between predicting the abuse liability of specific classes of
drugs in animals and humans (34). However, it is recognized that
animal models are imperfect and, in fact, there are examples of
drugs that proved to have significant abuse potential in humans,
whereas the preclinical testing in animals revealed relatively
minimal abuse potential (9,33,38). The ultimate answer to the
issue of whether a drug has significant abuse potential is
long-term experience with the drug once it has become available,
either legally or illegally. Nevertheless, animal models serve as
the only practical means of initially screening drugs for abuse
liability and have proven to be the most effective means of
detecting whether there is likely to be a problem in humans.<br>
</p>

<p> Self-Administration <br>
</p>

<p> The predominant feature of all drugs with significant
addiction-producing properties is that they are self-
administered. In fact, self-administration of a drug to the point
when the behavior becomes detrimental to the individual is the
primary criterion for classifying a drug as having significant
abuse potential for addiction. In addition to
self-administration, another contributing factor to abuse
liability is the notion of craving (9,33,38). Although craving is
a difficult term to quantify, once a drug is voluntarily or
involuntarily withdrawn, the increased desire to take the drug
can play a role in the relapse to substance abuse. As previously
mentioned, the reinforcing properties of the drug may shift the
pattern of administration established during the initial, early
phase of drug?addiction. Specifically, the drug may have
initially been self-administered for its pleasurable effects but
may eventually be self-administered to relieve the discomfort
associated with withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> Animals can be readily trained to self-administer drugs in a
variety of settings (9). Animal models of self- administration
provide a powerful tool that can give a good indication of the
abuse liability of new or unknown drugs. These models also permit
examination of the behavioral, physiological, and biological
factors leading to sustained self-administration.<br>
</p>

<p> Drug Discrimination <br>
</p>

<p> Another tool in the assessment of abuse liability of drugs is
drug discrimination, which refers to the perception of the
effects of drugs (3,9). Specifically, animals or humans trained
to discriminate a drug from a placebo show a remarkable ability
to discriminate it from other drugs with different properties.
These procedures also permit a determination of whether the
subject considers the drug to be the pharmacological equivalent
of another drug. Pharmacological equivalence refers to the fact
that drugs of particular classes, such as opiates, stimulants,
and depressants cause a series of affects on the brain and other
organs which collectively constitute their pharmacological
profile. Drug discrimination provides a useful measure in animals
to assess the subjective effects of drugs in humans.<br>
</p>

<p> Dependence and Tolerance <br>
</p>

<p> Physical dependence and tolerance to drugs of abuse can
readily be induced in animals by chronic administration of these
drugs (37,38). Following abrupt cessation of these drugs, a
withdrawal syndrome will often develop and, if given the
opportunity, self-administration rates will be increased.
Furthermore, since the understanding of the biological changes
which take place during the development of physical dependence
and tolerance are poorly understood in humans, with the possible
exception of opiate dependency (45), animal models offer a unique
opportunity to carry out experiments designed to address these
issues.<br>
</p>

<p> GENETIC FACTORS <br>
</p>

<p> Why does one person abuse or become dependent on drugs while
another, exposed to a similar environment and experiences, does
not? To date, the majority of biomedical research has focused on
the role, if any, that genetics plays in individual
susceptibility to substance abuse and dependence. There is
growing interest, however, in researching other factors that
effect a person's biological status. For example, nutrition,
biological development, in utero experiences, early exposure to
environmental lead, head injuries, and other environmental
components, can modify individual neurophysiology. Thus, while
this section features genetics, there are many other factors that
can influence individual biological susceptibility to the effects
of a drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Progress in understanding the genetics of various conditions
and diseases has brought with it a realization that substance
abuse and addiction probably involve a genetic component. That
is, hereditary biological differences among individuals may make
some more or less susceptible to drug dependency than others.
However, a genetic component alone is undoubtedly insufficient to
precipitate substance abuse and addiction. Unlike disorders such
as Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis that result from the
presence of alterations in a single gene, any genetic component
of substance abuse is likely to involve multiple genes that
control various aspects of the biological response to drugs,
individual temperament, and the propensity to engage in
risk-taking behaviors, or physiological predisposition to become
an abuser. In addition, the involvement of many behavioral and
environmental factors indicates that any genetic component acts
in consort with other nongenetic risk factors to contribute to
the development of substance abuse and addiction. Thus, the
presence or absence of a genetic factor neither ensures drug
addiction nor precludes it. Two questions arise when considering
a genetic component to substance abuse and addiction. Do
inherited factors exist? If so, what are they? To date, most of
the work done in this field is related to alcoholism; much less
is known about the genetics of other drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Do Inherited Factors Exist? <br>
</p>

<p> Results from family, twin, and adoption studies as well as
extensive research on animal models indicate that there are
heritable influences on patterns of alcohol use. Animal studies
using selective breeding techniques have established that alcohol
preference, the reinforcing actions of alcohol, alcohol
tolerance, and alcohol physical dependence can be affected by
genetic factors. Although fewer studies have examined the genetic
component of vulnerability to the addictive properties of other
drugs of abuse, evidence from animal studies confirms the role of
a genetic influence on the use and abuse of drugs other than
alcohol. To study nonalcoholic drug abuse in humans has been
difficult because of substantially lower population prevalence
and marked changes in availability and, hence, exposure to these
substances. Investigation in this area is further hampered by the
complexity of subjects' drug use--most drug abusers have used
(and had problems from using) multiple substances. This has led
researchers either to concentrate on one class of drug or to
treat all illicit drug use as equivalent. The tendency to lump
all illicit drugs into one category makes results difficult to
interpret or compare.<br>
</p>

<p> Family Studies: Alcoholism <br>
</p>

<p> References to a familial tendency or hereditary
&quot;taint&quot; of alcoholism date back to classical times
(23). Family studies have repeatedly confirmed that the risk of
alcoholism is higher among first-degree relatives (i.e., parents,
siblings, children) of alcoholics as compared with the general
population (54). Moreover, while family studies can establish
that a disorder (or liability to a disorder) is transmitted, in
general they fail to distinguish between biological and
environmental transmission. This issue, however, can be evaluated
in large family studies by analyzing multiple classes of
relatives with differing degrees of genetic relatedness.<br>
</p>

<p> Results of numerous family studies indicate that alcoholism
segregates within families, with male first-degree relatives of
alcoholics having a higher incidence (ranging from 27 to 54
percent) than female first-degree relatives (6 to 17 percent) as
compared to first-degree relatives of nonalcoholics (20 percent
of males, 4 percent of females) (26,66,76). In fitting models of
inheritance to family data, researchers concluded that observed
patterns of inheritance were consistent with the hypothesis that
familial factors predisposing to alcoholism were the same in men
and women, but that nonfamilial environmental factors exerted
more influence in the development of alcoholism in women (14).
However, a review of drug abuse research on women presented
several comparative studies of men and women showing that
alcoholism among some women appeared more highly correlated with
a family history of alcohol problems. Compared to alcoholic men
in various studies, alcoholic women had a greater likelihood of
having an alcoholic father and/or parents, as well as alcoholic
siblings (47). Additionally, while perhaps not genetically
influenced, familial alcoholics (those with at least one relative
with alcoholism) appear to have earlier onset, more antisocial
symptoms, more social complications of alcohol use, and worse
treatment outcome than nonfamilial alcoholics (22,62,70).<br>
</p>

<p> Familial is not identical to genetic, and in the case of
alcoholism, the familial patterns of inheritance are not
consistent with those of a purely genetic condition (36,79). In
addition, researchers suggest that the transmissibility of
alcoholism has increased over time (65). Thus, any genetic
factors promoting the development of alcoholism are significantly
moderated by nongenetic influences. <br>
</p>

<p> Family Studies: Other Drugs <br>
</p>

<p> Although fewer family studies have been conducted on the
genetic transmission of liability to other drugs of abuse,
researchers suggest that, as in the case of alcohol, addiction to
other psychoactive substances appears to run in families.<br>
</p>

<p> One study found evidence of drug use running in families,
based on family history obtained from individuals admitted for
substance abuse treatment (53). However, this study combined use
of all illicit drugs into one category and relied on self-reports
by the subject on his or her drug use as well as that of family
members. A large family interview of opiate addicts found that
the relatives of opiate users had elevated rates of drug
addiction as compared with the controls (67). In addition, an
association was found between opiate use and the presence of
antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Further analysis of these
data revealed that the incidence of both drug abuse and ASPD was
higher among the siblings of the opiate subjects than among their
parents (49,50). <br>
</p>

<p> A familial association between opiate addiction and
alcoholism has been noted in some studies (46). However, another
family history study found that while both opiate addiction and
alcoholism clustered within families, co- occurrence of the
disorders within families occurred only as frequently as expected
by chance, thus supporting the hypothesis of independent
transmission (29).<br>
</p>

<p> Little has been done to test hypotheses regarding familial
transmission of liability to addiction to specific substances
other than opiates or alcohol. One study examining treated drug
abusers and their relatives found that alcoholism was equally
common among relatives of individuals who preferentially abused
opiates, cocaine, or sedative-hypnotics (27 percent, 31 percent,
and 24 percent of male relatives, respectively), whereas
relatives of sedative-hypnotic users were subject to diagnoses of
other substance abuses (2 percent of male relatives, versus 11
percent of male relatives of opiate abusers and 16 percent of
male relatives of cocaine abusers) (55). <br>
</p>

<p> Twin and Adoption Studies <br>
</p>

<p> Twin and adoption studies provide information to distinguish
between biological and cultural transmission. Twin studies
observe siblings raised in the same environment, but compare how
often identical twins, who are genetically identical, and
fraternal twins, who have the genetic similarity of nontwin
siblings are concordant for a trait. A high concordance rate for
a trait among identical twins versus fraternal twins usually
indicates a genetic component for the trait. Adoption studies, by
contrast, compare the presence of a trait among biological versus
adoptive family members or other control groups. In this way
individuals sharing the same environment but having different
genetic heritages, or vice versa, can be compared.<br>
</p>

<p> Evidence from twin studies suggests genetic influences on
drinking patterns as well as alcohol-related problems. Results
from twin studies demonstrate genetic influences on measures of
alcohol consumption such as abstention, average alcohol intake,
and heavy alcohol use (28,39,61). Twin studies also indicate an
inherited risk for smoking (16).<br>
</p>

<p> When evaluating the development of alcoholism, twin studies
have generally supported the existence of genetic influences over
the disorder's development. One early study found a higher
concordance rate for alcohol abuse between identical twins (54
percent) than in fraternal twins (28 percent) (35), while two
other studies did not find such a relationship (25,61). A 1991
study examined male and female identical twin pairs, and male and
female fraternal twin pairs, with one member of the pair meeting
the criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence (64). Researchers
found that identical male twins differed from fraternal male
twins in the frequencies of both alcohol abuse and dependence as
well as other substance abuse and/or dependence. On the other
hand, female identical and fraternal twins were equally likely to
abuse alcohol and/or become dependent on other substances, but
identical female twins were more likely to become alcohol
dependent. Another study of 356 twin pairs also found higher
identical than fraternal rates of concordance for problems
related to alcohol and drug use as well as conduct disorder (52).
The same study also noted that among men, heritability played a
greater role in the early rather than late onset of alcohol
problems, whereas no such effect was seen among women. However, a
study of 1,030 female twin pairs found evidence for substantial
heritability of liability to alcoholism, ranging from 50 to 60
percent (40).<br>
</p>

<p> Thus, twin studies provide general agreement that genetic
factors influence certain aspects of drinking. Most twin studies
also show genetic influence over pathological drinking, including
the diagnosis of alcoholism, which appears (like many other
psychiatric disorders) to be moderately heritable. Whether
genetic factors operate comparably in men and women, and whether
severity of alcoholism influences twin concordance is less clear.
How psychiatric comorbidity may affect heritability of alcoholism
also remains to be clarified. <br>
</p>

<p> Adoption studies have supported the role of heritable factors
in risk for alcoholism (6,11,71). The results from a series of
studies conducted in Denmark during the 1970s are typical.
Researchers studied male adoptees, later comparing them with
nonadopted brothers; female adoptees, later comparing them with
nonadopted daughters of alcoholics, comparisons were also made
with matched control adoptees. Sons of alcoholic and nonalcoholic
parents who were put up for adoption were compared for the
development of alcoholism. Sons of alcoholic parents were found
to be four times as likely as sons of nonalcoholic parents to
have developed alcoholism; evidence also suggested that the
alcoholism in these cases was more severe. The groups differed
little on other variables, including prevalence of other
psychiatric illness or &quot;heavy drinking.&quot; Being raised
by an alcoholic biological parent did not further increase the
likelihood of developing alcoholism; that is, rates of alcoholism
did not differ between the adopted-away children and their
nonadopted brothers. In contrast, a study of daughters of
alcoholics revealed no elevated risk of alcoholism (23).<br>
</p>

<p> Another analysis examined factors promoting drug abuse as
well as alcoholism (10). In this study, all classes of illicit
drug use were categorized into a single category of drug abuse.
Most of the 40 adopted drug abusers examined had coexisting ASPD
and alcoholism; the presence of ASPD correlated highly with drug
abuse. Among those without ASPD, a biological background of
alcoholism (i.e., alcoholism in a biological parent) was
associated with drug abuse. Also, turmoil in the adoptive family
(divorce or psychiatric disturbance) was associated with
increased odds for drug abuse in the adoptee.<br>
</p>

<p> Finally, results from other adoption studies suggest two
forms of alcohol abuse (7,13). The two forms were originally
classified by C.R. Cloninger as &quot;milieu-limited&quot; or
type 1 alcohol abuse and &quot;male-limited&quot; or type 2
alcohol abuse (15). Type 1 alcohol abuse is characterized by
moderate alcohol problems and minimal criminal behavior in the
parents, and is generally mild, but occasionally severe,
depending on presence of a provocative environment. Type 2 is
associated with severe alcohol abuse and criminality in the
biological fathers. In the adoptees, it is associated with
recurrent problems and appears to be unaffected by postnatal
environment.<br>
</p>

<p> While the appropriateness of the biological and environmental
parameters used in the Cloninger study have been challenged, the
discriminating characteristics used to classify individuals as
type 1 or 2 alcohol abusers have not been--until recently. A new
study of familial and nonfamilial male alcoholics has
investigated the type 1 and 2 classifications by analyzing the
importance of age differences and cohort distributions (19). The
researchers showed that among the male alcoholics, there was not
a clear distinction between familial and nonfamilial based
alcohol abuse problems and type 1 or 2 characteristics, as
reported in previous studies. Additionally, another recent
publication discusses the absence of paternal sociopathy in the
etiology of severe alcoholism, and the possibility of a type 3
alcoholism (30). This type of research raises obvious questions
as to the validity of the discriminating characteristics
originally outlined by Cloninger and currently used in the
classification of individual alcohol abusers.<br>
</p>

<p> In summary, adoption studies of alcoholism clearly indicate
the role of biological, presumably genetic, factors in the
genesis of alcoholism. They do not exclude, however, a possible
role for nongenetic, environmental factors as well. Moreover,
researchers have suggested more than one kind of biological
background may be conducive to alcoholism. In particular, one
pattern of inheritance suggests a relationship between parental
antisocial behavior and alcoholism in the next generation. Thus,
adoption studies, like other designs, suggest that even at the
genetic level, alcoholism is not a homogeneous construct.<br>
</p>

<p> What Is Inherited? <br>
</p>

<p> While study results indicate a probable genetic component to
alcoholism and probably other drug abuse, they lack information
about what exactly is inherited. For example, do individuals with
a family history of drug abuse have an increased susceptibility
or sensitivity to the effects of drugs with reinforcing
properties? If a susceptibility exists, what are its underlying
biological mechanisms? To understand what might be inherited,
both individuals who have a substance abuse problem and animals
models of substance abuse are studied. Various types of
information can be derived from these studies. As with family,
twin, and adoption studies, much more information is available
about alcoholism as compared with other drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> First, it may be possible to identify specific inherited risk
markers for alcoholism and other substance abuse. A risk marker
is a biological trait or characteristic associated with a given
condition. Thus, if an individual is found to have an identified
marker for substance abuse, he or she is at risk for developing a
drug dependency. To date, no biological characteristic has been
clearly identified as being a risk marker for either alcoholism
or substance abuse, although evidence suggests some possible
candidates. The identification of a valid and reliable risk
marker could provide important information about the fundamental
mechanisms underlying substance abuse and addiction and would be
an invaluable aid in diagnosis and treatment.<br>
</p>

<p> Second, inherited differences in biochemical, physiological,
and anatomical processes related to differences in drug responses
might be identified and studied. Animal models of substance abuse
allow thorough biological assays to be carried out. Animal
genetic models of substance abuse consist of strains of animals
(usually rodents) that have been selectively bred to either
exhibit a preference for taking or refusing a drug, or to differ
in some way in their behavioral or physiological response to a
drug. In the case of alcohol, studies suggest that low doses of
alcohol are more stimulating and produce a stronger positive
reward in rats bred to have a high preference for alcohol as
compared with normal rats. Experimental data indicate that this
may be due to inherited differences in the dopamine, GABA, and
serotonin systems (27,32, 57,73). These differences represent
inherited traits related to drug taking behavior, and these
animals can be examined to determine what biological mechanisms
are involved in the expression of these traits.<br>
</p>

<p> Third, the genetic technique of linkage analysis can narrow
the area on a chromosome where a gene may be located. It can lead
to the identification of the gene itself which in turn can
improve the understanding of the molecular events that underlie
the expression of the gene. There have been few genetic linkage
studies related to substance abuse since few specific biological
traits associated with drug dependency have been identified. Some
studies in humans have been carried out related to alcoholism but
the findings of these studies are contradictory and inconclusive.<br>
</p>

<p> Several studies have reported an association between
alcoholism and a gene that regulates the number of a type of
dopamine receptor in the brain; other studies have found no such
link (4,5,8,18,58). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.
One study revealed a relationship between the presence of the
gene not only in alcoholics, but in other disorders such as
autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's
syndrome (17). Thus, the presence of this particular gene, while
not uniquely specific for alcoholism, may cause an alteration in
the brain's dopamine system that somehow exacerbates or
contributes to alcohol abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Few studies have examined possible inherited biological
mechanisms associated with the abuse of other drugs. For example,
strains of rats and mice that differ in their sensitivity to the
reinforcing effects of cocaine and in their cocaine-seeking
behavior have been observed to also have differences in the
actual number of dopamine-containing neurons and receptors in
certain brain areas. Also, a comparison of one strain of rat that
self-administers drugs of abuse at higher rates than another
strain, found that the higher self-administering strain exhibited
differences in the intracellular mechanisms that control activity
in some of the neurons in the brain reward system (see box 3-2)
as compared with the low self-administering strain. Additional
studies exploring the role of genes in drug response are needed
to more fully understand the full range of biological factors
associated with drug abuse. The recent development of new and
more sensitive techniques to analyze brain activity and processes
will facilitate these studies. <br>
</p>

<p> ROLE OF LEARNING <br>
</p>

<p> The learning that occurs during drug-taking activities is an
important force in the continued use and craving of drugs
(59,72). Drugs of abuse often produce feelings of intense
pleasure in the user. In addition, such drugs produce changes in
numerous organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, digestive,
endocrine). Both the behavioral and physiological effects of a
drug occur in the context of the individual's drug-seeking and
drug-using environment. As a result, environmental cues are
present before and during an individual's drug use that are
consistently associated with a drug's behavioral and
physiological effects. With repetition the cues become
conditioned stimuli, that on presentation, even in the absence of
the drug, evoke automatic changes in organ systems and sensations
that the individual reports as drug craving. This is analogous to
Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments in which dogs
salivated at the cue of a bell following repeated pairing of food
presentation with a ringing bell. Evidence for this effect is
seen in numerous studies showing that animals seek out places
associated with reinforcing drugs and that the physiological
effects of drugs can be classically conditioned in both animals
and humans (72).<br>
</p>

<p> Conditioning also occurs in relation to the withdrawal
effects of drugs (75). It was observed that opiate addicts who
were drug free for months and thus should not have had any signs
of opiate withdrawal, developed withdrawal symptoms (e.g.,
yawning, sniffling, tearing of the eyes) when talking about drugs
in group therapy sessions. This phenomenon, termed conditioned
withdrawal, results from environmental stimuli acquiring the
ability, through classical conditioning, to elicit signs and
symptoms of pharmacological withdrawal. Conditioned withdrawal
can also play a role in relapse to drug use in abstinent
individuals. The emergence of withdrawal symptoms as a result of
exposure to conditioned cues can motivate an individual to seek
out and use drugs.<br>
</p>

<p> These associations are difficult to reverse. In theory,
repeated presentation of the environmental cues, without the drug
should extinguish the conditioned association. Animal studies
indicate that stopping the conditioned response is difficult to
achieve and does not erase the original learning. These types of
studies examining drug conditioning have found that various
aspects of extinguished responses can either be reinstated with a
single pairing of the drug and environmental cue, can be
reinstated with a single dose of drug in the absence of the
environmental cue, or canspontaneously recover (72).<br>
</p>

<p> Thus, exposure to environmental cues associated with drug use
in the past can act as a stimulus for voluntary drug- seeking
behavior. If the individual succeeds in finding and taking the
drug, the chain of behaviors is further reinforced by the
drug-induced, rewarding feelings and the effects of the drug on
other organ systems (59). The effects of the environmental
stimuli can be similar to the priming effects of a dose of the
drug.<br>
</p>

<p> The complexity of human responses to drugs of abuse, coupled
with the number of drugs that are abused, complicates
understanding of the role of biology in drug use and abuse.
Nevertheless, scientists know the site of action of many drugs in
the brain, and sophisticated new devices are expected to improve
that understanding. A genetic component to drug use and abuse is
likely, but it has not been fully characterized.<br>
</p>

<p> SUMMARY <br>
</p>

<p> Underlying all alcohol and drug problems are the actions and
effects that drugs of abuse exert. It is important to understand
how drugs work in the brain, why certain drugs have the potential
for being abused, and what, if any, biological differences exist
among individuals in their susceptibility to abuse drugs.<br>
</p>

<p> Two biological factors contribute to substance abuse and
addiction: the effects drugs of abuse exert on the individual,
and the biological status of the individual taking drugs. The
effects the drugs exert can be either acute or chronic and will
vary depending on the drug and its route of administration. Most
drugs of abuse influence the brain's reward system. The
pleasurable sensations that drug use can produce reinforce
drug-seeking and -taking behaviors. These actions differ with
different drugs: and, thus, some substances have greater
potential for abuse and addiction than others.<br>
</p>

<p> Prolonged or chronic use of a substance or substances can
produce both biological and behavioral changes (some long-
lasting). Biological changes can include sensitization and/or
tolerance and, if use is discontinued, withdrawal. The behavioral
changes from continued drug use are directly related to these
biological changes. An individual's drug- craving, -seeking, and
-taking behaviors are amplified through the neuroadaptive changes
in the brain reward system that occur with chronic
administration.<br>
</p>

<p> Environmental cues also play a large role in drug-seeking and
-taking behavior. On encountering certain environmental stimuli
(i.e., specific locations, smells, tastes), drug- craving and
drug withdrawal symptoms have been reported by former drug users
who have been drug-free for months, even years.<br>
</p>

<p> Through family, twin, and adoption studies, most researchers
agree that genetic factors play some part in the heritability of
alcohol problems and, although less clear, other drug problems.
No conclusive evidence has been found to explain precisely what
is inherited or the overall importance of this inherited
material. It has been hypothesized that there are probably
numerous genes (as opposed to one) that interact in complex ways,
and whose expressions are affected by a myriad of environmental
factors. Thus, the presence or absence of a genetic factor
neither ensures nor protects against drug dependency.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 3-1: Neuropharmacology <br>
</p>

<p> Neurons are the cells that process information in the brain.
Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by neurons to
communicate with other neurons. When a neuron is activated it
releases a neurotransmitter into the gap between two neurons (see
figure 3-1). The molecules of the neurotransmitter move across
the gap and attach to proteins, called receptors, in the outer
wall of an adjacent cell. Once the receptor is activated, the
neurotransmitter is removed from the gap, either by reabsorption
into the neuron that released it or by being broken down
chemically.<br>
</p>

<p> For each neurotransmitter in the brain, there are specific
receptors to which it can attach. Receptors and receptor subtypes
can activate a variety of membrane and cellular mechanisms. In
this way, one chemical can have diverse effects in different
areas of the brain. Many chemicals have been identified as
neurotransmitters. Some particularly relevant to the reported
pleasurable sensations associated with drug abuse include
dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, opioids and other
neuropeptides, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.<br>
</p>

<p> A neuron can have thousands of receptors for many different
neurotransmitters. Some neurotransmitters activate neurons
(excitatory neurotransmitters), while others decrease neuron
activity (inhibitory neurotransmitters). Some receptors are
biochemically coupled: the activation of one modulates the
function of the other, either increasing or decreasing its
activity. A neuron can also have receptors for the chemical it
releases. In this way, neurons can regulate their release of a
particular neurotransmitter. Thus, these so-called autoreceptors
act as a feedback mechanism. The activity of a neuron will be
determined by the cumulative activity of all its various
receptors. <br>
</p>

<p> Drugs that work in the brain, including drugs of abuse, alter
normal neuropharmacological activity through a variety of
different mechanisms. They can affect the production, release, or
reuptake of a chemical, they can mimic or block the action of a
chemical at a receptor, or they can interfere with or enhance the
activity of a membrane or cellular mechanism associated with a
receptor. Prolonged drug use has the potential to alter each of
these processes. <br>

<p> BOX 3-2: The Brain Reward System <br>
</p>

<p> Eating, drinking, sexual, and maternal behaviors are
activities essential for the survival of the individual and the
species. Natural selection, in order to ensure that these
behaviors occur, has imbued them with powerful rewarding
properties. The brain reward system evolved to process these
natural reinforcers.<br>
</p>

<p> The reward system is made up of various brain structures. A
key part of this system for drug reward appears to be the
mesocorticolimbic pathway (MCLP). The MCLP is composed of the
axons of neuronal cell bodies in the middle part of the brain
(i.e., ventral tegmental area) projecting to areas in the front
part of the brain (i.e., the nucleus accumbens, a nucleus in the
limbic system, a network of brain structures associated with
control of emotion, perception, motivation, gratification, and
memory; medial prefrontal cortex, part of the front of the brain
involved with higher ordered thinking) (see figure 3-2). Ventral
tegmental neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine to
regulate the activity of the cells in the nucleus accumbens and
the medial prefrontal cortex. Other parts of the reward system
include the nucleus accumbens and its connections with other
limbic structures, and other regions in the front part of the
brain (i.e., substantia innominata-ventral palladium). The
nucleus accumbens also sends signals back to the ventral
tegmental area. Finally, other neuronal pathways containing
different neurotransmitters regulate the activity of the
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and may also be involved in
mediating the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse.<br>

<p> BOX 3-3: How Drugs of Abuse Affect the Chemical Release of
Dopamine <br>
</p>

<p> The rewarding properties of stimulant drugs such as cocaine
and amphetamines are due directly to the effects of the chemical
dopamine. Opiates, on the other hand, indirectly stimulate
dopamine by activating other chemical pathways, which in turn
increase dopamine activity. Similarly, alcohol, barbiturates, and
benzodiazepines likely have an indirect action which increases
dopamine activity. All of these drugs have reinforcing
properties. Phencyclidine (PCP) is also a strong reinforcer but
its relationship, if any, to activity in the dopamine pathway has
yet to be established. Other drugs are either weak reinforcers or
have not been shown to support self-administration in animal
experiments. Nicotine stimulates dopamine neurons; however, its
effect is modest when compared with cocaine or amphetamine.
Likewise, caffeine is a weak reinforcer, but the precise
mechanisms of its reinforcement are unclear. Finally, cannabis
and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) also produce positive
effects that clearly support their use.<br>

<p> BOX 3-4: The Two Types of Tolerance <br>
</p>

<p> The two types of tolerance are: dispositional
(pharmacokinetic) and pharmacodynamic. Dispositional tolerance
develops when the amount of drug reaching active sites in the
brain is reduced in some way. Generally, this arises from an
increased breakdown of the drug or a change in its distribution
in the rest of the body. Thus, more drug must be taken to achieve
the same blood levels or concentrations at the active sites in
the brain.<br>
</p>

<p> Pharmacodynamic tolerance represents a reduced response of
the brain to the same level of drug. It develops during the
continued and sustained presence of the drug. It may be that the
mechanism of adaptation may differ from drug to drug and depend
on the original mechanism of action of a given drug. The net
effect is that more drug is required to overcome this new
neuronal adaptation to produce an equivalent pharmacologic
effect.<br>
</p>

<p> Although dispositional tolerance represents a component of
tolerance to some drugs (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates), in most
cases much or all of the tolerance which develops to drugs with
significant abuse potential can be attributed to pharmacodynamic
tolerance. Tolerance can contribute to drug- taking behavior by
requiring that an individual take larger and larger doses of a
drug to achieve a desired effect.<br>

UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION US

src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"></font></b> </p>

<p> Availability is a precondition for drug abuse and dependency.
A person cannot become a drug abuser unless a drug is available
to be used. </p>

<p> Drug availability is often thought of as mere physical
presence of an abusable substance. In addition, however,
availability is affected by social norms (social availability),
prices (economic availability), and personal values (subjective
availability) (see table 4-1). Marketing techniques for both
licit and illicit drugs can alter social, economic, and
subjective availability, and thus are addressed in this chapter
(see box 4-1). </p>

<p> A substantial body of literature addressing the relationship
between drug availability and drug demand does exist. However,
most of this information addresses tobacco and alcohol, rather
than illicit drugs. In addition to conducting a literature search
(primarily of mass media), the Office of Technology Assessment
(OTA) contracted with the National Center for Juvenile Justice
(NCJJ) to conduct a survey of juvenile probation officers on the
perceived availability of drugs and to conduct a workshop on
availability issues (see appendix F for a list of participants). </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY </p>

<p> Availability is a concept usually reserved for the supply-
side of the substance abuse policy equation (i.e., making drugs
available to supply an already existing demand). However, the
proximity of drugs and drug dealers to potential users, and the
ease with which these substances can be purchased or otherwise
obtained can affect demand, use, and abuse. This is especially
true when one considers aggressive marketing efforts by
suppliers, who seek to create or expand the demand for drugs by
convincing potential consumers of the benefits, acceptability,
and availability of these substances. While availability is a
concept that applies to the whole range of drugs, most of what we
know about its role in drug use and abuse comes from research in
the arena of alcohol and tobacco abuse (1,9,10,14) (see box 4-2
and figure 4-1). </p>

<p> Research has shown that when alcohol is more available, the
prevalence of drinking, the amount of alcohol consumed, and the
heavy use of alcohol all increase (5). Alternatively, the
literature also suggests that physical conditions that restrict
alcohol availability reduce rates of alcohol consumption (1). A
review of alcohol-related literature reveals that availability
can be conceptualized in four different, yet related categories. </p>

<p> Physical Availability </p>

<p> Physical availability refers to a basic element--the
proximity and accessibility of an abusable substance. Simple
logic dictates that if a substance is absent, it cannot be used.
Government interdiction and law enforcement policies target the
physical availability of illicit drugs. Other policies, such as
limitations on the point-of-sale, hours, or age of purchasers,
target the physical availability of other abusable drugs, such as
tobacco and alcohol products. </p>

<p> Responses to the OTA survey of juvenile probation
administrators indicated that respondents perceived two ways in
which physical availability is increased: through contamination
by outsiders (e.g., youth gangs, tourists, foreigners) bringing
drugs into the community, and through proximity to a source of
drugs or alcohol. </p>

<p> Gangs and organized drug trafficking were mentioned often by
respondents as reasons for increases in the availability of
drugs. Respondents from all over the country, representing both
rural and urban areas, registered concerns about gangs and their
role in marketing and trafficking drugs. A respondent from
Canton, Mississippi, for example, attributed the increase in drug
availability simply to &quot;gang leaders from California.&quot;
A respondent from Waterbury, Connecticut, was more explicit about
the age and ethnicity of the gang influences, attributing the
observed increase in drugs to the &quot;emergence of gang
activity for the 12-to-15-year-old age group, particularly in the
Hispanic and black ethnic groupings.&quot; A respondent from
Paducah, Kentucky, said that the &quot;increase in drugs has been
from gangs entering the community from Memphis, Tennessee,
Arkansas, and Chicago, Illinois.&quot; The respondent from
Davenport, Iowa, attributed the increase to attempts by
&quot;Chicago gang members to establish crack markets in Quad
Cities--lots of arrests of Chicago residents including
juveniles.&quot; Even cities with an established history of youth
gangs identified gangs as being responsible for increases in
drugs. For example, a respondent from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
attributed the observed increase to the fact that &quot;gang
participation has become increasingly sophisticated.&quot; </p>

<p> However, gangs were not the only phenomena associated with
increasing the physical availability of drugs and alcohol. Many
respondents were concerned with the potential for contamination
due to proximity to areas thought to be established drug markets
or through proximity to the means for widespread drug
distribution (e.g., major highways and roads, prisons). </p>

<p> Physical availability is necessary but not solely responsible
for drug use. For example, drugs often are physically available
but are not always used. Also, seeking to prevent or reduce drug
use solely by eliminating or reducing physical availability may
be doomed to failure, since it has proven to be very difficult to
keep drugs out of communities. So although the concept of
physical availability is important, it is limited, both as a
cause and a cure to drug use and abuse. </p>

<p> Economic Availability </p>

<p> Economic availability may be increased when a person has
access to surplus income or the costs of drugs are low, illegal
drug sales are a key component of the local economy, or the price
per unit of a drug or drugs in general is reduced. In describing
the difference between &quot;private&quot; and
&quot;flagrant&quot; drug markets, one article specified some of
the dimensions of the changing economics of addiction: </p>

<p> If cigarettes were sold only by the carton and whiskey only
by the case, the effect would be to decrease the total
consumption of tobacco and whiskey. Presumably, few people would
start smoking cigarettes if the first experimental purchase were
a $20 carton rather than a $1 pack. Similarly, fewer poor people
would drink if they were required to buy whiskey by the case. A
similar effect would, in all likelihood, hold true if open air
and flagrant drug markets were eliminated (3). </p>

<p> In addition to overall conditions, economic availability of
all substances can be affected by the pricing of products. For
licit products such as alcohol and tobacco, economic availability
is also affected by taxes levied by federal, state, and local
authorities. </p>

<p> In 1989, federal excise taxes on tobacco, alcoholic
beverages, and motor fuels raised $24.4 billion in revenue--
about 2.5 percent of total federal revenues (11). Excise
taxes--taxes on specific products--while representing a small
part of total taxes, are an important consideration in the
economic availability of licit substances. </p>

<p> Excise taxes are seen by many as having three impacts: </p>

<p> o to raise revenue for government programs; </p>

<p> o to make certain harmful substances less affordable and,
hence, less used and abused; and </p>

<p> o to cover societal costs that accrue from the use of various
substances (e.g., environmental costs from the use of gasoline,
health costs resulting from smoking and drinking). </p>

<p> Whether taxation of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products
is an appropriate means of reducing societal costs caused by
their use is a continuing public debate. Some argue that the
public health costs and other external costs are so significant
as to justify substantial excise taxes. Others counter that such
taxes are regressive--impacting the poor more than the rich--and
reduce the satisfaction experienced by millions of sensible
drinkers without necessarily reducing the harm caused by
excessive drinkers (8). </p>

<p> Social Availability </p>

<p> Social availability refers to those factors within the
community conducive to drug use. One study explored alternative
explanations for reported declines in cocaine use among high
school seniors, using questionnaire data from annual nationwide
surveys conducted from 1976 to 1988 (2). Results of this analysis
indicated that although lifestyle factors showed strong links
with the use of marijuana and cocaine, these factors had not
developed trends in ways that could account for declines in the
use of either drug. Reported physical availability of either drug
had not been reduced. Instead, increases in perceived risks and
disapproval appear to have contributed substantially to the
recent declines in the use of marijuana and cocaine. The study
concluded that it was important to lower demand by reducing
social availability, as opposed to trying to reduce supply by
reducing physical availability. </p>

<p> Increasingly, grass roots community action groups are working
to diminish both the subjective and social domains of
availability. These efforts usually entail developing and
presenting public awareness and fact-based education to consumers
and potential consumers, decreasing community tolerance for drug
use while increasing collective pride in the community, and
developing or otherwise demonstrating alternatives to substance
use and abuse. </p>

<p> Subjective Availability </p>

<p> Subjective availability encompasses individual differences in
how people perceive their access to substances. For example, an
individual may choose to use one type of abusable substance, but
not another. Or, an individual may choose to use a drug (e.g.,
cocaine), but only in certain forms (i.e., a person may choose to
snort a line of cocaine but refuse to smoke or inject it). The
person who refuses to use illicit drugs has interjected his or
her personal values in a way to make illicit drugs unavailable,
even if they are physically and economically available. </p>

<p> One reviewer identified four components of subjective
availability as it relates to alcohol: 1) willingness to go out
of one's way to purchase alcohol, 2) perceived convenience of
buying alcohol, 3) discomfort about buying alcohol, and
4)?importance of the price of alcohol. Subjective and social
availability were demonstrated to have direct influences on
alcohol consumption, and subjective and social aspects of
availability can mediate and outweigh the influence of physical
availability (1). </p>

<p> Subjective availability is likely to increase when an
individual holds attitudes or values favorable toward use; lives
in a community that condones, or even celebrates, drug use; and
has ready access to drugs that are highly valued, particularly if
those agents are addictive. </p>

<p> ARE DRUGS READILY AVAILABLE? </p>

<p> A number of surveys exists for measuring drug use (see
chapter 2). In addressing the question of whether drugs are
readily available, several measures exist (e.g., marketing
figures related to alcohol and tobacco sales, tallies of illegal
drugs seized by law enforcement authorities). In addition to
quantitative measures of drug use, many people perceive various
drugs to be widely available. In an attempt to measure these
anecdotal perceptions, OTA surveyed juvenile probation
administrators randomly selected from a database maintained by
NCJJ. </p>

<p> The purpose of the survey was to identify communities that
have experienced a sudden, observable change in the abuse of
drugs or alcohol in the past 12 months and to collect preliminary
data about the events and circumstances leading to the change in
abuse. Such anecdotal evidence could be gathered from a number of
groups; OTA chose to survey juvenile justice officials because of
their involvement in drug issues and the availability of a
nationwide database of such officials who could be accessed. </p>

<p> Responses were received from 246 juvenile justice
administrators across 38 States. The data provide a glimpse at
some of the drug and alcohol availability issues being addressed
by juvenile courts and probation departments across the United
States. Seven findings resulted from the survey: </p>

<p> o Most respondents consider substance abuse to be a serious
problem in their communities. Using a scale of 1 (not serious) to
10 (very serious), the respondents, on average, rated the problem
of substance abuse among juveniles in their communities at 7.4.
In addition, 85.8 percent of the respondents rated substance
abuse seriousness at six or above. </p>

<p> o Almost half of the respondents indicated a dramatic
increase in availability of drugs and/or alcohol in their
communities. A total of 46.7 percent of the survey respondents
reported a dramatic increase in the availability of drugs and/or
alcohol in their communities. Some 50.8 percent of the
respondents indicated &quot;no dramatic changes&quot; in
perceived availability of drugs and/or alcohol. Only 2.4 percent
indicated a dramatic decrease in availability. </p>

<p> o Factors affecting physical availability (i.e., sales and/or
distribution of drugs) were selected most often and were rated
highest in terms of increasing availability of drugs. Given an
opportunity to select and rate commonly cited reasons for
increased availability of drugs and alcohol, the respondents
selected items that were strongly associated with the sales and
distribution of drugs and alcohol (see table 4-2). </p>

<p> o Crack cocaine and cocaine were much more likely than other
drugs to show dramatic increases in availability. Respondents
were given an opportunity to report whether they had noticed a
change (ranging from a dramatic decrease to a dramatic increase)
in the availability of a range of drugs, including alcohol. Crack
(24.5 percent) and cocaine (17.8 percent) had the highest
percentage of respondents indicating a &quot;dramatic
increase&quot; in availability. The next closest were inhalants
at 14.6 percent (see table 4-3). </p>

<p> o Economic conditions and the perceived lack of real
opportunities for many youths were frequently cited as factors
contributing to the increased availability of drugs in many
communities (see box 4-3). </p>

<p> o Survey respondents listed several factors contributing to a
sense of social availability, including lack of parental/guardian
supervision, consequences for alcohol and drug offenses,
alternative activities, as well as portrayals of alcohol and drug
use by the mass media as a glamorous and healthy activity (see
box 4-4). </p>

<p> o Substance abuse prevention and early intervention efforts
were rated highest as important community responses to increases
in the availability of drugs and alcohol. Over 80 percent of
respondents agreed that an increase in prevention and
intervention efforts was an important response to an increase in
the availability of drugs. Trailing behind prevention and early
intervention were increased law enforcement (68.4 percent),
increased treatment (68.2 percent), and stiffer judicial
penalties (68.0 percent). Respondents were also asked to rate the
relative effectiveness of the listed responses to availability on
a scale of 1 (not effective) to 10 (very effective). Prevention
and early intervention (6.4 percent) was rated the highest in
terms of perceived effectiveness, but not much higher than law
enforcement (6.2 percent), increased treatment (6.0 percent), and
stiffer judicial penalties (6.2 percent) (see table 4-4). </p>

<p> MARKETING </p>

<p> Standard marketing strategies used to increase consumption of
legal goods are used in equally effective ways to increase
consumption of illicit drugs. Marketing refers to efforts by
individuals interested in the sale or trade of a product to
maintain or increase sales by maintaining market shares and
opening new markets. Marketing includes efforts to increase the
perceived availability of a product or products by enhancing the
sense of both subjective and social availability in prospective
consumers. To the extent that those efforts are successful, then
purveyors of consumer products will attempt to make the supply
match the demand (physical availability) at a cost that maximizes
both sales to consumers (economic availability) and profits to
the sellers. </p>

<p> Illegal Drugs </p>

<p> Illegal drugs are marketed aggressively in the United States.
Some of the strategies for marketing illicit drugs are very
similar to those strategies for marketing licit products.
Sometimes the distinction between licit and illicit products is
difficult to determine. Take, for example, the case of so-called
head shops. Drug paraphernalia are items sold specifically to
promote the preparation, manufacture, or marketing of drugs. Head
shops may sell a wide variety of products that are often
associated with specific drugs, for example: </p>

<p> o Stash cases, rolling machines, pipes, bongs (marijuana). </p>

<p> o Bottles, concert kits, brass straws, spoons (cocaine). </p>

<p> o Glass pipes, vials, stems, screens, shaker bottles (crack
cocaine). </p>

<p> o Testing kits, scales, adulterants (heroin). </p>

<p> o Canisters, balloons, tanks (inhalants). </p>

<p> Head shops represent the most shrewd form of pro-drug
marketing by targeting mostly young customers and providing the
technology and products required to increase the ability of users
to procure, prepare, hide, and ingest drugs. Despite Federal
legislation prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia (18 USC
Ap4), heads shops continue to flourish. These shops can avoid the
intention of the law because the definition of what constitutes
drug paraphernalia is ambiguous and open to interpretation. Head
shop owners will simply emphasize the legitimate use of their
products. For example, they may sell a scale designed to weigh
drugs as a product to weigh food for dieting purposes.
Specifically, head shops contribute to the drug abuse problem by:
</p>

<p> o sending a double message--if drugs are so bad, why is drug
paraphernalia sold openly? </p>

<p> o operating, in some cases, in the guise of candy stores,
exposing children to drug paraphernalia and stimulating curiosity
about drugs; </p>

<p> o serving to facilitate the use, marketing, and sale of
drugs; </p>

<p> o selling items designed as conversation pieces which serve
to glamorize drug use; and </p>

<p> o becoming hubs for drug abusers, indirectly serving to
increase crime in the neighborhoods in which they operate. </p>

<p> Another example of a marketing strategy used for licit
substances and now being adapted for illicit substances is total
marketing, which consists of four basic strategies-- promotion,
product, price, and place--to maximize theexposure of a product
in a positive light to the most likely consumer groups (4). </p>

<p> A key component of total marketing is promotion, or
advertising particular product lines to appeal to particular
subpopulations of the consuming public. Promotion is a standard
practice in the marketing of legitimate products-- it is also a
very powerful force for manipulating consumer habits. </p>

<p> Promotion includes activities like advertising and
sponsorship of sporting and entertainment events (7). For illicit
drugs, promotional activities may include sponsoring a party in
which the illegal drug is dispensed free or at a dramatic
discount along with other attractions (e.g., sex, drug
paraphernalia) (15). </p>

<p> Total marketing also entails the development of a product
line that can be targeted to subpopulations within the larger
consumer community. For example, alcohol and tobacco
manufacturers will produce an array of products targeted at
several consumer groups--premium beers for one group, wine
coolers for another, rugged masculine cigarettes for one group,
thin feminine cigarettes for another. Similarly, purveyors of
illegal drugs have begun to develop product lines--powdered
cocaine for one group, crack cocaine for another. The use of
brand names is one technique used by marketers to establish a
niche in the larger market, which is one reason people become
unwilling participants in the marketing wars between Coke and
Pepsi or Visa and American Express or even Bud and Bud Light. </p>

<p> A great deal of uniformity exists in the price, quantity, and
quality of drugs sold in the same city, especially in the same
neighborhood or street market. As a result, a dealer will
occasionally try to capture a larger share of the market by
increasing the weight or strength of the product and applying a
brand name for recognition (3). </p>

<p> In Washington, DC, for example, brand name heroin is sold
under the name of &quot;Smurf,&quot; &quot;Mr. T,&quot;
&quot;Brown Wrapper,&quot; and &quot;Black Poison.&quot;
Phencyclidine (PCP) is occasionally sold under the brand name
&quot;Hinkley&quot; (after John Hinkley, the man who shot Ronald
Reagan), &quot;Gofer&quot; (a reference to a television character
on the &quot;Love Boat,&quot; which is a popular street name for
PCP), and &quot;Keys to St. E's&quot; (a reference to a local
mental institution). Crack cocaine is sometimes hawked under the
brand names of &quot;Conan,&quot; &quot;007,&quot; and
&quot;Baseball.&quot; </p>

<p> Pricing is the process of assigning a retail cost to each
item in a given product-line that matches the ability of the
targeted subgroup to pay. By producing a line of products at a
wide range of prices, the purveyor of the goods can maximize the
consumer population. For example, whether a consumer of tobacco
products is smoking low-priced generic cigarettes from the
supermarket or high-priced cigarettes from the tobacconist, that
individual is included in the range of consumers. Illegal drug
sellers also price their particular products to move. For
example, while powdered cocaine may be too expensive for some
economically disadvantaged consumers to purchase regularly,
almost everyone can afford a $5 vial of crack cocaine. Drug
dealers also manipulate the cost for their goods to attract
customers. </p>

<p> Once a product has been developed, promoted, and priced to
move, a place must be found to most effectively sell the product.
Legal nonmedical drugs are packaged and made available at retail
outlets in such a way as to make their purchase as convenient as
possible. </p>

<p> Wine coolers, for example, are a type of beverage aimed
particularly at women and young people. With its sweet, light
taste, low prices, and convenient packaging, the wine cooler
competes with beer and soft drinks for occasions such as picnics
and sports events, where traditional wine products are unlikely
to be consumed. Wine cooler ads promote just these types of uses.
Packaging has taken on a beer or soft drink look, and the
industry is successfully obtaining access to convenience stores
and supermarket outlets to make purchases easier (6). </p>

<p> Illicit drugs can also be packaged and made available at
&quot;retail&quot; outlets where purchasers can conveniently
obtain the product(s) of their choice. One news account suggests
that &quot;mass marketing that would have made McDonald's
proud&quot; is responsible for the evolution of crack cocaine
from a drug derided as &quot;garbage rock&quot; just a few years
ago into a national craze. </p>

<p> Crack was not invented, it was created by a sharp crowd of
sinister geniuses who took a simple production technique to make
a packaged, ready to consume form of the product with low unit
price to entice massive numbers of consumers. Cocaine powder
required an investment of nearly $75 for a gram, but a hit of
crack costs as little as $5. Equally alluring was crack's
incredible &quot;high&quot;--an instantaneous euphoria because it
was smoked--that could create addicts in weeks (16). </p>

<p> Two kinds of retail drug markets exist in the United States:
the private market place and the open-air or flagrant drug
markets (3). The private drug market involves transactions that
occur between people who are known to one another or are referred
by a trusted acquaintance. Referrals in the private marketplace
are usually not very far removed from the original connection;
they may be classmates in college, business associates,
relatives, or persons belonging to the same club. </p>

<p> The familiarity of the parties in the private drug market
usually means that there is a reduced level of public exposure
and violence. The desire to keep the flow of traffic to the site
of transactions at a minimum means that sales in the private
marketplace tend to be of larger quantities of drugs than those
in street transactions. Because most of the transactions take
place &quot;behind closed doors&quot; or in some other
clandestine fashion, a high degree of impermeability exists in
the dealer-customer relationship (3). Examples of private drug
markets include &quot;speak easies&quot; during prohibition and
the &quot;traditional&quot; (i.e., before crack) cocaine markets.
</p>

<p> Another aspect of the private drug market is the ritualistic
aspect of procuring the product. Consider, for example, the
ritual associated with purchasing cocaine. One author describes
&quot;a day in the office&quot; of a street-level cocaine
distribution network. The office itself is a highly structured
operation, complete with receptionists to screen potential
customers, guards, a &quot;catcher&quot;--held on retainer to
retrieve cocaine thrown out of a window during a bust-- and the
merchant who sets prices, arranges to barter goods and services,
gives credit, and makes day-to-day decisions regarding sales
(15). </p>

<p> A typical transaction involves a positive identification of
the buyer, a greeting and brief social contact (e.g., handshake,
hug, kiss) between the merchant and the buyer, a formal request
for an amount of cocaine, and a discussion of method of payment
(e.g., cash, barter). Sometimes the transaction involves a brief
discussion of the relative quality of the drugs in the street, a
sample of the drug available from this particular merchant, and
possibly some haggling over price. The public weighing and
packaging of the cocaine is central to this type of transaction.
The scale, in fact, becomes a central point of power and
authority in the business; only those with the highest level of
trust and respect can operate the scale (15). </p>

<p> Open air and flagrant drug markets, on the other hand, tend
to be far more impersonal and much less ritualistic than the
private marketplace. Many of the concepts used by mass marketers
of licit products are used in the flagrant marketplace--targeted
consumer groups, small and widely affordable units of sale,
prepackaged goods with fixed prices, convenient retail outlets.
One research team describes the mechanics of a typical open-air
drug market transaction: </p>

<p> A car drives down a residential street with enormous
apartment buildings on either side. Young men wave to the car; a
few of the more aggressive dealers step into traffic to signal
autos to stop. Even before the wheels have stopped rolling,
several young men are at the window; &quot;You looking?&quot;
says one. &quot;Smoke, smoke. I've got crack. Whatever you
want&quot; says the other peering over his shoulder. The answer
from the driver is simple and short: &quot;Two dimes.&quot; Two
small brown glass vials are exchanged for a 20 dollar bill and
the transaction is over in a matter of seconds (3). </p>

<p> Although the exact method for conducting a transaction may
vary slightly from place to place around the country, the essence
of the transaction is remarkably similar across the United
States. Flagrant or open-air drug markets have many of the same
structural characteristics as legal marketplaces: demographic and
product segmentation, brand loyalty, cartel pricing, aggressive
salesmen working on commission, and careful recruitment of loyal
and productive employees (3). </p>

<p> Alcohol and Tobacco </p>

<p> The marketing of legal yet addictive substances, especially
tobacco and alcohol, has become controversial in recent years.
Issues stemming from the marketing of licit substances include
advertising, taxation, and labeling. </p>

<p> Advertising </p>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco products have long been advertised in the
United States. In the 1950s and 1960s, these products were
advertised with minimal restrictions. Following the Surgeon
General's report on the hazards of smoking in 1964 (13), public
sentiment against cigarette advertising increased. The most
famous example of Federal regulation is the ban on broadcast
cigarette advertising in January 1971 resulting from the passage
by Congress of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969
(Public Law 91-222). In recent years, attention has focused on
legislative proposals to ban all forms of cigarette advertising,
and to control the advertising of alcoholic products. </p>

<p> Taxation </p>

<p> The federal government currently levies excise taxes on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes on all
types of alcoholic beverages were raised in 1990 to their current
levels. Currently, for example, beer (six pack 12-ounce cans)
carries a 33 cent federal excise tax, a 750 ml bottle of wine
carries a 21 cent federal excise tax. A pack of cigarettes
carries a federal excise tax of 24 cents. </p>

<p> A number of studies in the 1980s focused on the impact of
federal excise taxes on cigarette consumption. A 1986 study
concluded that an 8- to 16-cent increase in the federal cigarette
excise tax would encourage from 1 to 2 million young persons and
8,000 to 1.5 million adults to quit smoking or not to start.
Thus, a tax increase could prevent hundreds of thousands of
premature smoking-related deaths, while a tax decrease would
contribute to the disease burden of tobacco (14). The General
Accounting Office, in a review of the literature on teenage
smoking and excise taxes, concluded that an increase in the
cigarette excise tax would be an effective way to reduce teenage
smoking (12). </p>

<p> Labeling </p>

<p> Federal law addresses the labeling of both cigarettes and
alcoholic beverages. In both cases, Congress declared that the
purpose of such labeling is to make sure the American public is
informed about the potential health hazards that may result from
consumption (36 USC 1331; 27 USC 213). Manufacturers of
cigarettes must use one of four rotating warnings on each
package, while manufacturers of alcoholic beverages must post a
prescribed warning (see box 4-5). Proponents of labeling have
stated that such warnings do not create legal restrictions, but
only help to inform the consumer about possible health risks.
Opponents of labeling have argued that no scientific proof exists
to link labeling with reduced use or improved health. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> The second set of preconditions for drug abuse and dependency
includes availability and marketing. A person cannot become a
drug abuser unless a drug is physically available to be used. In
addition, however, availability is affected by social norms
(e.g., factors within the community conducive to drug use,
including level of parental or guardian supervision, lack of
consequences for alcohol and drug offenses, lack of alternative
activities, portrayals of alcohol and other drug use by friends
and the media as a glamorous and healthy activity), prices
(economic availability), and personal values (subjective
availability). </p>

<p> The primary focus of U.S. antidrug policy has been to attack
the physical availability of illicit drugs through law
enforcement efforts aimed at disrupting the production,
transport, and sale of drugs. While this focus has increased
drug-related arrests--nearly half of newly sentenced federal
inmates in 1991 were imprisoned on drug charges--illicit drugs
are still widely available. </p>

<p> Marketing techniques for both licit and illicit drugs can
alter social, economic, and subjective availability. Key
components of marketing include the promotion and advertising of
particular product lines to appeal to particular subpopulations
of the consuming public; development of a product line that can
be targeted to subpopulations within the larger community of
consumers; pricing strategies to attract new buyers; and
identification of retail outlets for sales. </p>

<p> Federal law regulates the merchandising of licit yet abusable
substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs by
placing a variety of restrictions on how such products may be
marketed. Despite current restrictions, debate continues as to
whether and how a variety of legal drugs should be marketed.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 4-1: What Is Marketing? </p>

<p> Marketing includes any activity involved in moving goods from
producer to consumer. In the context of drugs, marketing includes
a variety of activities covering a wide range of licit and
illicit substances. </p>

<p> For licit substances, such as alcohol, tobacco, and
inhalants, it includes market research, advertising, pricing, and
taxation. A number of government policies in the marketing
arena--taxes, advertising restrictions, point- of-sale controls,
and age restrictions on certain products-- directly affects the
availability of licit, yet abusable, substances. </p>

<p> For illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, and
hallucinogens, marketing techniques can include street markets,
gang activity, and private, closely controlled distribution and
sales systems. Government control in this area--prohibiting the
possession, use, and sale of such substances--likewise affects
the availability of these substances. </p>

<p> Box 4-2: Availability and Tobacco </p>

<p> The evolution of tobacco from a relatively rare product
requiring preparation, thought, and ritual to a product that is
ubiquitous, prepackaged, and consumed without much fanfare
provides a graphic illustration of how increased physical
availability of a product can dramatically increase drug use,
abuse, and addiction. Three major developments in the history of
tobacco use paved the way for making this drug imminently
available for use by consumers: the invention of the cigarette
manufacturing machine, the invention and perfection of matches,
and the proliferation of the use of vending machines to sell
tobacco products. </p>

<p> The first successful cigarette manufacturing machine was
developed in 1881 by James A. Bonsack. This machine had the
capacity to produce more than 200 cigarettes per minute. Prior to
the advent of this machine, smokers had to roll each cigarette by
hand, a time-consuming and often ritualistic process. </p>

<p> Once rolled, a cigarette must be lit to be consumed. This was
no easy task prior to the introduction of the safety match, first
invented in 1896 but not perfected until 1912. Without matches,
smokers were required to enter cigar stores to light cigarettes
from gas or oil lamps provided specifically for the purpose of
lighting tobacco products. These developments changed forever the
way that cigarettes were consumed by making them readily
available for consumption at any moment during the day. Instead
of a thoughtful, often ritualistic exercise, cigarette
consumption has evolved for some into an almost unconscious
habit. Following the invention of the manufacturing machine and
the safety match, the rate of cigarette consumption soared during
the late 19th and early 20th century. </p>

<p> The use of vending machines may be the most revolutionary
aspect of tobacco availability. First introduced in 1926, vending
machines require no sales person, are not restricted by selected
hours of operation, and are not concerned with the age or
legality of the purchaser. Vending machines make cigarettes
available almost anywhere, appearing in bars, hotels, train and
bus stations, airports, hotels, and restaurants. By 1953, nearly
half a million cigarette machines existed and were responsible
for sales of more than 3 billion packs of cigarettes a year. The
upward trend in sales from cigarette machines continued through
the mid- 1970s: by 1973 more than 900,000 vending machines were
in operation, selling almost 5 billion packs per year. Some early
research indicated that the existence of vending machines
throughout the physical environment is a major inducement to
impulse smoking. </p>

<p> BOX 4-3: Survey Comments, Economic Availability </p>

<p> Economic factors impact on perceptions of availability in a
number of ways. For example, because Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
was experiencing a &quot;strong economy . . . juveniles have had
an abundance of cash available for alcohol/drug usage.&quot; More
frequent, however, were comments stating the opinion that a poor
economy increased the economic availability of drugs and alcohol:
</p>

<p> Frankfort, Kentucky: &quot;Profit motive due to national
economy and lack of job training/jobs. Lack of hope and
opportunity for some causes increased sale of drugs due to high
profit.&quot; </p>

<p> Barbourville, Kentucky: &quot;Drug dealers that cannot make
it flipping hamburgers, but are successful at selling drugs and
have a lot of material evidence of their success. Law enforcement
needs to confiscate these material items in prosecution of case.
Also, involvement of drug dealing by law enforcement and
politicians is a problem. &quot; </p>

<p> Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: &quot;Teenaged drug dealers have
status, money, jewelry, cars, designer clothes, etc., which many
of their peers cannot afford.&quot; </p>

<p> Fort Worth, Texas: &quot;Depressed economic conditions--Lack
of legitimate means to obtain income. It's easy money with
minimal consequences for conviction.&quot; </p>

</p>

<p> BOX 4-4: Survey Comments, Social Availability </p>

<p> Conway, New Hampshire: &quot;Our law enforcers are known and
make little inroads towards prosecuting drug traffickers or
sellers. Many young adults supply liquor and drugs to underage
kids in our area.&quot; </p>

<p> Mount Holly, New Jersey: &quot;The legal system does not
fairly prosecute offenders. It gives some juveniles the message
that depending upon your circumstances it is OK to use and sell
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> Muskogee, Oklahoma: &quot;The lack of prosecutive vigor in
alcohol-related offenses (Minor in possession, public
intoxication, D.U.I.). District attorney does not vigorously
pursue and law enforcement treats D.U.I. as public
intoxication.&quot; </p>

<p> Prineville, Oregon: &quot;This community is basically a blue
collar community. There is an attitude of acceptance of juveniles
using alcohol. Kind of a boys will be boys attitude.&quot; </p>

<p> South Bend, Indiana: &quot;We have seen an increase in
alcohol consumption that appears to be tolerated or even
encouraged by adults (primarily parents).&quot; </p>

<p> Hillsboro, Illinois: &quot;Lack of education, interest,
cooperation of parents. Not enough interest with higher officials
(e.g., school teachers, church members, government officials,
businesses, and senior citizens).&quot; </p>

<p> Baraboo, Michigan: &quot;Lack of appropriate teen activities.
Lack of parental interest.&quot; </p>

<p> Jacksonville, Illinois: &quot;Decrease in the ability and
willingness of individual family units to educate, instruct, and
monitor juvenile behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p> Nicholasville, Kentucky: &quot;Alcohol is supplied willingly
to juveniles by a large number of adults. Inhalants are available
at any department store.&quot; </p>

<p> Brownstown, Indiana: &quot;Children, mostly high school age,
come in contact with adults, ages 18-23, who are very willing to
buy alcohol or sell drugs to their younger friends. In addition,
these children who do not have money on hand are likely to steal
items and trade them for drugs or cash to buy alcohol and
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 5 </b> </p>

<p> <b>SUBSTANCE USE AND TRANSITIONS TO ABUSE AND ADDICTION <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Substance use is another precondition and contributor to
addiction, since one cannot become dependent on a substance
without first using it, continuing its use, and passing through
stages of progressively more serious use. </p>

<p> Patterns of progression from use to addiction are not,
however, consistent or predictable for all individuals. They can
vary widely, depending on numerous individual and contextual
factors and on characteristics of the use itself, such as age of
onset and the type, frequency, and quantity of substance used.
While other chapters in this report focus on individual and
contextual factors, this chapter focuses only on the
characteristics of drug use itself that can contribute to the
progression to abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Researchers have failed to identify specific levels of
substance use or of substance-related problems that clearly
distinguish use from abuse (16). This is the case, in part,
because substances can differ greatly in their abuse liability
and, in part, because the same levels of use of a particular
substance can affect the functioning of various individuals
differently. For example, for some individuals, the initial use
of certain substances may constitute substance abuse, because of
the severe adverse consequences of the initial use itself.
(Although abuse is usually associated with large quantities of
substance use per occasion, resulting in either the risk of harm
to others (e.g., drunk driving) or to self (e.g., blackouts),
some in the prevention field define any initial use of an illicit
substance as substance abuse, because the substance being used is
illicit and should not be used.) </p>

<p> Although the distinction between use and abuse is unclear,
the causes of substance use--especially initial or casual
use--are thought to differ in many cases from the causes of
substance abuse and addiction. Some researchers have asserted
that substance use results primarily from social influences
(e.g., peer pressure), while abuse results more from internal
psychological and physiological processes (13). Others have
reported, based on longitudinal data, that current substance use
was related more to the early modeling of use by adults and to
one's own prior use, whereas problem use was related more to
early rebelliousness (22). A review of prevention programs also
supports the conclusion that the factors associated with the
initiation of use differ from the factors associated with
escalation to abuse (23).<br>
</p>

<p> SUBSTANCE USE <br>
</p>

<p> Because substance use is necessary as a precondition to abuse
and addiction, prevention efforts can be directed at initial use,
continuing use, or progression in use to block the later
development of addiction. </p>

<p> Possible goals are: </p>

<p> o Prevent initial use. One way to prevent substance abuse and
addiction is to prevent any initial use. The surest way to
succeed would be to keep abusable substances out of the
community, since, if they are unavailable, they cannot be used.
However, once the substances are available in a community, other
preventive approaches can be tried, including scare tactics (as
with a policy of zero tolerance, backed up by stern parental,
school, and legal penalties for use), educational efforts
(through media campaigns or prevention curricula in the schools),
training in refusal skills, and promotion of safe
nonsubstance-using activities. The lack of clear standards and
penalties, credible information, and alternative activities may
certainly increase the vulnerability of youth to the appeals of
abusable substances, but the presence of such efforts has not
guaranteed success in preventing initial use among all youth. </p>

<p> o Delay initial use. Another goal is to delay initial use as
long as possible, thus delaying the point at which any
progression from use to abuse to addiction can begin. Such an
approach can provide at least some protection for some
chil-dren--i.e., those who might otherwise initiate use at
earlier ages and then more rapidly progress to abuse and possibly
addiction. Early onset of substance use is often more severe than
late onset and, as is discussed later in this chapter, early use
of substances is one of the better predictors of subsequent
problems. Thus, a delay in initial use may offer significant
protection even if substances are used later on. </p>

<p> o Prevent, reduce, or control continued use. Another approach
is to try to prevent current users from continuing or escalating
their use of one substance or moving on to other substances with
greater abuse liability. Many youth experiment with cigarettes,
alcohol, and marijuana, but do not progress to problematic use of
these or other substances. Others, however, do progress. Efforts
to reduce, prevent, or control continued and progressive use, if
successful, can protect individuals from the problems of abuse
and addiction. </p>

<p> Preventing, delaying, reducing, or controlling the use of
substances can help prevent abuse and addiction. Because of their
directness and apparent simplicity, these goals can be very
appealing. Detracting from their appeal, however, is that they
can be difficult to achieve, especially for multiproblem
individuals in communities where abusable substances are widely
available and aggressively marketed, and for individuals who may
be physiologically predisposed to the continued and escalating
use of substances. </p>

<p> In addition to being a precondition (without which abuse and
addiction become impossible), substance use can also be an
important contributor to later abuse and addiction, by affecting
individuals physiologically, psychologically, and
socioculturally.<br>
</p>

<p> Physiological Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Addictive substances affect processes in the brain, some of
them operating through reward systems, and can produce drug
tolerance and dependence. Tolerance manifests itself when, to
produce a given response (e.g., a high), an individual must
ingest more of a substance. Physiological drug dependence has at
least two defining characteristics: the development of tolerance
to the effects of the drug and the manifestation of symptoms of
withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation or reduction in dosage. The
development of physiological tolerance and dependence can
contribute to the progression from use to abuse and addiction: as
tolerance to a substance increases, an individual must ingest
more of the substance to continue to obtain a given desired
response; as dependency develops, an individual must continue to
ingest the substance to avoid the unpleasant experience of
withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> Psychological Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Substance use may contribute to further use and abuse through
psychological means as well. For example, an initial successful
experience of use may reduce an individual's fear about the
substance, thus opening the way to continued use that can lead to
growing tolerance and dependence. </p>

<p> Changes in expectations about the consequences of alcohol use
have also been associated with increases in behavioral tolerance.
Specifically, less impairment from drinking alcohol occurred
when, after the ingestion, successfully performing certain tasks
was rewarded, while all other variables that increase tolerance
were controlled. Several recent studies and a literature review
have found that the ingestion of alcohol increased when the
rewards for alternative behaviors were constrained (24). Also,
social drinkers who expect the effects of alcohol to be better
than the outcomes of other activities may well be more likely to
make the transition to abusive drinking. Such a hypothesis is
supported by several studies that found that alcohol abusers
identify a greater number of favorable conseqences of alcohol
consumption than do nonabusers (24). </p>

<p> Continued use of substances can also impair the learning of
skills, especially among the young, and the ability to remember
lessons once learned. Developmental processes may be slowed,
which may hamper decisionmaking, in general, and about the use of
substances, in particular. However, the progression from use to
abuse may also, in many cases, not be simply linear, as when
individuals move in and out of substance abusing patterns,
depending on the developmental stages and social and cultural
situations and contexts that may be affecting them.<br>
</p>

<p> Sociocultural Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Sociocultural factors, triggered by substance use, can also
contribute to progression in use. An individual who initiates
use, for example, may begin to participate in a subgroup that
encourages use, such as the patrons of crack houses, groups of
heroin users, members of substance-using motorcycle gangs,
adolescent peer groups, cocktail party groups, after-work beer
groups, and groupies who follow certain rock bands. (In some
cases, too, such groups and subcultures may provide the impetus
for the initiation of use as well.) Such social and cultural
environments encourage, reinforce, maintain, and increase
substance use and abuse--all of which can develop after the
initiation of use outside the group. Conversely, the lack of
rewarding, substance-free alternative groups and activities may
render individuals more vulnerable to the appeals of substance-
using groups and subcultures.<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN THE INITIATION OF USE <br>
</p>

<p> Do individuals first use one substance (e.g., alcohol or
tobacco) and only later use another (e.g., cocaine or heroin)?
Are stages in the first use of different substances similar
across cultures? Does the use of one substance (e.g., marijuana)
directly increase the likelihood of later use of another
substance (e.g., heroin)? Or is progression in use caused more by
other mediating factors, such as multiple behavior problems? If
so, might these other problems contribute to later use of certain
substances even in the absence of the use of other substances
earlier on? </p>

<p> The basic question about whether there are stages in the
initiation of the use of different substances has been studied in
the United States (9,11,12,21,27) and in Israel and France (1).
While study results vary somewhat, the sequence most often
reported is that alcohol and cigarette use come first, followed
by marijuana use and then by the use of other illicit substances.
Some variations in this sequence have been found for individuals
of different sexes, racial and ethnic groups, and cultures. The
idea that the use of some substances increases the likelihood of
the use of other substances has led to several hypotheses.<br>
</p>

<p> The Stepping Stone Hypothesis <br>
</p>

<p> In its strongest form, the so-called &quot;stepping
stone&quot; hypothesis asserted that the use of marijuana often
or almost always led to violent crime and to the use of other
illicit substances (28). This hypothesis has never been proved.
An even earlier version of the stepping stone hypothesis goes
back to the beginning of the 20th century, when the presumed
progression from tobacco to alcohol to morphine use was presented
as an argument for prohibiting both alcohol and tobacco. One
observer commented that there was no strong evidence that the use
of these substances causes progression from one to another;
rather, some individuals are more prone to the use of multiple
substances. Also, the criminalization of marijuana may have
caused some marijuana users to move on to other illicit
substances through contact with the subculture of illicit users
(14).<br>
</p>

<p> The Gateway Hypothesis <br>
</p>

<p> More recently, a more moderate hypothesis, the gateway
hypothesis, has been put forward. It asserts that use of certain
substances increases somewhat the chances of progression to the
use of other substances. For example, in one longitudinal study,
men who had used both alcohol and cigarettes by age 15 had a 52
percent greater chance of using marijuana, compared to men who
had never used alcohol or cigarettes by age 25 (26). For women,
the increased chance of marijuana use among alcohol and cigarette
users was 46 percent. Similarly, for the next stage, men who had
used marijuana by age 15 had a 68 percent greater chance of
initiating the use of other illicit substances, compared with
those who had never used marijuana. For women, the increased
probability was 53 percent. <br>
</p>

<p> Early and Frequent Use <br>
</p>

<p> A still more constrained version, but one that may be more
predictive, suggests that early and frequent use increases the
probability of movement to later levels in the sequence (12). For
example, researchers have reported that early use of substances
is associated with later problematic use (7,20).<br>
</p>

<p> Nonuse of a Substance at an Earlier Stage <br>
</p>

<p> Another hypothesis proposes that the nonuse of a substance at
an earlier age reduces the chances of later use of other
substances. A longitudinal study has found that the chance that
an individual who had never used marijuana would move up a level
to use other illicit substances was very low (26). This finding
corroborated conclusions reached earlier based on a
cross-sectional study (18). </p>

<p> Because of variations among communities and cultures, the
search for a universally applicable sequence in the initiation of
the use of different substances may be less fruitful than the
study of why there may be somewhat different sequences, depending
on factors such as availability and social norms. The relative
ease of availability of some substances (e.g., cigarettes, beer,
wine) may well account for their frequent appearance at an early
stage in the sequence of use. However, this may vary among
cultures. In France, for example, wine is widely available and
used both at an early age and at an early stage in the sequence.
In other cultures, where wine is less available but inhalants are
widely available and inexpensive, inhalants are used at an early
age and early in the sequence. Use at a young age may be a
marker, at least in some cultures, for other risk factors, such
as parental substance abuse and other family problems, which can
contribute to later substance abuse problems, independently of
early and frequent use. For example, one study found that,
irrespective of the age of onset of use, individuals who
exhibited numerous behavioral problems in their youth moved on to
problem substance use, no matter how early or late in their youth
they began to use substances (20).<br>
</p>

<p> Limitations in the Research <br>
</p>

<p> Research into stages in the initiation of the use of
different substances has itself evolved through stages. A number
of issues, which have not been thoroughly addressed, remain: </p>

<p> o The identification of stages in the progression from use to
abuse and addiction is more a description of the stages some
individuals move through than a prediction of necessary stages
for most individuals, since the majority of substance users do
not move on to abuse. Reasonable questions are: What prevents
some individuals from progressing from initial use to abuse and
addiction? Are the obstacles primarily due to the absence of
preconditions, such as biological and pharmacological
preconditions or availability and marketing. Studying those
individuals who do not progress from use to addiction may provide
insights and lessons about how to prevent progression among those
who do progress. Of particular importance are studies of the
changing vulnerabilities and resiliencies of individuals in
different developmental stages from childhood through
adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood. </p>

<p> o What is the role of substance use in progression to abuse
and addiction? The initiation of use of a particular substance
may often not be the most important contributor to the use of a
substance higher in the sequence. Other factors directly related
to use may play a larger role. For example, age of onset,
quantity, frequency, techniques, and purposes of the substance
use may be more salient. Longitudinal risk factor and expectancy
studies have begun to look at the role of these other elements. </p>

<p> o Are some individuals more predisposed to use and abuse
substances than others? Individual biological and psychological
factors may also strongly influence which individuals progress
from use to abuse. </p>

<p> o What environmental factors contribute to substance use and
abuse? Availability, marketing, social norms, peer groups,
subcultures, and settings that encourage substance use may also
be key in determining which individuals progress. </p>

<p> Despite the need for greater understanding about the issues
above, already completed research into stages in substance use
has been influential in providing the basis for policy and
program recommendations. The gateway hypothesis has encouraged
some prevention advocates and program planners to focus on
preventing or delaying the use of gateway substances (e.g.,
alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana) as a possibly effective way to
prevent later use of illicit substances. Longitudinal studies
have found that the use of cigarettes by youth can be a strong
predictor of later problems with substances (17).<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN THE CYCLE OF USE, ABUSE, AND ADDICTION <br>
</p>

<p> One approach to the study of stages in substance use focuses
not just on the initiation of use; but also on the continuation
of use, maintenance and progression of use within a class of
substances; progression across classes; and regression,
cessation, and relapse cycles in use and abuse (2).<br>
</p>

<p> Initiation of Use <br>
</p>

<p> Initiation is clearly a key first step in the progression to
more serious levels of use. Because substance use is often
initiated during adolescence, most substance use research has
focused on initiation of use among adolescents. However, most
individuals who initiate substance use do not progress to harmful
use. Also, the factors associated with such progression may often
differ from the factors associated with initiation. Thus, the
focus on the initiation of use during adolescence is not
sufficient for an understanding of the progression from use to
abuse and addiction. <br>
</p>

<p> Continuation of Use <br>
</p>

<p> After trying a substance for the first time, one person may
say, &quot;I won't be trying that again,&quot; while another may
say, &quot;That's for me.&quot; Although only limited research
has been conducted on risk and protective factors associated with
the transition from experimentation to continued use, the
continuation of use can apparently be influenced by the
pharmacology of the substance (e.g., whether it produces desired
or pleasant experiences), the biology of the individual (e.g.,
whether specific individuals have genetic or acquired biological
predispositions or intolerances to the use of specific
substances), the availability and marketing of the substance
(e.g., whether a substance is widely available, used, and
accepted for use), other characteristics of the individual (e.g.,
at what developmental stage one is, and whether one has mental or
emotional problems, which may be ameliorated at least temporarily
by substances), and community contexts (e.g., substance-using
subcultures or settings that strongly encourage and reinforce a
continued use of substances).<br>
</p>

<p> Maintenance and Progression of Use Within a Class of Drugs<br>
</p>

<p> Maintenance and progression may include conformity with norms
of consumption--for example, initial and continued heavy use of
alcohol in a college fraternity. Progressionwith cocaine could
entail movement from snorting to smoking or injection. College
students in some fraternities and sororities with drinking
traditions may be at higher risk for heavy substance use,
especially of alcohol. But very little research has been
conducted on the risk factors for maintenance of high levels of
use or for progression within classes of substances to excessive
use among this age group.<br>
</p>

<p> Progression in Use Across Classes of Substances <br>
</p>

<p> At this stage, an individual may try different substances for
different, and often compensating, effects. For example, the
antiemetic properties of tetrahydracannabinol in cannabis can be
used to facilitate greater use of alcohol, alcohol or marijuana
can be used to smooth out the aftermath of snorting cocaine, and
heroin can be used for similar purposes after a binge with crack.<br>
</p>

<p> Regression, Cessation, and Relapse Cycles <br>
</p>

<p> The transition away from abuse may occur a number of times
before an individual succeeds in getting off a substance or,
failing that, remains dependent. It may also be influenced by the
same factors, or kinds of factors, that contributed to the
substance abuse problem in the first place, including the full
range of biological and pharmacological factors, availability and
marketing, individual emotional needs, or contextual factors.<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN PROBLEM BEHAVIORS <br>
</p>

<p> Does substance use itself contribute to conduct disorders,
delinquency, and other problem behaviors? Do these behaviors
then, in turn, contribute to the progression to more use and to
abuse and addiction? </p>

<p> Adolescents who use substances, especially those that are
illegal, are more likely than nonusers to exhibit various problem
behaviors, including: early sexual experimentation, delinquent
activities, eating problems, and psychological or psychiatric
problems, including suicide and suicidal thoughts (10). Less is
known, however, about the sequencing of these behaviors. The
interrelations among the factors is likely to vary widely among
individuals, but some sequences may predominate. Several such
sequences have been proposed. One suggested developmental
sequence, for example, includes six stages: oppositional
(characterized by disobedience at home); offensive (including
disobedience in school, fighting, lying); aggressive (physical
attacks on others, theft at home); minor delinquency (shoplifting
and status offenses, such as alcohol use, truancy, running away);
major delinquency (break-in and entry, car theft, substance
abuse, robbery, drug dealing); and violence (assault, rape,
homicide) (15). </p>

<p> One of the few studies of problem behavior sequences looked
at the order of initiation of four different substances,
delinquency, and sexual activity, among a sample of black
adolescents (3). For males, it found involvement proceeded
generally from beer use to cigarette use, then to delinquency,
sexual activity, marijuana use, and the use of hard liquor. For
females, the progression was generally from cigarette use, to
delinquency, beer use, sexual activity, marijuana, and hard
liquor. For both sexes, delinquency and youthful sexual activity
tended to precede the use of marijuana and hard liquor. </p>

<p> While a high correlation among problem behaviors has been
frequently found, the sequencing of those behaviors is less
clear. The early use of so-called gateway drugs, such as beer and
cigarettes, may contribute to later problem behaviors, while the
later use of marijuana, hard liquor, and other illicit substances
may be more the result of extended participation in problem
behaviors. More research is needed in this area if these
hypotheses are to be better understood and tested.<br>
</p>

<p> KEY ASPECTS OF USE <br>
</p>

<p> Some research has focused on characteristics of substance use
that can strongly influence the progression from use to abuse and
addiction. In addition to the age of first use, these
characteristics include the frequency, quantity, and type of
substance used, and the technologies and purposes and
expectations of use.<br>
</p>

<p> Age of First Use <br>
</p>

<p> Initiation into substance use at a young age is one of the
most striking and often-found predictors of later problems,
including abuse. For example, in one large community epidemiology
study, men who first used substances before age 15 developed
mental and behavioral problems in 51 percent of the cases,
compared with 16 percent among those who began at age 18 or
later. For women, the comparable figures are 39 and 12 percent,
respectively. Other studies have also found problems later on
associated with the earlier introduction to alcohol or other drug
use (19). </p>

<p> This pattern seems to hold specifically for later substance
use and abuse as well. Early use of substances was found to be
associated with later problematic use (7,20). Another study
estimated that, of the men who had initiated the use of marijuana
by the age of 14, 71 percent would be expected to initiate the
use of other illicit substances by age 25, compared with 9
percent of those who first started at age 21 (12). </p>

<p> One report asserted that frequency of use was the mechanism
through which early onset probably operates (12). However,
another study concludes that preexisting conduct problems are a
better predictor of later substance abuse problems than is early
use (19). It found that, in individuals with many conduct
problems, any use of a substance, no matter how late in youth,
was followed by abuse. <br>
</p>

<p> Frequency and Quantity of Substance Used <br>
</p>

<p> When addiction occurs, it usually results from a period of
increasing intensity and frequency of use (5,6). Although
frequency has often been employed as a measure of problematic
use, one study found that quantity of substance used, rather than
frequency of use, was a more powerful predictor of disruptive and
problematic use (21). Quantity and frequency are often related,
but they are not identical. An infrequent user could go on a
binge, where large quantities are consumed, that could be
extremely harmful. By contrast, a frequent user, such as someone
who drinks alcohol every day but in strict moderation, may not
encounter substance-related problems (although a maintenance
alcoholic may drink daily with no apparent intoxication, but with
the later development of associated health problems). The
quantity and frequency of substance use can be strongly affected
by the availability and marketing of the substance and by the
techniques or technologies for administering the drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Type of Substance Used <br>
</p>

<p> The type of substance used can also influence the chances of
later substance problems. More addictive substances--those with
greater abuse liability--will make restraint from continued and
possibly escalating use more difficult. Cigarettes provide an
example experienced by many individuals: nicotine is extremely
addictive, and only a minority of those who try cigarettes and
continue to smoke them will be able to control or easily cut back
on their use.<br>
</p>

<p> Techniques of Use <br>
</p>

<p> Techniques of administration can also influence the
progression of substance use. The introduction of prewrapped,
prepackaged cigarettes, together with widely distributed matches,
was followed by the rapid escalation of cigarette use, and
presumably addiction to nicotine, in the United States in the
late 1800s and early 1900s. Similarly, the introduction of
smokable free-base and crack cocaine, the administration of which
is much more efficient than the snorting of powdered cocaine, led
to an explosion of cocaine abuse and addiction. The Bahamas, for
example, experienced a hundredfold increase in cocaine-related
hospital emergency room admissions following the introduction of
crack and free-base cocaine in the 1980s (8).<br>
</p>

<p> Expectations and Effects of Use <br>
</p>

<p> The expectations and effects of use can also reinforce use
and influence progression from use to abuse and addiction.
Research reviews have discussed some examples of the expectations
and effects of using illicit substances that can reinforce their
use and may increase the likelihood of progression to abuse and
addiction (13,25). These purposes include: </p>

<p> o The reduction of negative feelings, including the use of
stimulants to alleviate depression and weakness; psychedelics to
combat boredom and disillusionment; alcohol to assuage feelings
of guilt, loneliness, and anxiety; and tranquilizers,
amphetamines, and sedatives to reduce painful feelings. </p>

<p> o The reduction of self-rejection. Some researchers have
found an association between substance use and indices of
insecurity, dis-satisfaction with self, desire to change oneself,
defensiveness, low self-esteem, and low self- confidence. </p>

<p> o The increase in potency. Increases in physical and sexual
potency, daring, and toughness can be achieved by using specific
substances in certain situations. This can be especially
appealing to youth, who may be wrestling with feelings of
powerlessness, dissatisfaction, and frustration. </p>

<p> o The expression of anger. Substances can heighten
expressions of anger (e.g., in opposition to mainstream norms) or
can medicate away anger and rage. Narcotics and hypnotics may
help reduce rage, shame, jealousy, and impulses toward extreme
aggressiveness. </p>

<p> o The achievement of peer acceptance. Peers often play the
largest role in endorsing and encouraging substance use, and in
supplying substances. The initiation, continuation, and
progression of use can be important ways for individuals to gain
acceptance into peer groups. This can be true in school (e.g., in
a fraternity), at work (e.g., in a sales force that demands that
one be able to &quot;hold one's liquor&quot;), in substance-using
gangs, and among certain groups of artists (e.g., some
contemporary painters and musicians). </p>

<p> o The seeking of euphoria. Many substance users, especially
addicts, report favorably on drug-induced euphoria. Indeed, the
prospect of euphoria may be the initial attraction of the
substance. It can also encourage continued use, even to the point
of addiction and negative consequences. </p>

<p> o The coping with problems. For some users, substances
temporarily alleviate problems they have been unable to resolve
in other ways. While the problems may be causing emotional pain,
the use of substances, especially for the young, can inhibit the
development of other problem-solving skills and may alleviate
symptoms only in the short-run, since the underlying causes of
the problems are likely to remain unresolved. </p>

<p> o The reduction of overwhelming trauma. Post-traumatic stress
(e.g., after a war, or after physical or sexual abuse) can result
in the use of addictive substances, since use may temporarily
reduce fears, flashbacks, and other negative feelings. </p>

<p> o The suppression of appetite or hunger. Another function of
using some psychoactive substances is appetite suppression. An
extensive literature exists on the use of nicotine, from
cigarette smoking, to control appetite and weight. This
phenomenon often manifests itself in the negative: for example,
current smokers (especially women) are reluctant to stop smoking
for fear they will gain weight (4). </p>

<p> o The seeking of stimulus. Individuals who seek higher levels
of external stimulation can also turn to substances, for a high,
for hallucinations, for unpredictable effects. </p>

<p> o The regulation of affective and behavioral impairments.
Those with mood disorders, such as depression, and behavioral
impairments may find that some substances alter moods and allow
them to modify behaviors. </p>

<p> The above expectations and effects might well be expected to
contribute to more continued and progressively heavier substance
use than would more casual purposes such as curiosity,
experimentation, or recreational use. The more
&quot;serious&quot; the expectations, effects, and functions of
substance use, the greater the likelihood of continued use and
abuse may be. As noted earlier, the use of substances, especially
by the young, to address problems or to achieve feelings may
impede the development of skills for managing feelings and
behaviors and for solving problems, and thus may result in
deficiencies in handling problems in life later on. Indeed, the
use of substances at very young ages may even contribute to
permanent changes in the brain that may contribute to further use
and abuse. More research is needed to clarify the connections
between the expectations and effects of use and the progression
to heavier and more problematic use and abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> SUMMARY <br>
</p>

<p> Substance use, including the progression to heavier and more
harmful use, is a precondition and contributor to abuse and
addiction. Researchers have focused on stages in the progression
of substance use in several ways. They have studied stages in the
initiation of the use of different substances, finding a sequence
that moves from the use of cigarettes and wine or beer, to the
use of marijuana, then hard liquor, and finally other illicit
substances. Because many individuals who use substances do not go
on to substance abuse, and because use at one level does not
guarantee use at a higher level, these stages are descriptive but
not predictive. </p>

<p> In addition to the biologically and pharmacologically
reinforcing properties of addictive substances that can lead to
tolerance and dependence, key aspects of substance use that
contribute to abuse and addiction include age of first use, the
frequency, quantity, and type of substance used, and the
techniques and expectations and effects of use. _ <br>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 6 INDIVIDUAL RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> No single or generic set of variables explains the misuse of
substances for every individual. Depending on an individual's
biological makeup, developmental stage, and interaction with
various environmental forces, individual risk, vulnerability, and
resilience to substance abuse and addiction will vary for
different factors at different times (3). </p>

<p> Much of the research on substance abuse has focused on
identifying factors for drug and alcohol use (see table 6- 1),
specifically among adolescents and young adults. Risk factors for
substance abuse have been identified as those cognitive,
psychological, attitudinal, social, pharmacological,
physiological, and developmental characteristics that foster
initiation of drug and alcohol use and abuse by an individual.
There is some consensus in the field of risk factor research that
probably two fairly distinct sets of risk factors affect
individuals differently. Social, situational, and environmental
factors are likely to be more influential in initial or low-level
substance use, while individuals who progress from use to abuse
or addiction are influenced to a greater extent by biological,
psychological, and psychiatric factors (27). This distinction
between risk factors is more thoroughly discussed in chapter 5.
Protective factors are those characteristics that reduce the risk
of substance abuse and addiction and promote positive development
such as, appropriate role models, involvement in positive peer
groups, and a positive self-image and outlook for the future. </p>

<p> This chapter focuses on a select group of individual factors
that has been combined under the three headings: Demographics, </p>

<p> Economics, and Psychosocial/Behavioral. Factors not directly
discussed in this chapter are reviewed in either Part I or III of
the report. These factors may not appear in every individual with
substance abuse and addiction problems, nor will all individuals
exposed to these factors use or abuse drugs. In addition,
unanimous agreement is lacking within the field of substance
abuse and addiction on the importance, number, order of
appearance, or interactive effects of many of these factors. </p>

<p> Where applicable, each of the factors has been reviewed in
the following manner: historical perspectives; current
prevalence; psychosocial and cultural antecedents; biological and
genetic antecedents; relevant prevention programs; and areas for
future research. </p>

<p> DEMOGRAPHICS </p>

<p> Age </p>

<p> The preponderance of substance abuse research points to the
fact that children who use drugs and alcohol before the age of 15
have a greater likelihood of becoming problem alcohol and other
drug users, versus those youth who begin use at a later age (28).
</p>

<p> Highlights from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA) provide a somber picture of substance use among the
Nation's children (77). Lifetime and past month substance use,
rates for continued substance use, as well as differences in
racial and ethnic substance use (see box 6-1) are reviewed in
this section. </p>

<p> As part of NHSDA, data on lifetime use of alcohol and
cigarettes (whose use is illicit for minors) has been collected
for youth aged 12 to 17 since 1974; data collection on other
illicit drug use began in 1979 (see figure 6-1). The lifetime use
findings include: </p>

<p> o Rates in 1991 for lifetime use of alcohol, cigarettes, or
other illicit drugs were the lowest recorded since the survey
series began 17 years ago. The highest rates for any substance
use appeared in the late 1970s. </p>

<p> o In 1979, 70 percent of youth aged 12 to 17 reported some
lifetime use of alcohol compared to 46 percent in 1991. Since
1979, lifetime cigarette use has dropped from 54 percent to 38
percent. </p>

<p> o Since 1979, the use of other illicit substances
(methaqualone, inhalants, heroin, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP),
crack, tranquilizers, stimulants, other opiates, barbiturates,
nitrites, lysergic acid diethylamide, hallucinogens, and
marijuana) has followed a similar trend with rates decreasing
from a high of 34 percent to the 1991 rate of 20 percent. </p>

<p> A complementary study of adolescents shows 1991 data for
substance use within the past 30 days among a sample of
approximately 17,500 eighth graders, 14,800 tenth graders, and
15,000 twelfth graders (75). </p>

<p> o Any alcohol use within the past 30 days was reported by 25
percent of the eighth graders, 43 percent of the tenth graders,
and 54 percent of the twelfth graders. Having had more than five
drinks in the last two weeks was reported by 13 percent of the
eighth graders, 23 percent of the tenth graders, and 30 percent
of the twelfth graders. </p>

<p> o Fourteen percent of the eighth graders, 21 percent of the
tenth graders, and 28 percent of the twelfth graders reported
smoking cigarettes within the past month. Those who smoked more
than one-half pack per day included 3 percent of the eighth
graders, 7 percent of the tenth graders, and 11 percent of the
twelfth graders. </p>

<p> o The other most commonly used substance for eighth and tenth
graders was smokeless tobacco with 7 and 10 percent reported,
respectively. Eighth graders had the highest percentage of past
month inhalant use (4 percent), and of those individuals,
approximately 1 percent reported using inhalants on 3 to 5
occasions within the past month. </p>

<p> o For tenth and twelfth graders, the other most commonly used
substance was marijuana and/or hashish with 9 percent of the
tenth graders and 14 percent of the twelfth graders reporting
past 30-day use. Of those individuals, approximately 2 and 3
percent, respectively, had used marijuana and/or hashish on three
to five occasions. </p>

<p> Another important indicator of potential substance abuse
problems among adolescents is the noncontinuation rate for the
use of certain substances. This is an indication of the extent to
which people who try a drug do not continue to use it, and is
based on the number of individuals who reported ever using a drug
divided by the those who have not used the drug in the past 12
months (75). </p>

<p> Among a sample of twelfth graders in 1991, the data show that
noncontinuation rates vary widely among the different drugs, with
the highest rates observed for methaqualone and inhalants (62
percent). As mentioned previously, inhalant use is higher among
younger individuals. The noncontinuation of methaqualone may be
due, in part, to the decrease in its availability. A high
noncontinuation rate is also seen for heroin (56 percent),
cocaine (55 percent), PCP (52 percent), and crack (52 percent).
Marijuana has one of the lowest noncontinuation rates (35
percent) in the senior year of any of the illicit drugs;
primarily because a relatively high proportion of seniors
continue to use it at some level over an extended period of time.
</p>

<p> Additionally, the noncontinuation rates for alcohol and
cigarettes are extremely low. In other words, 88 percent of the
seniors reported some lifetime use of alcohol, and of those
individuals, 78 percent have continued to use it within the past
year, thus only 12 percent of the seniors reported no alcohol use
in the preceding 12 months. Cigarette noncontinuation was defined
somewhat differently, as the percentage of those who said they
had ever smoked &quot;regularly&quot; and who also reported not
smoking at all during the past month. Of the regular smokers,
only 17 percent stopped smoking within the past month. </p>

<p> An obvious drawback to these data is the fact that only those
individuals who have not dropped out of school are included in
the survey. It is not unrealistic to assume that those students
with serious drug problems may well have left school before the
twelfth grade. More specific discussion of the factors that
influence the risk of adolescent substance abuse, as well as
prevention programs targeting youth, are thoroughly reviewed in
chapter 8. </p>

<p> While the majority of attention is focused on adolescent
substance use and abuse, young adults and older adults also show
significant levels of substance use and abuse. The 1991
statistics from the NHSDA reveal that heavy drinking (defined as
drinking five or more drinks per occasion on 5 or more days in
the past month) was reported by 2 percent of 12 to 17 year olds,
11 percent of 18 to 25 year olds, 7 percent of 26 to 34 year
olds, and 4 percent of those 35 and older (77). For those same
age categories, smoking a pack or more of cigarettes per day was
reported by 1, 13, 17, and 17 percent, respectively. The illicit
substances reported being used most often in the past month among
all age groups were marijuana and hashish. Individuals 18 to 25
had the highest percentage (13 percent) and those 26 to 34 the
next highest percentage (7 percent). The second most commonly
reported illicit substance was the nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics, which was again highest among 18 to 25 year
olds (3 percent) followed by those 26 to 34 (2 percent); all
other age groups reported less than 2 percent. </p>

<p> Clearly then, the heavy use of some substances is not
exclusive to adolescents. Young- to middle-aged and older adults
can also be exposed to stressful risk factors, such as loss of a
job, divorce, or death of a child, which could contribute to
alcohol or drug problems. The adult population presents unique
and often overlooked challenges for the planning and
implementation of substance abuse prevention programs. </p>

<p> Gender </p>

<p> Historically, the vast majority of biological and behavioral
substance abuse studies were conducted on male participants,
although that has begun to change. A distorted picture emerged,
in which women were assumed to misuse the same substances, and
for the same reasons, as their male counterparts. It has only
been within the past 10 to 20 years that separate research has
been conducted on the causes and consequences of alcohol and drug
problems among women. </p>

<p> Women have not been immune to the harmful effects of alcohol
and other drugs. In the late 1800s twice as many women were
addicted to narcotics as men. The majority of these women were
white, middle-aged, and of upper-middle class status. Some had
become addicted through the prescription of narcotics for a host
of so-called female problems, while others knowingly misused
opium, heroin, morphine, and cocaine (53). </p>

<p> The number of women drinking alcohol and experiencing
alcohol-related problems has risen steadily since World War II.
At least one-third of the estimated 18 million alcoholics and
problem drinkers in the United States are thought to be women.
These figures, which many consider to be conservative, would
suggest that close to 6 million women are currently dealing with
the medical, legal, and social problems of alcohol misuse (53). </p>

<p> Overall, men report more frequent use of alcohol, cigarettes,
and all illicit substances (except nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics) than women (79,77). However, this does not
mean that there is not substantial alcohol and drug use among
women (see table 6-2). Additionally, some gender and ethnic
differences may be attributable to failure to survey hidden
populations. The risk status of women who are not in the
workforce, do not receive prenatal care, and are not visible
through arrest, is less reliably known. </p>

<p> Neither men, nor women, should be considered homogeneous. For
example, alcohol use and its misuse can vary widely between
different racial and ethnic groups. Among men, Hispanics (60
percent) were slightly more likely to have used alcohol within
the past month than whites (59 percent) or blacks (52 percent)
(77). In general, white women drink more frequently than other
women. Large numbers of Native American, Hispanic, black, and
Asian women do not drink at all (70). Additionally, poor and
minority women appear to come under closer scrutiny for alcohol
and drug abuse than do financially secure or white women (see box
6-2). These racial and ethnic differences are more fully
discussed in the following section. </p>

<p> Do men and women cite different reasons for the misuse of
alcohol and other drugs? Over the last several decades within the
United States, the socially defined roles for men and women have
undergone substantial changes. When given a choice, many women
have opted for the traditional role of a stay-at-home mother and
homemaker, while other women have pursued career paths that may
or may not include marriage and children, and still others have
attempted to combine the two. These fairly recent changes have
brought pressures and risks many women had not been subjected to
previously. </p>

<p> Women in the workplace are more likely to encounter drinking
opportunities such as business lunches and office celebrations,
where they may feel encouraged or even pressured to drink (53).
Women have also been recently targeted by the beer, tobacco, and
liquor industries, as well as by small-scale marketing by
nightclubs and bars in the form of ladies' nights. </p>

<p> In the early 1970s, researcher Sharon Wilsnack postulated
that some women may abuse alcohol to submerge those aspects of
themselves that did not conform to the traditional female sex
role, thereby allowing them to feel more acceptably feminine
(53). More recently, several studies on female alcoholics have
shown that women, more frequently than men, can pinpoint a
specific traumatic life event that they believe precipitated
their problem drinking. The crises identified most often by women
included a partner's infidelity, the death of a family member, a
child leaving home, postpartum depression, divorce or separation,
infertility, gynecological problems, and menopause (39,53). </p>

<p> A similar study focused on the impact of various life events
on alcoholic men and women. Alcoholic men placed significant
importance on work-related events, marriage issues, sexual
difficulties, and arguments with spouses. In addition to those
events cited by the men, alcoholic women focused on social
activities, family troubles, stillbirth and adoption, and death
of a close relative (40). </p>

<p> While much of the substance abuse research has focused on
alcohol issues, various researchers have examined the differences
between men and women in their use of illicit substances with or
without the presence of alcohol. For men and women cocaine
addicts in treatment, the following significant differences were
noted (40,41,35): </p>

<p> o Women had started to use cocaine at a younger age than men,
conversely to what is generally found among opiate users and
alcoholics. </p>

<p> o Women had a significantly lower level of social adjustment
than male patients. </p>

<p> o Women patients were less likely to be employed, to hold
high status jobs, to be self-supporting, and to be financing
their own drug use. </p>

<p> o Women were more likely than men to cite specific reasons
for their drug use: depression, feeling unsociable, family and
job pressures, and health problems; whereas men more often cited
the intoxicating effects of cocaine as a reason for their drug
use. </p>

<p> o Men reported experiencing more guilt (47 vs. 23 percent),
whereas women noted that one of the desirable effects of cocaine
use was a reduction in their feelings of guilt. </p>

<p> o Women were more often diagnosed with depression than men,
and their depression took longer to treat, while men were more
often diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. </p>

<p> o Most men and women reported that they used cocaine to be
more sociable. </p>

<p> o Women demonstrated a slower recovery than men, and had more
residual problems. </p>

<p> Gender differences among opiate addicts have also been
explored. Researchers have shown that female addicts are more
likely than male addicts to have first been introduced to heroin
by family members or others close to them, and to have
experienced severe family disruption (36). The development of the
women's opiate dependence is also more likely to be linked to the
family's approval of use or the absence of clear disapproval of
use, in combination with easy access to the drug (35). </p>

<p> Differences in marijuana smoking may also be partially
attributable to gender. In a recent review, it was shown that
men's marijuana smoking was tied more to the availability of the
drug, while women's smoking was affected to a greater degree by
social influences, such as weekday versus weekend smoking, and
the smoking of their male partners. Women have also been shown to
increase their marijuana smoking during periods of anger and
other unpleasant dispositions (41). </p>

<p> In addition to discovering some sociocultural
dissimilarities, gender differences in biological and genetic
susceptibility to substance abuse have been examined. The role of
heritability and genetics in influencing individual
susceptibility is more thoroughly discussed in chapter 3, thus
the discussion in this section will concentrate on biological
differences. Again, a large portion of these studies has
concentrated on alcohol and its effects. </p>

<p> In the late 1970s it was reported that when men and women of
comparable body weight were given equivalent doses of alcohol,
women achieved higher blood alcohol levels. However, these
findings have been challenged, as more recent studies have shown
that if the blood alcohol level is based on total body water
rather than weight, the difference in levels between men and
women is insignificant (65). </p>

<p> Another avenue that has been explored in explaining the
gender difference in blood alcohol levels has to do with the
metabolism of alcohol. Based on findings from animal research,
Mario Frezza et al. (25) investigated differences in the
&quot;first-pass metabolism&quot; between men and women. Data
from animal studies reveal that a significant amount of ingested
ethanol does not enter the circulatory system, but rather is
neutralized in the stomach by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.
Using a small study sample (6 alcoholic and 14 nonalcoholic men,
6 alcoholic and 17 nonalcoholic women) Frezza et al. investigated
whether the first-pass metabolism and enzyme activity level
varied between men and women, and alcoholic and nonalcoholic
individuals. They discovered that both gender and chronic alcohol
abuse had statistically significant effects on the first-pass
metabolism of alcohol, specifically, the first-pass metabolism
was considerably lower among alcoholic women compared to
alcoholic men, which in turn was lower than nonalcoholic men.
Similar findings were reported for the alcohol dehydrogenase
activity level; with the highest activity levels (70 to 80
percent) found in the nonalcoholic men and women, less activity
among the alcoholic men (37 to 46 percent), and the smallest
activity level among alcoholic women (11 to 20 percent). To
summarize, the women in general had lower rates of first- pass
metabolism and lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase activity,
which both lead to an increase in the amount of ethanol in the
circulatory system. The levels of enzyme activity further
decreased among the alcoholic women and the first-pass metabolism
was essentially nonexistent, indicating little neutralization by
the stomach. </p>

<p> Researchers have also been studying the effect of hormonal
changes during the menstrual cycle on alcohol absorption rates.
Alcohol absorption has been reported to vary during a woman's
cycle--specifically, the rate of alcohol absorption increases
premenstrually. However, data from other clinicaland animal
trials have disputed these findings (65). </p>

<p> What is clear from this type of biological research is that
few firm conclusions can be made about gender differences in
response to alcohol ingestion, and even fewer still about
biological responses to drugs other than alcohol. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the psychosocial differences that have been
identified between the sexes could assist practitioners in the
development of more gender specific substance abuse prevention
programs. For example, because many women can pinpoint specific
events in their lives that they believe contributed to their
heavy alcohol or drug use, it would behoove professionals working
with women to be cognizant of these factors. General inquires
could be made at yearly physical or gynecological exams, which
could also serve as informational sessions on the dangers of
alcohol and drug use (39). In addition, special attention should
be paid toward adolescent girls whose first experience with
alcohol and drugs is often through a male family member or
boyfriend. </p>

<p> Broadly speaking, there are basic gaps in knowledge
concerning gender differences and substance use within virtually
all the parts identified in this report: Part I- necessary
preconditions; Part II-individual factors; and Part III-activity
settings. Until these gaps are addressed, the practice of
transferring data garnered from studies specific for one gender,
to the other gender, is inaccurate and misleading. </p>

<p> Race and Ethnicity </p>

<p> Historically, racial and ethnic minorities have been linked
with, and often blamed for, many of the drug problems within the
United States. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, the
general public associated the growth in opium addicts with the
arrival of Chinese immigrants; although numerous physicians had
been freely prescribing narcotic preparations to their patients,
many of whom were middle- to upper-class whites. The drug cocaine
has long been associated with blacks. A popular image during this
time was one of cocaine-crazed blacks, although use of cocaine
was widespread among whites as well (86). Throughout this same
period, marijuana was thought to have been brought into the
country and promoted by Mexican immigrants and later picked up by
the subculture of black jazz musicians. Due in part to public
paranoia, the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which was a direct
attempt to control marijuana use, was born (45). </p>

<p> In the minds of many individuals, this derogatory link
between minority populations and rampant drug abuse has
continued. Certainly, many urban areas have high concentrations
of minorities, and within these areas the prevalence of alcohol
and drug abuse may be high. Often over-looked, however, is the
existence of alcohol and drug problems in suburban and rural
areas throughout the United States, which have varying
percentages of minorities. </p>

<p> Prevalence rates for past month use of an illicit substance
in 1992 (see figure 6-2) are not drastically different between
whites, blacks, and Hispanics, although it should be kept in mind
that this statistic does not accurately reflect abuse or
addiction. Even though the prevalence of illicit substance use
was highest among blacks, over three-fourths (76 percent) of the
past month illicit substance users were white. In other words,
there were approximately 8.7 million whites, 1.5 million blacks,
885,000 Hispanics, and 315,000 individuals of other racial and
ethnic groups who reported past month use of an illicit substance
in 1992 (79). </p>

<p> Also for 1992 among individuals aged 12 and older, whites
reported the highest percentage of alcohol use within the past
week (21 percent), followed by blacks (19 percent), and Hispanics
(18 percent) (79). The rates for heavy drinking were not
statistically different by race or ethnicity (5 percent for
whites and blacks, and 6 percent for Hispanics) (78). </p>

<p> Until fairly recently, much of the analysis of substance use
data has concentrated on the correlations between the use of a
substance and one or two variables such as race and ethnicity
and/or educational level. Often a positive association was found
between minority populations and the use of certain substances.
While statistically correct, these analyses can be simplistic and
misleading (see box 6- 3). Clearly many risk and protective
factors interact to produce substance use and abuse. If the
majority of these variables are excluded from the analysis, a
skewed picture may arise as to the importance of certain
variables as risk factors for substance use and abuse.
Additionally, to simplify the data collection, racial and ethnic
categories are often broad. The most popular groupings are
blacks, white non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other. Though each of
these categories contains many distinct cultures, gross
generalizations are commonly made within each category. </p>

<p> In recent years, there has been a shift toward analyzing more
carefully the complex relationship between cigarette, alcohol and
illicit drug use, and socioeconomic and demographic variables.
The previous research had drawn on relatively small databases.
However, in 1992, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
critically analyzed the national drug use data collected in its
1988 and 1990 NHSDA. Predictors of drug and alcohol use included
an extensive array of both individual variables (e.g., age,
educational level, marital status) and aggregate variables based
on the attributes of the census block, community, or region in
which the respondent lived (see table 6-3 for a complete list). </p>

<p> The effect of select variables such as race and ethnicity
were measured, while simultaneously controlling for all other
variables (e.g., age, educational level, employment status).
Individuals of racial and ethnic minorities were found to be no
more likely than whites to use alcohol heavily (defined as having
five or more drinks on five or more days in the past month) or to
use marijuana, cocaine, or psychotherapeutic drugs (inclusion of
crack or heroin in the analysis was impossible due to the small
number of respondents reporting use). In fact, when socioeconomic
status was controlled for, both blacks and Hispanics had a
substantially lower likelihood of heavy alcohol use than whites
(76). </p>

<p> A reanalysis of the 1988 NHSDA data was accomplished by an
independent group of researchers who clustered the respondent
data into neighborhood risk sets. The original analysis on the
1988 data revealed that for all ages, blacks and Hispanics were
twice as likely to have ever used crack cocaine than were whites.
Once neighborhood clusters were established, the data revealed
that given similar social and environmental conditions, crack use
did not differ significantly for blacks or Hispanics compared
with whites (9). However, the number of reported crack users in
the study was relatively small (138), and neighborhoods were
identified as crack neighborhoods with as few as one reported
crack user, thus the research findings should not be generalized.
</p>

<p> The new research hypothesized that the previous racial
differences found in the prevalence of crack cocaine smoking may
have been due to macrosocial environmental risk factors
including: differences in the availability of crack; employment
rates; premature death rates; community contact with the criminal
justice system; socially acceptable mechanisms for coping with
life stressors; distribution of wealth; and access to social
resources. </p>

<p> While both studies had specific limitations, the importance
of these types of analyses cannot be understated. Focus should be
placed on the interaction between communities and individuals and
the relative influence on subsequent drug and alcohol use, rather
than a person's race or ethnicity. </p>

<p> Race or ethnicity has not been shown to be either a
biological or genetic risk factor for substance use or abuse. To
date, the preponderance of investigative studies has focused on
racial and ethnic differences in response specifically to
alcohol. Virtually no study has been completed on differences in
racial and ethnic biological responses to other licit or illicit
drugs. </p>

<p> Individual metabolism of alcohol is essentially controlled by
two enzymes, aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. If
the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase is inactive for any reason,
ingestion of even a small amount of alcohol can cause rapid and
prominent facial flushing. Continued drinking leads to nausea,
dizziness, palpitations, and faintness. This reaction is seen
among many Asians (84,16). </p>

<p> A mutant form of alcohol dehydrogenase will effect the
efficiency of alcohol metabolism as well. Altered forms of the
alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme have also been reported in several
Asian populations. </p>

<p> The two enzymes, aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase, probably
interact in some individuals to amplify the adverse reaction to
alcohol consumption (57). Since this reaction discourages heavy
drinking, the observation that it commonly occurs in some
populations where alcoholism is relatively rare suggests that
alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase mutations might be a major
determinant of alcohol consumption, abuse, and dependence. This
would seem to hold true for Taiwan and Japan where the reaction
occurs in 30 to 50 percent of individuals. Research on these two
enzymes among other racial and ethnic groups is scanty and
inconclusive. </p>

<p> The role genetics plays in the heritability of alcohol and
other drug problems has been studied for the past 30 years. While
this topic is more thoroughly addressed in chapter 3, one point
is worth mentioning here. Of the more than 30 family, twin, and
adoption studies that have been completed, the vast majority have
used white males as study subjects. Clearly, among different
racial and ethnic groups the relationship between genetic
heritability and increased susceptibility to alcohol and other
drug problems is an area that deserves further study. </p>

<p> While race and ethnicity in and of themselves are not
predictive risk factors for future substance abuse, by reviewing
when, how, and why certain substances became problematic within
different racial and ethnic groups, insight can be gained into
the generational impact drugs have had on these populations. Four
broad racial and ethnic groups (and one multiracial and ethnic
group, see box 6-4) are discussed below in the following manner:
historical perspectives; prevalence statistics; psychosocial and
cultural antecedents; and selected prevention programs. A
separate section on areas for future research is also included. </p>

<p> Native American Indians/Alaska Natives </p>

<p> There are more than 1.5 million Americans Indians and Alaskan
Natives throughout the United States, with vastly different
languages and cultural beliefs. Even within the same tribe there
may be a good deal of cultural diversity, since differences exist
between reservation and rural tribal members, and those residing
in urban settings. While urban dwelling American Indians may
constitute more than 50 percent of the total Indian population,
little is known concerning their health status (59). </p>

<p> The American Indians' introduction to alcohol dates back to
the early 1600s and their initial interactions with European
trappers and settlers. Much of the early trading between the
Europeans and American Indians involved an exchange of alcohol.
It was not long before alcohol became a considerable problem for
many American Indian tribes. Some researchers speculate that
because American Indians lacked a prior drinking history, or role
model for moderate drinking practices, many tribes adopted a
quick and copious style of drinking, consistently drinking to the
point of intoxication. However, in other tribes, it is appears
that being intoxicated was deemed unacceptable, and over time
these tribes developed a &quot;social&quot; drinking style (35). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Studies among American Indian adolescents have shown that
prevalence rates for licit and illicit drug use vary
insignificantly between tribes (5,4). However, compared to
non-Indian youth, Indian adolescents consistently begin using
alcohol, illicit substances, cigarettes, and inhalants at a
younger age, at higher rates, and in combination with each other
(10,60,69). With regard to alcohol, there is often a great deal
of peer pressure to drink as the Indian thing to do (42). Studies
have shown that Indian youth are three times more likely to be
involved in alcohol-related offenses than their white or Hispanic
counterparts. A 1982 study indicated that alcohol was involved in
as many as 58 percent of Indian juvenile arrests (63 percent for
males, 37 percent for females)(60). </p>

<p> In some tribes, up to 30 percent of American Indian
adolescents have used inhalants, most notably, gasoline and glue.
The age group with the highest rate of inhalant use was 11- to
13-year-olds. Contrary to the popular belief that inhalant abuse
occurs primarily among boys, research among American Indians
revealed that eighth grade girls and boys were equally likely to
have inhaled volatile substances. While the rate for Indian
inhalant use decreases substantially among high school age youth
(down to 4 percent), it is still 2.5 times greater than the rate
for non-Indian youth of that age. Interestingly, while the rate
of inhalant use has remained relatively stable among Indian youth
since 1984, there has been a steady rise of reported use among
non-Indian adolescents (66). </p>

<p> While there is no substantial difference in alcohol use among
various tribal adolescents, rates do differ between the drinking
patterns of tribal adults. Contrary to the still pervasive
drunken Indian stereotype, many tribes have levels of adult
alcohol use below the national average (42). Consistent with the
U.S. population as a whole, American Indian males are more likely
to drink than females (42,35). In some tribes it is permissible
for adolescent females to experiment with alcohol, with the
understanding that when adulthood is reached they are expected to
abstain or drink only rarely. </p>

<p> As is true for adolescents, adult Indians encounter an
increased rate of legal complications due to alcohol and drug
use. Data on urban American Indians has shown that while under
the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs, they are arrested at
four times the rate for blacks and 10 times the rate for whites
(44). </p>

<p> Few statistics exist to quantify illicit substance use among
the adult American Indian population. While alcohol is clearly a
major problem for some tribes, future research efforts should
include data on the use of illicit substances. </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> The relationship between the majority of American Indians and
the early settlers was suffused with violence, distrust, deceit,
and perhaps more than anything, forcible and abrupt change. The
food American Indians ate, how they dressed, where and how they
lived, what language they spoke, tribal governing structures, and
how they worshiped were, for the most part, forcibly altered to
conform with the newly dominant society's cultural and moral
views. While these involuntary changes occurred several
generations ago, their impact on the American Indian culture
should not be underestimated. </p>

<p> In some instances, tribal traditions, languages, and methods
of worship were lost. Thousands of American Indian children, some
as young as 3 years old, were removed from their families and
placed in federally funded and run boarding schools, where
physical, verbal, and sexual abuse were common. Nuclear and
extended families were dispersed, and with them, a vital social
support system. Acculturation issues abounded. Children returned
home from boarding schools unable to speak their native language,
or understand the importance of their cultural traditions. These
cultural problems are multigenerational, and current studies
reveal that American Indian children report more emotional
problems, mental health problems, and low self-esteem than
non-Indian children (60). While the relationship between many of
these psychosocial/cultural antecedents and increased substance
abuse levels has yet to be formally evaluated, clearly the
American Indian people have been, and in some may continue to be,
subjected to cultural disruption. </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> For substance abuse prevention programs to be effective
within the American Indian population it is important to realize
the diversity that exists between tribes and villages. For
example, a specific program tailored to New Mexico Navajos living
on the Navajo reservation may be culturally unacceptable to
Winnebago Indians living in urban Minneapolis, MN. However,
several fairly universal themes permeate American Indian culture:
the importance of tribal identity, which is an individual's
membership or affiliation with specific tribe(s); a belief that
each human is a multidimensional being made up of a body, mind,
and spirit, and that the spirit world coexists and intermingles
with the physical world; the importance of sharing and
generosity, allegiance to one's family and community, respect for
elders, noninterference, orientation to present time, and harmony
with nature; the importance of an oral tradition as a primary
method of teaching values, attitudes, legends, and stories; an
emphasis on observant, reflective, and integrative skills which
lead to communication patterns that give virtue to silence,
listening, nonverbal cues, and learning by example; and the
presence of rituals and symbols that are acknowledged for their
underlying significance, which is expected to emerge as time and
experience go on (72). </p>

<p> One example that assists communities in the development of
culturally sensitive programs is an instructional publication
compiled by The Four Worlds Development Project in Alberta,
Canada. Information has been collected on health promotion and
prevention efforts by various indigenous people from around the
world. The text assists American Indian communities in tailoring
program planning, training, and implementation techniques with
their culture beliefs and specific needs (24). </p>

<p> Blacks </p>

<p> A great deal of diversity exists within the black community.
One reflection of that diversity is the use of the terms African
American and black. Some researchers use African American to
define black persons who are direct descendants of men and women
brought to the United States as slaves, whereas blacks is used to
define all people and cultures of African descent, including
black people from the West Indies, Africa, and the Americas. At
times, the two terms are used interchangeably (72). For this
section, both terms will be utilized where appropriate. </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> Many of the first blacks to arrive in the United States did
so as slaves. Plantation owners were responsible for regulating
much of their slaves' alcohol consumption. During holidays,
alcohol was routinely distributed to the slaves in reward for
their loyalty and hard work, and the subsequent drunken revelries
were tolerated. This controlled permissiveness began to change in
the early 1800s, as clandestine groups of black slaves began
their quest for freedom. It was at this point that blacks were
prohibited from owning stills, or even being in possession of
alcoholic beverages. These laws persisted after the Civil War,
when technically, blacks had been granted citizenship (14). </p>

<p> Spanning the late 1800s through the late 1960s, hundreds of
thousands of blacks left the South and, looking for work, headed
for northern cities. This period was later described as the
&quot;Great Migration,&quot; with a total outmigration estimated
at 4.3 million individuals (72,14). This outmigration contributed
substantially to defining the large number of blacks currently
found in many of the northern urban areas. Unfortunately, many of
those seeking work did not find it, nor did they find that they
were free from racism, discrimination, and oppression. Slowly,
the numbersleaving the South decreased, and by the 1970s there
was actually some migration back into the southern states by both
northern-born blacks and individuals returning home after
unsuccessful moves to the North. </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Differences in adolescent drug use among high school seniors
by race and ethnicity were discussed earlier in this chapter (see
box 6-A). Among this group, alcohol, cigarette, and illicit drug
use was lowest among black and Asian youth, even after inclusion
of background and lifestyle factors. Obviously, a drawback to
this type of survey is that high school dropouts are not included
in the analyses. The 1991 event dropout rate (which measures the
proportion of individuals who dropped out of school over a
specified time period) for grades 10 to 12, ages 15 to 24, reveal
dropout percentages of 3.2 for whites, 6.0 for blacks, and 7.3
for Hispanics (63). While the event dropout rate for blacks is
double that of white students, low alcohol and drug usage rates
have also been found among black eighth and tenth graders, so the
low rate of substance use among black twelfth graders cannot be
due entirely to dropout rates (75). </p>

<p> While use of alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs is
relatively low among blacks, data on heavy or frequent use of
such substances differs. The 1991 NHSDA data for individuals aged
12 to 20 found that 7.3 percent of whites reported heavy alcohol
use (defined as having 5 or more drinks on one occasion on 5 or
more days in the past 30 days), Hispanics reported 3.9 percent,
and blacks reported 2.7 percent. However, for those individuals
aged 21 or older, heavy alcohol use did not differ significantly
between whites and blacks (5.0 vs. 6.0 percent), but was
significantly higher among Hispanics (6.6 percent) (77). Other
studies on heavy alcohol use, by gender, have shown that white
men aged 18 to 29 report the highest prevalence of heavy
drinking, which then declined in subsequent age groups.
Conversely, the abstention rate for black males was highest among
those aged 18 to 29, while subsequent age groups showed
significantly increased levels of heavy drinking--among whom half
report either frequent heavy or frequent high maximum drinking
(70). Similarly, white women in the 18 to 29 age group were
significantly more likely to drink, and to drink heavily, than
were young black women (67). </p>

<p> Past-month use (which does not necessarily constitute abuse)
of an illicit substance by race and ethnicity was discussed at
the beginning of this section (see figure 6-2). However, the 1992
NHSDA also contains more specific data for some of the most
commonly used substances such as marijuana and cocaine. Of the
blacks age 12 and older surveyed, 3.2 reported using marijuana
once a week or more compared to 2.5 percent for whites and
Hispanics. Blacks also had the highest reported weekly use of
cocaine (0.5 percent) compared to Hispanic and white percentages
(0.4 and 0.3, respectively) (78). </p>

<p> Persistence of drug use has also been used as another
indicator of substance use severity and is measured by percent of
monthly users divided by percent of lifetime users. It has been
shown that blacks and Hispanics have a different pattern of drug
persistence from that of whites. Data on cocaine use analyzed
from the 1990 NHSDA showed that the persistence rate for blacks
age 18 to 25 was almost three times that of whites (.29 vs.. 09),
and among those aged 26 to 34, the rate for blacks was four times
higher than that for whites (.21 vs.. 05). In both age groups,
the persistence rates for Hispanics were between those of blacks
and whites. It is important to note that the differences in
persistence did not appear to extend to alcohol and marijuana
(32). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> At least initially, many blacks did not arrive in the United
States voluntarily. The legacy of slavery has shaped much of
black culture. Black slaves struggled with many of the same
issues as American Indians: loss of languages, traditions, and
religious beliefs; assimilation and acculturation issues; and the
breakup of nuclear and extended families. Not allowed to express
their original languages, cultures, and beliefs, blacks attempted
to establish new cultural identities amidst oppression,
segregation, and racism. </p>

<p> Hypotheses concerning alcoholism among black males have been
proposed by several studies. Some researchers believe that the
increase in the number of heavy drinkers among black males in
their thirties may be due to feelings of frustration and failure
concerning career expectations. A complementary view points to
the combination of high unemployment rates among black males
coupled with the large numbers of liquor stores found in many
urban black neighborhoods, as having contributed to the alcohol
problems faced by black men (14,82). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> With respect to the use of alcohol and other drugs, common
themes link blacks. In general, social stratification, church and
community involvement, and racial identity are thought to be
important variables in attitudes toward alcohol and drug use
(72,14). The level of importance will vary between individuals
and groups depending on environmental factors. One program cited
as exemplary by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP)
is called Super II, and targets primarily at risk, black
inner-city youths 11 to 17 and their parents. The design and
implementation of the program emphasizes holism and cultural
competence, viewing them as crucial in reducing the strength of
risk factors and increasing the strength of resiliency factors.
The program takes place through already established agencies in
the communities (Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs) and incorporates the
childrens' caregivers, youth and recreational workers, police
officials, local corporations, and a variety of social service
agencies. The first-year evaluation report found reductions in
four of five major categories of alcohol- and drug- related
behavior. These included frequency of use and amount of use,
number of modalities of use, alcohol- and drug-related behavior
problems, and media influenceability (71). </p>

<p> Another antidrug abuse campaign is being waged by the
Congress of National Black Churches, Inc. (CNBC), a national
nonprofit religious organization comprised of a variety of
denominations. Through a variety of programs, the CNBC clergy are
mobilizing, creating, and coordinating groups of individuals
interested in bringing about positive change in their
communities. Program strategies are implemented in partnership
with the police, criminal justice agencies, school systems,
social service agencies, private organization and businesses, and
informal community networks to reduce the supply of and demand
for drugs. </p>

<p> Hispanics </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> The term Hispanic was first used by the U.S. Census Bureau in
1980 to designate those individuals who resided in the United
States and whose cultural origins were in Mexico, Puerto Rico,
Cuba, Central America, and other Latin American countries. Not
all members of this group accept the term and prefer to use
phrases such as Latino or la raza (literally, &quot;the
race&quot;). Data from the 1990 census reveal an Hispanic
population of more than 20 million, and projections indicate that
Hispanics will be the largest minority group in the United States
sometime between the years 2000 and 2010. Hispanics of Mexican
origin, by far the largest Hispanic group (63 percent), are
clustered in the southwest, particularly California and Texas.
Puerto Ricans, excluding those living on the island of Puerto
Rico, are the second largest subgroup (12 percent) and live
primarily in the Northeast, especially in and around New York
City, New York. Cubans (5 percent) live primarily around their
port of entry, Miami, Florida, though large numbers are found in
New Jersey and New York. Dominicans, who reside primarily in the
Northeastern Atlantic States, are also beginning to grow in
number. In the past 10 years, there has been a large immigration
of Central Americans to the United States. These individuals have
come primarily from civil war-plagued countries including
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. It is highly possible that
many of the problems faced by newly arrived Hispanic immigrants
may be exacerbated among this population who have left their
countries involuntarily. Refugees escaping political turmoil or
open warfare often show signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(72). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> NIDA data collected from 1975 to 1991 on drug use among
twelfth graders, as well as data from 1991 for eighth and tenth
graders, reveal the following for Hispanic students: as a group,
Hispanic youth had the highest lifetime and annual prevalence
rates in the senior year for PCP, cocaine, crack, heroin, ice,
and steroids, compared to whites and blacks, and the rates for
crack and steroid use were particularly high; among eighth
graders, Hispanics had higher rates of past month use for
virtually all the drugs surveyed including, cocaine, heroin,
inhalants, alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens, and cigarettes. In
other words, in eighth grade, before a considerable number of
students has dropped out, Hispanic youth have the highest
prevalence of nearly all drug use, but by twelfth grade, whites
have the highest usage rates. The researchers suggest two
possible explanations, which are not necessarily exclusive. The
first being that the high dropout rate for Hispanics in later
grades (in some areas as high as 40 percent) is causing a shift
in the rates, and the second is that while Hispanic youth begin
experimenting earlier, white youth catch up by the later grades
(75). </p>

<p> National statistics for 1992 of past-month use of any illicit
substance indicated that rates for Hispanics and whites were not
significantly different, and were slightly lower than those for
blacks (see figure 6-2). The same database also revealed that for
the illicit substances measured, Hispanic rates either fell
between black and white rates, or were the lowest rates reported
by an ethnic group. The only exception would be the heavy alcohol
use data (defined as having 5 or more drinks on one occasion on 5
or more days within the past 30 days) for 1991 (1992 data not yet
available) which showed that Hispanics aged 21 or older reported
significantly more heavy alcohol use within the past month as
compared to whites and blacks (77). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> Dignidad, respeto, confianza--dignity, respect, and trust--
are important elements in the Hispanic culture. Like many
immigrants to the United States, Hispanics deal with language,
cultural, racial, and economic barriers. These barriers and how
they are handled within the Hispanic culture have a great deal to
do with subsequent alcohol and drug problems. To a large extent,
drinking (at times heavily) among Hispanic males is not only
expected, but encouraged. Much of the research literature has
therefore centered around alcohol and its misuse. To be able to
drink heavily and maintain &quot;control&quot; is a valued
characteristic among most Hispanic men (38). Personal identities
for a vast majority of Hispanic men are intricately entwined with
the notion of machismo, which generally connotes strength,
masculinity, independence, and responsibility (1). The man of the
family is expected to provide for and take care of his wife and
children. For those who may be unable to fulfill this role, due
to difficulties learning English and/or procuring employment, the
social drinking pattern can change from one of low frequency and
high quantity, to high frequency and high quantity (38,1). This
drinking pattern varies between Hispanic groups, however. A study
completed in 1981 found that drinking levels among newly arrived
Dominicans, Guatemalans, and Puerto Ricans, when compared to
preimmigration levels, decreased, increased, and remained the
same, respectively (1). </p>

<p> As is relatively true for other cultures, heavy drinking is
not condoned for Hispanic women. This is not to say that it does
not exist. While the majority of first generation Hispanic women
generally abstain or drink very little, changes in drinking
patterns among the following generations have been observed. To
the distress of many first generational Hispanic families, as
their daughters and granddaughters become increasingly
acculturated, the drinking patterns and alcohol problems more
closely mirror those found in the general population (26).
Another change observed among more acculturated Hispanic women is
the diminishment of marianismo, which is the female complement to
machismo, and encompasses such behaviors as submissiveness,
humility, tolerance, virtuosity, and devotion to the male
(whether father, husband, or first son). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> Important intergroup differences need to be understood for
the planning, implementation, and evaluation of substance abuse
prevention programs. For example, while two immigrants, one
Mexican and the other El Salvadorian, may both speak Spanish and
may both be experiencing many of the same difficulties in
adjusting to life in the United States, they are very likely to
have had vastly different lifetime and cultural experiences (72).
</p>

<p> Funds from CSAP as well as the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have been distributed to several
demonstration projects throughout the United States and Puerto
Rico that target high-risk Hispanic youth and their families.
Many of these programs are similar to others previously outlined
in this report in their attempt to be as comprehensive as
possible through the coordination of families, schools, law
enforcement, and local social services and businesses. Several of
the programs are creating their own audiovisual and written
materials in Spanish, others are utilizing activities such as
English courses, puppet shows, and live theater performances,
while others employ peer group counseling and mentoring programs
(69). </p>

<p> Asian and Pacific Island Americans </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asian and Pacific Island
Americans are the fastest growing population in the United
States. Between 1980 and 1988, the number of Asian and Pacific
Island Americans increased by 76 percent compared with an
increase of 36 percent within the Hispanic population. Similar to
the other racial and ethnic categories, the term Asian and
Pacific Island American gives one the impression of homogeneity,
while in reality, over 60 different racial and ethnic groups are
lumped in this bracket. Some of the diverse populations included
in this group are Hawaiians, Guamanians, Filipinos, Thais,
Bengalis, and Sri Lankans. Beside the obvious differences in
language, and cultural norms and beliefs, is the degree to which
different subpopulations have acculturated and/or assimilated to
the dominant culture. Many Chinese and Japanese families have
been in the United States for three generations or more, which is
in sharp contrast to the majority of first-generation Vietnamese,
Koreans, Asian Indians, and Filipinos (72,85). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Research on substance use and abuse within the Asian and
Pacific Island American population appears to be sporadic, and
often limited to alcohol. While the three national surveys NHSDA,
the National Adolescent School Health Survey, and the High School
Senior Survey, all collect separate data for Asian and Pacific
Island Americans, only the High School Senior Survey routinely
analyzes the data separately. Due to small sample sizes, the
remaining two surveys included Asian and Pacific Islanders under
the racial and ethnic category of &quot;other.&quot; </p>

<p> Research on alcohol consumption patterns among adult Asian
and Pacific Island Americans consistently shows that this
population drinks substantially less than whites and Hispanics,
and slightly less than blacks. Though subgroup variation does
exist, as data reveal, native Hawaiians drink at levels
comparable to those of whites, among mainland Asian Americans,
Japanese Americans drink the most, followed by Koreans and
Chinese Americans. However, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino men
all have roughly the same percentage of heavy drinkers at 28
percent. This style of heavy drinking is typically associated
with business entertainment and after work socializing (68).
Among Asian and Pacific Island American women, four-fifths of
Korean and Filipino women were reported to be abstainers, as were
two-thirds of Chinese women, and one-third of Japanese women.
Among women who drank, the percentage who did so heavily varied:
12 percent for Japanese women; less than 4 percent for Filipino
women; and virtually none for Chinese and Korean women (68). A
similar statistic for white women showed 14.5 percent reported
drinking heavily (73). Evidence suggests, however, that the
prevalence of drinking may be on the rise among both men and
women Asian and Pacific Island Americans, although the exact
reasons for this remain unclear. Some researchers have suggested
that paralleling other immigrant populations, the more
acculturated and assimilated generations will tend to adopt the
drinking patterns of the dominant culture. Yet other researchers
point to the fact that a significant number of second and third
generation Asian and Pacific Island Americans have not adopted a
more copious style of drinking. </p>

<p> For adolescent Asian Americans, the majority of the studies
mirrors the findings for the adults--this group consistently has
the lowest prevalence of alcohol and other drug use for all
racial and ethnic groups with the possible exception of black
youth. Although, a prospective study conducted in North Carolina
found an alarming increase in reported alcohol and other drug use
among Asian Americans over a three-year period in the late 1980s.
The reason for this increase at a time when prevalence rates for
other races and ethnicities was decreasing remains unknown (72).
Another study on youth in California reported that Chinese
American youth used quaaludes twice as often as white and
Hispanic youth, and five times as often as black youth (68).
Drinking statistics for Asian American youth are again similar to
those reported by the adult population, that is, their overall
prevalence rate is one of the lowest, but statistics for heavy
drinking are similar to those found among white youth (72). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> Why does this population have such low overall rates of
alcohol and other drug use? The diversity present within the
Asian and Pacific Island American group makes it impossible to
list all the different cultural factors that could influence
alcohol and drug use patterns. However, among many of the
subpopulations, anthropologists and substance abuse experts have
found the existence of the following philosophies: moderation,
family reputation, humility, keeping a low profile, negative
community sanctions on excessive drinking and behavior, and the
impact of parental drinking practices (83). Among Chinese
specifically, alcohol is in an important part of many religious
and celebratory ceremonies, yet excessive use is strongly
discouraged. </p>

<p> One study in California uncovered additional behavioral
factors that influenced drinking patterns among some Asian
American men. Japanese respondents were heavily influenced by
their friends' drinking; among Chinese men, those with more
education were more likely to drink; and Korean men were strongly
influenced by their parents' drinking habits (68). </p>

<p> Few researchers have examined psychosocial influences on
Asian and Pacific Island American adolescent drinking or other
drug use. One factor which has been mentioned, though, is the
pressure Asian American youth, in particular, are under to
succeed, especially academically. Thirty-four percent of Asian
Americans are college educated, more than twice that of the
United States population as a whole. Those with the least amount
of college education were American Indians (7.7 percent) and
Pacific Islanders (9.3 percent). Asian parents are similar to
parents, in general, in their hopes for their children's success.
However, among some subpopulations (notably Japanese, Korean, and
Chinese) the feelings for their children are often tied to the
child's academic achievement. When their children perform poorly
in school, some parents respond with strong
criticism,disapproval, and shame. This can understandably add a
substantial amount of stress to an adolescent who may already be
coping with language and cultural differences (72). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> Mainstream culture in the United States, to a great degree,
emphasizes individuality, competitiveness, and monetary success.
Conversely, for many Asian and Pacific Island Americans the
qualities most stressed are the needs of the family, sharing and
generosity, and a belief in who you are rather than what you own.
Because the extended family is so important in many of the
cultures, it is often the first group that an individual with
problems will turn to versus an &quot;outsider&quot; or social
service agency. Substance abuse prevention practitioners need to
be aware of the strong resistance within many Asian and Pacific
Island Americans to seek outside assistance. </p>

<p> One innovative substance abuse program entitled Na Keiki O
Ka`Aina (Children of the Land) is being implemented in Oahu,
Hawaii. Children attending the local Makaha elementary school
work several hours a week on a farm where they learn to care for
the land, their environment, and themselves as alternatives to
lifestyles that rely on alcohol and other drugs. The program uses
the cultural values of native Hawaiians, which emphasize
&quot;warm, open friendship and love,&quot; love of the earth,
and other spiritual values. Since the program's inception, class
behavior has noticeably improved, English scores have increased,
and a survey measuring drug use in the district schools showed
that Makaha school was the only school that reported a decrease
(74). </p>

<p> Areas for Future Research Among Different Racial and Ethnic
Groups </p>

<p> While this section of the report has reiterated the need to
view racial and ethnic groups as heterogeneous, the majority of
substance abuse data is not collected or examined in this way. To
date, a variety of distinct cultures are usually grouped under
one classification, and generalizations are made concerning this
group's drug use. While substance abuse prevention programs are
often better tailored to specific subpopulations and cultures, it
is virtually impossible to adequately evaluate these programs
when little baseline substance abuse data exists for specific
subpopulations. There is therefore room for improvement in the
collection of prevalence data on alcohol and other drug use and
abuse among distinct racial and ethnic groups. Furthermore, long-
term prospective studies, which are essential for understanding
risk and protective factors specific to different groups, are
extremely scarce. </p>

<p> Biomedical research on different racial and ethnic groups has
also been inconclusive and scanty (with the possible exception of
alcohol research and Asians). </p>

<p> ECONOMICS </p>

<p> Economics can be viewed as a factor in individual substance
abuse in two ways. In areas where substance abuse is already well
established and viable employment opportunities are scarce,
selling illicit substances can seem very appealing. Several
questions arise from this scenario. Are individuals lured into
the world of illegal drug sales by income potential? And, are
drug dealers more likely to become drug abusers because they are
dealers? Both of these questions have been addressed under the
first section. </p>

<p> A parallel issue is that of poverty and the daily stresses
encountered by individuals living in chronically poor areas. Do
individuals living in these poor areas abuse substances in
greater numbers or are fewer social services available in these
areas, and thus the consequences from substance abuse are more
acutely felt and visible? </p>

<p> Generated Income </p>

<p> While few studies have attempted to ascertain the individual
incomes of drug dealers, two studies have concentrated on the
street sale of illicit drugs by urban youth (21,52). The research
revealed that individual dealers reported mean gross monthly
incomes of $3,558 to $5,934. Even if these self-reported earnings
were exaggerated, this sum of money is clearly more than many
urban youth could hope to obtain in legitimate jobs at a median
of $7 per hour. </p>

<p> This earning potential may be a serious obstacle to
prevention, intervention, and treatment programs targeted toward
urban adolescents. The staff at an innovative treatment program
for drug dealers in Baltimore, Maryland, has discovered the
difficulties former dealers have in giving up the fast lifestyles
they once led. </p>

<p> Most dealers say they do it because of the money,&quot; says
a staff counselor. &quot;They can't see working at McDonald's for
minimum wage when they're making $500 to $1,000 per day,&quot; he
adds. Counselors try to help clients think beyond the idea of
making fast money to the moral, social and legal issues
associated with drug dealing. They find, however, that the moral
issue is not always clear-cut. In many cases, clients are
supporting their families and it is hard for them to see they are
doing something wrong when they are paying the bills. </p>

<p> Overall, counselors say their clients are addicted to the
money. &quot;What we do is help them see what is all around them,
what they're doing to themselves and their community by selling
drugs (48). </p>

<p> The potential for monetary gain may be especially true within
the crack trade. A young black male from San Francisco,
California, explained his preference for the immediate rewards of
selling crack over the seemingly meaningless rituals of school: </p>

<p> Forget about school. I'd rather have a life of selling drugs.
?.?. When you go to school, you do nothing. You sit around, have
books in your backpack, take`em home, do your homework, come back
to school, get some grade. When you sell drugs, see, I had
satisfaction of seeing my work, getting some money for it (22). </p>

<p> It would appear then that for many urban youth, selling
illicit drugs supplies purpose, companionship, and income without
compromising dignity. More money can be gained from the sale of
illicit drugs than through petty crimes, and certainly more than
through minimum wage jobs. </p>

<p> Another issue to be addressed is the dealer-turned-client.
From the two previously cited studies, dealers were estimated to
spend between 59 and 71 percent of their income each month on the
purchase of illicit drugs. For example, out of $3,558 gross per
month, $1,226 was spent purchasing additional drugs for business,
$883 was spent on drugs for personal consumption, and an
additional $533 on expenses associated with drug dealing. </p>

<p> The Urban Institute has also reviewed the relationship
between using and selling drugs. Its study population was
composed of 387 inner-city adolescent males of ninth- and tenth-
grade age. Of this sample, 79.6 percent reported that they
neither used nor sold drugs within the past year. Of the
remainder, 19.0 percent reported both using and selling drugs,
44.3 percent reported selling only, and 36.7 percent reported
using only. They also discovered that the greater the level of
involvement in either using or selling, the higher the likelihood
of doing both (13). </p>

<p> In summary, the research completed thus far neither confirms
nor negates the possible influence income potential has on luring
individuals into drug dealing. Nor can one conclude that drug
dealers are more likely to become substance abusers than
nondealers. </p>

<p> Poverty </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug problems are present not only among the
poor, but are poor individuals at greater risk for developing
these problems? While a relatively straight forward question, not
only is poverty difficult to define, but drawing conclusions
concerning an individual's potential for future substance abuse
based on one or two variables, such as family income or
educational level, is overly simplistic and deceptive. To
adequately review this question, a milieu of both individual and
aggregate measures should be present in any analysis done. </p>

<p> In recent years, great attention has been paid to the plight
of the urban poor, many of whom are minorities. These inner- city
communities are often riddled with high rates of crime, violence,
unemployment, and inadequate social and medical services. For
individuals living in these localities, the consequences of these
problems are serious and far reaching. Yet according to the 1980
census only 9 percent of all the poor, and 21 percent of all the
poor blacks, lived in these types of areas. </p>

<p> To define the problems of the urban poor as predominantly
&quot;black problems&quot; does a disservice to the two-thirds of
African Americans who are not poor, as well as to the two- thirds
of the poor in our central cities who are not black (8). </p>

<p> Poverty within rural communities, while lacking much of the
violence and crime of urban areas, is no less oppressive. In
1987, compared with the general population, rural residents were
less likely to be employed and to have completed high school.
They had lower average incomes and higher poverty rates than did
urban residents, and one out of every six rural families lived in
poverty (compared with one in eight urban families). This ratio
approached one out of two for black rural families. Areas of
chronic poverty were concentrated in the South, where 25 million
of the Nation's 57 million rural residents live (48 percent), and
where four out of every ten rural residents were poor, elderly,
or both (61). </p>

<p> To assess poverty and its relationship to alcohol and drug
abuse problems, one must find appropriate measures. Some
researchers have utilized the Federal guidelines for poverty,
while others employ measures of Socioeconomic Status (SES), such
as educational level and household income. To date, the largest
and most comprehensive analysis of SES variables and substance
use has been accomplished by NIDA (76). Both bivariate and
multivariate analyses were completed on data collected in 1988
and 1990 from NHSDA (see box 6-C). </p>

<p> The NIDA report has two major limitations. First, the
analysis focused on indicators of drug and alcohol use, rather
than indicators of problem use or hard-core use. While the report
has categories for frequent/heavy use and recent use, it cannot
be assumed that individuals who reported such use had alcohol or
drug problems. Secondly, the report lacks data for transient,
homeless, or institutionalized individuals, many of whom have
serious alcohol and/or drug problems. </p>

<p> Table 6-3 presents the findings from the multivariate
analysis of the NHSDA data. The SES variables pertinent to a
possible link between poverty and substance use are educational
level, occupation of chief wage earner, employment status, number
of jobs held in past 5 years, median housing value, and percent
of housing that is owned. Neither personal income nor household
income were included in the analysis, as personal income was most
meaningful only for persons who worked and household income data
were not available in the 1988 survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol consumption within the past month was measured on
three levels: abstinence; nonheavy use; and heavy use. Marijuana
use was measured by any past-month use and cocaine use was
measured by any past-year use (both categories could include
frequent as well as casual users). Major findings from the
analysis include: </p>

<p> o SES variables associated with poverty and predictive of
past month abstinence from alcohol were: not having worked in the
past 5 years and having lived in a census block with a high
percentage of owner occupancy. For users, versus abstainers, SES
attributes predictive of nonheavy alcohol use included having
attended college (regardless of completion) and living in census
areas with high housing values. Significant for heavy alcohol use
was not having completed high school, holding three or more jobs
in the past 5 years, and living in a census area with low housing
values. No employment status or occupational categories were
found to be independently predictive of heavy alcohol use. </p>

<p> o For any past-month marijuana use the independent SES
predictors associated with poverty were being unemployed and
having held three or more jobs in the past 5 years. Individuals
who reported no marijuana use in the past month were more likely
to have had some degree of college participation. </p>

<p> o Many of the SES predictors for cocaine use in the past year
were similar to those identified for marijuana use: being
unemployed and having worked three or more jobs in the past 5
years. SES characteristics predictive of no reported cocaine use
in the past year were being a college graduate and having a
part-time job. </p>

<p> This type of analysis is an exercise in inclusion and
exclusion. A myriad of individual and aggregate characteristics
are initially considered in the equation and, depending on the
outcome of interest, whether it be heavy alcohol use or marijuana
use in the past month, different variables will show themselves
to be either predictive or not predictive of the outcome. Because
personal income and household income were not included in the
multivariate analysis, but are often used as SES measures for
poverty, tables 6-4 and 6-5 depict the bivariate analysis done by
NIDA (76). Again, this analysis reveals associations, not
causality. </p>

<p> Personal income (which is highly correlated with an
individual's age and sex) was examined only for respondents who
reported working full time during the year prior to the survey.
Associations between personal income and drug use were
significant for most drugs. For every drug use measure (except
past-month use of alcohol), plus heavy use of alcohol, the
percentage of users declined as the income level rose.
Differences between income levels for frequent use of marijuana
and cocaine, concurrent heavy use of alcohol with marijuana, and
use of psychotherapeutics, hallucinogens, inhalants, and crack
were all statistically significant and more than twice as common
in the lowest income group as in the highest. Low income was also
associated with higher rates of abstinence from alcohol as well
as higher rates of heavy drinking. </p>

<p> The associations between household income (which is less
affected by age and sex) and drug and alcohol use were
considerably weaker than those observed for personal income. The
only statistically significant associations were for alcohol use,
concurrent heavy alcohol use with marijuana, and use of
hallucinogens. Those with household incomes of $40,000 or higher
were about twice as likely as those with incomes of less than
$12,000 to have used any amount of alcohol in the past month.
However, the rates of heavy drinking differed little across the
income levels. Other categories of drug use appear to be slightly
less common among the wealthiest households, but, in general,
drug use was not strongly related to household income. </p>

<p> From these types of analyses, a straightforward &quot;yes or
no&quot; response to the initial question, which linked poverty
to increased individual risk for drug abuse, is clearly
impossible. The NIDA analyses demonstrated that the type and
quantity of an individual's substance use is correlated with a
variety of both individual as well as geographic characteristics.
Furthermore, while the NIDA report was the largest and most
comprehensive to date, some segments of the population, many of
whom were possible alcohol and drug abusers, were excluded from
the survey. </p>

<p> As one economist noted, &quot;There is much we still need to
learn about poverty. Much of the past research has focused
primarily on economic questions, reflecting the extensive
involvement by economists in this work. Research is much more
limited on topics such as the causes of changing family
structures, the impacts of neighborhoods and family structure on
children's opportunities in life, personal and family coping
strategies among the poor, how expectations about future
opportunities are formed, and how these expectations influence
behavior&quot; (8). </p>

<p> PSYCHOSOCIAL/BEHAVIORAL </p>

<p> Aggressiveness </p>

<p> In much of the research literature the term aggression is
used almost exclusively when referring to young children and
adolescents between the ages of 13 and 15. Shortly after this age
a divergence appears within this identified aggressive group. The
vast majority of children &quot;outgrow&quot; their aggressive
behavior, while a smaller percentage progress into or also
exhibit, among other things, conduct disorders, antisocial
behavior, delinquency, and violence. Discussing each of these
areas is beyond the scope of this report. However, it should be
noted that as is true for many individual risk factors, a number
of these behaviors are intricately meshed. </p>

<p> Definitions for the term aggression vary considerably and may
include tardiness, breaking rules, fighting, vandalism, cruelty
to animals, and verbal abuse of other children. Many studies
simply fail to define it. Wherever possible, study definitions of
aggression will be outlined. </p>

<p> The children in the various studies on aggressiveness and
subsequent drug abuse ranged in age from 5 to 20 years old.
Aggressive behavior in the majority of the studies was exhibited
almost exclusively by boys. While girls were included in the
study populations, the number exhibiting aggressive behavior was
very small. However, the presence of aggressive behavior among
some young girls has not been shown to be predictive of later
adolescent delinquency or substance use (49). This disparity
between the sexes has not been addressed at any length. </p>

<p> Of the preadolescent boys who exhibited aggressive behavior,
30 to 40 percent maintained this behavior into adolescence. This
continued aggression has been shown to be a strong predictor of
subsequent alcohol and drug problems (28,33, 51). Interestingly,
the combination of shy and aggressive behavior has also been
correlated with later substance use problems. It has been
postulated that aggressive boys may be more likely to be shunned
by conventional peer groups, but accepted by other aggressive
children who could encourage drug and alcohol use. Another
theory, while not confirmed, suggests that young children
rejected by conventional peer groups gravitate toward each other
and that these groups of former so-called loners may foster
delinquent behavior in later adolescence (28). Conversely, boys
(but not girls) exhibiting shy behavior have been shown as less
likely to partake in alcohol and drug using activities as they
grew older (28,33,51). </p>

<p> Where does this aggressive behavior originate? Some studies
have shown that young children exhibiting sociable, spontaneous,
and fearless behavior are at greater risk for future aggressive
and violent conduct. Factors that seem to be protective include a
shy temperament, being first born, having a small and stable
family characterized by low discord (i.e., effective family
management), and having parents who regularly attend religious
services (51). </p>

<p> Current psychological perspectives emphasize that aggressive
and violent behaviors are &quot;learned&quot; responses to
frustration, that they can also be learned as instruments for
achieving goals, and that the learning occurs by observing models
of such behavior. Such models may be observed in the family,
among peers, elsewhere in the neighborhood, and through the mass
media (51). </p>

<p> This observation could, in part, explain why so few young
girls are identified as aggressive. While socially defined roles
for adults have changed considerably in the last several decades,
the socialization of children's behavior to a large extent has
not. Certain behaviors by boys are still classified by many
adults under the &quot;boys-will-be-boys&quot; axiom, while the
same behaviors by girls are oftenconsidered inappropriate. </p>

<p> Biological and genetic precursors to aggressiveness have also
been explored. Events associated with brain dysfunction that
appear to increase an individual's potential for aggression
include: brain injuries; in vitro exposure to opiates, cocaine,
alcohol, and tobacco; and early environmental exposure to lead
(e.g., air contaminated by leaded fuels, lead-based paint, water
from older plumbing systems) (51). </p>

<p> No genetic studies specific to aggressive behavior have been
conducted. Several Scandinavian countries have researched the
association between genetics and violence, obtaining mixed
results. No such studies have been attempted in the United States
(51). </p>

<p> By understanding the antecedents of aggressive behavior,
prevention programs targeted at reducing such behavior are much
more likely to succeed. It has been asserted that
multidimensional programs are more effective than those that
focus on one or two components of aggressiveness. Researcher
Karen Dodge submits: </p>

<p> Most intervention approaches are implemented without regard
for the type of aggressive behavior under scrutiny, and that
different types of aggression are likely to respond differently
to different types of intervention. Reactive aggressive children
who overly attribute hostility to others in provocative
situations may respond best to treatment aimed at training them
to understand better others' thoughts and feelings. Proactively
aggressive children may respond more favorably to consistent
punishment of aggressive behavior and reinforcement of
nonaggressive responses; this latter group many also have a
better prognosis than the former group. Three intervention
programs cited as being particularly suitable for differential
implementation with these two types of aggressive children
include social problem-solving skills training, anger-control
training, and parent training (17). </p>

<p> Several unanswered questions point to areas for future
research. Why do boys disproportionately exhibit aggressive
behavior? Are specific aggressive behaviors unique to certain
subpopulations? What are the differences between those
individuals who &quot;grow out of&quot; their aggressive behavior
and those who do not? </p>

<p> Answers to these questions and others will allow for more
detailed understanding of aggressive behavior and its connection
to alcohol and drug abuse, which could in turn provide for an
improved structure for the planning of appropriate prevention
programs. </p>

<p> Delinquency and Crime </p>

<p> Similar to aggression research, studies define and collect
data on delinquency and crime differently. Some studies use the
two terms interchangeably, while others define delinquent acts as
those less serious versus acts such as rape, armed robbery, and
manslaughter, which are clearly illegal. Self-reported data are
relied on by some studies, while others utilize only arrest
records. These differences must be considered when attempting to
generalize delinquent behavior to subsequent misuse of alcohol
and drugs. </p>

<p> As is true for aggressiveness, males are at greater risk for
developing delinquent and criminal behavior. Delinquent behavior
for most youths appears to peak between the ages of 15 to 17,
while alcohol and drug use are on the rise. However, only a small
percentage (2 to 6 percent) of these adolescents become young
adults who continue to engage in serious criminal activity
coupled with frequent drug use. Statistics reveal that many
arrests for property and violent crimes can be attributed to this
small group of individuals (29). </p>

<p> Several researchers have linked delinquent and criminal
behavior to alcohol and drug abuse and have concluded these
activities precede the use and abuse of certain substances
(28,29,13,56). </p>

<p> One such study conducted on adolescents examined the
relationship between later drug use and earlier individual
delinquent behavior and delinquent peer group bonding (DPGB).
Females were found less likely to engage in individual delinquent
behavior before but not after participating in a delinquent peer
group. Additionally, minority students doing well in school had
lower rates of delinquent problems than did nonminority youth who
were also doing well in school. Strong positive belief systems
(beliefs that committing illegal or rule-violating acts are
morally wrong) also decreased the potential for future use of
alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. Conversely, those
adolescents who had high DPGB levels had increased rates of
alcohol, marijuana, and polydrug use (20). </p>

<p> A separate study of male and female cocaine addicts analyzed
the psychosocial factors present among individuals who
substantially increased their cocaine use from adolescence to
young adulthood. Those who progressed to heavier use displayed a
significant lack of law abidance or social conformity (46). </p>

<p> Several points have come to light from studies on heroin
addicts. Studies conducted in the late 1970s found that while
delinquency preceded illicit drug use, use of alcohol and first
alcohol intoxication took place before delinquency. In fact, an
average of two years lapsed between first alcohol intoxication
and first criminal activity for both males and females who later
became heroin addicts (64). A further study on male heroin
addicts that grouped participants into low-crime versus
high-crime categories found that men who had been placed in the
high-crime group admitted significantly more contact with the
criminal justice system before becoming addicted than did those
in the low-crime group. Also, the high-crime group showed earlier
and more frequent use of substances, as well as use of a wider
variety of narcotic and nonnarcotic substances (47). </p>

<p> While a relatively small number of individuals who exhibit
delinquent behavior progress to serious alcohol and drug
problems, understanding the cause(s) of the delinquent behavior
may help to decrease this number further. Psychosocial elements
that have been associated with later delinquent behavior include:
</p>

<p> o low parent-child attachment </p>

<p> o family conflict </p>

<p> o family social deprivation </p>

<p> o school failure </p>

<p> o parental and sibling drug use and criminal behavior </p>

<p> o poor and inconsistent family management practices (e.g.,
harsh or lax discipline, lack of supervision) </p>

<p> o attitudes and beliefs </p>

<p> o lack of neighborhood attachment and community
disorganization </p>

<p> o family mobility. </p>

<p> Neurophysiological and cognitive dimensions have also been
examined for serious delinquents, adult criminals, and children
with conduct disorders. However, the findings were scanty and
inconclusive (29,37). </p>

<p> When discussing prevention programs for these children, there
is the hazard of labeling them predelinquent. This concern could
be applied equally to most risk factors linked to future alcohol
and drug problems. Labeling children as aggressive, high risk,
delinquent, or developmentally slow may be a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Some researchers have suggested that broad,
encompassing programs should be implemented in targeted areas
where groups exhibit a number of the risk factors previously
described. This type of approach would not single out individuals
but rather would assist communities, schools, and families (29). </p>

<p> Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Researchers and clinicians have increasingly addressed the
possibility that physical and sexual abuse, especially in
childhood, may be associated with an increased likelihood of
later substance abuse and addiction. Although there are many gaps
in this literature, and substantive and methodological issues
that remain to be addressed, findings from several studies that
have measured the prevalence of substance abuse strongly suggest
that additional research and the evaluation of targeted clinical
interventions are warranted. This section highlights selected
research findings on the relationship of physical and sexual
abuse to later substance abuse. </p>

<p> One review article on physical abuse found that children
subjected to physical abuse had higher levels of later substance
abuse compared to children not physically victimized. The review
also cited another study which found that 84 percent of the
females in treatment for alcohol or drug addiction reported a
history of childhood abuse (18). </p>

<p> Childhood sexual abuse appears to be rising. The National
Incidence Study reported in 1988 that approximately 156,000
children had been recognized by public agencies (such as child
protective service agencies, mental health agencies, and the
schools) as being sexually abused each year, for an annual rate
of about 0.3 percent (58). This is an increase in recognized
cases of child sexual abuse of more than 300 percent between 1980
and 1988, and due to the sensitive nature of the topic, is
probably a gross underestimation of the actual numbers of cases. </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics on childhood sexual assault specific to
women range from 6 to 62 percent, depending on the definitions,
methodology, and study populations used (54). One study that
relied on a random sampling method discovered that of the 391
women who agreed to participate in the study, almost 34 percent
reported being sexually assaulted by age 18, which provides a
lifetime prevalence rate of one out of every three women. Of the
respondents, over 24 percent reported an experience such as rape,
15 percent had been victims of molestation, and 10 percent
reported some type of noncontact sexual assault (e.g., voyeurism,
verbal threats of sexual assault, being forced to watch
pornography) (54). Other researchers, measuring childhood
molestation histories among women psychiatric outpatients, have
cited figures of 50 to 70 percent, versus 20 to 30 percent
reported by women in nonclinical populations (12). </p>

<p> While causality has not been established between childhood
sexual abuse and later substance abuse problems, an association
between the two variables has been shown. Several review articles
have summarized the findings from researchers who consistently
report that children exposed to sexual abuse present with a
greater number of symptoms and problems compared to children who
are not victimized (12,34,55). While substance abuse problems are
not measured in all the studies, where it is measured,
individuals who have been sexually abused show a much higher
incidence of later substance abuse than their study counterparts
(55). For example, 60 to 80 percent of individuals in substance
abuse treatment programs report having been sexual abused (12).
Other researchers have classified common symptoms by age group,
discovering that among adolescents who had been sexually abused
at some time in their lives, 53 percent reported abusing some
substance (34). </p>

<p> Studies on sexually abused women have demonstrated similarly
high rates. One study of women requesting appointments at a
crisis counseling unit of a community health center found that 44
percent of the women walk-in clients reported a history of sexual
abuse as children. The sexually abused women differed from the
nonabused women in many ways, but they differed most in their
substance abuse. The abused women were about 10 times more likely
than the nonabused women in this population to report a history
of drug abuse (21.1 percent vs. 2.3 percent) and more than twice
as likely to report a history of alcoholism (26.9 percent vs.
10.5 percent) (11). </p>

<p> A review of four separate studies on women seeking treatment
for alcoholism shows 34 to 85 percent of the women report a
history of sexual abuse (30); and among recovering chemically
dependent women, the topics discussed most often are sexual child
abuse, incest, and rape. Uncovering the memories of these early
childhood experiences is thought to be a contributing factor in
drug relapse for some women (31). Thus, early experiences of
abuse, especially sexual abuse, may require attention in
treatment programs, since they may have been important precursors
and contributors to the substance abuse and addiction, and may be
major obstacles to successful treatment and the prevention of
relapse. </p>

<p> Clearly, physical and sexual abuse are not uncommon
phenomena. While this section has focused on the association
between abusive experiences and subsequent substance abuse, there
are many other psychopathologies that also arise from sexual and
physical abuse. The research question need not be whether
physical and sexual abuse &quot;cause&quot; the later substance
abuse and addiction. Clearly, many factors interact, especially
in the home, school, and peer settings of children as they grow
up. However, the consistent finding of higher levels of physical
and sexual abuse among substance abusers warrants further
research to disentangle the many factors that are at work. Unlike
race, ethnicity, and poverty (which are not by themselves
strongly and independently associated with substance abuse and
addiction, but must be understood in the context of subcultures
and the availability and marketing of drugs in neighborhoods and
communities), physical and sexual abuse may more directly
contribute to later behavioral problems, including substance
abuse. </p>

<p> Mental Disorders </p>

<p> The sheer number of Americans with mental disorders
transforms personal tragedy into a widespread public health
problem. Nearly one in three American adults will experience a
mental disorder during his or her lifetime. Moreover,
approximately 1.7 to 2.4 million Americans currently suffer from
a persistent and severely disabling mental disorder, such as
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic
depression) (62). </p>

<p> There exists a wide array of behaviors classified as
symptomatic of mental disorders, ranging from premenstrual
syndrome, hostility toward others, and other maladaptive
personality traits, to full-blown psychosis (2). It can at times
be difficult to delineate where mental health ends and mental
illness begins. </p>

<p> While many alcohol and drug problems may not be attributable
primarily to mental disorders, they can certainly be exacerbated
by these disorders. One comprehensive study found a high
prevalence of comorbid (i.e., occurring at the same time) mental
disorders and alcohol or other drug disorders--including both
abuse and dependence syndromes as defined in the DSM-III-R. Using
data from NIMH's Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) survey of
20,291 adults (aged 18 and older) in communities and in various
institutional settings (prisons, mental hospitals, nursing homes,
and specialized treatment centers), they assessed the prevalence
of comorbid alcohol, other drug, and mental disorders.
Schizophrenia, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders were among
those studied. Specific drugs studied, in addition to alcohol,
included marijuana, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, amphetamines,
and hallucinogens (50). </p>

<p> Alcohol Disorder as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> An estimated 13.5 percent of all adults in the United States
will have a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence
(see figure 6-3). For these individuals, the rate of mental
disorder was almost double that of persons with no history of an
alcohol disorder, and the rate of another drug disorder was
almost six times greater. Specific comorbid mental disorders
found in people with alcohol abuse- dependence disorder include
anxiety disorders (19.4 percent), mood disorders (13.4 percent),
and schizophrenia (3.8 percent). </p>

<p> Drug Disorder (Other than Alcohol) as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> Some 6.1 percent of the total adult population will have had
a primary diagnosis of drug abuse or dependency at some time in
their lives. Over half of these individuals have also been
diagnosed with a comorbid mental disorder such as anxiety
disorder (28.3 percent), mood disorder (26.4 percent), or
schizophrenia (6.8 percent). Compared to those persons without a
drug disorder, these individuals are at more than four times the
risk of having some type of mental disorder. Additionally, these
individuals are also seven times more likely to be addicted to
alcohol. </p>

<p> Mental Disorder as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> In contrast, at some time in their lives nearly one-quarter
of all adults in the United States will have had a primary
diagnosis of mental disorder. Compared with individuals having no
history of mental disorder, people with a mental disorder face
twice the odds of having alcohol abuse- dependence and over four
times the odds of drug abuse dependence. </p>

<p> Comorbid alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence disorders
occur frequently in people with the specific subtypes of mental
disorders included in the study: </p>

<p> o Of those who develop schizophrenia and related disorders
during their lifetimes (approximately 1.5 percent of the U.S.
population), nearly half will abuse or be dependent on alcohol or
other drugs, or both. </p>

<p> o Thirty-two percent of people with mood disorders (8.3
percent of the total adult population) will abuse or become
dependent on alcohol, other drugs, or both. </p>

<p> o The anxiety disorders, as a group, occur at sometime in the
lives of 14.6 percent of the population and are highly likely to
be associated with an alcohol or other drug abuse or dependence
disorder. For example, 35.8 percent of people with panic
disorder, and 32.8 percent of people with obsessive-compulsive
disorder will have some form of alcohol or other drug abuse or
dependence disorder. </p>

<p> People with both mental disorders and alcohol or other drug
disorders are likely to suffer more severe psychiatric symptoms,
disruptive behaviors, aggression, and criminal behaviors. The
importance of early detection for mental disorders is clear if
subsequent alcohol and drug abuse problems are to be avoided. In
other cases, an individual's drug and/or alcohol problems may
precede his or her mental disorder. In whatever order these
complications are distinguished, it is essential to remember that
millions of men and women suffer through not one, but two
illnesses (62). </p>

<p> Resiliency </p>

<p> The majority of funding and research has been devoted to
understanding and identifying those elements that appear to place
individuals at a greater risk for substance abuse. However, many
of these same factors can, to some degree, be protective. For
example, the vast majority of adolescents who have used alcohol,
cigarettes, and other drugs do not grow up to become substance
abusing adults. The process of aging and successfully passing
through various developmental stages is in itself protective. In
other cases, the lack of a particular factor is protective. This
is true for many of the psychosocial factors such as
aggressivity, delinquency, mental disorders, and physical and
sexual abuse. </p>

<p> But what about those individuals who live in stressful and
chaotic conditions--who are constantly exposed to many of these
risk factors--yet who do not develop substance abuse problems.
How do these individuals emerge relatively unscathed, while many
of their immediate family succumb to substance abuse? This
section addresses a complimentary set of protective attributes,
characteristics identified inindividuals who display resiliency
to the effects of various risk factors. </p>

<p> The term resiliency can be described as the ability to
recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. A 1991
conference sponsored by the Children of Alcoholics Foundation
released a report in which resiliency was conceptualized in the
following manner (15): </p>

<p> o Resiliency is a dynamic process, not a static condition. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is contextual; adaptive behavior in one context
may be maladaptive in another. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is the result of inherent personality
characteristics interacting with environmental factors. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is more complex in multiple-risk situations. </p>

<p> o Resiliency can be learned. </p>

<p> For the most part, social science research on resiliency in
children has not specifically addressed environmental substance
abuse, and where it has, the research has focused to a large
extent on alcoholism within the family. However, in general,
resiliency studies have examined high-risk children from a
variety of families and communities, of which many had substance
abuse problems. </p>

<p> One of the largest longitudinal studies spanned a period of
30 years and was completed by Emmy Werner on the Hawaiian island
of Kauai (80,81). An entire multiracial cohort of children was
followed from the prenatal period to young adulthood, revealing
invaluable information on resiliency in the presence of certain
risk factors. Of the 700 children originally included in the
study, 200 were identified as at- risk for later problems based
on perinatal stress, poverty, family instability, and parents
with mental health problems. Through the children's first decade
of life, approximately 25 percent had at least one parent with a
serious alcohol problem. Of these children, 41 percent later
developed serious learning and behavioral problems by age 18,
while the rest did not. All the children of alcoholic mothers
developed problems, with the exception of one. Conversely,
children of alcoholic fathers &quot;were represented in roughly
equal proportions among those who did and those who did not
develop serious coping problems by age 18&quot; (80). </p>

<p> More general findings from the study highlighted the
difference between the prevalence of serious physical, learning,
and behavior problems among girls and boys. Up to age 10, when
confronted with a variety of risk factors, boys were
significantly more likely to display a greater number of
childhood problems requiring some type of social service and/or
medical intervention. However, this ratio changed markedly by the
second decade (ages 10 to 18). While high- risk boys were still
three times more likely than girls to have records of serious
delinquency (77 vs. 26 percent), by age 18 more than twice as
many high-risk girls reported serious mental health problems.
Additionally, of those children in the first decade identified
with serious learning and/or behavioral problems, a greater
number of boys than girls had improved by age 18. </p>

<p> Interestingly, the researchers also showed that some of the
resilience factors identified differed between the sexes. For
example among young girls, experiences that tended to foster
greater maturity and independence, such as absence of a father,
responsibility for younger siblings, and maternal employment
outside the home, also appeared to bolster resiliency and
competence. On the other hand, resiliency among young boys was
correlated with the presence of the father, little family discord
or crowding, and the existence of adequate structure and
supervision. However, overall, a greater number of high-risk
girls than high-risk boys grew into resilient young adults. </p>

<p> Several other studies have also identified factors associated
with resiliency in children (6,19,23). One such factor is
described as adaptive distancing whereby the child accomplishes
two things: the child emotionally and psychologically detaches
from the chaos of the family and resumes more &quot;customary
pursuits&quot; in the outside world of school and friends, and
the child does not allow the caregiver's drug or alcohol problem
to be the central focus of his or her world. These behaviors have
been observed in children as young as 3 years old. </p>

<p> A sense of purpose and future have also been identified with
resiliency. Clinicians have observed very young children
attempting to make sense of their situation upon experiencing an
array of hardships such as chronic poverty or familial substance
abuse. Resilient children display such attributes as hopefulness,
hardiness, motivation, and a belief in a bright future even when
faced with challenges and adversity. </p>

<p> Researchers have also found that the ability to develop
competency skills was associated with resiliency. Competence
includes &quot;the qualities of responsiveness, flexibility,
empathy and caring, communication skills, a sense of humor, and
any other prosocial behavior&quot; (6). Researchers have
consistently documented the presence of these characteristics
among resilient individuals, and equally important, have noted
the lack of these characteristics among individuals with severe
behavioral, criminal, and mental health problems. </p>

<p> Another element that has been associated with resiliency is
the ability to use support systems effectively. Those children
who tapped into school activities, spoke with counselors,
actively sought an alternative parent figure or role model, and
confided in others were much more likely to be resilient than
those children not involved in these supportive networks. </p>

<p> Much of a person's resiliency depends on a variety of
elements including the individual's developmental stage, cultural
perceptions, and &quot;the acuteness or chronicity of the adverse
circumstances&quot; (19). Nonetheless, many men and women who
have gone on to lead productive and fulfilling lives, often did
so in spite of their circumstances. By understanding how this was
achieved, prevention programs can incorporate activities to
bolster the protective factors in the lives of all children. </p>

<p> Spirituality/Religiosity </p>

<p> The terms religiosity and spirituality are neither mutually
exclusive nor inclusive. Both terms encompass an enormous array
of fellowships and individual values, including institutionalized
religion, new age religion or quasi- religious groups,
traditional beliefs, and nonreligious persons. </p>

<p> Within the drug and alcohol abuse research field, studies
have focused almost exclusively on the relationship between
institutionalized Christian religions (with the exception of a
handful of studies on Judaism) and its effect on substance use
among adolescents and young adults. Virtually no data are
available on other methods of worship, or discussion of the
effect spiritualism/religiosity may have on the progression from
adolescent alcohol and drug use to problem use and addiction. </p>

<p> A succinct and thorough review of recent literature on
religion and substance use was completed by social psychologist
Peter Benson (7). With rare exceptions, religiousness, in varying
degrees, has been associated with decreased levels of substance
use. The substances studied included alcohol, cigarettes, and
numerous illicit drugs. This protective factor held true for men
and women across the four U.S. census regions, and to some extent
among blacks and Hispanics (although only a few studies analyzed
race and ethnicity). The most widely used measures of religiosity
were church attendance, church affiliation versus nonaffiliation,
and religious importance; yet it also appeared that such indirect
associations as parents' religiousness and belief in life after
death were correlated with decreased substance use. Multivariate
analysis was employed to examine the relative importance of
religiousness by controlling for other demographic and social
variables. In most instances the protective effect of
religiousness was relatively small, but it did appear to be more
predictive than several personal factors (e.g., self-esteem,
purpose in life, locus of control) and less predictive when
compared to social variables such as parental standards, peer
pressure, and social tolerance. Benson puts forth several
explanations for this apparent protective element, most of which
center around the idea that organized religion fosters and
maintains a certain set of morals and values. Depending on the
religion, deviating from these norms can be somewhat tolerated
or, at the other extreme, considered a profound sin. </p>

<p> For countless individuals, spirituality, while a more
nebulous concept than religion, is intricately tied to emotional,
psychological, and physical well-being. A practitioner of Zen
(Buddhist) meditation and various New Age spiritualities stated: </p>

<p> I think of health at every level: a healthy mind, a healthy
spirit, as well as a healthy body. So that a person would have to
have energy, alertness, enthusiasm, a love of life, a love of
people, a love of themselves (43). </p>

<p> Many traditional cultures think of illness and disease as
indicators of personal spiritual discord. For example, the
American Indian Navajos strive for a state of personal wholeness,
beauty, and well-being. The Blessingway rite, composed of sacred
songs and prayers, is often used to restore an individual's
harmony with those around him or her, the environment, and, in a
larger sense, the universe. </p>

<p> By ignoring different racial and ethnic religious and
spiritual beliefs, their importance is minimized and/or
trivialized (perhaps inadvertently) by more dominant religions.
From a drug and alcohol prevention point of view, it would seem
both cost-effective and relatively simple to encourage and
celebrate religious and spiritual differences among individuals
and communities; and acknowledge the protective benefits these
factors provide for many people. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> No single or generic set of variables explains the harmful
use of alcohol and drugs for every individual. While this chapter
reviewed a number of selected individual and protective factors,
this information should be viewed in a broader context. To gain a
complete understanding of the complexity of the substance abuse
issue, the information presented before and after this chapter
must be incorporated in any argument concerning factors that in
some way effect an individuals potential for substance use and
abuse. </p>

<p> By reviewing the individual risk factors under the three
broad headings of Demographics, Economics, and
Psychosocial/Behavioral, certain gaps in the literature appeared.
Within the demographics section, the vast majority of the
research to date has focused on identifying psychological as well
as social characteristics that place preadolescent and adolescent
children at greater risk for the initiation and continuation of
drug use. While the benefits of this type of research are
obvious, the majority of data point to the fact that alcohol,
tobacco, and illicit drug use are highest among those aged 18 to
25 and 26 to 34. However, few research studies have been devoted
to these age groups. Also, under the demographic section there
was a general paucity of data on risk factors that may be unique
to racial and ethnic minority populations and to some extent
women (although this continues to change). </p>

<p> Within the economics section, while there may be quotes in
the general media of tremendous financial earnings by drug
dealers, research substantiating these figures is scanty. There
is also little known about whether those individuals dealing
drugs are at an increased risk for becoming drug abusers. </p>

<p> Many of the psychosocial/behavioral factors reviewed in the
chapter have been extensively studied, and their associations to
alcohol and drug use documented. However, one of the sections
that has fairly recently been scientifically studied is that of
physical and/or sexual abuse. Those studies that have been
rigorously conducted are beginning to yield data that positively
links childhood abuse to later alcohol and drug problems. Future
research in this area is probably warranted. Also included in the
section were select studies on resiliency and/or protective
factors. While research has been conducted in this area for quite
some time, much of the literature is not specific to alcohol and
drug use situations, but rather, encompasses a wide array of
variables that place individuals at a greater risk for
behavioral, developmental, and learning problems.<br>

<p> BOX 6-1: Racial and Ethnic Differences in Adolescent Drug Use
Among High School Seniors Research on adolescent substance use
has documentedsubstantial racial and ethnic differences in use
among highschool seniors. On average, alcohol, cigarette, and
otherillicit drug use is highest among American Indian
youth,somewhat lower among white and Hispanic youth,
substantiallylower among black youth, and lowest among Asian
youth.Additional research explored the hypothesis that
thesedissimilarities could be partially attributed to
differencesin background (e.g., urban versus rural, family
structure,parental education) and lifestyle factors (e.g.,
grades,truancy, evenings out, religious commitment).The findings
indicated that controlling for backgroundfactors alone did not
account for most racial and ethnicdifferences in drug use, but it
did reduce American Indians'relatively high levels of use, which
suggests that their usemay in part be related to disadvantaged
socioeconomicstatus. When both background and lifestyle factors
wereincluded in the analysis, the racial and ethnic
differenceswere substantially reduced. Educational values
andbehaviors, religious commitment, and amount of time spent
inpeer-oriented activities were particularly importantexplanatory
variables.Racial and ethnic differences were also found in a
study ondrug-related attitudes and perceptions. Perceived risk
ofusing drugs, disapproval of drug use, and perceptions
ofdisapproval of drug use by friends were typically highestamong
black seniors, at intermediate levels among Hispanicseniors, and
lowest among white and American Indian seniors.Conversely,
perceived peer use of drugs and exposure topersons using various
drugs for &quot;kicks&quot; were generallylowest among black and
Asian seniors, at intermediate levelsamong Hispanic seniors, and
highest among white and AmericanIndian seniors.While these
findings are not applicable for thoseadolescents who drop out of
school, researchers areconfident that the results are valid for
the majority ofadolescents who remain enrolled through the senior
year ofhigh school.SOURCE: U.S. Department of Health and Human

<p> BOX 6-2: Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Discrepancies in
Mandatory Alcohol and Drug Use Reporting Practices for Pregnant
Women In one county of Florida, anonymous alcohol and drug
testswere conducted on urine samples obtained from all
pregnantwomen seeking prenatal care from both public health
clinicsas well as private obstetrical offices. White and
blackwomen were discovered to have insignificantly
differentprevalence rates for alcohol or illicit drug use
duringpregnancy. While black women used cocaine more
frequentlythan white women (7.5 percent versus 1.8 percent),
whitewomen had higher rates of marijuana usage (14.4
percentversus 6 percent). The relative similarities between
alcoholand drug use also held true for poor versus
middle-classwomen. However, the study also documented that
afterdelivery, black women were 10 times more likely to have
beenreported to the health authorities for substance use
duringpregnancy than were white women. Poor women also had
agreater chance of being reported than middle-class women.This
study reflects a discrepancy in reporting practicesamong staff at
some public clinics and private obstetricaloffices, which appears
to be influenced by an individual'ssocial status as well as
race.SOURCE: I.J. Chasnoff, H.J. Landress, and M.E. Barrett,

Analysis Bivariate analysis is the process of taking one
variablesuch as employment status and testing its correlation
andstatistical significance to reported alcohol or drug use.
Amajor drawback to this type of analysis is its
relativesimplicity; it does not control for the potential effects
ofother variables. For example, if a relationship betweenbeing
unemployed and heavy alcohol use was shown to bestatistically
significant, one could not be certain of thenature of the
relationship. Perhaps the individual wasunemployed due to his or
her heavy drinking. Alternatively,a person's unemployment could
have caused his or her heavydrinking. Furthermore, if more
sophisticated analyses usingadditional variables were completed,
the originalassociation between being unemployed and heavy
drinkingcould disappear altogether.Multivariate analysis, while
having its own limitations, isa much more comprehensive way in
which to study therelationships between several variables and
alcohol and drugconsumption. The multivariate analysis used by
the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse systematically incorporated
avariety of individual variables such as educational
level,employment status, race and ethnicity, and sex, in
additionto certain aggregate variables including region
(South,Northeast, North Central, West), metropolitan status,
andracial and ethnic composition of census blocks. Each one
ofthese variables was then separately analyzed for itspotential
predictive value for alcohol and drug use, whilethe other
contributing variables were also taken intoaccount. While
multivariate analyses fall short ofdemonstrating causality,
because additional variables areused to control for plausible
alternative explanations, moreconfidence can be placed in the
significant correlationsfound.SOURCE: Office of Technology
Assessment, 1994. </p>

<p> BOX 6-4: A Population at Risk--Migrant and Seasonal
Farmworkers Migrant and seasonal farmworkers (M/SFWs) are
individuals&quot;whose principal employment is in agriculture on
a seasonalbasis [and who have] been so employed within the last
24months&quot; (Public Law 100-386). Migratory workers are
those&quot;who establish ... for the purposes of such employment
atemporary abode,&quot; while seasonal workers are those who
meetthe seasonal definition but are not migrant workers
(PublicLaw 100-386). While seasonal is not explicitly defined
inthe public law, the Department of Agriculture defines aseasonal
farmworker as one who performs 25 to 149 days offarm wage work in
one year, and does not migrate.Due to the transitory nature of
the job and the employees,obtaining a precise estimate on the
number of farmworkers isdifficult. State data suggest that
upwards of 4 millionfarmworkers are in the United States and
Puerto Rico, and ifratios from the late 1970s hold true,
approximately 30percent (or 1.2 million) of these are
migrants.The racial and ethnic background of the farmworkers
varieswith the so-called &quot;stream.&quot; The East Coast
stream isprobably the most diverse with American blacks,
Haitians,Jamaicans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,
anincreasing number of Central American Indians, and a
smallpercentage of whites. In the Midwest and West, the
greatmajority of migrant farmworkers are of Mexican
descent,although increasingly, Asian immigrants are making their
wayinto the stream. American Indians make up a
substantialproportion of the farmworker population in the West
andSouthwest.Farmworkers are most often hired through a
middle-person or&quot;crewleader&quot; who is usually in charge
of negotiating lengthof employment, transportation, wages,
housing, and meals. Itis not uncommon for migrant farmworkers to
move anywherefrom two to eleven times in a year. Besides the
physicallytaxing nature of the work, numerous environmental
stressors(some unique to this population) increase the likelihood
foralcohol and drug abuse. Some of these stressors
includephysically and socially isolated camp locations;
unsanitary,overcrowded, and unsafe camp conditions; towns which
oftendo not welcome the presence of farmworkers; long periods
ofseparation from family members; feelings of boredom,isolation,
and powerlessness; and language and culturaldifferences.The job's
high mobility requirements hamper the collectionof health data on
this population. Anecdotal informationfrom health care providers
located at Migrant/CommunityHealth Centers (M/CHCs) and local
health departments citealcohol and drug abuse problems as some of
the mostsignificant health issues faced by M/SFWs, followed
byanxiety and depression (McCaw 1991). However, fewquantitative
or qualitative studies have documentedsubstance abuse within this
population. One study of blackand Haitian farmworkers in upstate
New York found that themajority of the heavy drinking on the
migrant camps was doneby older, single, black males, and that the
drinkingpatterns of the study participants who traveled with
theirfamilies differed little from individuals in the
generalpopulation. To a large extent, this was attributed to
thesocial controls family members exerted on one another(Mattera
et al. 1983). This is an important point, as thegreater
mechanization of farmwork has reduced the need formanual labor,
and many of the farmworkers who previouslytraveled with their
families can no longer afford to do so.Anecdotal evidence
suggests that the composition of themigrant workforce has been
shifting toward one of singlemales, rather than families. With
this shift, a generaldecrease in social control among the migrant
camps is likelyto occur, and a greater number of alcohol and drug
problemsmay begin to appear.Providing substance abuse prevention
programs to M/SFWs is achallenge. Few M/CHCs have the financial
or personnelcapabilities to implement substance abuse
preventionprograms. Many farmworkers simply do not stay in
onelocation long enough. Language and cultural differences
arevast, not to mention the geographical distances
sometimesrequired to reach the camps, which often are located 20
to30 miles away from the nearest social service and/or eachother.
Two organizations (BOCES Geneseo Migrant Center inNew York, NY,
and Tri-County Community Health Center inNewton Grove, NC) have
successfully implemented similartypes of programs based on the
premise of providing weekendactivities as an alternative to
drinking and drug use. Full-day programs are normally held away
from the camps, andinclude educational, creative, athletic, and
culturalactivities. The activities are free and transportation
isoften provided. However, farmworkers can attend only if
theyhave not been drinking or using drugs.Clearly, greater
research is necessary to adequatelydocument the prevalence of
alcohol and drug use within themigrant streams, as well as the
changing composition of thestreams, and how this may affect
substance use. Little isknown about the differences in substance
use between thevarying racial and ethnic groups within the
streams, and howthe growing number of immigrants from war-torn
countrieswill affect the health problems seen within the
streams.SOURCES: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
