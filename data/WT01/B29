<h1><a name="OLE_LINK1">FIVE LEGISLATIVE OPTIONS </a></h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> Many legislative options are available for cannabis and, as
indicated in [1]Chapter 2, much confusion exists in the
terminology used to describe them. In this chapter, we outline
the five broad options available to Australian decision-makers,
namely: </p>

<ul>
    <li>total prohibition; </li>
    <li>prohibition with civil penalties for minor offences; </li>
    <li>partial prohibition; </li>
    <li>regulation; and </li>
    <li>free availability. </li>
</ul>

<p> Some readers will be aware that this is the classification
used by the South Australian Royal Commission into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs (the Sackville Commission) which
reported in 1978. We have adopted their approach as it is, in our
view, both precise and comprehensive. It avoids the semantic
problems that often cause much confusion in debates about drug
policies. In particular, it avoids the terms 'decriminalisation'
and 'legalisation', terms which have different meanings for
different authorities. </p>

<p> The five options listed capture all the approaches which
people have in mind when they refer to 'decriminalisation' and
'legalisation', as well as other options which these two words
may or may not encompass. The five legislative options are
discussed in turn. We follow a consistent format to facilitate
comparisons between them. First we describe the option; an
example of it in operation follows (or, if there is no such
example, we describe what it would look like if the option were
implemented); we then outline the rationales which are given or
are imputable (both philosophical and pragmatic rationales are
covered); discuss the outcomes and impacts (observed or likely)
flowing from its implementation; and in conclusion we evaluate
the appropriateness of the option. </p>

<h2>Option 1: Total prohibition </h2>

<p> Under the system of total prohibition the use, possession,
cultivation, importation, sale and distribution of any amount of
cannabis are treated as criminal offences. People importing or
dealing in cannabis may be liable to severe sanctions, and those
using or found in possession of the drug are subject to arrest
and prosecution. If convicted, they acquire a criminal record and
may be subject to a variety of sanctions including imprisonment. </p>

<p> 'Total prohibition' can take a number of forms. For example,
although both The Netherlands and the United States have
legislation that can be described as total prohibition, the
differences in the strategies used to enforce, or not enforce,
the legislation mean that the drug policies in these two nations
are dramatically different. This section will outline the
background and rationale of American and Dutch drug policies, and
will evaluate them in light of the goals outlined in [2]Chapter
2. </p>

<h3>PART A: THE UNITED STATES: </h3>

<h4>Total legislative and administrative prohibition: Drug law
and policy in the United States </h4>

<p> This examination of drug policy will focus on the US Federal
Government's strategy of total prohibition.5 </p>

<p> The Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) groups drugs into
five categories. These categories are said to be based on the
drugs' perceived potential for abuse, accepted medical use and
propensity to create physiological and psychological dependency,
for users (Inciardi 1990). The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
is responsible for classifying drugs and for periodically
updating classifications. Cannabis is listed in Schedule 1 of the
classification scheme. Schedule 1 drugs are seen to have a high
potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the
United States and no acceptable safe level of use under medical
supervision. </p>

<p> Violations of the CSA are separated into two offence
categories: first, the possession of controlled substances; and,
secondly, the manufacture, delivery or sale of controlled
substances. All first possession offences carry a penalty of up
to one year's incarceration and a fine of $1,000 to $5,000.
Second offences are punishable by more severe sanctions. The
basic penalty for the manufacture, delivery or sale of less than
50kg of marijuana, 100 or more marijuana plants, less than 10kg
of cannabis resin (hashish) or less than one kilogram of cannabis
oil is punishment by up to five years incarceration and/or a
$250,000 fine. Second or subsequent offences are punishable by up
to 10 years incarceration and/or a $500,000 fine. The penalty for
the manufacture, sale or delivery of between 50kg and 100kg of
marijuana is a sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment and/or a
fine of up to $1 million. Second or subsequent violations of
manufacture/delivery/sale provisions are punishable by up to 30
years imprisonment and/or up to $2 million in fines for
individuals and $30 million for others. </p>

<p> The CSA also provides for other sanctions against people who
profit from drug dealing. An offender can be required to forfeit
to the state all controlled substances, raw materials or
equipment used to manufacture, import or export controlled
substances, all conveyances used to transport controlled
substances, all money and property gained through contravening
the CSA, and all property used to facilitate violations of the
CSA. The proceeds of forfeiture are used to fund drug law
enforcement. </p>

<p> Drug policy in the US has, in part, been conceptualised in
the economic terms of supply and demand. Primarily the focus has
been on reducing the supply of illegal drugs, including cannabis,
through such measures as destroying crops at the source or
interdicting supplies as they enter the US. Cannabis crops, for
example, may be spotted from the air by helicopter, sprayed with
herbicide or eradicated by ground teams. Destroying cannabis
crops in other countries, particularly South American, and
encouraging other governments to participate in law enforcement
efforts, have formed an important part of the American drug
strategy of reducing the supply of drugs. </p>

<p> Central to the US Government's policy on reducing demand is
the idea of creating a climate of intolerance towards all drug
use through concepts such as 'user accountability' and 'zero
tolerance'. 'User accountability' is the idea that individual
users should be made to recognise that their drug use, no matter
how minor it may appear to be, is part of a drug problem that
eventually results in the death of some users ([3]Wardlaw 1992).
The notion of 'zero tolerance' holds that no drug offence should
be allowed any degree of tolerance and makes little distinction
in terms of culpability between the different scales of drug
offences ([4]US Bureau of Justice Statistics 1992). </p>

<h3>Rationales </h3>

<h4>Pragmatic rationales </h4>

<p> The eradication of all illicit drug use is the central aim of
US drug policy and it is thought that prohibition is the most
effective means of reaching this goal. Cannabis use is seen as a
part of a larger drug problem. Prohibition is thought to decrease
cannabis usage in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
    <li>prohibition discourages people from experimenting with
        drugs and </li>
    <li>deters people convicted of drug offences from
        re-offending; and </li>
    <li>prohibition causes the price of illicit drugs to
        increase, making them more difficult to obtain. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Philosophical rationales </h4>

<p> Drug policy in the US is based on a deeply held belief that
all illicit drug use is extremely harmful, both in terms of the
dangers that it poses to users and in terms of the dangers that
it poses to the social fabric of American society. There is very
little distinction made between cannabis and other drugs. In
1971, President Richard Nixon declared that drug abuse was
'public enemy number one' ([5]Wijingaart 1991, p95) and, more
recently, one commentator has claimed that: Drug use in America
today is a major threat to our health, productivity, and quality
of life (Du Pont 1984: xvi, [6]cited in Wijingaart 1991, p101). </p>

<p> Section 801 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act states
that: The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and
possession and improper use of controlled substances have a
substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general
welfare of the American people. </p>

<p> In the US, official analysis of the social problems
associated with drug use has been narrow, and American policy
makers have tended to see drugs themselves as the central source
of all the ills associated with drug use in that country.
Analyses of the social context of drug taking or of the
relationship between drug taking and poverty have apparently had
little impact on the development of drug policy. </p>

<p> Central to the official American idea of 'harm' caused by
drugs is that all drugs are 'addictive', and that any
experimentation with drugs will inevitably result in dependency.
Associated with the fear of dependence is the fear, in many cases
unrealistic, of the effect that drug use has on individuals.
Although not accepting this characterisation, James Inciardi has
described the stereotype of the American drug user in the
following terms: 'Dope fiends', as they were called, were
sex-crazed maniacs, degenerate criminals, and members of the
'living dead'. 'Narcotics', including marijuana and cocaine ...
destroyed morality, addicts were sexually violent and criminally
aggressive, they were weak and ineffective members of society;
addiction was contagious since users had a mania for perpetuating
the social anathema of drug taking; and finally, once addicted,
the user entered into a lifetime of slavery to drugs ([7]Inciardi
1986, p100). </p>

<p> It has been claimed that those debating drugs policy in the
US have blurred the distinction between the effects of drug use
and the effects of the prohibition of drug use ([8]Wardlaw 1992).
Drug use is therefore thought to be inextricably linked to
violent crime, users are conceptualised as criminals, and policy
towards any level of drug use is punitive and coercive. This
philosophy of drug use is evident in the rhetorical language of
US policy makers who talk about 'zero tolerance' and who have
called their drug strategy a 'war on drugs'. </p>

<h4>Outcomes </h4>

<p> Although the price of cannabis has increased with the
policies of prohibition, the increase has not had the intended
effect of significantly reducing cannabis consumption. Despite
half a century of total prohibition, cannabis is still the most
widely used of illicit drugs in the US. Household surveys of drug
use conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse have found
that almost 68 million people in the US reported that they had
used cannabis, including 9.7 million who reported that they had
used it in the past month. In other words, some 33 per cent of
the household population aged 12 years or older reported they had
used marijuana in their lifetimes and 5 per cent reported having
used the drug in the past month. (NIDA, National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse: Population estimates 1991; cited in [9]US Bureau
of Justice Statistics 1992, p26). </p>

<p> It could be concluded that the prohibition of cannabis has
not been successful in eradicating or even significantly
decreasing cannabis use in the United States. On the other hand,
it could be argued that the policy has prevented an even higher
level of use occurring. From 1981 to 1987, 5.3 million kilograms
of marijuana were seized, however Customs, Coast Guard and the
DEA believe that they seized only 10 per cent of the marijuana
entering the country ([10]Inciardi &amp; McBride 1990, p284).
Despite the fluctuations in price that law enforcement efforts
may cause to cannabis markets from time to time, demand for
cannabis has, it is claimed, remained relatively unchanged.
Nadelmann has argued that 'the greatest beneficiaries of the drug
laws are organised and unorganised drug traffickers. The
criminalisation of the drug market effectively imposes a 'value
added tax' ([11]Nadelmann 1991). </p>

<p> The law enforcement program associated with prohibition has
also been costly, both in financial and social terms. In 1986 the
Federal expenditure on cannabis enforcement was estimated to be
around $800 million, and it is thought to have significantly
increased since then (Kleiman 1986). This figure does not include
state and local expenditures on law enforcement and criminal
justice. Every year there are 350,000 arrests for cannabis
possession alone, making this the third most common cause of
arrest in the US ([12]Kleiman 1992, pp267-8). </p>

<p> The social costs of the law enforcement program are also
high. [13]Kleiman (1992) claims that the majority of people who
are arrested for buying and using cannabis rarely do anything
else that might bring them to the attention of the criminal
justice system and that, for many users, being subject to arrest
and criminal justice processing is the most substantial risk of
using cannabis. The consequence of this is that large numbers of
people acquire criminal records and are stigmatised for what many
would see as relatively minor offences. </p>

<p> Kleiman also argues that the prohibition of cannabis
undermines the symbolic value of the criminal law. Since arrest
is the most immediate and frequent part of the punishment process
for all crimes, it is important that arrest should retain its
social meaning both as involving some substantial risk of further
punishment (to maintain its deterrent value) and as resulting
from the doing of some substantial harm (to maintain its moral
force). The fact that simple possession of marijuana is the third
most common cause of arrest puts strain on both of these symbolic
links. This contribution to the devaluation of arrest as a
sanction ought to be counted as a sizeable cost of current
marijuana laws ([14]Kleiman 1992, p268). </p>

<p> It has also been claimed by some opponents of the 'war on
drugs' that one by product of prohibition is the abuse of civil
liberties (e.g. [15]Boaz 1990). In the United States, property
can be seized if a police officer alleges that a small amount of
a controlled substance, including cannabis, is found in the
property. Forfeiture can occur without indictment or conviction
of the owner of the property, a practice that Boaz claims is a
violation of civil rights. </p>

<p> The prohibition of cannabis has also had a number of
unintended consequences. It is argued that the patterns of
cannabis use have become more dangerous and the amount of
violence associated with the cannabis market has increased.
First, it is argued that the successful interdiction of cannabis
entering the US from overseas has resulted in increased
cultivation and production of cannabis within the country.
Nadelmann has claimed that the US has emerged as one of the
world's leading producers of cannabis ([16]Nadelmann 1991, p787).
He also argues that international drug traffickers have
redirected their attention from cannabis to cocaine, resulting in
a 'glut of increasingly potent cocaine being available and a
shortage of comparatively benign marijuana' ([17]Nadelmann 1991,
p787). </p>

<p> It is also argued that prohibition has caused an increase in
the crime and violence associated with cannabis markets and an
increase in the content of THC (the major psychoactive
ingredient) of cannabis. When the majority of cannabis used was
imported from other countries, the distribution system for
cannabis was much smaller. The production of cannabis within the
US, it is argued, leads to more small and medium producers with a
wider, more competitive and possibly more violent distribution
system (Kleiman 1986; [18]Wardlaw 1992). Domestic enforcement
has, it is argued, resulted in more technology-intensive methods
of cultivation and an increase in the potency of cannabis
([19]Reuter 1987). The fact that the sale of water pipes for
smoking cannabis is illegal means that users more often consume
cannabis in cigarette papers, which is the form of consumption
most damaging to their lungs (Reuter 1987). </p>

<p> Given the costs of this form of prohibition, and its relative
lack of success, it is perhaps surprising that the US drug
strategy enjoys widespread support from the American people. In
Gallup surveys conducted from 1969 to 1985, people were asked:
'do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?'.
In 1985, 23 per cent of respondents were in favour, 73 per cent
opposed and 4 per cent expressed no opinion ([20]Inciardi &amp;
McBride 1990, p295). In October 1989 a Time/CNN poll found that
79 per cent of the population would be willing to pay higher
taxes if the money were used for fighting the 'war on drugs'
(Inciardi &amp; McBride 1990, p295). The 'war on drugs' is
supported by liberal and conservative politicians alike, public
debate on drug strategy is rare, and discussion of the
appropriateness of drug strategy has been described as 'a parlour
sport for intellectuals' rather than a subject of general public
concern. </p>

<p> As noted above, during the 1970s a number of US states
removed the penal penalties for possession of small amounts of
cannabis for personal use (a process referred to in the USA as
'decriminalisation'), but this move towards a more liberal
approach was subsequently abandoned. Little information is
available on the basis of the policy reversal, referred to as
'recriminalisation'. Apparently the decisions were made not on
the basis of factual research into the impact of
decriminalisation, but rather on ideological grounds.
Opportunities were available for research comparing the
experiences of the various states, but apparently such research
was not undertaken, leaving policy to be made without a firm
information base.6 </p>

<h4>CONCLUSION - THE USA APPROACH </h4>

<p> The US drug policy does not seem to have met many of the
policy goals identified in the early part of this report. </p>

<p> First, cannabis policy has not been separated from that of
other drugs. Policy makers see only the larger 'drug problem' and
have not recognised the need to have different policies for
different drugs. </p>

<p> Secondly, in the USA the arguments for the total prohibition
of all drugs are highly emotive; arguments about the consequences
of drug use have not been separated from arguments about morals.
Consequently, this has led to the idea that is implicit in much
US drug policy, that all illicit drugs and consequently all drug
users are inherently criminal and even evil. The
conceptualisation of the drug problem in such uncompromising,
black and white terms means that there is little room to make
exceptions for arguably 'soft' drugs such as cannabis. </p>

<p> Thirdly, the goals of the 'war on drugs' are not realistic.
Kleiman has argued that US drug policy amounts to a 'holy war'
against drugs, and as such it is not surprising that the policy
goals are far from realistic ([21]Kleiman 1992). Those creating
and implementing the US drug strategy do not talk of 'minimising
the harm' arising from drug use (as in Australia's National Drug
Strategy); rather they aim to completely eliminate drug use, a
goal that many would consider to be unreachable. </p>

<p> Finally, in [22]Chapter Two of this report, we have suggested
that the harms caused by the drug control regimes themselves
should not outweigh the harms prevented by them. With respect to
cannabis use it has been argued that the harm caused by control
regimes clearly outweighs the harm caused by the drug
([23]Kleiman 1992). It has also been argued that those developing
policy in the US have failed to make the distinction between the
problems created by drugs and the problems created by prohibition
(e.g. [24]Wardlaw 1992). The USA has a number of severe social
problems associated with drug use, including forcing users into
the criminal milieu, demeaning the criminal law in the eyes of
users, increasing the number of people with criminal records,
increasing the level of imprisonment, and increasing the level of
transmission of the AIDS virus. These problems, and the
relatively limited achievements in reducing drug use and
drug-related problems, have prompted ever increasing efforts in
the 'war against drugs'. It is likely, however, that many of the
social problems are created not by the drugs themselves but by
the strategy of total prohibition. </p>

<h3>Part B: The Netherlands: </h3>

<p> <b>LEGISLATIVE PROHIBITION WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPEDIENCY
PRINCIPLE </b> </p>

<h4>Background </h4>

<p> Between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s in The Netherlands,
the use of illegal drugs grew from 'almost non-existent to
constitute a serious health and public order problem in urban
areas' ([25]van Vliet 1990). Although the use of cannabis in The
Netherlands came to public attention in the late 1950s, debate on
drug policy only began in earnest when heroin use and the
problems associated with it became increasingly visible between
1972 and 1975. </p>

<p> Amendments to the Opium Act were introduced in 1976 and can
be seen as heralding a new era in drug policy. Until this time
drug policy in The Netherlands was much like that of other
countries ([26]Wijingaart 1990, p668, cited in [27]Wardlaw 1992,
p16). Drug law and policy in The Netherlands The Opium Act of
1976 makes a clear distinction between 'drugs presenting
unacceptable risks' (heroin, cocaine, LSD, amphetamines) and
'cannabis products'. The changes introduced in this legislation
increased penalties for dealing in 'drugs presenting unacceptable
risks' and decreased the penalties for possession and dealing in
cannabis products. </p>

<p> The purpose of the legislation was to separate drug markets
and user groups in an effort to prevent cannabis users from
involvement in the 'hard' drug scene. Although the legislation
falls clearly within a total prohibition framework, as Dutch
commentators have pointed out 'law in practice is more relevant
than law in books' ([28]Leuw 1991). A clause in The Netherlands
Code of Criminal Procedure, known as the 'expediency principle',
states that the prosecution office may decide whether or not to
enforce certain laws, to prosecute or to initiate criminal
investigation on the basis of whether or not such action would be
'in the public interest'. Using this clause, the Minister of
Justice issued guidelines in 1976 for the enforcement of drug
laws and the investigation and prosecution of breaches of drug
laws. </p>

<p> Essentially it is these guidelines rather than legislation
that determines drug policy in The Netherlands. [29]Marshall et
al. (1990) have noted that the priorities in the guidelines
correspond to the distinctions made between 'hard' and 'soft'
drugs in the Opium Act. High priority is given to detecting the
importation and exportation of drugs that are seen to represent
an 'unacceptable risk'. </p>

<p> Investigation and prosecution of 'soft' drug violations, with
the exception of the import and export of large amounts of such
drugs, are assigned a low priority (Marshall et al. 1990).
According to the guidelines, dealing, possessing or producing
small amounts (30g or less) of marijuana, do not require police
investigation, arrest or prosecution. A low priority is also
given to the investigation and prosecution of retail dealing in
cannabis, and police are only required to confront dealers when
they advertise publicly or conduct their business in a
provocative manner. As long as there is no sale to minors, no
advertising, no sale of 'hard' drugs, and if the dealing takes
place without causing a public nuisance, then (generally
speaking) there will be no police intervention. Where there are
breaches of the type outlined above, administrative measures,
such as the withdrawal of permits to serve drinks and food, are
imposed. If the parties involved persist in contravening the
guidelines, they are issued with a warning. Confiscation of the
drugs may be another consequence of continuing breaches of the
guidelines. [30]Marshall et al. (1990) report that only very
rarely is imprisonment the consequence of such violations. The
extent to which the guidelines, or the Opium Act, are followed
depends on local circumstances. Sanctions imposed may vary
between different districts of The Netherlands. </p>

<h4>Rationales </h4>

<h5>Pragmatic rationales </h5>

<p> The goals or rationales for Dutch drug policy include the
following: </p>

<ul>
    <li>to promote safer methods of consumption of cannabis; </li>
    <li>to limit sales of cannabis to specialist sellers; </li>
    <li>to limit progression from cannabis use to other drugs; </li>
    <li>to limit the amount of violence in the cannabis
        distribution system; and </li>
    <li>to limit the substitution of other (more damaging) drugs
        for cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Philosophical rationales </h5>

<p> The 'drug problem' in The Netherlands has always been
recognised as a complex social problem and as such, law
enforcement and penal sanctions alone have never been seen to
represent a complete solution . During the parliamentary debate
on the revised Opium Act of 1976 Irene Vorrink, the Minister of
Public Health, identified the following aims that form the basis
of drug policy in The Netherlands: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the central aim is the prevention and amelioration of
        social and individual risks caused by the use of drugs; </li>
    <li>a rational relation between those risks and policy
        measures; </li>
    <li>a differentiation of policy measures which will also take
        into account the risks of legal recreational and medical
        drugs; </li>
    <li>a priority of repressive measures against the trafficking
        of drugs other than cannabis; and </li>
    <li>the inadequacy of the criminal law with regard to any
        other aspect of the drug problem ([31] Handelingen 1976,
        cited in Leuw 1991, p10). </li>
</ul>

<p> The aims outlined above illustrate that The Netherlands drug
policy is characterised by a number of factors. First, the
criminal law was never thought to be a solution to the drug
problem. Government policy with respect to 'hard' drugs is
broadly based and focuses on treatment and assistance for the
user and punishment for the commercial dealer ([32]Marshall et
al. 1990). Secondly, it is recognised that the basis of drug
policy should be to minimise harm rather than eradicate drug use,
and thirdly, it is argued that drug policy should not be the same
for all illicit drugs. Cannabis is seen in a different light from
other drugs. Clearly there are pragmatic reasons for this
separation, as the user markets for different drugs are divided
and users of cannabis are, it is argued, less likely to progress
to the use of 'harder' drugs. </p>

<p> However there is also evidence that suggests that the use of
cannabis was never perceived by Dutch society to be a
particularly compelling social problem. Leuw claims that: In
accordance with the legal differentiation between cannabis
products and hard drugs, drug policy encompassing prevention and
assistance developed primarily in reaction to the emerging heroin
problem. The cannabis problem - if there ever had been one seemed
to have disappeared from the face of the earth even before the
amended Opium Act became effective ([33]Leuw 1991, p725). </p>

<p> The separation of cannabis from other drug problems also has
had the effect of making the drug problem more manageable.
[34]Van Vliet (1988) is critical of the US style of drug policy
that makes no moral or legal distinction between different types
of drug offences or different types of drugs and claims that 'by
lumping all these different phenomena together, societies and
governments help to create a problem which is unsolvable' (van
Vliet 1988). Conversely, The Netherlands breaks down the
'inextricable' problem into 'manageable bits'. </p>

<p> In the mid-1980s, a Government-sponsored research project led
to the development of the concept of 'normalisation' or 'cultural
integration' which added to the sophistication of Dutch drug
policy ([35]van Vliet 1990;[36] Leuw 1991). 'Normalisation'
recognises that some type of drug use is natural to all human
societies and argues that the eradication of all drug use is an
unrealistic policy goal. The reduction of drug use and the social
and individual problems associated with it are felt to be far
more reasonable policy goals. Central to the concept of
'normalisation' is the idea that drug users should not be
marginalised from the rest of society. In a speech to the Dutch
Parliament, the State Secretary of Health stated, in 1985, that:
Normalisation ... includes the cultural integration of drug users
in society ... This does not mean the elimination of the drug
phenomenon as a social reality: it means a change of context
which clears the way for a different approach ... drug addicts
should be treated neither as criminals nor as dependent patients
but as 'normal' people to whom we can make 'normal' demands and
who should be offered 'normal' opportunities ([37]van Vliet 1990,
p727). </p>

<p> The implications for cannabis policy of 'normalisation' are
clear. According to the Dutch, the eradication of cannabis use is
an unrealistic policy goal and the creation of a 'deviant status'
for drug users means that users are more likely to 'drop out' of
main stream society and perhaps start using more dangerous drugs.
The use of the criminal law to deal with cannabis use would
marginalise cannabis users and this would be seen as
unnecessarily destructive in terms of its social costs. </p>

<h4>Outcomes </h4>

<p> Today it is possible to openly buy and use cannabis in a
number of coffee shops in Amsterdam and other regional centres.
Most of these coffee shops do not sell any other drugs and many
do not even sell alcohol. However, the public consumption of
cannabis has been subject to criticism from other countries, who
seem to equate public consumption with increased use. Downes
(1988) has claimed that the image of The Netherlands portrayed in
the international media is one of 'a blinkered liberalism
belatedly struggling to cope with the results of its own
permissiveness' and cites an example of a British journalist who
wrote in the Sunday Times that 'Amsterdam has a long history of
free-thinking and tolerating most things except law and order ...
But the city's tolerance has been worn thin by crime, drug abuse
and militant squatters' ([38]Downes 1988, p123). </p>

<p> Unsurprisingly, Dutch commentators do not subscribe to the
view that their society is on the brink of collapse. They argue
that the 'hash cafes' have been integrated as normal urban
facilities and do not pose a threat to public order ([39]Leuw
1991). The point has also been made that visible drug use only
signals failure if maintaining an image of a drug-free society is
an aim of drug policy (Leuw 1991). In contrast, the Dutch, who
aim to prevent drug users from being marginalised, may see
visible drug use as a sign of success. </p>

<p> Despite the impression presented in the international media,
most studies suggest that the policies implemented in The
Netherlands have not resulted in any significant increase in drug
use or changes in patterns of use ([40]Engelsmann 1989;
Wijingaart 1988a cited in [41]Wardlaw 1992, p23). A recent study
combined the results of over 20 Dutch studies that examined the
percentage of the population who had 'ever used' cannabis and
compared them with data from Norway, Sweden and the USA. The
period from 1970 to 1988 was examined and the authors concluded
that: </p>

<p> The results of the time analysis show that the prevalence of
cannabis use since 1970 decreased, whereas the policy became more
tolerant. Since 1979 a slight increase in the use of cannabis can
be observed. A comparison with data from other countries with a
more restrictive policy reveals that the use of cannabis in The
Netherlands is on the same level as in Sweden and Norway (around
10-15 per cent), but far lower than that in the US (exceeding 50
per cent). However the downward trend in these three countries
since 1984 did not occur in The Netherlands ([42]Driesen, van Dam
&amp; Olsen 1989, p11 cited in Leuw 1991). </p>

<p> The savings made to law enforcement and criminal justice
budgets of not processing large numbers of cannabis offenders are
substantial and should be seen as one of the primary benefits of
the Dutch approach to drug policy. In addition, the cannabis
market and distribution system is free from violence ([43]van
Vliet 1990). </p>

<p> It has also been argued that the Dutch approach has led to
safer patterns of cannabis use. First, the fact that users of
cannabis do not seem to turn to other more dangerous drugs is
used as evidence that the policy of the separation of drug
markets is working ([44]van Vliet 1990). [45]Cohen (1988) argues
that Dutch cannabis users, unlike their counterparts in the USA,
are not likely to ingest the herbicide paraquat in the cannabis
that they consume, and are also more likely to consume the drug
in a safer way because the sale of drug paraphernalia such as
water pipes is legal in The Netherlands (Cohen 1988). Cohen has
also argued that 'the knowledge of how to regulate cannabis use
has become an inconspicuous part of local Dutch youth culture
because the development of drug use rules was not pushed out of
the mainstream and into deviant sub cultures' (Cohen 1988, p24). </p>

<p> In terms of the goals that Dutch policy makers identified,
drug policy in The Netherlands has been moderately successful.
However, the Dutch approach to drug policy has not been popular
internationally: Germany and the USA in particular have been
vocal in their opposition. In recent times this has led to the
introduction of tougher drug policies with respect to 'hard
drugs' ([46]Marshall et al. 1990), however these pressures have
not yet had any impact on cannabis policy. Indeed, it has been
speculated that Dutch cannabis policy is unlikely to change as a
result of international pressure ([47]Wardlaw 1992). </p>

<h4>CONCLUSION - THE DUTCH APPROACH </h4>

<p> In a variety of ways The Netherlands drug policy meets many
of the criteria outlined in [48]Chapter 2. </p>

<p> First, Dutch policy makers have recognised the need to have
different policies for different drugs. The idea of separating
'drugs of unacceptable risk' and cannabis is based on the idea
that the control regime that appears to be appropriate for one
illicit drug need not apply to others. </p>

<p> Secondly, policy makers have managed to separate arguments
about the consequences of drug use from arguments about morals.
In fact, Dutch policy was intended to be 'non-moralistic'
([49]Leuw 1991). It has been claimed that, in The Netherlands,
drug use has never been seen as a 'moral' issue and it is argued
that: Political speeches elaborating on the abhorrence of illegal
drugs have seldom been staged. They would appear as quite
misplaced in Dutch political culture. Consequently there are no
votes to be won or positions to be conquered by rallying an
anti-drug theme ([50]Leuw 1991). </p>

<p> Thirdly, this non-moralistic approach to drug policy has led
to the development of realistic policy goals with respect to
cannabis use. [51]Leuw (1991) notes that in The Netherlands there
has been no pledge of 'solving the problem' of drug use. Instead
of attempting to eradicate drug use Dutch authorities have
adopted the more pragmatic goal of minimising the risks and
damaging effects of drug use. Of concern to some observers,
however, is the Dutch approach of formalising inconsistency
between the provisions of legislation and its implementation. An
argument can be advanced that this conveys confusing messages to
the community. It is preferable, some would argue, for
legislation and policy on implementation to be aligned so that
both permit (or proscribe) the use of cannabis in certain
circumstances. Having legislation creating an offence of cannabis
use, along with policy declaring that it is inexpedient to
prosecute such offences, seems to be acceptable in the Dutch
context, although it would possibly be unacceptable in other
cultures. We return to this apparent difficulty in the concluding
chapter of this report. </p>

<h2>Conclusion - the total prohibition options </h2>

<p> The Netherlands has been successful in terms of the goals
identified by Dutch policy makers. Their policy has not resulted
in the increased use of cannabis; indeed levels of cannabis use
are markedly lower than those seen in the United States or
Australia. There is little violence associated with the cannabis
distribution system, cannabis users do not seem to progress to
using more serious drugs and the drug is consumed in a manner
whereby the risks of harm are minimised. </p>

<p> Dutch policy is also relatively successful in terms of many
of the policy goals that we discussed above. The separation of
cannabis from other drugs ensures that The Netherlands has a more
manageable drug policy. The goals of policy are realistic and
policy makers have not confused moral arguments with arguments
about the consequences of drug use. </p>

<p> In contrast, the US drug strategy with respect to cannabis
does not seem to be particularly successful. Despite considerable
economic and social costs, cannabis use is far from being
eradicated in the USA. Cannabis users may be consuming the drug
in a particularly dangerous manner, the illicit drugs
distribution system (of which cannabis is a part) is associated
with violence, and law enforcement, criminal justice processing
and the imprisonment of cannabis-related offenders costs American
tax payers millions of dollars every year. </p>

<p> The USA has not emerged favourably in relation to the goals
identified in the first part of this report. Apparently American
policy makers have not recognised the need to consider different
policy strategies for different drugs, leaving cannabis part of
the larger, seemingly unsolvable 'drug problem'. Moral arguments
have been confused with arguments about the consequences of drug
use, and this has led to the development of unrealistic policy
goals and a failure to recognise that the control regime imposed
to deal with the problem of cannabis use may be causing more harm
than the cannabis use itself. Examples from the USA and The
Netherlands demonstrate that the legislative option of total
prohibition can be implemented in very different ways. The two
countries have very different philosophical and pragmatic
rationales for their policies and, unsurprisingly, the outcomes
of the policies have varied considerably. </p>

<p> In developing policy, international examples are of benefit
to Australian policy makers. It should be remembered, however,
that the relative success or failure of drug policies depend as
much on cultural factors, existing patterns of drug use, and
public views of drug use, as they do on the soundness of the
policy. </p>

<h1>CHAPTER 5: DIVERSION AND COMPULSORY TREATMENT </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"> </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> This chapter covers the two related fields of diversion and
treatment - including compulsory treatment - for drug offenders,
particularly where cannabis is involved. Such diversion may
simply involve diversion from the criminal justice system for
individuals involved in minor cannabis offences; it may also
involve diversion to treatment for those who either want, or are
judged by others, to need treatment for drug use sufficiently
serious to bring them into contact with the criminal justice
system. </p>

<p> Diversion is a form of intervention in the lives of offenders
primarily based on humanitarian grounds (i.e. to keep them out of
prison), but also, more pragmatically, to relieve the burden on
the courts and the prisons imposed by the very large numbers of
people charged with very minor offences. While diversion from a
court appearance is a mild form of intervention receiving broad
community support, diversion to treatment, particularly when
mandated by the court, raises philosophical issues relating to
the degree of intervention the state should be empowered to
exercise over people's lives. Compulsory treatment when it takes
the form of civil commitment is the most extreme form of
intervention, and, where ordered for drug offenders, is morally
distasteful to many and the subject of much controversy.
Nevertheless, there are legislative provisions for civil
commitment of drug offenders in many countries, including
Australia. </p>

<p> We begin the chapter with a discussion of the concept of
diversion, then review existing diversion programs in Australia
and overseas, with particular reference to programs involving
treatment. The subject of compulsory treatment, including civil
commitment for drug offenders, is dealt with next, with an
overview of international legislation and treatment programs,
along with such evaluations as exist. The implications of this
for offenders whose primary drug is cannabis are discussed and
some conclusions are drawn regarding treatment for repeat
offenders. </p>

<p> Finally, we present a summary of the major findings for
cannabis users resulting from our review of the key Australian
and international literature dealing with diversion and treatment
for drug offenders. The concept of diversion In the US, according
to Tomasic ([1]1977, cited in Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p6),
official use of the term 'diversion' occurred for the first time
in the US President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice. The following are two definitions of
diversion from the US literature: ... the disposition of a
criminal complaint without conviction, the non-criminal
disposition being conditioned on either the performance of
specified obligations by the defendant, or his participation in
counselling or treatment, ([2]Nimmer 1974, cited in Dept of
Attorney-General 1982, p6). ... those formally acknowledged and
organised efforts to utilize alternatives to the initial or
continued criminal justice processing of alleged offenders, which
are undertaken prior to adjudication but after a prosecutable
action has occurred, ([3]Rovner-Pieczenik, cited in Dept of
Attorney-General 1982, p6). Due to fears, in the case of
non-trial disposition, of unfairness, lack of procedural
protection and lack of follow-up treatment to prevent recurrence
of the offence, the Commission recommended formalising the
procedure and adding extra-legal services such as treatment and
preventative education as an integral part of the non-trial
disposition. The total package came to be known as 'diversion'
([4]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p8). </p>

<p> The early justifications for diversion included: </p>

<ul>
    <li>relief of overburdened courts; </li>
    <li>avoiding the further criminalisation of first offenders; </li>
    <li>avoiding the disadvantaging of first offenders on
        re-entry to society by their being labelled as criminals;
    </li>
    <li>providing a preferable way of dealing with certain
        offenders such as juveniles or drug users, who could be
        better dealt with in the community than in prisons; and </li>
    <li>providing cost-benefits to the community and a more
        humane way of dealing with certain categories of
        offenders ([5]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, p9). </li>
</ul>

<p> The term 'diversion' when used in relation to the Australian
criminal justice system may incorporate a 'range of related but
relatively exclusive procedures some of which are seen as
potential alternatives to &quot;due process&quot; others as
additions to it' ([6]Williams 1981, p3). Those falling into the
'alternatives' classification include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>pre-arrest diversion: this amounts to discretionary
        measures taken by police at the point of apprehension of
        an offender; and </li>
    <li>pre-trial diversion (or 'pre-court', in Australia): in
        this case certain conditions have to be satisfied by the
        offender, following which the alleged offences are struck
        off the record. </li>
</ul>

<p> Those falling into the 'additions' classification include: +
pre-sentence diversion: this is essentially remand for assessment
and/or treatment; and + post-conviction diversion: in this case
offenders are directed to some form of treatment-related
supervision as a part of their sentence (presumably in lieu of
imprisonment). Prisoners may also be diverted from jail to
treatment as a condition of their parole. These additions to due
process, therefore, function as increased sentencing options
([7]Williams 1981, p3). </p>

<p> The subject of diversion has been a neglected area in
Australia, although there have been 'official' diversionary
programs operating at least since 1977 (in NSW). The term
diversion is applied to a wide variety of programs, and in
Australia can occur pre-court or pre- or post-sentence. Pre-court
diversion can vary from a police warning or an expiation notice
for a minor drug offence, to referral for drug-treatment as an
alternative to a punitive sentence. </p>

<p> Unlike some countries, in Australia cannabis use and
possession offences are not regarded as very serious in
comparison with offences involving 'harder' drugs, and the
subject of treatment for cannabis use has similarly not been
considered much of an issue. In fact the legislation in some
States does not cover diversion for treatment on the grounds of
cannabis use alone. If cannabis users are diverted for treatment
it is usually because they are polydrug users, as many of the
more serious users are. </p>

<p> The main diversion programs operating in Australia will be
briefly described, and an overview presented of diversion in the
US and other countries, with reference to their relevance for
cannabis users. Key features of treatment programs for drug users
are discussed, along with the issue of compulsory treatment and,
what is known in the United States as, civil commitment. </p>

<h2>Diversion programs in Australia (10) </h2>

<h3>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY </h3>

<p> The ACT Drugs of Dependence Act 1989 (as amended in 1992 and
1993) allows as a sentencing option anyone found guilty of a
crime to be sent for assessment as to whether they are
drug-dependent and therefore suitable to be referred for
treatment. Those brought to court usually appear on a combination
of charges of different degrees of seriousness. Often a community
service order may be the sentence or a conviction on
recognisance, which can include a good behaviour bond or a
partially or fully suspended sentence. Assessment or treatment
orders are rare and are typically given for such offences as
unlawful possession, stolen property offences, burglary and motor
vehicle theft (where drug dependence is believed to have
contributed to the criminal behaviour).11 </p>

<p> The DODA (Drugs of Dependence) Referral Program works in the
following way: anyone committing an offence requiring a court
appearance who seems to defence counsel to have a drug problem
(or who claims to have a drug problem) is entitled to have this
fact raised before sentencing. If the court issues an assessment
order, the client then has to contact the DODA Referral Program
where a counsellor takes a case history to be sent to the
Treatment Assessment Panel. The panel consists of a legal person
(usually a solicitor) and two others with extensive knowledge of
drug and alcohol treatment in the ACT, who are appointed for a
year. The client is assessed and options for treatment put
forward. The client then goes to the chosen treatment centre
which reports back to the panel as to whether the client is
suitable or not suitable for treatment. The client then goes back
to the panel for a second time at which time the panel looks at
the information from the treatment centre and listens to what the
client has to say, since the client has high input and
responsibility throughout the process. If the client fails to
come back (or fails to attend at any stage) an arrest warrant may
be issued, or the panel may suggest a Breach of Assessment Order.
This information goes to the court, where a warrant for arrest
may be issued, or the failure to attend may be brought up when
the client next comes before the court and the client may lose
the right to the alternative to sentencing. This does not happen
very often, as the court usually chooses the treatment order when
they have the option. The court specifies the length of time at
the treatment centre and periodic reviews by the panel, which can
be every three months. The program tries to be lenient if the
client misses one or two reviews, as the objective is harm
minimisation rather than abstinence (unless the client has opted
for abstinence). If the client consistently fails to appear for
review or is not doing well (this is not the usual outcome) it is
possible to breach them. The breach is issued in court but DODA
provides the report on behalf of the panel. Then a summons can be
issued and the usual court process (arrest warrant issued) is
followed. </p>

<p> The magistrate primarily concerned with diversion made the
following observations: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Most drug-related offences are caused by alcohol, often
        used in conjunction with cannabis, which is particularly
        dangerous if the offender is driving. The DODA Program
        does not cover alcohol. </li>
    <li>There is concern about the danger posed by offenders
        combining alcohol and cannabis prior to driving (many
        alcohol-dependent people coming before the DODA treatment
        panel are also cannabis-dependent). </li>
    <li>Clients should not be referred for treatment in the case
        of cannabis use unless assessed as 'seriously dependent
        on cannabis', in order to screen out those seeking simply
        to avoid conviction. </li>
    <li>A distinct preference was expressed for post-court
        diversion, as opposed to pre-court diversion, so that the
        court has the opportunity to assess offenders. </li>
    <li>Offenders may be diverted more than once. The goal is
        'harm reduction', and total rehabilitation is not
        expected after the first treatment. </li>
</ul>

<p> It was confirmed by the magistrate and treatment personnel
that there have been clients coming to the program who complain
of cannabis dependence. Personnel at the DODA Referral Program
report that there is very little treatment for cannabis users. It
is usually outpatient treatment and 'is not 100 per cent
successful'. The treatment they use is adapted from the treatment
for tobacco, i.e. a process of slow cessation, while keeping a
diary of the situations and times of use, with counselling once a
week. Ideally the treatment should be tailored to the
individual's needs. Very few cannabis users would be referred to
a residential facility such as Karralika, and if so, it would be
on the grounds of polydrug use. </p>

<p> The DODA program is the only one of its sort in Australia,
and mainly deals with fairly longstanding opiate users with
lengthy records. There is a juvenile panel, but this has not been
used much. If magistrates send more juveniles in future, the
program would be especially relevant for alcohol use. A formal
evaluation has not yet been done, but program staff claim the
following desirable results: a reduction in criminal activity on
the part of its clients; monitoring their progress rather than
seeing them go to jail; and reducing their drug use. Very few
become drug-free, but there is significant harm reduction from
the social, personal and economic viewpoint. </p>

<h3>SOUTH AUSTRALIA </h3>

<p> The drug diversion scheme operating in South Australia was
established when the Controlled Substances Act 1984 provided for
the South Australian Drug Assessment and Aid Panel (the panel) as
an alternative to the criminal law for illicit drug users.12 The
panel is only one of 13 penalty outcomes for drug offenders in
South Australia, ranging from a $50 expiation fee for possession
of small amounts of cannabis and cannabis resin to $1 million and
life imprisonment for the most serious trafficking offence. The
underlying philosophy is to make a clear distinction between the
drug dealer and the drug user (Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
1992). </p>

<p> The new Act came about primarily as a result of the
recommendation of the Sackville Commission that drug assessment
and aid panels should be established to which all persons charged
with simple possession offences involving drugs must be referred
before a prosecution may proceed. Juvenile Aid Panels were also
established - as an alternative to the juvenile court system -
which continue to operate and to provide for the diversion of
some, but not all, young offenders out of the criminal justice
system ([8]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992). </p>

<p> The panel provides for absolute diversion in so far as the
panel and its clients, not the courts and prosecutors, determine
the outcome of proceedings. All persons charged with a 'simple
possession' offence (i.e. involving personal use of illicit drugs
other than cannabis and cannabis resin and including use or
possession of implements for the use of an illicit drug) must be
referred to the panel, thus precluding any issue of discretion on
the part of courts or prosecutors, and removing the offender from
the court system ([9]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p129). </p>

<p> The panel, however, considers only a limited number of
offences, and although an amendment to the Act permitted courts
to refer matters to the panel for the preparation of pre-sentence
reports, this power has rarely been exercised ([10]Gray, Reynolds
&amp; Rumbold 1992, p130). The panel consists of a lawyer and two
people with extensive knowledge of the problems and/or treatment
of illicit drug use. Hearings are private and proceedings
confidential in order to create an atmosphere of trust. Clients
are referred from either the police or the courts, more often the
former. Before being dealt with by the panel, the client must
have admitted to the offence and be willing to undertake the
assessment and any treatment or counselling which may be
required. The client may choose the option of being dealt with by
the courts. Those who do not appear willing to change their lives
and those who do not respond to the initial letter from the panel
or attend their appointment are referred back to court. </p>

<p> Those dealt with by the panel must undertake to comply with
the directions of the panel and attend panel sessions as
requested over a six-month period.13 At the end of this period
the panel instructs the court and the police to withdraw the
matter, and no record of any drug offence may be used
subsequently against the client ([11]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
1992, p129). </p>

<p> The major findings of an evaluation of the panel were that: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Out of the 1,400 clients seen between May 1985 and
        September 1991, most were male and in their 20s, directed
        to the panel for illegal possession of, mostly,
        amphetamines followed by heroin. </li>
    <li>The panel did not provide the early intervention hoped
        for. Although most clients were being offered the
        opportunity for assessment for treatment for the first
        time, many already had criminal histories. Intervention
        at an earlier stage is desirable for a more successful
        outcome. </li>
    <li>The amount of polydrug use 'should be seen as a matter of
        significance and concern. This includes the dangerous -
        though legal - drugs, alcohol and tobacco, which will
        often prove more of a problem and potentially more
        destructive to clients than the illicit drug problem that
        brought them to the attention of the panel in the first
        place' ([12]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p133). </li>
    <li>While cannabis and cannabis resin offences were excluded
        from the panel's jurisdiction, 'there were indications of
        extensive and potentially harmful levels of cannabis use
        among many clients' ([13]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold
        1992, p132). </li>
    <li>The characteristics of most of the clients were such that
        the treatment required was based on coping and lifestyle
        skills 'rather than strategies influenced by models of
        physiological addiction' ([14]Gray, Reynolds &amp;
        Rumbold 1992, p132). </li>
    <li>The panel is only as effective as the treatment and other
        social supports which are available. </li>
    <li>The statutory barrier allowing only people over 18 to be
        seen by the panel means that many have had drug habits
        for years. Although structured to deal with these cases,
        the Childrens Aid Panel is not sufficiently a specialist
        drug assessment and aid body, nor are drugs its primary
        concern. </li>
</ol>

<p> Overall 'the justification for the panel as a means of
diverting offenders from the criminal justice system and
providing intervention opportunities is overwhelming' ([15]Gray,
Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p134). Interviews with criminal
justice personnel indicated that the panel is satisfactory from
the point of view of cutting down on court congestion and from
the point of view that it is treatment-focused rather than
punitive. There is also no stigma of a conviction being recorded.
However, it seems that within the confines of the Act, the police
have the discretion as to what charge to lay, e.g. if the
offender is known by the police and has an amount of the drug
which could be trafficked, he may instead be charged with
trafficking. </p>

<h3>NEW SOUTH WALES </h3>

<p> Offences relating to alcohol or drug use in New South Wales
are covered by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
This Act distinguishes between cannabis and other drugs only in
the case of commercial trafficking. Possession and administration
of cannabis are prosecuted summarily and offenders are liable to
a penalty of $2,000 and/or two years' imprisonment. Cultivation,
manufacture and production, and supply are prosecuted on
indictment, an offender being liable to a fine of $2,000 and/or
two years imprisonment if there are less than five plants or less
than a quantity of 25g. New South Wales was the first State in
Australia to introduce a drug diversion program. </p>

<p> Its current program, the Drug and Alcohol Court Assessment
Programme (DACAP) is a post-conviction, pre-sentence program
where offenders on drug-related charges (such as possession of an
illicit substance) or drug-involved crime (such as property crime
to finance drug use) are bailed/remanded to attend a treatment
agency and undergo a comprehensive assessment which forms the
basis of a pre-sentence report for the magistrate, containing
recommendations for sentencing, including treatment options
([16]Desland &amp; Batey 1990, p796). </p>

<p> Successful completion of the treatment program, the length of
which is determined by a health worker, finalises the matter
([17]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993). A further objective is to
'provide drug offenders with a comprehensive assessment that may
encourage them to consider improving their health and social
functioning' ([18]Schlosser 1984, pxi). </p>

<p> DACAP further attempts through these assessments to match the
individual's drug-related problems to the most appropriate range
of therapeutic interventions within a legal/health framework
(Schlosser 1984).'... the diversion from the Criminal Justice
System to the health care system provides to the offender in many
cases, the initial insight and confrontation that criminal
activities are directly related to their health. Often this
insight initiates motivation to address the problems of substance
abuse' ([19]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p92). </p>

<p> DACAP statistics between 1990 and 1992 indicate that, while
heroin was the main drug of concern (after alcohol) in about one
case in five, both in 1990-91 and 1991-92, cannabis was the next
ranking drug ([20]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p96).14 An interview with
one of DACAP's clients who had been arrested for possession and
supply of a large amount of cannabis revealed that, although he
knew that he had 'a big marijuana problem', he had never been
prepared to do anything about it and that DACAP provided the
opportunity and a reason to 'address the issue'. The magistrate
placed this client under supervision, fined him, imposed a
sentence of periodic detention, with 20 hours at an Attendance
Centre and the requirement to undertake a series of courses on
issues such as personal development, money management, drug and
alcohol information and education. The client fulfilled these
requirements ([21]MSJ Keys Young, 1992, p118). </p>

<p> MSJ Keys Young's recent evaluation of DACAP included the
observations that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Magistrates generally agreed that a DACAP report might be
        considered appropriate in cases involving a relatively
        serious and/or repeated offence, where a custodial
        sentence was a realistic possibility (some used it even
        where a custodial sentence was unlikely), and where it
        appeared that drug/alcohol dependency might be a
        significant factor (1992, p113). </li>
    <li>It was very desirable to use the pre-sentence 'crisis'
        period to get the dependency problem acknowledged and, if
        possible, to start treatment, as if left until after
        sentence, the chances of success were much less (1992,
        p105); sometimes it takes a long time for a drug user to
        recognise dependency (e.g. in the case of cannabis) and
        an intervention such as that of DACAP can be very
        beneficial in confronting this. </li>
    <li>Some magistrates observed that they did not see many
        people who had been through the DACAP process coming
        before the court for repeat offences. Important issues
        were availability of places in treatment and skilled
        counsellors with broad views of dependency. Regarding the
        issue of coercion, several evaluations of DACAP have
        'tentatively concluded' that the legal coercion into
        treatment as evidenced in the DACAP program was effective
        in acting as an early intervention into drug use,
        generating a younger client less involved with drugs, who
        is more amenable to an abstinent outcome (Desland &amp;
        Batey 1988; [22]Schlosser 1984; [23]Bush &amp; Scagliotti
        1983; [24]Williams 1981; all cited in Desland &amp; Batey
        1988, p51). This is consistent with other studies of
        court-ordered assessment/treatment for substance use
        ([25]Salmon &amp; Salmon 1983, cited in Desland &amp;
        Batey 1987, p51). </li>
</ul>

<h3>VICTORIA </h3>

<p> Victoria appears not to have any government-implemented
pre-court drug diversion programs ([26]Walters &amp; Coventry
1993). The Alcoholics and Drug Dependent Person's Act 1968 (Vic),
s13 provides for bonds under which offenders may be ordered to
attend treatment as an alternative to a custodial sentence (Skene
1986, cited in [27]Walters 1993, p11). Programs are available for
offenders who are detected to be intoxicated at the time of the
offence and considered by the court to be 'habitually using
intoxicating liquor or drugs of addiction'. </p>

<p> The Court Advice and Assessment Programme precipitates a
court report which makes recommendations on the suitability of a
community-based order, and provides a management plan based on
the offender's level of substance use. Referral to the program is
at the discretion of the court, and applies only at the
magistrate's jurisdiction, but is not limited to particular
offences ([28]Gray, Reynolds &amp; Rumbold 1992, p130). In
addition, s67 of the Act allows for a good behaviour bond for
first offenders so that the number of drug users ending up in
court is not large. </p>

<p> A current study being carried out in Victoria by the National
Centre for Socio-Legal Studies ([29]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993)
for the Victoria Police, is considering a pilot pre-court drug
diversion program for 'all first-time drug offenders apprehended
for use and possession offences regardless of the illicit
substance'. At the time of detection and arrest these offenders
would be considered 'recreational users', and one option for
processing such offenders would be a diversion panel. In this
case it would be up to the panel to assess the nature and extent
of drug use and recommend a course of action ([30]Walters &amp;
Coventry 1993, p7). </p>

<h3>WESTERN AUSTRALIA </h3>

<p> In Western Australia, the Bail Act 1982 provides for
treatment as a condition of bail in the case of a defendant who
is suffering from alcohol or drug dependence. Their pre-court
diversion system, the Court Diversion Service (CDS) has been
operating since 1988 as a cooperative venture between the West
Australian Alcohol and Drug Authority (WAADA), the Department of
Corrective Services and non-government drug treatment agencies,
coordinated by the WAADA. Any person with a drug dependency
problem who is charged with a criminal offence is entitled to
apply to the court for inclusion in the CDS program. However, it
is important to note that persons are disqualified whose primary
drug problem is alcohol or cannabis unless there is evidence of
other current substance use that is a contributing factor.
Informal referral and preassessment does occur and clients may
voluntarily engage with a treatment agency prior to a formal
referral by the court (CDS 1993). CDS policy requires only that a
person admit to substance use, not to an alleged offence, thus
the person can be formally engaged in treatment for an admitted
drug problem and maintain a not guilty plea throughout the legal
proceedings. </p>

<p> If formal referral does not occur, the CDS is not empowered
to oversee the defendant's drug treatment and no CDS reports can
be provided to the courts on the defendants progress (CDS 1993). </p>

<p> When formal referral to the CDS does occur, defendants are
informed of the relevant drug treatment agencies and their
philosophies, and must choose. They are then required to remain
with that agency unless otherwise instructed by the CDS officer.
Court appearances after formal referral are accompanied by
interim reports regarding progress, and at the point of plea or
of a finding of guilt the defendant is generally remanded for a
full pre-sentence report. The coercive nature of the CDS in
engaging drug dependent persons in treatment programs during
times of legal crisis is acknowledged, and it is emphasised to
potential clients that progress in treatment is only one aspect
taken into consideration by the sentencing judge or magistrate
(CDS 1993). </p>

<p> CDS personnel expressed the view that, whereas in the early
days of the program there were mostly self-referrals, now most
are court-generated. People have always had the option of
treatment but clearly the catalyst is often a legal charge. The
more familiar the courts become with the process the more it is
used, and it is regarded as being generally well accepted. </p>

<p> Pre-court or pre-sentence diversion? As long as personal
cannabis use/possession/cultivation remains illegal, the
fundamental problem exists of the involvement of police
discretion and variation in enforcement policies from one officer
to another and from one jurisdiction to another. Any contact
between the cannabis user and the police (at street level) or
between the user and the court has the potential for the
individual to have continuing involvement with the criminal
justice system. Police discretion at street level at the point of
arrest (or non-arrest) is inevitable. Police officers have the
discretion regarding whether or not to issue an expiation notice
(in jurisdictions such as South Australia) or (in jurisdictions
such as Victoria) to choose which (if any) of a number of
possible charges they will lay, which can vary from possession to
trafficking. </p>

<p> While this could work in the interests of the offender, it
may also act in a discriminatory fashion, which is why many would
make the argument in favour of diversion systems which bring all
offenders before the court, thus guaranteeing them due process.
Many lawyers tend to support leaving the conventional criminal
processing intact 'to ensure that the diversion program does not
result in more coercive treatment of offenders through the
non-judicial exercise of discretion' (Dept of Attorney General
1982, p78). In the case of expiation fines, it appears that many
fines are not being expiated.15 Therefore the objective of
relieving the burden on the courts, while achieved to a
substantial degree, has not yet been 100 per cent successful, and
there is room for improvement in terms of reducing the number of
non-expiators and consequently removing more offenders from the
criminal justice system. </p>

<h2>Diversion programs in other countries </h2>

<h3>UNITED STATES </h3>

<p> The most prominent drug diversion programs in the US are the
Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime (TASC) programs,
established primarily to try to reduce the crime associated with
drug use (mainly heroin). This national pre-trial diversion
program was expanded to include all drug users (except those
dependent on alcohol), including juveniles, recruited at all
points of entry to the criminal justice system (e.g. through
pre-sentence referral, conditional probation, police diversion
and conditional parole). The program varies with the different
legal systems and drug problems existing from State to State. For
instance, marijuana users and juveniles were excluded in
Colorado, whereas in Michigan marijuana users were preferred.
Overall, however, most programs concentrated on heroin users
([31]Dept of Attorney-General 1982, pp10-11). </p>

<p> Such programs were not particularly amenable to satisfactory
evaluation and usually were restricted to an examination of how
well program objectives had been met. The results indicated: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Dissatisfaction among law enforcement officials because
        of reduced opportunities for information from defendants
        regarding drug supplies (an example of the clash of
        philosophies between health authorities and law
        enforcement, which can be a factor contributing to
        failure in many diversion programs; this also indicates
        the emphasis on the supply reduction approach in the US,
        which is greater than that in Australia). </li>
    <li>Most of those diverted did not totally abstain from
        marijuana use although they reported reduced use (again
        this was not acceptable from the US total prohibition
        point of view, but a reduction in use can be seen as a
        successful program outcome in many treatment programs in
        Australia). </li>
    <li>There were fewer arrests and convictions (though
        marginally) among those diverted. </li>
    <li>There was some reduction in workload in the case of the
        prosecutor and the court but greatly increased workloads
        for the probation service. </li>
    <li>Purely from the treatment outcome point of view for the
        individual, the results were encouraging (though lack of
        adequate data precluded assessment of recidivism over the
        long term). Individuals' characteristics prior to program
        entry are an important determinant to successful program
        outcome (Rovner-Pieczenik cited in [32]Dept of
        Attorney-General 1982, p14). </li>
</ul>

<p> Criticisms of the program also include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The argument that the workloads of courts and prisons are
        not really reduced because people are being brought into
        the criminal justice process who would not have been
        processed at all, since they would have been handled in
        the community. </li>
    <li>Diversion programs are sometimes utilised by prosecutors
        and courts when less official procedures might accomplish
        the same objective with less intervention and use of
        court time. </li>
    <li>The court is saved time only if the accused would have
        gone to trial and then to jail. </li>
</ul>

<p> However diversion appears to be more an 'alternative to
dismissal of charges or probation than to incarceration'
(Gorelick 1975 cited in [33]Dept of Attorney General 1982, p16).
This view was also shared by the Canadian Law Reform Commission
(Dept of Attorney-General 1982). Further criticisms were: </p>

<ul>
    <li>That diversion might also come to carry with it a social
        stigma if it is an 'institutionalised element of the
        criminal justice system'. </li>
    <li>Unsuccessful participants may be disadvantaged when
        returned to the court system. </li>
    <li>Legal analysts are concerned about the exercise of
        judicial discretion by non-judicial bodies. </li>
    <li>Diversion could be seen as an expansion of social
        control, and the concept of 'need for treatment' has no
        inherent limitation ([34]Dept of Attorney-General 1982,
        pp16-17). </li>
</ul>

<p> All of the points made above are also valid for Australian
diversion schemes. A very recent form of pre-court intervention
(for the purpose of treatment) operating in the US is the Weekend
Intervention Program (WIP) which is reported to be 'highly
effective in identifying and intervening with persons charged
with alcohol- and other drug-related driving offences' (Siegal
&amp; Cole 1993). </p>

<p> The underlying philosophy of the program is that the crisis
nature of an encounter with the criminal justice system, if
successfully managed, provides a valuable opportunity to
intervene in an individual's life by identifying the clinical
needs of substance users who are not yet receiving treatment, and
in a non-punitive way 'gently' confronting participants with the
consequences of their own drug and alcohol use. The individual is
provided with a diagnostic assessment and treatment program
recommendation 'with a specificity unavailable through
traditional settings' ([35]Siegal &amp; Cole 1993, p133). The
program consists of a three-day residential program to which
persons involved in a drug or alcohol offence may be remanded by
a court or other supervising agency. It consists of 'Marathon
substance abuse counselling sessions using a
cognitive-behavioural-oriented approach combined with
presentations structured around a modified health belief model'.
This participation in the assessment and referral process itself
is regarded as being able to help prepare the substance user for
any treatment to be received ([36]Siegal &amp; Cole 1993,
pp133-4). </p>

<h3>NEW ZEALAND </h3>

<p> New Zealand has an adult pre-trial diversion scheme which
commenced operation in 1988. It was developed and is managed by
the New Zealand Police as part of a wider program which entails
an increasing emphasis on the use of discretion by police in
their handling of minor offenders. The scheme is not, at present,
statutorily based although the Government is considering this
option. </p>

<p> The scheme is widely accepted by police officers, members of
the judiciary and practising lawyers, as well as the offenders
who are offered pre-trial diversion. The New Zealand Police have
described the scheme in the following terms: The key steps in the
scheme are that the offender must be a first offender (there are
limited exceptions in special cases), there is sufficient
evidence to charge the offender, and information is then laid and
at that stage the offender is considered for diversion. If the
offender meets the criteria [see below] and admits the offence to
the diversion coordinator (a police prosecutor) the court is
asked to adjourn the case until the offender has completed the
requirements of the diversion scheme. Those requirements may
consist of paying money to a charity, doing community work,
and/or attending specialist counselling depending on what problem
they may have, e.g. drugs, alcohol, anger management, etc. Once
the requirements have been completed the police ask the court to
withdraw the information (personal communication, New Zealand
Police, 17 December 1993). If the court agrees to withdraw the
information, the offender is not convicted and the police destroy
the offender's records, including fingerprints. </p>

<p> The criteria for diversion are not rigid; they include the
following: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The offender should be a first offender. </li>
    <li>There should be special circumstances which make the
        offender suitable for diversion. </li>
    <li>The offence must be non-serious. </li>
    <li>The offender must admit guilt, show remorse, and be
        prepared to pay full reparation to the victim. </li>
    <li>The victim must agree to diversion. </li>
    <li>The officer in charge of the case [generally the
        arresting officer] must agree to diversion. </li>
    <li>The offender must agree to diversion ([37]Young &amp;
        Cameron 1991, pp9-10). </li>
</ol>

<p> The use of cannabis and the possession of small quantities
for personal use are considered to be minor offences, making an
offender eligible for consideration for diversion. (Clearly the
criterion relating to the consent of the victim is not relevant
in such cases.) Consultants reviewed the scheme for the New
Zealand Police in 1991. They reported that approximately 12 per
cent of the people dealt with through the diversionary process
had been charged with cannabis possession ([38]Young &amp;
Cameron 1991, pp41-6). The review indicated that the scheme was
generally very well received by all the parties involved and also
pointed to existing and potential difficulties and to ways in
which it could be strengthened. The police and the Government are
currently reviewing the scheme, considering the option of giving
it a legislative base and ensuring that it operates in a similar
manner throughout the country. This diversionary scheme, combined
with an actively implemented policy of cautioning minor offenders
whenever possible (rather than charging them), comprises an
enlightened approach to the handling of minor offenders such as
cannabis users. </p>

<h2>OTHER COUNTRIES </h2>

<p> An overview of international legislation relating to
diversion, in countries covered by the World Health Organization
([39]Porter, Arif &amp; Curran 1986), indicates that many
countries provide for diversion to drug- and alcohol-dependence
treatment programs both separately and in combination, the
covering legislation falling into a variety of categories (e.g.
mental health, public health, criminal or specialised treatment
laws).16 </p>

<p> The legal disposition of drug- or alcohol-dependent persons
is frequently covered by the criminal law (e.g. under specified
statutory offence) or mental health legislation. In Victoria, for
example, treatment programs for drug and alcohol dependence
include provision for both voluntary and involuntary admission,
while other provisions governing treatment may be found in road
traffic laws and the mental health legislation (Porter, Arif
&amp; Curran 1986, pp36-37). Porter et al. emphasise the
importance of treatment as a service to the public and the
individual concerned, which should be available at every stage of
the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> Initial contact between the offender and the police can be
very important, as it may create the kind of crisis that
motivates a person to undergo effective treatment, and the police
should be 'both legally entitled and encouraged to refer the
person directly to a treatment program, in lieu of arrest, for a
short time until the emergency passes'. They claim that there are
definite advantages in including treatment provisions in drug
control legislation because of the flexibility it gives to the
courts in imposing alternatives to penal sanctions ([40]Porter,
Arif &amp; Curran 1986, p116). </p>

<p> To summarise some relevant points raised by Porter et al's
overview of international diversion legislation: 1. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Cannabis is rarely named specifically in legislation
        relating to diversion for drug users who commit offences.
        Usually the legislation refers to 'narcotics', 'opiates',
        'alcohol' or 'other drugs'. Although cannabis is usually
        not specifically singled out (as distinct from alcohol,
        for example, which is mostly treated in a special class
        of its own with specialised treatment), it falls within
        the general class of substances for which many countries
        legislate compulsory reporting and/or registration
        followed by referral into a treatment program. 2. </li>
    <li>There are many precedents among overseas countries for
        diversion and voluntary or non-voluntary commitment to
        treatment. There are also examples of such diversion
        occurring at every stage of the criminal justice process.
        3. </li>
    <li>There is a clear lack of evaluation of programs, which
        means results cannot be quantified, but the general
        impression is one of diversion to treatment being more
        acceptable all round than imprisonment without
        rehabilitation, which would otherwise be the situation in
        countries with a total prohibition policy. 4. </li>
    <li>Civil commitment appears to be common internationally,
        but in Australia legislative provisions for civil
        commitment exist only in certain States, e.g. NSW and
        Victoria. (This is discussed further under the heading
        Compulsory Treatment for Drug Offenders: Criminal Justice
        System-Initiated Treatment and Civil Commitment.) 5. </li>
    <li>There are a wide variety of legislative approaches to
        treatment and many different routes. </li>
</ol>

<p> Among the problems raised are: 1. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The different objectives (sometimes conflicting) of
        health professionals and legal practitioners, when
        diversion for treatment is involved. 2. </li>
    <li>The clear need for evaluation programs and for planning
        for these when the program is established. The importance
        is stressed of evaluating treatment programs in terms of
        the objectives stated in the legislation. It is important
        to establish realistic and concrete objectives for
        treatment in addition to the overriding goal of reducing
        morbidity and mortality. 3. </li>
    <li>With regard to compulsory treatment, it is acknowledged
        that it is in conflict with individual liberty and
        freedom of decision, and it is emphasised that the
        legislation should lay down the conditions governing
        participation in voluntary treatment programs, e.g.
        should the 'voluntary' status be ended if the client is
        not cooperating? 4. </li>
    <li>On occasions there may be legislation that is not used or
        does not work because of lack of suitable treatment
        facilities and resources. </li>
</ol>

<p> Drug diversion schemes of various types operate in overseas
countries. In France, for example, an offender who complies with
a court-determined treatment order is not liable to prosecution;
in Germany, a period of treatment can be credited against a
custodial sentence; in Massachusetts, a court-appointed diversion
scheme operates to stay court proceedings ([41]Porter 1986,
p171). In some countries, e.g. France and Italy, a person
voluntarily undergoing treatment, on completion is issued with a
certificate as evidence to protect against subsequent prosecution
for offences committed prior to treatment ([42]Leroy 1991). Of
the 51 jurisdictions surveyed by the WHO, 22 diverted persons for
treatment at one or more of these stages in the criminal justice
process: (a) instead of arrest; (b) after arrest, pending trial;
(c) after trial in lieu of imprisonment (e.g. suspended
sentence); and (d) correction with imprisonment (e.g. during
confinement or as a condition of parole) (Porter, Arif &amp;
Curran 1986, p57). </p>

<p> A major issue for legislators is whether such diversion
should be mandatory. If diversion is mandatory prior to or
instead of trial, this amounts to decriminalisation of the
offending behaviour.17 In Sweden, which allows for compulsory
commitment, there is now legislation in place criminalising drug
use and widening the powers of the authorities to take adult
alcohol and drug-dependent people into care. Sweden is a country
with a strong temperance tradition which has led to 'an obsession
with substance misuse generally'. Faced with the problem of AIDS
and with economic difficulties, a 'new moralism' has developed in
this country leading to these harsher drug measures (Gould 1989,
p731). </p>

<p> Another approach to the handling of cannabis offenders is
that taken in the United Kingdom, where more than half of the
police constabulary areas have allowed police officers to take
note of drug users found in possession of quantities of drugs
consistent with personal use. Police then have the option not to
proceed with a legal charge unless the individual has been
cautioned on more than two occasions previously ([43]Wodak 1993).
</p>

<p> A recent example of a pre-court initiative involving an
attempt to bring drug users into contact with treatment is the
'Southwark Arrest Referral Pilot Program', funded by the British
Home Office Local Drug Prevention Team. This three-year pilot
program, commenced in March 1991, is being carried out to
establish the effectiveness of arrest as an intervention for drug
users wanting help. Police provide arrestees with information on
local drug referral agencies and cards are sent to all charged
offenders. Also, drug workers are on call to visit the relevant
police stations. Though referrals were not numerous, most of
those participating in referral programs reported reduced drug
use in the following 12-month period. </p>

<p> The flaw in the program to date is the lack of effort and
encouragement on the part of the police. However, it reflects an
attempt to bring into a closer working relationship police and
local welfare agencies in a harm reduction effort rather than
simply to exercise law enforcement against drug users
([44]Walters &amp; Coventry 1993, p12). Although the British
Criminal Justice Act was proclaimed in 1991 with specific
sections relating to the treatment of drug and alcohol dependent
offenders (Criminal Justice Act 1991, s69, schedule 1, cited in
Walters and Coventry 1993, p11) and allowing for referral and
assessment procedures as components of non-custodial orders, it
does not establish diversionary programs for drug offenders. </p>

<h3>Compulsory treatment for drug users </h3>

<p> <b>CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM-INITIATED DRUG TREATMENT AND CIVIL
COMMITMENT </b> </p>

<p> A number of literature reviews have concluded that treatment
can effectively reduce drug use as well as the criminal activity
which often accompanies it ([45]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990; Gerstein
1990; Office of Technology Assessment 1990 in Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p244). There is also increasing evidence that those coerced
into treatment by way of the criminal justice system achieve the
same success as those entering voluntarily (Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p244). </p>

<p> The issue for makers of social policy is how to increase the
number entering treatment, since 'the nature of drug use,
especially at abusive and addictive levels, often inhibits or
precludes self-motivation in the user toward voluntarily seeking
treatment' (Anglin &amp; Hser 1991, p247). </p>

<p> Many would say that 'when offenders, such as arrestees,
probationers, inmates or parolees, are identified as substance
abusers by the criminal justice system, remanding to treatment is
a necessary and logical action ... One of the most successful of
coercive efforts has been civil commitment' (Anglin &amp; Hser
1991, p247; see also discussion below of countries which employ
civil commitment). Carney, in his Drug Users and the Law in
Australia (1987), points out that, in Australia, civil commitment
policies for drug-dependent people date back to the 19th century,
and were based on the early view of drug use as a 'disease' for
which in-patient therapy should be compulsory (1987, p1). </p>

<p> As early as 1867, Victoria copied Scotland's move to amend
its lunacy laws to allow inebriates to be admitted to 'lunatic
asylums', and in 1872 passed the Victorian Inebriates Act, which
was the first comprehensive Inebriates Act to be enacted outside
America. The other Australian States followed, with legislation
in Tasmania in 1873, in South Australia in 1874, in Queensland in
1898, in New South Wales in 1900 and in Western Australia in 1903
(1987, p3). Much of the Australian State legislation has survived
to the present time. When Queensland was debating its legislation
in 1896, the subject of drugs other than alcohol, i.e. 'opium,
chloral and other drugs', came up for the first time (1987, p13).
Legislation providing for voluntary or compulsory civil admission
to treatment facilities of alcohol or drug-dependent people is in
force in most of the major Australian jurisdictions - but is not
much utilised. Carney (1987, pp52-53) outlines four approaches to
the regulation of entry to civil treatment schemes for dependent
drug users - the fourth 'applies the classic justifications for
the enactment of criminal law, namely that the actions of the
prospective patient constitutes an intolerable degree of harm to
other members of the community. Judicial commitment of offenders,
and some third party proceedings initiated by police officers,
fit this model' (1987, p53). </p>

<p> Moving to the United States, the origins of 'civil
commitment' for opiate-dependent (and also alcohol-dependent)
people date back to the second half of the 19th century when some
of the laws enacted to provide for the civil commitment of the
mentally ill also permitted civil commitment of people dependent
on narcotics ([46]Rosenthal 1988). In the United States civil
commitment generally takes the form, described by [47]Brown
(1988, p664), of the direct remanding of the individual to the
health care system in which civil procedures alone are brought
into play ... This administrative/judicial action need not
involve provision of legal counsel, the potential for judgment by
one's peers, access to witnesses for one's defense, etc. </p>

<p> With some exceptions (see Newman 1986, cited in [48]Brown
1988), diversion from the criminal justice system for drug
treatment seems to be acceptable to both health and criminal
justice authorities. However, in democratic countries, civil
commitment of the drug user conflicts with many people's views
regarding civil rights, the proper relationship of the individual
to the State and the use of the health care system for social
control. Regardless, legislation in a number of countries
provides for such civil commitment for drug use. [49]Porter et
al. (1986) point out that in 27 (comprising 32 separate
jurisdictions) of the countries they surveyed, there was
provision for civil commitment under certain conditions, as there
are in 35 American States. </p>

<p> It has been argued (Bejerot 1983 &amp; Webster 1986, cited in
Brown 1988) that such extreme measures to deal with drug use must
have wide public support. Generally the rationale for such action
is that drug use is a threat to the country's stability (as in
Singapore in the case of heroin dependence among young males) or
a threat to the country achieving its economic goals, e.g.
Malaysia, where the Government decided that the drug problem was
a threat to national security as the country was 'losing its
manpower to drugs' ([50]Rysavy 1990).18 </p>

<p> In 1983, due to an increasing heroin problem in Malaysia, the
powers of police and drug rehabilitation officers were extended,
allowing them to arrest and detain persons suspected of using
illegal substances. A positive urine sample resulted in mandatory
drug treatment. Ten per cent of those in treatment in 1989 were
undertaking rehabilitation for cannabis use only. All programs
were the same, lasting a maximum of two years with two years'
compulsory aftercare, an important part of which was the
assignment of a drug-free 'guardian' to act as a role model and
to provide positive support. Any infringement of rules during
treatment resulted in severe punishment, and any drug use after
release from treatment resulted in incarceration (Rysavy 1990).
Needless to say the program has a high success rate, but is
unlikely to fit other countries with cultures differing from that
of Malaysia. </p>

<p> Brown summarises the conditions that 'on the basis of other
societies' actions, have been described as necessary to the
implementation of civil commitment procedures: </p>

<ul>
    <li>there needs to be the appearance of risk to the larger
        society through the subgroup's (i.e. drug users')
        inappropriate behaviours; </li>
    <li>there needs to be the capacity to marshal public support
        for such action; </li>
    <li>there must be a capacity to identify and isolate the
        subgroup demonstrating the offending behaviour; </li>
    <li>the subgroup must be without sufficient political support
        to withstand the competing political pressure; </li>
    <li>there must be the machinery to process, detain and
        confine those whose behaviour is inappropriate or
        threatening; and </li>
    <li>there should be a belief in the ability of the community
        to put in place initiatives that will humanely change
        individuals' behaviour for their own and for the larger
        society's well-being ([51]Brown 1988, p676). </li>
</ul>

<p> Brown goes on to say that it is likely that jurisdictions
will retain the option to call upon civil commitment in the event
of a situation arising which has the capacity to 'disrupt the
normal course of society and for which criminal prosecution may
be seen as either inappropriate, unwarranted or infeasible'. At
the same time, only with the greatest conservatism will civil
commitment be likely to be employed, due to a general distaste
for such emergency measures ([52]Brown 1988). The contribution to
the spread of AIDS of intravenous drug use, and its repercussions
for individual drug users and the wider society, is potentially
one such situation. </p>

<p> Throughout the wide variety of countries providing for civil
commitment for drug use, there have been few studies of the
efficacy of such treatment ([53]Brown 1988). However, some
studies have been produced by the US and these are discussed
below. Generally, in the majority of countries, grounds for
commitment are provided either in mental health legislation or
specific drug legislation. Countries using mental health
legislation usually include provision for commitment for threats
both to others and to self. Germany, Japan and Somalia, for
example, provide for civil commitment if the drug-related
disorder 'constitutes an imminent threat to public safety, or
when individuals pose a danger to their own life and health'
([54]Brown 1988, p666). Bangladesh, on the other hand, specifies
only the existence of psychiatric disturbance without elaboration
of threat, and Trinidad and Tobago emphasise the individual's
inability to provide for himself (Brown 1988). Fifteen out of 43
countries surveyed by [55]Porter et al (1986) provide for civil
commitment under legislation specific to drug use, where the
criteria may be limited to evidence of dependence (as in Mexico,
Columbia, Peru, Thailand and Malaysia). Some (i.e. Argentina,
Italy, Australia and Sweden) also include reference to the threat
posed to others and/or to the need for treatment. In Victoria
(Australia) under the Alcoholics and Drug Dependent Persons Act
of 18 December 1968, an alcohol- or drug-dependent person
'suitable for treatment' (i.e. 'who habitually uses drugs of
addiction to such an extent that he has lost the power of
self-control with respect to the use of drugs of addiction'
(Porter et al 1986, p126), may be committed for seven days and,
at the discretion of the medical officer in charge of the
assessment centre (the decision-making authority), for another
seven days. </p>

<p> A consensus statement issued by the participants at a meeting
in the US to examine research findings relating to civil
commitment and mandatory treatment, particularly in relation to
hindering the spread of AIDS, found that 'treatment is effective
in reducing intravenous drug abuse and that the length of time in
treatment is positively related to treatment success, the
criminal justice system is important for identification and
retention of drug abusers in treatment' ([56]Leukefeld &amp; Tims
1988). It was further recommended at this meeting that 'the term
&quot;compulsory treatment&quot; be used rather than &quot;civil
commitment&quot; to capture a wider range of possible
interventions, since civil commitment is only one type of
compulsory treatment. Further, it is essential that candidates
for compulsory treatment receive appropriate legal protections.'
In the US, despite interest in the early 1970s due to 'high rates
of recidivism and criminal justice system over-crowding and the
shift away from a rehabilitative philosophy in corrections,
programs for drug-abusing offenders have languished in the 1980s
until fairly recently' ([57]Anglin and Hser 1990, p424). </p>

<p> However, the 1960s saw the beginning of civil commitment for
drug-abusing offenders in some States of the US. These were based
on the therapeutic community philosophy. There are few
evaluations of treatment for offenders except for these civil
commitment programs, and such programs as have been developed are
so recent that they have not been evaluated. </p>

<h4>CIVIL COMMITMENT IN THE US </h4>

<p> Compulsory treatment of drug users has been a controversial
issue worldwide for decades. In response to two forces, one aimed
at more effective treatment of problem drug users and the other
at social control of the problem user, civil commitment
legislation was enacted in the US in the 1960s and 1970s
([58]Rosenthal 1988). </p>

<p> Following this, three major treatment programs were
established: the California Civil Addict Program, the New York
Civil Commitment Program and programs under the federal Narcotic
Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA) ([59]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990,
p425), enabling large-scale commitment of drug-dependent people.
However, relatively few persons were committed under the
Massachusetts law, one of the earliest in the country, and
despite civil commitment laws in many other jurisdictions they
remained only statutes on the books (Rosenthal 1988). </p>

<p> Since involuntary civil commitment involves a substantial
deprivation of liberty, various aspects of the California and New
York programs were challenged quite early - the federal program
for involuntary civil commitment of drug users not charged with a
crime was not challenged in this way, presumably because the
federal program permitted only relatives to initiate commitment,
and few relatives did. Despite challenges to the
constitutionality of involuntary treatment, the Californian and
New York courts held in its favour. They were, however,
influenced by the Supreme Court case of Robinson v. California
which did not really involve the constitutionality of involuntary
commitment at all but rather the question of whether it was
constitutional for a State to make 'addiction' a crime:
'Nevertheless, the Supreme Court declared (in a dictum) that a
State might establish a program of compulsory treatment for
opiate addicts either to discourage violation of its criminal
laws against narcotic trafficking or to safeguard the general
health or welfare of its inhabitants' ([60]Rosenthal 1988, p641).
</p>

<p> It has been suggested that because this case did not involve
the constitutionality of involuntary treatment of opiate users,
the Supreme Court did not go into that question as deeply as it
might have and, in turn, the California and New York courts
relied too much on the Supreme Court dictum without delving
deeply enough into the question. The Supreme Court decision
therefore meant almost inevitably that in future cases the
substantive validity of involuntary civil commitment would be
upheld (Rosenthal 1988, p643). </p>

<p> Under the legislation discussed here anyone found in a
medical examination to be dependent on drugs (usually heroin)
could be committed. Mostly those committed had been arrested for
property crimes or drug trafficking and were diverted from the
usual criminal processing. Usually there were two phases of
treatment, initially one of imprisonment, plus a period of parole
or monitored community release. During both phases the goal was
reduced drug use and criminal behaviour; vocational training was
sometimes added. </p>

<p> The California Civil Addict Program was more successful than
the New York State program, primarily due to better management.
The main results of evaluations were that program participants
reduced 'narcotic use and associated property crime' to one-third
compared with those not in the program ([61]Lindblad 1988).
Overall, studies of the California CAP concluded that civil
commitment and other drug treatment programs, particularly
methadone maintenance, were effective in reducing narcotics
dependence and minimising the associated adverse social effects,
the important issue being that the dependence should be brought
into an environment where intervention can occur over time. </p>

<p> In this respect, civil commitment and other legally coercive
measures were found to be useful where the dependent person would
not enter treatment voluntarily ([62]Anglin 1988a). A vital issue
is the implementation strategy employed, which can 'ensure or
sabotage success' (Anglin 1988a, p539). Although NARA was a
comparatively short-lived program superseded by other
legislation, it provided a national network of treatment
providers and was regarded as an effective way of bringing
narcotic dependent people into treatment. NARA allowed treatment
for offenders as a pre-trial civil commitment, rather than
prosecution for drug-dependent people convicted of a specific
crime and for voluntary applicants. Those admitted to the program
did as well or better than those in other programs (Lindblad
1988). </p>

<h4>TASC PROGRAMS IN THE US </h4>

<p> More recently in the US, coordinated programs have been
developed in a number of States to refer 'drug-abusing offenders
to community-based treatment in lieu of prosecution or probation
revocation', e.g. the Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime
(TASC) program ([63]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p428), begun in 1972
and by 1988 operating in 18 States (Cook et al. 1988 in Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p428). This provides community-based treatment
for drug-dependent offenders who 'otherwise might become
progressively more involved with the criminal justice system'
(p428). Diversionary dispositions such as deferred prosecution,
creative community sentencing, and pretrial intervention are used
to motivate offenders to enter and remain in treatment.
Evaluation Such limited evaluation as has taken place (through
the Treatment Outcomes Prospective Study) indicates that criminal
justice referred clients, because they were monitored, tended to
stay in treatment longer than voluntary clients, which is usually
associated with more successful treatment outcomes ([64]Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p429). </p>

<p> Although evaluations of treatment are positive, it remains a
question as to whether improvements would have occurred over time
anyway due to maturation or other outside influences. In terms of
client characteristics and treatment effectiveness, it was found
that 'addicts who have a more stable family background, an intact
marriage, a job, a history of minimal criminality, less evidence
of alcohol or polydrug abuse, and less severe psychiatric
disorders are more likely to achieve a better outcome in most
programs' (Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p429). </p>

<p> Many studies have shown that, while older clients, mostly
opiate users, tend to stay in treatment longer and therefore
benefit most (possibly due to the 'maturing out' effect noted by
Winick (1962 in Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p435), those under 25
tend to leave treatment prematurely, thus limiting their
prospects for effective results. In terms of program factors
which appeared to be most beneficial, the significant ones were:
psychotherapy, urine testing, and legal coercion. 'Clients
referred from the criminal justice system have been shown to stay
in treatment longer than other clients' (Collins et al., cited in
[65]Leukefeld &amp; Timms 1988, p57) and longer retention
suggests better treatment outcomes than with other clients (but
see above). </p>

<p> Some argue that treatment cannot be effective if the client
is coerced, and the findings are not consistent on this issue.
However, the best-designed studies 'generally support the
proposition that a collaborative relationship between the
criminal justice system and community-treatment delivery systems
produces, at an aggregate level, enhanced treatment outcomes'
([66]Anglin &amp; Hser 1990, p439). While length of retention in
treatment is an important predictor of success it appears that
'for many drug abusers, repeated exposure to treatment is more
effective than one episode' (McLellan &amp; Druley 1977 in Anglin
&amp; Hser 1990, p441). </p>

<p> Total time in treatment may be more important, when accrued
across treatment episodes, than retention in a single program
(p441). In a number of other countries, any illegal drug use
including that of cannabis is sufficient grounds for recommending
or ordering treatment, implying that some other countries regard
cannabis use more seriously than Australia does, and deserving of
treatment. The mode of treatment depends on the profile of the
individual user and on such factors as are mentioned elsewhere in
this report, e.g. whether the person is a polydrug user, length
of time of use, degree of psychopathology and so forth.
Outpatient non-methadone programs which involve clients with all
types of drug use who tend not to have serious criminal
histories, are the most obvious option for treatment of cannabis
dependence. Therapeutic communities are not necessarily specific
to any class of drug and could also therefore potentially be of
benefit to certain cannabis-dependent persons. </p>

<p> Since the numbers of cannabis users who have problems is
still small and very few are likely to be seriously enough
dependent to be referred by the court, it is unlikely that
treatment facilities could not incorporate them. </p>

<h2>Summary of findings </h2>

<p> A summary of findings from Australian and international
literature concerned with diversion and treatment for drug
offenders suggests the following conclusions with relation to
cannabis users: </p>

<ul>
    <li>While the vast majority of cannabis users do not report
        any problems, there are increasing reports of individuals
        both in Australia and in other countries (e.g. the United
        States and New Zealand) who are seeking treatment for
        cannabis dependence. </li>
    <li>It is generally accepted that a prison sentence is
        unsatisfactory for offenders with drug problems, and
        diversion with the purpose of treatment is a widely used
        alternative, welcomed by judges and magistrates. Usually
        the illegal drug involved is heroin but occasionally
        cannabis is the offender's primary drug. </li>
    <li>Criminal justice involvement is seen as providing an
        opportunity to intervene in drug users' lives in order to
        confront the users with their drug problems and to bring
        them into contact with treatment agencies, often for the
        first time. </li>
    <li>The earlier the intervention in the users' lives the
        better, and the longer (or more frequent) the periods of
        treatment, the more successful the treatment outcome. </li>
    <li>In some cases merely attending for assessment is
        sufficient to bring about a change in attitude since the
        users are often confronted with their drug problem for
        the first time. </li>
    <li>While some dispute the value of coercion in getting drug
        users into treatment, it is often the only way, and there
        is more evidence to indicate successful treatment results
        for involuntary than for voluntary clients. This is
        primarily due to the length of time spent in treatment.
        Frequently the attitude of an unwilling client will
        change quite quickly once treatment has begun. </li>
    <li>The success of diversion to treatment programs depends on
        the skill and experience of the drug counsellor, the
        availability of sufficient places in suitable treatment
        facilities, and close cooperation between health and
        criminal justice agencies. </li>
    <li>It would be more cost effective to provide additional
        funds for the training of counsellors and the provision
        of suitable facilities than to continue to send repeat
        drug offenders to prison. </li>
    <li>Conclusions regarding treatment for cannabis offenders,
        particularly repeat offenders, are as follows: </li>
    <li>There are reports from most diversion programs/treatment
        agencies of individuals being referred for other drug use
        who also have serious problems in reducing or ceasing
        their cannabis use. Some of these may also be
        alcohol-dependent. There appears then to be some demand
        for cannabis treatment in this country. </li>
    <li>Interpreting treatment in its broadest and most ideal
        sense (i.e. as a program personally selected by the
        client in consultation with a counsellor, tailored to the
        needs and characteristics of the particular individual),
        for a repeat offender facing a prison sentence, treatment
        is a preferable alternative. Treatment appears to have
        the potential to help offenders restructure their lives
        in such a way as to avoid breaches of the law which bring
        them continually into contact with the criminal justice
        system. In the sense that treatment may be 'compulsory'
        (i.e. court mandated), while the client must be assessed
        as suitable for treatment (genuinely motivated to
        participate, although there may be some initial
        resistance), the advantage of the compulsory nature of
        the treatment is that it provides the 'crisis' generally
        acknowledged as necessary to get most drug users into
        treatment and to keep them there long enough for a
        successful outcome. In the case of cannabis use, the
        earlier the intervention the better, since there is
        likely to be less criminal involvement and therefore more
        likelihood of a successful outcome for the client. Young
        users, particularly juveniles, should receive more
        attention than they appear to be getting at present in
        Australia from, for instance, juvenile 'panels' (such as
        those in South Australia) for whom this is not a major
        focus. </li>
    <li>A final consideration regarding the treatment option for
        cannabis users is the availability of treatment programs
        and facilities and counsellors of sufficient quality and
        in sufficient numbers to accommodate those referred from
        the court system, since this is vital for successful
        treatment outcomes. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> In this chapter we have discussed the two related fields of
diversion and treatment for drug offenders. We believe that few
people would disagree with the wisdom of diversion from the
criminal justice system for minor cannabis offenders. Further,
though some would object that treatment of drug offenders is a
form of social control and that the concept of the 'need for
treatment' has no inherent limitation, the evidence suggests
that, although methodological problems exist in the evaluation of
treatment programs, most of the programs outlined here have
achieved a certain level of success in terms of meeting their
objectives - which generally means, in the Australian context,
reducing the drug use, and associated involvement with the
criminal justice system, of the individual undergoing treatment. </p>

<p> Disagreement arises regarding the degree of intervention
which should be exercised by the criminal justice system, as an
agent of the State, in coercing drug offenders into treatment -
in its most extreme form, through civil commitment. While the
United States, for example, indicates considerable support for
civil commitment, in Australia, although commitment exists as a
legislative option, there has been reluctance to use it. This
decision with respect to the balance between protecting society
and infringing the rights of individuals is a matter for the
particular society involved and the prevailing mores at the time.

<h1>Chapter 6: EVALUATING NEW LEGISLATIVE APPROACHES TO CANNABIS </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The principle of evaluating new policy and legislation is
widely accepted, but is less frequently observed in practice. In
Australia and most Western nations, little has been done,
especially by government agencies, to monitor and evaluate, in a
systematic manner, their national drug policies. This is the case
in instances where legislation has developed incrementally (as in
most of Australia's States and Territories) and where new
approaches have been implemented following detailed policy
reviews (e.g. the Australian Capital Territory's cannabis
expiation notice initiative). Too often evaluation is considered
relevant only after a policy has been in place for some time and
changes are being considered. </p>

<p> To be of most value, new initiatives should be designed and
implemented with an explicit and adequately resourced monitoring
and evaluation component built into the initiative from the
outset. In the context of evaluating new legislative approaches
to cannabis, we suggest that policy evaluation and program
evaluation be considered separately. The bulk of this paper has
addressed the evaluation of policies, as reflected through
legislative options. The details of evaluating the implementation
of policies, focusing on the programs themselves, are matters
which need to be addressed after the broad policy issues are
settled and particular new approaches are agreed upon. </p>

<p> We provide below an overview of the steps involved in both
evaluative tasks. The National Drug Strategic Plan 1993-97
(Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy 1993) provides the
framework within which we base our recommendations relating to
monitoring and evaluation. The Plan is explicitly goal-attainment
focused, the approach that we argued for in [1]<a
href="can_ch2.html">Chapter 2</a>, where we highlighted the
importance of clarity in the specification of the goals of drug
policy, legislation and program implementation. The Plan provides
an overarching goal (or 'mission') for Australian drug policy:
'The overall mission of the National Drug Strategy is to minimise
the harmful effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society'
(MCDS 1993, p6). </p>

<p> Policies and programs in specific areas, including cannabis,
should be evaluated in a manner consistent with this national
goal. Applying goal attainment models of evaluation is a more
complex task than it sometimes seems to be initially. Substantial
technical difficulties exist in both designing and conducting
evaluation research; part of this is the often complex task of
identifying policy and program goals. </p>

<p> Our discussion in [2]<a href="can_ch2.html">Chapter 2</a>
referred to the fact that, in practice, a particular cannabis
policy can relate to goals which are inconsistent: the attainment
of one may militate against the attainment of another. Needs
change over time; often policy and legislation are far behind.
For a given policy, it is likely that a hierarchy of goals will
exist: the mission statement of the National Drug Strategic Plan
is an overarching goal, one which must be articulated in terms
which encompass other goals such as those concerned specifically
with cannabis. Policy evaluation and decision-making </p>

<p> In [3]<a href="can_ch4.html">Chapter 4</a> we outlined five
broad policy and legislative options for cannabis in Australia.
The approach taken there is a contribution to policy evaluation
in this area, and, by extension, a contribution to
decision-making. But how are decisions about drug policy to be
made? </p>

<p> One approach is the making of ad hoc decisions. This must be
rejected in favour of more systematic policy choice models. The
literature differentiates two groups of decision-making models
for use by governments: 'rational' and 'incremental' approaches
(see, e.g. Corbett 1992, pp59-76; Davis et al.1993, pp157-81).
The rational approach, illustrated below, is something of an
ideal. It is not always easy to implement in practice, but the
alternative (making decisions incrementally without ever
reconsidering the overall needs and patterns of policy responses)
is much less attractive. Applying a rational approach to
decision-making in evaluating new legislative approaches to
cannabis use (as different from evaluating the actual
implementation of new legislation and resulting programs), we
suggest that the following issues be taken into account: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The need to examine the sources of the proposal and the
        context within which it has been presented. </li>
    <li>The need to clarify just why that approach (rather than a
        different one) is proposed. </li>
    <li>The need to identify the goals which the new approach, if
        implemented, would attain. The philosophical and
        pragmatic goals should both be specified. Multiple goals
        may be identified and inconsistencies between them made
        explicit. </li>
    <li>The need to assess the likely impacts on key
        stakeholders, if the approach were to be implemented. For
        each key stakeholder, assess the likely costs and
        benefits, both intended and unintended. </li>
    <li>The need to review the depth, breadth, relevance and
        quality of the data currently available to assist the
        evaluation of the proposed approach. Determine whether or
        not it is, in fact, feasible to reach a conclusion on the
        value of the proposed policy, given the availability of
        data to answer questions about the proposal's likely
        outcomes and impacts. </li>
    <li>The need to make judgments regarding: (a) the value of
        the goal or goals; (b) how achievable the goals are; and
        (c) if the goals are judged to be achievable, how
        effective, efficient and appropriate are the
        implementation programs. </li>
</ol>

<p> This systematic approach to policy evaluation is not often
seen in the development of drugs policy. Nevertheless, in the
area of legislative options for cannabis in Australia, policy
makers have the capacity to apply such a process. This should be
undertaken as part of the National Drug Strategic Plan's project
to develop a national statement on cannabis, one which includes a
contemporary perspective on the most appropriate legislative
option or options for cannabis. Program evaluation It is beyond
the scope of this report to present details on the techniques of
program evaluation. These are to be found in standard textbooks
(Brinkerhoff et al. 1983; Hawe et al. 1991; Guba &amp; Lincoln
1989; Morris 1987; Patton 1990; Rossi &amp; Freeman 1989). </p>

<p> One point to be made, however, is that the evaluation
research model and techniques employed should be selected on the
basis of answering a precisely defined evaluation question. If
the evaluation question is, for example, 'What has been the
impact on policing of a new legislative approach to cannabis',
quite different evaluation techniques will be used from a
situation where the evaluation question is 'How cost-effective
has the new approach been', or 'How relevant is current
legislation to contemporary needs?'. No single approach covers
all circumstances. </p>

<p> Again, the National Drug Strategic Plan emphasises the
importance of monitoring and evaluation. Under the heading
'Policy Approach', it states: The National Drug Strategic Plan
explicitly identifies policy objectives and indicators to enable
the effectiveness of the program to be evaluated. The National
Drug Strategic Plan is committed to the application of
needs-based planning and evaluation activities to ensure the
effectiveness and efficiency of strategies employed to minimise
drug-related harm (MCDS 1993, p5). We commend those responsible
for this emphasis, but note that this policy cannot be
implemented without the allocation of a significant level of
resources. The oft-stated policy that evaluation should be an
integral part of all drug-related programs can only be realised
if program budgets include sufficient funds to cover the design
and conduct of monitoring and evaluation, and if reporting time
frames are appropriate to the evaluation model being employed.
Indicators A related strength of the National Drug Strategic Plan
which is highly relevant to the present review is its focus on
indicators of program implementation, short-term outcomes and
longer-term and broader impacts. The indicators selected for this
purpose will depend on the particular initiative being evaluated;
accordingly, they cannot be comprehensively described here.
Within Australia, the work of Sarre, Sutton and Pulsford (1989)
and of Christie (1991) in evaluating the South Australian
cannabis expiation notice scheme, and of the Queensland Criminal
Justice Commission's Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs (1993)
are examples of the effective use of indicators in the monitoring
and evaluation of cannabis legislation. Single's (1989) review of
the USA experience of marijuana 'decriminalisation' demonstrates
the dearth of information available in that country to evaluate
the legislative changes initiated over the last 20 years.
Elsewhere in this paper we have referred to such evaluation data
as are available relating to other nations. Without seeking to be
exhaustive, we list here some examples of indicators which are
significant inputs to policy and program evaluation relating to
new legislative initiatives concerned with cannabis: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The impact on social justice in Australian society of the
        implementation of cannabis legislation. </li>
    <li>Costs of cannabis controls, including the transfer of
        resources. </li>
    <li>The effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of
        policies and legislation. </li>
    <li>Public opinion concerning cannabis. </li>
    <li>Cannabis consumption patterns and levels. </li>
    <li>Numbers and characteristics of the people presenting to
        treatment agencies with cannabis-related health and
        social problems. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related offences. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related driving and motor vehicle crashes. </li>
    <li>THC levels of the cannabis available to consumers. </li>
    <li>Cannabis-related workplace accidents. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> In this section we have discussed the evaluation of new
legislative approaches to cannabis use in Australia. We have
differentiated between policy evaluation and program evaluation,
and have pointed to the need to develop indicators, tied to
specific initiatives, of activities, outcomes and impacts.
Undertaking high quality, systematic policy evaluation concerning
cannabis is essential and this paper contributes to that process.
Research aimed at developing evaluation techniques and program
indicators will be needed as part of the development and
implementation of new legislative approaches in this area. </p>

<h1>Chapter 7. Conclusion </h1>

<h1><img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</h1>

<p> This paper has addressed the legislative options available
for cannabis in Australia, and has argued that choosing from
among these options requires a process of policy evaluation.
Accordingly, the paper first considered the policy frameworks
within which decision-making occurs, emphasising the necessity
for clarity in the goals that society seeks to attain through
legislating in this area. </p>

<p> The paper places contemporary Australian cannabis legislation
within its broader context: historical and international. Despite
the work of numerous Royal Commissions and other official
inquiries, much of Australia's legislation concerning cannabis
reflects the dynamics of earlier times, when Australia tended to
mimic other nations' policies without taking sufficient account
of local circumstances. Our framework of legislative prohibition
was put in place at a time when there was virtually no cannabis
use in Australia. In the 1990s, when over four million
Australians report having used the drug and nearly half of them
report having done so during the last year, most jurisdictions
maintain total prohibition as their legislative stance, even
though only a tiny proportion of the offenders against their
legislation will ever be prosecuted. </p>

<p> We have reviewed the range of legislative options available,
classifying them as: total prohibition; prohibition combined with
a civil penalty for personal use, etc; partial prohibition
whereby personal use, etc., is not an offence, but trafficking
and large-scale growing of cannabis remains prohibited; the legal
availability of cannabis under various forms of regulation; and,
finally, the option of unregulated, free availability. Each of
these options is reviewed in terms of its rationale, experiences
with it to date and its impacts. </p>

<p> The related topics of the diversion from the criminal justice
system of people who come to the attention of the police for
cannabis offences, and the compulsory treatment of cannabis
users, have also been discussed. Experience to date suggests that
well-resourced and managed diversionary programs can be
effective, and desirable, alternatives to imprisonment for some
offenders. Very few cannabis users will need treatment, as
conceived of through a medical model, simply because of their
cannabis use. Many users can benefit, however, from a helping
intervention, the success of which may be potentiated by the
crisis of a 'bust' for cannabis use or related offences. </p>

<p> Cannabis is used mainly as a recreational drug and this
pattern of use has been the focus of this paper. For
completeness, we have included in the appendixes information on
the medical and industrial/agricultural uses of the cannabis
plant and its by-products. In doing so, we remind readers that,
in drug policies, we are not faced with 'all-or-nothing' choices.
Within the range of available policy options lies the possibility
of prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis while permitting
its use for other purposes. (This occurs, of course, with
opiates: the opium poppy is grown in Tasmania to provide raw
material for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.) </p>

<p> Australia's National Drug Strategy provides a policy
framework within which new legislative approaches may be
developed. Both existing and new approaches have the possibility
of both enhancing and detracting from the achievement of the
mission of the National Drug Strategy, that of minimising the
harmful effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society. Our
review of the policy options, set out in <a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter
4</a>, demonstrates this. </p>

<p> No single 'best option' for cannabis legislation exists. What
is most appropriate will depend upon what goals both policy
makers and the community are seeking to achieve. It is not the
role of researchers to dictate policy goals; rather we have drawn
attention to their importance, outlined an approach to evaluating
them and described the likely outcomes, in terms of policy goals,
of the five broad categories of legislative options which are
available now. </p>

<p> Our review suggests that two of the five legislative options
discussed in <a href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4</a> are
inappropriate in contemporary Australian circumstances. They are
the options which we have characterised as 'total prohibition'
and 'free availability'. The arguments for rejecting these
options will not be repeated here as they are detailed in <a
href="can_ch4.htm">Chapter 4</a>. </p>

<p> We point out, however, that the cultivation, possession and
supply of cannabis remain an offence in all Australian States and
Territories (and using it is an offence in most), even though
cannabis use is commonplace and little evidence exists that
cannabis itself causes significant harm when used in small
quantities. Australian society experiences more harm, we
conclude, from maintaining the prohibition policy than it
experiences from the use of the drug. </p>

<p> Widespread interest exists in the Dutch approach to drug
policies. We have categorised them, in this paper, under the
heading of total prohibition, as that is the Dutch legislative
position. However, as detailed above, the application of the
principle that it is, in their terms, 'inexpedient' to prosecute
people for minor drug offences (including selling cannabis in
certain coffee shops) means that Dutch policy and practice (as
contrasted to legislation) is closer to the regulatory option
than the total prohibition option. The regulatory option is one
of the approaches which we suggest is more appropriate to
Australian circumstances than is total prohibition. </p>

<p> It could be argued that the Dutch approach is a product of a
different culture and system of administration of criminal
justice. If the Australian States and Territories resolve not to
arrest and proceed against people using, possessing or supplying
cannabis, by far the best approach is for this policy to be
implemented through legislation, rather than through an
administrative decision not to prosecute cannabis offenders. This
is because the Australian system of legal justice is based upon
the principle of legal clarity and consistency in the
implementation of the law. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the reality is that, for a variety of reasons,
Australian governments may well prefer to implement the Dutch
approach. A number of precedents exist whereby, especially in
areas of moral contention, certain illegal activities, as a
matter of policy, are excluded from the purview of the criminal
justice authorities. In the Australian Capital Territory, for
example, we understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions
publicly announced that he would not conduct any prosecutions in
the area of prostitution. Abortion and certain types of gambling
(e.g. playing two-up on ANZAC Day) are or were similarly dealt
with. Police general orders frequently remind officers of the
desirability of exercising their discretion not to arrest or
summons a person found committing only a minor offence. Warnings,
formal cautions and referral to other agencies are encouraged
despite the existence of legislation prohibiting the behaviour
involved. </p>

<p> We suggest, then, that if governments agree that total
prohibition is not the most desirable approach, but are unwilling
or unable to legislate to enable a more preferable option to be
implemented, then the Dutch approach is a desirable alternative.
It would entail the government, the State/Territory Director of
Public Prosecutions, or another appropriate authority declaring
that, as from a certain date, no person would be prosecuted
before the courts for specified (minor) cannabis offences. We
suggest that this is a legitimate, but not optimal, pragmatic
option currently available to Australian governments. </p>

<p> We also reject the legislative option found at the opposite
end of the continuum from total prohibition, the totally
unregulated, free availability of cannabis. Our society is one
which accepts that governments and others have both the right and
the responsibility to intervene in diverse ways to protect people
from harm and to advance the common good. It would be
unreasonable, we suggest, to argue that cannabis should be
available in an uncontrolled manner: issues of quality control,
protection of the young, road safety, etc., demand at least some
degree of control over the drug's availability. </p>

<p> We conclude, then, that cannabis law reform is required in
this country. Numerous options for policy, legislation and
implementation processes exist within the broad categories of
prohibition with civil penalties, partial prohibition and
relatively free but regulated availability. We believe, on the
basis of the available evidence, that widely acceptable social
goals, well attuned to the needs of contemporary Australian
society, will be attained through the adoption and implementation
of policies which lie within these options. </p>

<h1>THE MEDICINAL USE OF CANNABIS (19) </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The medicinal use of cannabis in the ancient world has been
well documented (Abel 1980). In the United States, cannabis was
first mentioned as a medicinal drug in 1843 and by 1852 it was
included in the US dispensatory list of medicines. It was thought
to be beneficial in the treatment of 'neuralgia, gout, tetanus,
hydrophobia, cholera, convulsions, chorea, hysteria, depression
and insanity' (Wood &amp; Bache 1854, cited in [1]Abel 1980,
p182). In Australia, tincture of cannabis was used in medicine
until the 1960s, when it was declared a prohibited drug
([2]Cartwright 1983). </p>

<p>Since the introduction of legislation prohibiting the
recreational use of cannabis, its use for medicinal purposes has,
in most Western countries, not been popular. However, recently
the therapeutic benefits of cannabis have received close
attention in the United States. In 1991, Doblin and Kleiman
conducted an anonymous survey of the members of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology measuring the attitudes and
experiences of American oncologists concerning the use of
cannabis to treat nausea in cancer chemotherapy patients. They
found that, of those oncologists who replied to the survey (43
per cent), more than 44 per cent of them reported recommending
the illegal use of cannabis for the control of nausea to at least
one cancer patient. Some 48 per cent said that they would
prescribe cannabis to some of their patients if it were legal
([3]Doblin &amp; Kleiman 1991). </p>

<p>Cannabis has been used as an anti-emetic in the treatment of
AIDS patients and as a painkiller for those suffering from
chronic pain ([4]Grinspoon 1991). It has also been regarded by
some medical practitioners as being effective in reducing
intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma patients ([5]Caswell 1992) and
in treating epilepsy ([6]Cartwright 1983), Huntington's chorea
([7]Moss et al. 1989) and Parkinsonian tremor ([8]Frankel et al.
1990). </p>

<p>Despite the attention that the medical use of cannabis has
received in recent times, legislation in the United States does
not permit the medical use of marijuana. In the Federal
Controlled Substances Act, cannabis is categorised as a Schedule
1 drug, and as such is described as having a high potential for
abuse, no currently accepted medical use and no acceptable safe
level of use under medical supervision. </p>

<p>In 1989, organisations such as the (US) National Organization
for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), the Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics (ACT) as well as various individuals,20 applied to
have cannabis rescheduled so that it could be used for medical
purposes. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration rejected these claims and stated that: </p>

<p>It is clear that cannabis cannot meet the criteria ... for
safety under medical supervision. The chemistry of cannabis is
not known and reproducible. The record supports a finding that
marijuana plant material is variable from plant to plant. The
quantities of the active constituents, the cannabinoids, vary
considerably. In addition, the actions and potential risks of
several of the cannabinoids have not been studied ... (US
Government, Federal Register, vol. 54, no. 249, 29 December 1989,
p53,734). </p>

<p>This position has recently been restated by Robert C. Bonner,
a later Administrator of the US Drug Enforcement Agency, when he
responded to a subsequent petition lodged by NORML (US
Government, Federal Register, vol. 57, no. 59, 26 March 1992,
pp10,499-10,508). </p>

<p>Those in favour of rescheduling the drug argue that, for some,
the denial of cannabis as a medicine is particularly cruel.
Grinspoon argues that 'sick people are forced to suffer anxiety
about prosecution in addition to their anxiety about the illness
... Doctors are afraid to recommend what they know to be the best
treatment because they might lose their reputation or even their
licence' ([9]Grinspoon 1991). </p>

<p>The Australian medical community has not been as enthusiastic
about the therapeutic benefits of cannabis although many argue
that where the drug has been demonstrated to be effective its use
should be permitted. A study done at the Royal Children's
Hospital in Melbourne found that THC (the psychoactive ingredient
in cannabis) was an effective anti-emetic for some children
undergoing chemotherapy ([10]Cartwright 1983). Dr Lorna
Cartwright, a lecturer in Pharmacology at Sydney University
stated: </p>

<p>I think there are probably better drugs for medical uses. The
point is, though, I think it should be allowed to be used for
conditions in which it has been shown to have effect, such as for
glaucoma, for children having chemotherapy and for epilepsy. I
always feel that if something is good even for a small percentage
of patients, it should be allowed to be used (cited in
[11]Caswell 1992, p498). <br>
</p>

<p>Another pharmacologist, Dr Greg Chesher, argues that cannabis
clearly has therapeutic benefits but that research into the
possible uses of the drug is being hampered by the fact that
cannabis is a prohibited drug (cited in [12]Caswell 1992). The
position in Australia is different from that in the USA in that
in this country there is no legislation or binding administrative
ruling specifically stating that no medical use exists for
cannabis.21 Neither does the United Nations Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs, to which Australia is a party, specifically
forbid the medical use of cannabis. In fact the Convention
recognises that some otherwise illicit drugs may have medical
purposes and states that cannabis use should be 'subject to the
provisions of this Convention, to limit exclusively to medical
and scientific purposes the...use and possession of drugs'
(Article 4(1) (c)). Given that the United Nations Conventions do
not specifically proscribe the medical uses of cannabis,
introducing legislation that allowed the use of the drug for
medical purposes in Australia would be relatively simple. Clauses
authorising the therapeutic use of the drug could simply be
inserted into relevant drug legislation and therapeutic products
scheduling. Politically, however, such a change in policy could
be difficult. </p>

<p>As an illicit drug, cannabis has a negative image and is seen
as an being an inherently dependence producing, damaging drug
that has no possible benefits. Recognition of the medical
benefits of the drug may challenge this dominant view of
cannabis. </p>

<p> <b>APPENDIX 2. </b> </p>

<h1>INDUSTRIAL AND HORTICULTURAL USES OF CANNABIS </h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Since ancient times the fibres from the cannabis or hemp
plant have been used to make fabric, rope and paper ([1]Abel
1980). In World War II, the USA grew 50,000 acres of hemp, as
part of their war effort ([2]see United States Government 1944,
Hemp for Victory), and hemp fibres were used to make rope for
ships and the canvas used in parachutes. </p>

<p> More recently, experimental crops of a low THC-content
species of cannabis have been grown in The Netherlands, Italy,
Spain, France and Tasmania. Its fibres have been used in the
production of paper and fabric. Australian groups such as the
Business Alliance for Commercial Hemp argue that Australia should
allow the cultivation of hemp for industrial purposes. The
position is that, if a State or Territory Government authorises
the growing of cannabis, the Commonwealth will issue a permit for
the importation of seeds, provided that the applicant for the
import permit meets the criteria set out in the Act, such as
being 'a fit and proper person'. </p>

<p> The trade magazine for the US paper industry recently argued
that hemp has a number of advantages over timber in the area of
paper production, and there are a number of strong environmental
arguments for the commercial cultivation of hemp. Every four
months, each acre of hemp grown will produce 10 tons of fibre. It
can produce four times the amount of paper per acre than
20-year-old trees can, it requires less bleaching than pulp from
timber and, because it is a very densely growing crop, weeds are
choked and there is less need for pesticides and herbicides
([3]Young 1991). In addition, hemp requires less watering and
pesticides than cotton and produces a fibre that is argued to be
more durable than cotton fabrics ([4]Cowperthwaite 1993). </p>

<p> The United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs allows
the cultivation of cannabis for industrial and horticultural
purposes. Article 28(2) states that 'this Convention should not
apply to the cultivation of the cannabis plant exclusively for
industrial purposes (fibre and seed) or horticultural purposes'.
Australian drug legislation permits the cultivation of cannabis
for scientific purposes and some limited experimentation has
already taken place in Australia. </p>

<p> However, groups such as the Business Alliance for Commerical
Hemp argue that the full benefits of hemp production can only be
obtained if hemp is grown on a wider scale, and that cannabis
with a very low THC content can be grown for industrial purposes.
Legislation permitting the cultivation of cannabis for industrial
purposes could be included in existing drug legislation, however,
as with the medicinal use of cannabis, introducing legislation
that recognises the industrial uses of a substance that is
thought of simply as a dangerous illicit drug may pose political
difficulties for those advocating legislative change. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> The abuse of licit and illicit drugs represents a major
public health problem in the United States. The costs to society
of such abuse include thousands of premature deaths annually due
to drug-related illnesses, accidents, and homicides; economic
costs related to health care, criminal justice, and lost
productivity; and the mental and physical pain suffered by
millions of Americans. Many ills plaguing the nation
today--including the AIDS epidemic, increased crime and violence,
and homelessness--in some cases, may be linked to individuals'
physical dependence on a variety of abusable substances. The
consequences of substance abuse and addiction have been felt by
people within every economic, social, racial, religious, and
political boundary. </p>

<p> What are the root causes of substance abuse and addiction?
Why and how does addiction occur? Who are the substance abusers?
What factors lead to addiction? What are the implications for
prevention and treatment? </p>

<hr>

<p> <b>ROOT CAUSES </b> </p>

<p> The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was asked to
identify the root causes of substance abuse and addiction. The
term root causes has been used in political discussions and
debate. To some, root causes of substance abuse and addiction are
framed in a moral context, in which decisions related to use,
abuse, and addiction are the responsibility primarily of
individuals. To others, root causes include a multitude of social
and economic problems, such as homelessness, poverty, and racism.
Many people have strongly held opinions as to what constitutes
the general root causes of substance abuse and addiction in
populations, but no consensus exists about the specific root
causes of substance abuse and addiction for particular
individuals. </p>

<p> The OTA report has four parts: necessary preconditions,
individual factors, community contexts, and policy options. The
first part, Necessary Preconditions, focuses on several factors
that are necessary for substance abuse and addiction to occur.
The second part, Individual Factors, focuses on risk and
protective factors in individuals that are thought to influence
substance use, abuse, and addiction. The third part, Community
Contexts, looks at how risk and protective factors play out in
subcultures and in major activity settings (home, school,
workplace, and recreation). The fourth part, Policy Options
addresses a range of legislative issues and options for Congress.
</p>

<hr>

<p> <b> NECESSARY PRECONDITIONS </b> </p>

<p> No single or general set of variables explains the misuse of
alcohol and other drugs for every individual; in other words
there are no &quot;root causes&quot; for substance abuse that
universally apply to everyone. Nevertheless, OTA has identified
three major sets of necessary preconditions that must be present
in order for substance abuse and addiction to occur: </p>

<ul>
    <li>biology and pharmacology, </li>
    <li>availability, and </li>
    <li>use and transitions to abuse and dependency. </li>
</ul>

<p> <b> Biology and Pharmacology </b> </p>

<p> The first major set of preconditions includes biological and
pharmacological factors, without which drug abuse and dependency
would be impossible. Underlying all alcohol and drug problems are
the actions and effects that drugs of abuse exert on the brain.
It is important to understand how drugs work in the brain, why
certain drugs have the potential for being abused, and what, if
any, biological differences exist among individuals in their
susceptibility to abuse drugs. </p>

<p> A wide range of psychoactive substances have the potential
for abuse (see box 1-1). The possession and use of several
substances (e.g., marijuana, heroin, cocaine) are illegal in all
50 states. Other addictive substances (e.g., tobacco and alcohol)
may be legally purchased, possessed, and consumed by many
Americans. Some abusable substances (e.g., a wide range of
prescription drugs) are available on a restricted basis, usually
by a physician's order, while others (e.g., inhalants) may be
legally purchased, possessed, and consumed by anybody. </p>

<p> Biological factors that contribute to substance abuse and
addiction fall into two groups: the effects drugs of abuse exert
on the individual in general, and the biological status of
specific individuals taking drugs. The effects the drugs exert
can be either acute or chronic and will vary depending on the
drug and its route of administration. Most drugs of abuse
influence the brain's reward system. The pleasurable sensations
that drug use can produce reinforce drug-seeking and drug-taking
behaviors. These actions differ with different drugs; thus, some
substances have greater potential for abuse and addiction than
others. While growing evidence suggests that the brain reward
system plays a role in the reinforcing properties of most drugs
of abuse, the precise mechanisms involved are complex and have
yet to be completely described (see figures 1-1 and 1-2). </p>

<p> Prolonged or chronic use of a substance or substances can
produce both biological and behavioral changes (some long-
lasting). Biological changes can include sensitization and/or
tolerance to a substance and, if use is discontinued, withdrawal
(see box 1-2). Behavioral changes also occur with continued drug
use. An individual's drug-craving, drug- seeking, and drug-taking
behaviors are reinforced through neuroadaptive changes in the
brain's reward system. </p>

<p> Environmental cues also play a large role in drug-seeking and
drug-taking behavior. On encountering certain environmental
stimuli (i.e., specific locations, smells, tastes), drug-craving
and drug withdrawal symptoms have been reported by former drug
users who have been drug-free for months and even years. </p>

<p> Through family, twin, and adoption studies, most researchers
agree that genetic factors play some part in the acquisition of
alcohol problems and, although less clear, other drug problems.
However, no conclusive evidence has been found to explain
precisely what is inherited or the overall importance of this
inherited material. It has been hypothesized that numerous genes
(as opposed to one) interact in complex ways, and expression of
those genes are affected by a myriad of environmental factors.
Thus, the presence or absence of a genetic factor neither ensures
nor protects against drug addiction. </p>

<p> <b> Availability </b> </p>

<p> The second set of preconditions for drug abuse and dependency
includes availability. A person cannot become a drug abuser
unless a drug is physically available. In addition, however,
availability is affected by social norms (e.g., factors within
the community conducive to drug use, including level of parental
or guardian supervision, lack of consequences for alcohol and
drug offenses, lack of alternative activities, and portrayals of
alcohol and other drug use by friends and the media as a
glamorous and healthy activity), prices (economic availability),
and personal values (subjective availability) (see table 1-1). </p>

<p> The primary focus of U.S. antidrug policy has been to attack
the physical availability of illicit drugs through law
enforcement efforts aimed at disrupting the production,
transport, and sale of drugs. While this focus has increased
drug-related arrests--nearly half of newly sentenced federal
inmates in 1991 were imprisoned on drug charges--illicit drugs
are still widely available. </p>

<p> Marketing techniques for both licit and illicit drugs can
alter social, economic, and subjective availability. Key
components of marketing include the promotion and advertising of
particular product lines to appeal to particular subpopulations
of the consuming public, development of a product line that can
be targeted to subpopulations within the larger community of
consumers, pricing strategies to attract new buyers, and
identification of retail outlets for sales. </p>

<p> Federal law regulates the merchandising of licit yet abusable
substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs by
placing a variety of restrictions on how such products may be
marketed. Despite current restrictions, debate continues as to
whether and how a variety of legal drugs should be marketed. </p>

<p> <b> Use and Transitions to Abuse and Dependency </b> </p>

<p> The third set of preconditions for drug abuse and addiction
is drug use, including the progression to heavier and more
harmful use. A person cannot become drug-dependent without first
using a drug and then progressing to more harmful levels of use.
Researchers have focused on stages in the progression of drug use
in several ways. They have studied stages in the initiation of
the use of different drugs, finding a sequence that moves from
the use of cigarettes and wine or beer, to the use of marijuana,
then hard liquor, and finally other illicit drugs. Because most
individuals who use drugs do not go on to abuse drugs, and
because the use of drugs at one level does not guarantee the use
of drugs at a higher level, these stages are descriptive but not
predictive. </p>

<p> Initiation is the first step in the progression to more
serious levels of drug use. Because drug use often begins during
adolescence, most drug use research has focused on drug use
initiation among adolescents. However, many individuals who
initiate drug use do not progress to harmful drug use. Also, the
factors associated with such progression may often differ from
the factors associated with initiation. Thus, the focus on the
initiation of drug use during adolescence is not sufficient for
an understanding of the progression from use to abuse and
dependency. </p>

<p> In addition to initiation, research has focused on other
identifiable stages in the full cycle of drug use and abuse,
including continuation of drug use, maintenance and progression
of drug use within a class of drugs, progression in drug use
across drug classes, and regression, cessation, and relapse
cycles. Research has also been done on the co- occurrence and
possible sequences in drug abuse and other problem behaviors,
with some studies finding that problem behaviors often precede
the onset of drug abuse. </p>

<p> <b> INDIVIDUAL FACTORS </b> </p>

<p> Much of the research on substance abuse and addiction has
focused on identifying individual risk factors for alcohol and
other drug use, specifically among adolescents and young adults
(see table 1-2). Risk factors have been identified as those
cognitive, psychological, attitudinal, social, pharmacological,
physiological, and developmental characteristics that foster
initiation of drug and alcohol use and/or abuse by an individual.
Protective factors are those characteristics that reduce the risk
of substance use and abuse and promote positive development, such
as appropriate role models, involvement in positive peer groups,
and a positive self-image and outlook for the future. </p>

<p> Because no individual risk or protective factor can be
categorized as a root cause of substance abuse and addiction, a
full analysis of each individual factor is beyond the scope of
this report. However, an overview of selected factors highlights
associations often present in substance abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> <b> Demographic </b> </p>

<p> <b> Age </b> </p>

<p> The preponderance of substance abuse research points to the
fact that children who use alcohol and other drugs before the age
of 15 have a greater likelihood of becoming problem alcohol and
other drug users, versus those youth who begin use at a later
age. </p>

<p> While most substance use and abuse occur during the
adolescent and young-adult years, older persons are not immune to
the addictive powers of these substances. For example, among
women, alcohol problems tend to appear on average several years
later than they do among men (although this trend may be
reversing). For black males, problem drinking patterns typically
occur after age 30, versus ages 18 to 25 for white males. </p>

<p> Although substance abuse problems are not exclusive to
adolescence, most prevention programs currently target youth. The
importance of these types of programs is obvious--to prevent or
decrease the use of alcohol, tobacco, cigarettes, and other drugs
by youth. Yet, adults can also be exposed to stressful life
situations, such as unemployment, divorce, or death of a spouse
or child, which could contribute to substance abuse problems. The
adult population presents unique and often overlooked challenges
for the planning and implementation of substance abuse prevention
programs. </p>

<p> <b> Gender </b> </p>

<p> Historically, the vast majority of biological and behavioral
studies were conducted on male participants; women substance
abusers were not commonly included in research studies. A
distorted picture emerged, in which women were assumed to misuse
the same substances, and for the same reasons, as men. Within the
past 10 to 20 years, however, some researchers have focused on
the causes and consequences of substance abuse problems among
women, and are beginning to report differences based on gender.
Basic gaps in knowledge remain, however, regarding substance use
and abuse among women. Until these gaps are addressed, the
inaccurate and misleading practice of transferring data garnered
from studies on men to women is likely to continue. </p>

<p> <b> Race and Ethnicity </b> </p>

<p> Historically, racial and ethnic minorities have been linked
with, and often blamed for, many of the substance abuse problems
within the United States (see box 1-3). Certainly, many urban
areas have high concentrations of minorities, and within many of
these areas the prevalence of substance abuse may be high. Often
overlooked, however, is the prevalence of substance abuse
problems in suburban and rural areas throughout the United
States. In the minds of many, the link between minority
populations and rampant substance abuse is inaccurate and
derogatory. </p>

<p> Adolescent research has documented substantial racial and
ethnic differences in substance use among high school seniors. On
average, licit and illicit substance use is highest among Native
American Indian youth, somewhat lower among white and Hispanic
youth, substantially lower among black youth, and lowest among
Asian youth. However, such findings do not include populations
most likely to be excluded from self-reporting studies (e.g.,
high school dropouts). </p>

<p> Until recently, much of the analysis of substance use and/or
abuse data has concentrated on the relationship between the use
of a substance and one or two variables such as race and
ethnicity and/or educational level. Often a positive association
was found between minority populations and the use or abuse of
certain substances. While statistically correct, these analyses
can be simplistic and misleading. Clearly many risk and
protective factors interact to produce substance use and abuse.
If the majority of these variables are excluded from the
analysis, a skewed picture may arise as to the importance of
certain variables as risk factors for substance use and abuse.
Additionally, to simplify the data collection, racial and ethnic
categories are often broad. The most popular groupings are black,
white non- Hispanic, Hispanic, and other. While each of these
categories contains many distinct cultures, gross generalizations
are commonly made. </p>

<p> Race and ethnicity have not been shown to be either
biological or genetic risk factors for substance use or abuse. To
date, the preponderance of investigative studies has focused on
racial and ethnic differences in response specifically to
alcohol. Few studies have been completed on differences in racial
and ethnic biological responses to other licit or illicit drugs. </p>

<p> <b> Economic </b> </p>

<p> Are poor individuals at greater risk of developing problems
related to substance abuse? While a relatively straight forward
question, its resolution is hampered by the fact that poverty is
difficult to define and drawing conclusions concerning an
individual's potential for future substance abuse based on one or
two variables such as family income or educational level is
overly simplistic and deceptive. </p>

<p> In recent years, attention has been paid to the plight of the
urban poor, many of whom are minorities. These inner- city
communities are often riddled with high rates of crime, violence,
unemployment, and inadequate social and medical services. For
individuals living in these localities, the consequences of these
problems are serious and far reaching. </p>

<p> To assess poverty and its relationship to substance abuse
problems, some researchers have used the federal guidelines for
poverty, while others employ measures of socioeconomic status
(SES) such as educational level and household income. To date,
the largest and most comprehensive analysis of SES variables and
substance use has been accomplished by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). While the analysis revealed associations
between certain characteristics and patterns of substance use, it
did not reveal causality. From this analysis, a straightforward
&quot;yes or no&quot; response to the initial question linking
poverty to increased individual risk for substance use or abuse
is clearly impossible. The NIDA analysis demonstrated that the
type and quantity of an individual's substance use is correlated
with a variety of both individual as well as geographic
characteristics. Furthermore, while the NIDA study was the
largest and most comprehensive to date, some segments of the
population (e.g., homeless, dropouts, institutionalized), many of
whom were possible alcohol and drug abusers, were excluded from
the survey. </p>

<p> <b> Psychosocial and Behavioral </b> </p>

<p> Many of the identified risk and protective factors relate to
psychological, social, and behavioral characteristics. Conditions
such as aggressiveness, delinquency, and mental disorders are
often linked with substance abuse and addiction. Experiences such
as physical and sexual abuse have also been identified as
potential risk factors. While relatively little research has been
accomplished on protective factors, several elements identified
within the resiliency literature, as well as religiosity and
spirituality, have been associated with decreased substance use. </p>

<p> However, the presence or absence of specific risk factors
neither predicates nor guarantees protection from substance
abuse. In addition, consensus is lacking within the substance
abuse field as to the importance, interaction, or order of the
factors. </p>

<p> <b> COMMUNITY CONTEXTS </b> </p>

<p> A growing body of research is focusing on factors and
interventions relevant to the onset and prevention of substance
use, abuse, and dependency in the four principal community
activity settings--homes and families, schools and peers,
workplaces, and recreational settings. </p>

<p> In framing prevention programs with divergent populations,
researchers are attempting to better understand qualitative as
well as quantitative research methods, and the variety of
settings in which substance abuse and addiction can take place
and can be combated (see box 1-4). </p>

<p> Despite the promise of community-based research, several
problems exist. First, much of the research does not address
substance abuse and addiction per se, but rather risk and
protective factors that can lead to a number of outcomes,
including substance abuse and addiction. Second, research studies
vary widely in methodology, making it difficult to draw
scientifically valid conclusions. Third, rigorous evaluation of
many prevention research programs is missing, leaving the
effectiveness of such programs open to debate. </p>

<p> <b> Homes and Families </b> </p>

<p> Although American society expects families in their homes to
take the lead in dealing with substance abuse and other problem
behaviors, families in this country generally receive only
limited support in protecting themselves against substance abuse.
This situation may result in part from the belief that most
nuclear families can raise their children largely independently
and therefore do not need outside support, and in part from the
belief that teens and young adults are more influenced by their
peers. The first belief, however, is not supported by
long-standing practices in most societies, where extended
families and life-long neighbors have traditionally helped raise
children (although in the United States many parents do not have
access to these additional child-rearing resources because of
urbanization, high technology, and family mobility). And the
second belief is being questioned by growing evidence that
certain parenting practices and family intervention programs can
significantly reduce the risk of substance abuse among
adolescents and young adults. </p>

<p> A growing body of research has identified risk and protective
factors that may be particularly relevant in home and family
situations (see table 1-3). Programs that enhance protective
factors include those providing parent education, prenatal and
infant care, preschool, and social support activities that help
strengthen involved and responsive parenting. Programs that seek
to decrease the presence of risk factors include those designed
to reduce drug trafficking (e.g., community policing, clean
sweeps of housing projects), physical and sexual abuse, the
impact of negative life events (e.g., mental health counseling),
and parental neglect. Substance abuse treatment programs that
include an addict's family members also address risk factors. </p>

<p> <b> Schools and Peers </b> </p>

<p> Schools have been the target for prevention programs to
curtail drug use at school sites (e.g., Drug Free School Zones)
as well as curriculum-based programs that target drug use in the
community as a whole. Because school-age youth are especially
likely to initiate the use of alcohol and other drugs, much of
the research has focused on use, rather than on abuse and
dependency. Such research is nevertheless relevant to an
understanding of abuse and dependency, since use is a
precondition and contributor to abuse and dependency and because
even experimental use can be harmful. </p>

<p> OTA conducted the most extensive compilation and examination
of survey research on school-aged substance use to date-- 9,930
statistical analyses from 242 separate studies. The studies
reported statistical relationships between substance use and its
postulated causes. Statistical findings from the study reports
were sorted into 11 major categories and 50 subcategories (see
table 1-4), and then analyzed to identify strong, moderate, and
weak statistical relationships, as well as those that had been
insufficiently studied. The four variables that dominated as
correlates of and possible contributors to substance abuse are:
1) prior and concurrent use of substances, 2) substance use by
peers and friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about substance
use, and 4) offers to use substances. The prominence of prior and
concurrent use is consistent with the reinforcing nature of
substance use itself. The prominence of the other three variables
emphasizes the importance of the social environment in
contributing to and reinforcing substance use among school- age
youth. </p>

<p> Schools primarily seek to prevent substance use and abuse
through curriculum-based drug prevention programs. Such programs
have dominated the field, largely because they are relatively
simple to understand, implement, and replicate, and because
methods to evaluate them have become standardized.
Curriculum-based prevention programs have been hampered, however,
by a lack of good evaluation data needed to prove their
effectiveness. </p>

<p> <b> Workplaces </b> </p>

<p> The prevalence of drug abuse among the employed remains
inadequately documented, based on a small number of studies.
Substance abuse contributes to workplace problems, such as
accidents, injuries, absenteeism, turnover, lost productivity,
compensation claims, and insurance costs. Substance abuse in
workplaces can be affected by nonworkplace factors and workplace
factors. The primary interventions are employee assistance
programs that help employees with personal problems by providing
services directly (through the work organization) or indirectly
(through a provider in the community); health promotion programs
that typically seek to prevent illness and promote wellness
through behavior change; and alterations to workplace
environments that seek to reduce stress and strengthen support
for workers. </p>

<p> <b> Recreational Settings </b> </p>

<p> Recreational activities and settings may also contribute to
the prevention of substance use and abuse or, by their absence,
increase the risk. Examples of recreational activities and
settings include Boys and Girls Clubs, Boy and Girl Scouts,
organized sports, and local park and recreation department
programs. </p>

<p> Research on the impact of organized youth activities on
substance use and abuse is limited, and only a few studies have
addressed the issue directly. However, existing research
indicates that involvement in youth programs and activities is
associated with fewer at-risk behaviors, including substance use
among youth. The youth development field, including the resources
of park and recreation departments, provides opportunities for
broad-based prevention interventions. </p>

<p> Involvement in activities does not by itself protect against
substance abuse. Some activities, such as those that are
unstructured and unsupervised, may even increase the risks of
substance use and abuse through association with a wider range of
peers, some of whom are using substances. In addition, activities
perceived as boring may not protect against substance use and
abuse. More research is needed to clarify the aspects of
recreational and other leisure activities that may protect
against substance use and abuse. Research might focus on whether
activities that are supervised, structured, drug-free,
empowering, skills- building, self-esteem-promoting, active,
shared, and nonboring (or some combination of those) are
associated with lower levels of substance use and abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p> <b> POLICY OPTIONS </b> </p>

<p> Issues related to substance abuse and addiction have long
occupied the attention of the American public (see table 1- 5).
Congress has authorized a multitude of federal programs aimed at
reducing or preventing the supply and demand of illicit drugs and
regulating the availability of illicit substances, and has
appropriated billions of dollars each year to federal agencies,
provided oversight of federal programs, and passed broad-based
legislation to coordinate programs as part of the war on drugs.
In addressing what some policymakers term as the root causes of
substance abuse and addiction, the list of relevant statutes
expands significantly, as many domestic and social programs can
influence the risk and protective factors that can lead an
individual into or away from substance abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> A total of 12 executive branch departments, four independent
agencies, one multiagency program (Weed and Seed), one White
House office (the Office of National Drug Control Policy--
ONDCP), and the Judiciary, all receive federal funding as part of
national drug control strategy. These efforts include
interdiction, treatment, and prevention programs. </p>

<p> The federal substance abuse control policy has as its primary
focus the eradication of the supply of drugs. Congress currently
appropriates more than $12 billion annually on antidrug efforts,
with approximately two-thirds of this amount supporting drug
interdiction and law enforcement activities, and the remainder
supporting demand- side activities, such as drug treatment,
research, and prevention programs. </p>

<p> Drug demand reduction efforts focus on providing treatment
for abusers and addicts, prevention programs for various
populations, and biomedical and behavioral research on the causes
of substance use, abuse, and addiction. Of these, the federal
government spends the most on treatment, followed by prevention
and causality research. Drug treatment and prevention programs
are funded at both the federal and state levels, while causation
research is funded primarily by the federal government. A recent
General Accounting Office (GAO) study revealed that for studying
the causes of drug abuse, funding has remained comparatively
tiny. In 1990, for example, such research was funded at a level
of $6 million, about one-tenth of one percent of the nation's
drug control budget for that year. </p>

<p> OTA, in conjunction with GAO, surveyed federal agencies
identified as having substance abuse prevention efforts. OTA
finds that substance abuse prevention efforts are scattered over
a number of federal agencies, and that federal prevention efforts
are dictated by statutory mandates, rather than directed at
identifying causes of substance abuse and addiction per se. The
White House ONDCP, charged with coordinating federal antidrug
efforts, lacks the statutory mandate to forcibly integrate or
alter the multitude of programs that make up the federal
government's war on drugs. </p>

<p> Congress faces several fundamental difficulties in addressing
the causes of substance abuse and addiction: </p>

<ul>
    <li> o No scientific consensus exists as to what is the
        driving cause of substance abuse and addiction. A range
        of risk and protective factors have been associated with
        drug use, abuse, and addiction. </li>
    <li> o Federal antidrug efforts, though coordinated by ONDCP,
        are spread among many federal agencies, whose
        authorization and appropriations fall under the
        jurisdiction of numerous congressional committees and
        subcommittees. ONDCP efforts in drug demand reduction
        efforts alone involved federal agencies across at least
        11 Cabinet-level departments. This makes coordinated
        legislative action difficult to achieve. </li>
    <li> o The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the
        creation of new domestic programs or the enhancement of
        existing programs that target known risk and protective
        factors in individuals and communities. The framework and
        literature reviews presented in this report make clear
        that substance abuse and addiction can arise and be
        influenced by multiple factors in individuals, groups,
        and communities. Thus, effective intervention requires
        prevention practitioners to select from a variety of
        options, so they can target the specific factors that are
        especially important for the particular populations and
        communities they are addressing. This does not mean that
        everything must be done at once nor that everything be
        known in advance of taking action. To the contrary,
        policymakers and practitioners can take small steps at a
        time, and then, as resources and new knowledge permit,
        take additional steps that address a fuller range of
        factors and contexts in greater depth. </li>
    <li> o Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically
        accepted standards for determining their success or
        failure. Whatever methods are developed, tested, and
        incorporated into prevention programs, a critical
        component of success is careful, rigorous evaluation.
        Answering &quot;what works?&quot; is essential in making
        advances in preventing substance abuse. </li>
</ul>

<p> In choosing which policy issues to address, OTA focused on
those areas directly addressed in this study. OTA identified a
series of policy issues in four broad categories: federal focus
and prevention program structure, research needs, community
activity settings, and availability (see table 1- 6). A number of
policy questions and options for congressional action emerge from
these four categories (see table 1-7). A full discussion of the
policy issues and options for congressional action can be found
in chapter 9 of the full report. Given the broad nature of
federal antidrug efforts, many important issues relating to
federal antidrug efforts remain beyond the scope of this report.
Such topics include drug treatment, interdiction and enforcement,
and drug legalization. </p>

<p> BOX 1-1: Overview of Alcohol and Some Other Psychoactive
Substances </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> ALCOHOL (ethyl alcohol) </b> </p>

<p> Alcohol, one of the most widely used of all drugs, is a
central nervous system depressant with effects similar to those
of sedative-hypnotic compounds (see below). At low doses, alcohol
may be associated with behavioral excitation thought to be due to
the depression of inhibitory neurons in the brain. Alcohol
differs from sedative-hypnotic compounds in that it is used
primarily for recreation or social rather than medical purposes. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Beer. 2. Wine. 3. &quot;Hard&quot; liquor (e.g., whiskey,
gin). </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> SEDATIVES, HYPNOTICS, OR ANXIOLYTICS </b> </p>

<p> Sedative-hypnotics are drugs of diverse chemical structure
that exert a nonselective general depressant on the central
nervous system. In addition, they reduce metabolism in a variety
of tissues in the body, depressing any system that uses energy.
Depending on the dose, any sedative hypnotic compound may be
classified as a sedative (an agent that allays excitement), a
tranquilizer (an antianxiety agent), a hypnotic (a sleep-inducing
agent), or an anesthetic (an agent that eliminates pain).
Sedative-hypnotics are used medically as sedatives, anxiolytics
(antianxiety agents), hypnotics, antiepileptics, muscle
relaxants, and general anesthetics. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Barbiturates (&quot;downers&quot; or &quot;barbs&quot;):
pentobarbital sodium[NembutalR], secobarbital sodium [SeconalR],
amobarbital [AmytalR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> 2. Nonbarbiturate hypnotics: methaqualone [QuaaludesR]--
taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Tranquilizers: diazepam [ValiumR], chlordiazepoxide
hydrochloride [LibriumR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> CANNABIS (THC) </b> </p>

<p> THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) the active agent in marijuana,
alters perceptions, concentration, emotions, and behavior, though
the mechanisms of action are not entirely clear. Researchers have
found, however, that THC changes the way in which sensory
information is processed by the brain. It can be used medically
to relieve nausea and side effects of chemotherapy in cancer
patients; it is very rarely used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Marijuana (&quot;pot&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;)-- smoked
or eaten. 2. Hashish (&quot;hash&quot;)--smoked or eaten. 3.
Hashish oil (&quot;hash oil&quot;)--smoked (mixed with tobacco.
4. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-- taken orally in capsules. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> NICOTINE </b> </p>

<p> Nicotine, obtained naturally from tobacco, is a central
nervous system stimulant.(c) It exerts its action secondary to
stimulation of certain cholinergic (excitatory) synapses both
within the brain and in the peripheral nervous system. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cigarettes. 2. Smokeless tobacco (e.g., snuff or chewing
tobacco). </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> COCAINE </b> </p>

<p> Cocaine, obtained naturally from coca leaves, is a potent
central nervous system stimulant.(c) It stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system, which regulates the activity of
cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. It also produces
bronchodilation in the lungs. It is used medically as a topical
anesthetic for surgical procedures. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> <b> Examples </b> </p>

<p> 1. Cocaine hydrochloride powder (&quot;coke&quot; or
&quot;street cocaine&quot;)--usually snorted or injected
intravenously.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Cocaine alkaloid (&quot;freebase&quot; or
&quot;crack&quot;)--smoked.(e) </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED STIMULANTS(f) </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamines </p>

<p> Amphetamines are a group of three closely related compounds,
all of which are potent central nervous system and behavioral
stimulants.(c) Some amphetamines are used medically to treat
attention deficit disorder or minimal brain dysfunction in
children, narcolepsy (recurrent, uncontrollable, brief episodes
of sleep), or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;uppers&quot;
(BenzedrineR]--taken orally, injected, or snorted.(g) </p>

<p> 2. Methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;crystal
meth&quot; or &quot;ice&quot;) [MethadrineR]--taken orally,
injected, or snorted.(g),(h) </p>

<p> 3. Dextroamphetamine [DexedrineR]--taken orally, or injected.
</p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> 2. Nonamphetamine stimulants </p>

<p> Like amphetamines, nonamphetamine stimulates are central
nervous and behavioral stimulants. Some non-amphetamine
stimulants (e.g., PreludinR) are used for weight control, and
some (e.g., RitalinR and CylertR) are used medically to treat
hyperactivity, minimal brain dysfunction, narcolepsy, or (rarely)
depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Pheumetrazine hydrochloride [PreludinR]--taken orally or
injected.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Methylphenidate hydrochloride injected.(d) </p>

<p> 3. Pemoline [CylertR]--taken orally. [RitalinR]--taken
orally, or injected.(d) </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> HALLUCINOGENS </b> </p>

<p> Hallucinogens, or psychedelics, are a heterogeneous group of
compounds that affect a person's perceptions, sensations,
thinking, self-awareness, and emotions.(i) </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or
&quot;acid&quot;--taken orally or put in the eyes. </p>

<p> 2. Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethylox- phenylethyl amide) or
&quot;mesc&quot; and peyote--disks chewed, swallowed, or smoked;
tablets taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Psilocybin (&quot;magic mushrooms&quot;)--chewed and
swallowed. 4. MDMA (methylene dioxymethamphetamine)--taken
orally. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> INHALANTS </b> </p>

<p> Inhalants are chemicals that produce psychoactive vapors.
Although different in makeup, nearly all of the abused inhalants
produce effects similar to those of anesthetics, which act to
slow down the body's functions or produce feelings of dizziness.
At low doses, users may feel slightly stimulated. Amyl nitrite is
used for heart patients because it dilates the blood vessels and
increases blood supply to the heart. There are no medical
indications for most of the inhalants. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Solvents (model airplane glue, nail polish remover,
lighter and cleaning fluids, and gasoline)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 2. Aerosols (e.g., paints, hairsprays)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 3. Some anesthetics (e.g.,nitrous oxide)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Amyl nitrite (&quot;snappers&quot; or &quot;poppers&quot;)
and butyl nitrite (&quot;rush&quot;)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> OPIATES (NARCOTICS) AND RELATED ANALGESICS </b> </p>

<p> Opiates are natural or synthetic drugs that, like morphine, a
substance derived from the opium poppy, have analgesic
(pain-relieving) properties. Heroin is not approved for medical
uses in the United States. The major medical use of other opiates
is for the relief of pain (i.e., as analgesics); some narcotics
are used to relieve coughing (i.e., as antitussives) or to treat
diarrhea. Methadone is used in the treatment of narcotic
abstinence syndromes and as an analgesic in terminal illness. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Heroin (&quot;smack&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;)--
injected, smoked, or inhaled.(d) </p>

<p> 2. Codeine (codeine sulfate)--taken orally or injected.(d) 3.
Morphine (morphine hydrochloride)--injected, smoked, or inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Synthetic opiates (e.g., methadone [DolophineR]);
hydromorphone hydrochloride [DilaudidR], meperidine hydrochloride
[DemerolR], oxycodone and asprin [PercodanR]-- taken orally or
injected. </p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> <b> PCP (PHENCYCLIDINE) AND SIMILARLY ACTING
SYMPHATHOMIMETICS </b> </p>

<p> Phencycyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, alters the
functions of the neocortex and has been called a dissociative
anesthetic. It was developed in the 1950s as an anesthetic but
was subsequently taken off the market in 1967 when it was
discovered that the drug caused hallucinations in some people.(j)
PCP is now used legally only in veterinary medicine as an
immobilizing agent. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> PCP (&quot;angel dust&quot; or &quot;lovely&quot;)--taken
orally, or smoked (sprayed on joints or cigarettes).(d) </p>

<p> (a) According to Julien, one could conceivably classify
psychoactive drugs by at least three methods: 1) mechanism of
action, 2) chemical structure, and 3) behavioral effects.
Probably the most useful approach would be to classify them by
mechanism of action, but knowledge of the brain's physiology is
too limited for this approach to be comprehensive. A limitation
of the second approach is that many drugs of apparently similar
structure exert quite different effects, and many drugs of
dissimilar structure exert quite similar effects. The
classification in this table largely reflects the behavioral
effects approach. The classification used here is based on the
categories in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., revised.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, all of the
classes of psychoactive substances listed in this box except
nicotine are associated with both abuse and dependence. Nicotine
is associated with dependence but not abuse. </p>

<p> (b) The potential physiological, psychological, and
behavioral effects of using the psychoactive substance shown are
discussed in the sources listed below. The consequences depend in
part on the specific drug used, the dosage level and mode of
administration. </p>

<p> (c) Central nervous system stimulants are drugs that can
elevate mood, increase alertness, reduce fatigue, provide a sense
of increased energy, decrease appetite, and improve task
performance. They can also produce anxiety, insomnia, and
irritability. The drugs differ widely in their molecular
structures and mechanisms of action. </p>

<p> (d) According to the American Psychiatric Association, the
route of administration of a psychoactive substance is an
important variable in determining whether use will lead to
dependence or abuse. In general, routes of administration that
produce more efficient absorption of the substance in the blood
stream (e.g., intravenous injection) tend to increase the
likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance uses that leads
to dependence. Routes that quickly deliver psychoactive
substances to the brain (e.g., smoking or intravenous injection)
are associated with higher levels of consumption and with an
increased likelihood of toxic effects. Use of contaminated
needles for intravenous administration of amphetamines, cocaine,
and opiates can cause hepatitis, HIV infection, and other
illnesses. </p>

<p> (e) Freebase cocaine is a form of cocaine made by converting
&quot;street cocaine&quot; (cocaine hydrochloride) to a purified
base that is smoked. The effect of smoking freebase is similar to
that of intravenous injection but smoking provides a shorter more
intense high than sniffing or ingestion because of the rapid
absorption of the drug through the lungs. &quot;Crack
cocaine&quot; is the street name given to freebase cocaine that
has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a chemical base
by cooking it with baking soda and water. The term crack refers
to the cracking sound that is heard when the mixture is smoked
(heated), presumably due to the sodium bicarbonate. </p>

<p> (f) Describing a drug as a stimulant does not adequately
describe its properties. Drug use surveys typically mean
amphetamines when they use the word stimulants. Some surveys
regard as stimulants both prescription (amphetamines) and
nonprescription substances (e.g., caffeine-based compounds used
in No-Doz, diet pills, and &quot;fake pep pills&quot;). Cocaine
and nicotine (described above) are also central nervous system
simulants. </p>

<p> (g) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
designer drugs are structural analogs of substances scheduled
under the Controlled Substances Act that are prepared by
underground chemists to mimic the psychoactive effects of
controlled substances or produce other psychoactive effects.
Because such analogs are not identical to their parent compound,
their manufacture and distribution does not violate the law. As
of June 1986, there were synthetic analogs of PCP, fentanyl and
meperidine, and amphetamine and methamphetamine. </p>

<p> (h) In the past, abuse of methamphetamine had been in the
form of tablets or intravenous injection. More recently,
&quot;ice&quot; (one of the common street names for
d-methamphetamine hydrochloride) has gained popularity in a form
suitable for smoking. </p>

<p> (i) Most of the agents in this class of drugs can induce
hallucinations if the dose is high enough. But the term
hallucinogen does not adequately describe the range of
pharmacological actions of the diverse group of substances
usually included in the class. The term psychedelic was proposed
by Osmond in 1957 to imply that these agents all have the ability
to alter the sensory perception and thus may be considered
&quot;mind expanding.&quot; The effects of hallucinogens are
unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the user's
personality, mood and expectations, and the surroundings in which
the drug is used. </p>

<p> (j) PCP is considered a hallucinogen in some surveys of drug
use. </p>

<p> BOX 1-2: Tolerance, Sensitization, Dependence, and Withdrawal
</p>

<p> Tolerance to a drug develops when, following a prolonged
period of use, more of the drug is required to produce a given
effect. Sensitization, the opposite of tolerance, occurs when the
effects of a given dose of a drug increase after repeated
administration. Dependence is a type of neuroadaptation to drug
exposure. With prolonged use of a drug, cells in the brain adapt
to its presence such that the drug is required to maintain normal
cell function. On abrupt withdrawal of the drug, the cell behaves
abnormally and a withdrawal syndrome ensues. Generally, the
withdrawal syndrome is characterized by a series of signs and
symptoms that are opposite to those of the drug's acute effects.
For example, withdrawal of sedative drugs produce excitation and
irritability. Conversely, withdrawal of stimulants produces
profound depression. </p>

<p> BOX 1-3: Drugs and Discrimination </p>

<p> In America, tensions between the majority and various
minorities often hinge on concerns raised by drug use. The groups
change over time and place, but the dividing issues remain
remarkably similar. Those in power decide which drugs are legal
and how rules should be enforced. Minorities charge that unfair
policies result from prejudice, ignorance, and hypocrisy. </p>

<p> When? 1850 Where? Boston Who? Irish Immigrants </p>

<p> Impoverished Irish immigrants brought the tradition of
drinking whiskey with them. In American cities, people often
blamed whiskey for neighborhood quarrels. In the mid-19th
century, clashes with Irish immigrants occurred so often that
police vans came to be known by the term &quot;paddy
wagons.&quot; </p>

<p> When? 1880s Where? San Francisco Who? Chinese Immigrants </p>

<p> Fear of immigrant Chinese often focused on their recreational
use of opium. In 1875, San Francisco outlawed opium smoking,
which most residents associated exclusively with the Chinese.
This citywide ban became nationwide in 1909. </p>

<p> When? 1882 Where? Ohio Who? German Immigrants </p>

<p> Beer drinking often brought Germans into conflict with
temperance advocates. Cincinnati's lively German community
gathered at beer gardens on Sundays to sing, dance, drink, and
argue politics. In 1882, Ohio's governor denounced Germans as
&quot;sabbath breakers, criminals, and free thinkers.&quot; </p>

<p> When? 1930s Where? Colorado, New Mexico Who? Mexican Migrant
Workers </p>

<p> The Southwest welcomed Mexican migrants during labor
shortages. But during the Depression, anxiety over competition
for jobs shifted to wildly exaggerated fears of the effects of
marijuana use customary among Mexicans. To placate fears,
Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which prohibited
recreational use of the drug. </p>

<p> When? 1991 Who? African Americans Police forces are largely
white and inner-city residents are mostly black. Between 1980 and
1990, the drug-arrest rate in the city of Rochester, New York,
was about five times that for suburban Monroe County. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> BOX 1-4: Ethnography </p>

<p> Ethnographic techniques allow researchers to study how
environmental and cultural factors affect values, attitudes, and
behaviors of individuals and groups. For three decades,
researchers have documented societal and cultural influences on
the patterns of substance use, abuse, and addiction; using a
range of methodologies and working in diverse contexts,
ethnographers have contributed to the understanding of substance
abuse. Interacting with drug users under a wider set of
circumstances than do strict quantitative researchers,
ethnographers have expanded the framework of substance abuse
research hypotheses. They have also assisted in the evaluation
and interpretation of clinical and survey data to different
subcultures and populations. </p>

<p> Ethnographies also provide information on constantlychanging
substance use patterns. By collecting data from substance users
in their natural environments, ethnographers have been able to
document who uses drugs and how drugs are used. This type of
methodology is essential to the historical understanding of
substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Lastly, ethnographers have documented different styles of
substance use within American society as well as abroad.
Differences are cited in experience and use patterns based on
social class, cultural background, gender, and geographic
location. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 2 INTRODUCTION </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction are pervasive in our society,
with their consequences felt by people in every economic, social,
racial, and political boundary. </p>

<p> The United States has grappled with problems associated with
substance abuse and addiction for over a century (see appendix A
and table 2-1). In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan launched
what has become known as the war on drugs. Federal spending to
combat drugs increased from $1.5 billion in 1981 to more than $12
billion in 1994, with spending in 1995 projected to pass the $13
billion mark (see table 2-2). Nearly two-thirds of the federal
antidrug budget goes toward efforts to curb the supply of drugs
(e.g., border interdiction, law enforcement), with the remainder
being spent on drug treatment and prevention programs. While the
use of illegal drugs has declined in the United States in recent
years, a vigorous debate continues as to whether the nation is
indeed winning the war on drugs, and what the balance of federal
effort should be in formulating programs to decrease the supply
of drugs, treat drug abusers and addicts, and educate Americans
about problems associated with drug abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Congress has enacted a number of laws in an attempt to create
a national policy to fight the scourge of drug abuse and
addiction. As part of oversight responsibility for national drug
policy, several committees of Congress have requested the Office
of Technology Assessment (OTA) to undertake a study addressing
the socioeconomic, psychological, physiological, and genetic
underpinnings of substance abuse and addiction (see table 2-3). </p>

<p> OTA has been asked to address a number of questions: </p>

<ul>
    <li> o What are the root causes of substance abuse and
        addiction? </li>
    <li> o Why and how does addiction occur? </li>
    <li> o Who are the substance abusers? </li>
    <li> o What factors, scientific and social, lead to
        addiction? </li>
    <li> o What are the implications for prevention? </li>
</ul>

<p> ROOT CAUSES </p>

<p> At the outset, OTA was asked to address the root causes of
substance abuse and addiction. The term root causes has been used
in political discussions and debate (see box 2-1), and although
many people have strongly held opinions as to what constitutes
the root causes of drug abuse, no consensus exists as to what, if
anything, is inherent in every case of substance abuse and
addiction. OTA conducted a search of various bibliographic
databases, which revealed only limited discussion about root
causes of drug abuse (2). </p>

<p> Research into drug abuse looks not at root causes per se, but
rather at risk and protective factors that increase or decrease
the possibility that substance abuse and addiction will occur
(see table 2-4), and how these risk and protective factors affect
various subpopulations in different settings. </p>

<p> WHAT ARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION? </p>

<p> Drug consumption is divided into three levels or stages
commonly distinguished by clinicians and researchers: use, abuse,
and dependence (see figure 2-1). Each of these stages is, on
average, more hazardous, more obtrusive, and more likely to
provoke or induce social interventions (e.g., punitive sanctions,
attention by prevention programs, admission to treatment) than
the one before (4). A substance is abusable if it has the
capacity to induce dependence in those who use it. Dependence, a
term that is often used interchangeably with the term addiction,
can include psychological dependence (a form of obsessive
behavior whose objective is the attainment of pleasure or the
avoidance of unpleasantness) and physical dependence (development
of tolerance, causing the user to need increasing amounts of the
drug for it to have its desired effect, and withdrawal symptoms
if drug use is stopped) (5). </p>

<p> Nevertheless, there is considerable controversy about what
constitutes substance abuse and addiction. A number of issues
come into play, such as: </p>

<p> o What substance is being used? A wide range of psychoactive
substances has the potential for abuse (see box 2-2). The
possession and use of several substances--such as marijuana,
heroin, cocaine--are illegal in all 50 states. Other addictive
substances--such as tobacco and alcohol--may be legally
purchased, possessed, and consumed by a majority of Americans.
Other abusable substances--such as inhalants-- may be legally
purchased, possessed, and consumed by anybody. </p>

<p> o Does experimental use constitute abuse? Some maintain that
any use of an abusable or addictive substance constitutes abuse.
Others suggest that experimentation-- particularly with such
psychoactive substances as alcohol or tobacco that are available
for purchase by adults of legal age--is part of normal
development and does not necessarily have harmful consequences. </p>

<p> o In what context are substance abuse and addiction being
addressed? Four broad arenas that encounter substance abuse
related issues include: mass communications, criminal justice,
medicine, and public health. These entities often operate
independently of one another, and use substantially different
terms when describing the use of illicit substances or the
illegal use of licit substances (see appendix C). </p>

<p> Public Health Model </p>

<p> The traditional public health model incorporates the host-
agent-environment relationship. Each of these factors has an
individual, as well as an interrelated role in the potential use
and/or harmful use of a substance. Host factors may include
possible genetic, psychological, and biological susceptibility.
Agent factors incorporate the substance's abuse liability
capacity, as well as how the substance is marketed. Lastly,
environmental factors encompass not only the availability of the
substance, but the social, cultural, political, and economic
climate as well. The focus of the public health perspective is to
understand the importance social norms, environment, and
availability play in the shaping of alcohol- and drug-related
problems both on an individual and societal level. </p>

<p> The public health approach toward substance abuse has several
defining characteristics: </p>

<p> o The substance abuse problem is primarily one of health, and
risks for ill-health. In every recreational, mood- altering drug
user, use increases the risk of contracting one or more diseases
or conditions damaging to one's health. Drug use always creates
the potential, from great to small, for developing one or more
drug-related health problems. </p>

<p> o The legality or illegality of a drug is an artificial
barrier that is not as relevant as the health-related
considerations stemming from all types of drug use. Rather than
using legal/illegal, the public health approach categorizes drugs
by such characteristics as addictive potential and long-term
health risks. </p>

<p> o The drug abuse problem and the drug-related crime problem
are not one and the same. As two distinct, interrelated problems,
they have different, interrelated solutions. </p>

<p> o Dealing with the drug problem primarily as a moral problem
is considered inappropriate and counterproductive. </p>

<p> Medical Model </p>

<p> Within the fields of medicine, the two most frequently cited
texts for the definitions of substance abuse and dependence are
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
issued by the American Psychiatric Association and used widely in
American medical practice, and the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) published by the World Health Organization
(WHO). </p>

<p> The current ICD and DSM definitions of substance dependence
are nearly identical. However, the two manuals differ sharply on
the concepts of abuse, which DSM classifies as a maladaptive
pattern of substance use leading to impairment or distress, as
manifested by one or more of several events occurring over the
same 12-month period (e.g., failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home; recurrent substance-related
legal problems, such as arrests for substance-related disorderly
conduct. The current ICD-10 category of harmful use, while
applicable cross-culturally, is limited to a pattern of
psychoactive substance use that is causing damage to health. The
damage may be physical, as in cases of hepatitis from the
self-administration of injected drugs, or mental, such as
episodes of depressive disorder secondary to heavy consumption of
alcohol (see appendix C for a full discussion of DSM and ICD
definitions). </p>

<p> Criminal Justice Model </p>

<p> While it is well-known that many crimes are committed by
persons with substance use disorders and that these disorders can
be major contributors to their crimes, the criminal justice
system has no systematic policy for the evaluation of these
disorders. In many jurisdictions, whether federal, state, or
local, the prevailing sentiment is that any use of an illicit
substance and/or use of a licit substance in an illegal manner is
considered criminal abuse. A limited set of quantitative analyses
including blood, urine, and breath tests can be performed to
detect illegal levels of alcohol and/or the presence of illicit
substances. Besides the limited amount of testing and evaluation,
psychological screening examinations or structured interviews are
used infrequently to determine the level and severity of use,
abuse, or dependence. </p>

<p> For purposes of this report, OTA does not adopt any single
definition for the terms substance abuse or substance
addiction/dependence. The focus of this report, the underlying
causes of substance abuse and addiction, relates to each of the
definitions discussed above. </p>

<p> MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM </p>

<p> The abuse of licit and illicit drugs represents a major
public health problem in the United States. Abuse of alcohol and
other drugs has been associated with many problems (see figure
2-2) costing Americans an estimated $144.1 billion annually. </p>

<p> Federal survey data estimate that 11.4 million Americans aged
12 and older used illegal drugs in 1992, continuing a steady
decline from a peak of 24 million in 1979. Findings from the 1992
National Household Survey found the following about specific
drugs: </p>

<p> o Illegal drugs. Since 1979, overall rates of current use
(defined as use within the last 30 days) have dropped in all age
groups, except those aged 35 and older, whose use of drugs has
remained level. This has resulted in a general shift in the age
distribution of illegal drug users. In 1992, 23 percent of
illegal drug users were aged 35 and older, compared with only 10
percent in 1979. </p>

<p> o Cocaine. The number of cocaine users decreased 31 percent
from 1.9 million users in 1991 to 1.3 million in 1992. This is
down from a peak of 5.8 million in 1985. The number of occasional
users (defined as those who used the drug in 1992 but less often
than monthly) also continued a sharp decline from 4.3 million in
1991 to 3.4 million in 1992. This is down from a peak of 8.6
million in 1985. Frequent use of cocaine (defined as use on a
weekly basis) remained unchanged between 1991 and 1992. In fact,
no significant change has occurred in this number since it was
first estimated in 1985. </p>

<p> o Marijuana. This is the most common illegal drug--used by 78
percent of all illegal drug users in 1992. </p>

<p> o Other illegal drugs. No major changes in the prevalence of
the use of hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP), between 1991 and 1992. The survey
estimates that approximately 1.8 million Americans have used
heroin at least once. However, the data on these categories are
somewhat unreliable, as these users are less likely to be
contacted and reported in a household survey. </p>

<p> o Alcohol. In 1992, approximately 98 million persons over the
age of 12 had used alcohol in the last month, which is
approximately 48 percent of the population aged 12 and older.
This number is down from an estimated high of 106 million
drinkers in 1988. The number of heavy drinkers (defined as having
five or more drinks per occasion on five or more days in the past
month) has remained steady at an estimated 9 million people. </p>

<p> o Tobacco. An estimated 54 million Americans were smokers in
1992, a rate of 26 percent of the population aged 12 and older.
Cigarette smoking has declined since 1988, when an estimated 57
million Americans smoked cigarettes. </p>

<p> o Smokeless tobacco. An estimated 7.5 million Americans used
smokeless tobacco in 1992, the vast majority of whom (7.1
million) were males. </p>

<p> o Inhalants. The use of inhalants (e.g., gasoline, glue, and
nitrites) dropped slightly in 1992 as compared to 1991. </p>

<p> o Prescription drugs. The estimated current nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics (sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants, or
analgesics) dropped from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> The survey also provides demographic variables useful to
understanding substance use and abuse in the United States (see
box 2-3). However, these figures, as all data on drug use, are
suspect. Most surveys have strengths and weaknesses, which have
led stakeholders and policymakers to make widely divergent
conclusions based on the same sets of data. </p>

<p> MEASURING SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE </p>

<p> Like the old fable about blind men describing an elephant,
individual drug statistics usually tell us only part of the story
(13). Each survey provides useful information, but at the same
time, each survey is flawed. Currently, no single measurement can
by itself describe drug use and abuse in all its complexity.
Nonetheless, several useful indicators do provide information to
policymakers. </p>

<p> Three major national drug monitoring systems are the primary
data source for this review: The National Household Survey on
Drug Abuse (the Household Survey), the National Survey of High
School Seniors (the Seniors Survey), and the Drug Abuse Warning
Network (DAWN). These continuing data series have been sponsored
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) since the 1970s.
Supplementary data sources include the few small area studies
that compare drug use by poverty or income status and the Drug
Use Forecasting System (DUF), sponsored by the National Institute
of Justice, which provides quarterly estimates of drug use among
the criminal population in selected cities. </p>

<p> National Household Survey on Drug Abuse </p>

<p> Since 1974, NIDA has commissioned the Household Survey every
one to three years. The survey is based on a multistage random
sample of the household population in the 48 contiguous United
States. The sample excludes persons living in group quarters,
including institutions, prisons, military quarters, and college
dormitories, and those with no permanent address, including the
homeless. </p>

<p> Since 1985, a number of enhancements have been made to the
Household Survey. In 1985, blacks and Hispanics were oversampled
to provide additional cases for subgroup analyses, and new
measures of drug use frequency were introduced to identify
persons who used drugs monthly and weekly during the previous
year. In 1991, special supplementary samples were added for six
metropolitan areas with highly publicized drug problems.
Similarly, reports published since the early 1980s provide
greater detail on the demographic characteristics of users by
frequency of use. </p>

<p> National Survey of High School Seniors </p>

<p> Every year since 1975 researchers at the University of
Michigan have surveyed a nationally representative sample of
approximately 16,000 high school seniors. Beginning in 1976, a
followup survey of members from each graduating class, including
an over-sampling of drug users, has been conducted by mail. In
1990, the followup sample included young adults aged 19 to 32. </p>

<p> Drug Abuse Warning Network </p>

<p> DAWN, established in 1972, is the federal government's major
data system for tracking patterns and trends in the serious
health consequences of drug use. DAWN reports include statistics
on the total number of hospital emergency room visits (episodes),
separate counts of the number of drugs mentioned per episode
(drug mentions), and drug-related deaths. </p>

<p> Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the DAWN program focused
primarily on data from emergency rooms and medical examiners in
27 metropolitan areas. The selection of reporting facilities,
over 700 emergency rooms and 87 medical examiners by 1989, was
not random, however, and the number of facilities reporting
varied from year to year, with facilities in metropolitan areas
being overrepresented. Beginning in 1990, DAWN implemented a
national probability sample for the collection of drug-related
emergency room visit data to allow reporting of national as well
as metropolitan area information. </p>

<p> Drug Use Forecasting System </p>

<p> DUF, initiated in 1988 by the Department of Justice, provides
estimates of drug use among booked arrestees in selected cities
based on urinalysis tests. The tests, administered shortly after
arrest, measure very recent drug use among lawbreakers. Four
times a year, samples of about 250 male adult arrestees in
participating cities are tested; some areas also test female
arrestees and juveniles. The proportion of persons arrested
explicitly on drug charges is limited to 25 percent of the total
sample. </p>

<p> Limitations of the Data </p>

<p> The national drug monitoring surveys have several limitations
for studying drug use, abuse, and addiction: </p>

<p> o Most surveys rely on self-reporting. The results of such
surveys rely on the veracity of the person responding to the
survey. A major, and widely recognized, limitation in the
national surveys is that respondents may be unwilling or unable
to report their drug use accurately. Comparisons of self-report
and urinalysis results based on DUF data indicate that, among
arrestees, the tendency to underreport drug use is substantial
(12). As one Member of Congress noted, &quot;how in the hell can
you expect people who live in households to share with anybody,
let alone the government, how often they use drugs?&quot; (3). </p>

<p> o Surveys miss populations at risk for drug abuse.
TheHousehold Survey, by definition, excludes certain groups who
do not reside in households, such as the homeless and persons in
jail or prison. Although the excluded groups represent only 2
percent of the total population, drug use may be higher, or
different, among excluded groups such as the homeless and jail or
prison inmates. The Household Survey may also fail to capture
drug users within the target population. Although overall survey
response rates are high (82 percent in 1990), drugs users may
have been more difficult to locate and interview because their
lifestyles may involve irregular hours, avoiding authority, and
other behaviors that reduce the likelihood of survey response. In
addition, response rates tend to be generally lower among young
adults and residents of metropolitan and low-income areas, and
those not interviewed may be more likely to use drugs than those
who respond to the survey. </p>

<p> o Poverty indicators per se are not available. The national
drug monitoring systems contain very limited data on poverty, and
none that meet the official poverty definition (in 1991, the
poverty thresholds varied from $6,932 for a person living alone
to $27,942 for a family of nine or more members (6). The proxy
variables relating to employment, education, place of residence,
and race and ethnicity unsuccessfully separate the effects of
income from the effects of other correlated factors. Information
on drug use by income status is available only in the most recent
Household Surveys, and then only by family income without regard
to household size. More information is provided by the Household
Survey on other variables related to poverty, including
employment status, race and ethnicity, and neighborhood
characteristics. The Seniors Survey provides no income data. For
high school seniors, the only regularly reported indicators of
socioeconomic status are college plans and parental education. No
socioeconomic indicators are available for the followup sample of
young adults except current enrollment in college. Race and
ethnic status are not regularly reported for either sample, but
for high school seniors racial and ethnic patterns of drug use
are analyzed and published separately. DAWN has severe
limitations for an analysis of poverty and drug use. The only
indicators in DAWN related to poverty are race and ethnicity. No
data are available on income status of patients or the economic
status of areas served by the facility. </p>

<p> o Surveys may over- and underrepresent findings regarding
populations at risk for drug abuse. Populations at risk for both
poverty and drug abuse, for example, are excluded or
underrepresented in the major surveys and overrepresented in
reports from hospital emergency rooms. These problems mean that
the findings from these surveys are suggestive rather than
definitive (see box 2-4). </p>

<p> o Drug measures focus on use, rather than abuse or addiction.
The common measures of drug use employed by the Household and
Seniors Surveys--lifetime, past year, and past month use--are
insufficiently refined to distinguish between casual and
dependent drug use. Definitions of alcohol, drug abuse, and
dependency --such as those set forth in DSM (1)-- link the
quantity and frequency of use to indications of persistent,
uncontrolled consumption, impaired social and psychological
functioning as a result of use, and physical problems including
withdrawal symptoms. No published estimates of the number of drug
users meeting medical criteria for abuse or dependence by poverty
indicators are available, with the single exception of the DAWN
estimates of emergency room contacts for dependency, which are
reported by race and ethnicity. </p>

<p> o The surveys include few multivariate analyses. Since the
surveys do not examine variables while controlling for factors
related to drug use, an accurate link of drug use with the role
of income, race, education, and place of residence is impossible.
The dearth of such analyses results in part from sample size
limitations and in part from the fact that secondary analyses of
the national survey data have not been encouraged. </p>

<p> ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE REPORT </p>

<p> This report has four parts: necessary preconditions,
individual factors, community contexts, and policy options. </p>

<p> The first part, Necessary Preconditions (chs. 3-5), focuses
on several factors necessary for substance abuse to occur. The
second part, Individual Factors (ch. 6), explores research
conducted on risk and protective factors thought to be indicators
in assessing an individual's substance use, abuse, and addiction.
The third part, Activity Settings (chs. 7 and 8), looks at how
risk and protective factors play out in various population
subgroups and in various community settings (home, school,
workplace, recreation, and neighborhood). The fourth section,
Policy Options (ch. 9), addresses the range of legislative issues
and options for Congress arising from chapters 3 through 8. </p>

<p> This report focuses on factors that contribute to or protect
against substance abuse and addiction, and the implications for
prevention. It does not address in any depth drug treatment or
law enforcement issues and interventions. Based on the
literatures reviewed by OTA about causes and prevention, however,
it is clear that comprehensive prevention strategies will
generally need drug treatment and law enforcement components, if
they are to be effective. While drawing on data from federal
antidrug prevention programs, the effectiveness of such
approaches needs to be studied in greater depth than was possible
in this report. </p>

<p> This report is the second and final publication of this
assessment. The first publication, a background report on
Biological Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction, described
genetic, pharmacological, and abuse liability research issues
(9). Readers are also referred to earlier OTA reports that
address issues related to drug interdiction efforts (10);
alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse prevention and services issues
in adolescent health (7); the effectiveness of drug abuse
treatment in controlling AIDS/HIV infection (11); and alternative
coca reduction strategies (8).<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 2-1: Root Causes: Two Views From the Political Arena </p>

<p> &quot;Many states and cities are on shoe-string budgets and
must provide services and alternatives to substance abuse in
local communities. The failure to address the fundamental causes
of substance abuse and to provide immediate intervention
strategies will impact city residents most... The committee
recommends that the National Drug Control Strategy be framed by
broader social and economic problems which require dramatic
reforms in order to attack the root causes of substance abuse. We
need to begin to build the infrastructure necessary to improve
the quality of treatment services by requiring medical schools to
provide comprehensive training to identify and treat substance
abusers; provide adequate treatment services at the community
level, including after care, vocational, educational, and
psychiatric assessments; and develop alternative leisure
activities for youth and adults to replace `street life' and
assist individuals to escape the drug culture.&quot; </p>

<p> House Committee on Government Operations committee report </p>

<p> &quot;One of [the Democrats'] tactics was to talk about the
root causes of drug use, the `deeper and more profound problems,'
as they put it, of homelessness, poverty, helplessness, and the
like. The elites liked this shift in emphasis, too. It took the
discussion away from moral considerations to the (for them) more
comfortable ground of social theory. They wanted to talk about
`hopelessness' as a condition caused by lack of government
involvement. We talked about hopelessness, too, but talked about
it as a condition caused by social decomposition and the
breakdown of the family and a lack of law and order in these
communities . . . I found it shocking and disappointing that when
we argued for more police, jails, courts, and prisons because of
the exploding crime epidemic in some of America's inner cities,
some people responded by saying, `But what are the root causes of
this? `That's an interesting debate which should go on at an
elite university. But if there are drug dealers going around
shooting people in the affluent suburbs, the citizenry will not
call for a seminar on root causes. They will raise hell and
demand that the dealers be arrested. And they are right to do
so.&quot; </p>

<p> BOX 2-2: Overview of Alcohol and Some Other Psychoactive
Substances <br>
</p>

<p> Class of psychoactive substance(a) Description(b) </p>

<p> ALCOHOL (ethyl alcohol) </p>

<p> Alcohol, one of the most widely used of all drugs, is a
central nervous system depressant with effects similar to those
of sedative-hypnotic compounds (see below). At low doses, alcohol
may be associated with behavioral excitation thought to be due to
the depression of inhibitory neurons in the brain. Alcohol
differs from sedative-hypnotic compounds in that it is used
primarily for recreation or social rather than medical purposes. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Beer. 2. Wine. 3. &quot;Hard&quot; liquor (e.g., whiskey,
gin).<br>
</p>

<p> SEDATIVES, HYPNOTICS, OR ANXIOLYTICS Sedative-hypnotics are
drugs of diverse chemical structure that exert a nonselective
general depressant on the central nervous system. In addition,
they reduce metabolism in a variety of tissues in the body,
depressing any system that uses energy. Depending on the dose,
any sedative hypnotic compound may be classified as a sedative
(an agent that allays excitement), a tranquilizer (an antianxiety
agent), a hypnotic (a sleep-inducing agent), or an anesthetic (an
agent that eliminates pain). Sedative-hypnotics are used
medically as sedatives, anxiolytics (antianxiety agents),
hypnotics, antiepileptics, muscle relaxants, and general
anesthetics. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Barbiturates (&quot;downers&quot; or &quot;barbs&quot;):
pentobarbital sodium[NembutalR], secobarbital sodium [SeconalR],
amobarbital [AmytalR]--taken orally. </p>

<p> 2. Nonbarbiturate hypnotics: methaqualone [QuaaludesR]--
taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Tranquilizers: diazepam [ValiumR], chlordiazepoxide
hydrochloride [LibriumR]--taken orally.<br>
</p>

<p> CANNABIS (THC) THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) the active agent in
marijuana, alters perceptions, concentration, emotions, and
behavior, though the mechanisms of action are not entirely clear.
Researchers have found, however, that THC changes the way in
which sensory information is processed by the brain. It can be
used medically to relieve nausea and side effects of chemotherapy
in cancer patients; it is very rarely used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Marijuana (&quot;pot&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;)--smoked
or eaten. 2. Hashish (&quot;hash&quot;)--smoked or eaten. 3.
Hashish oil (&quot;hash oil&quot;)--smoked (mixed with tobacco.
4. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-- taken orally in capsules.<br>
</p>

<p> NICOTINE Nicotine, obtained naturally from tobacco, is a
central nervous system stimulant.(c) It exerts its action
secondary to stimulation of certain cholinergic (excitatory)
synapses both within the brain and in the peripheral nervous
system. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cigarettes. 2. Smokeless tobacco (e.g., snuff or chewing
tobacco). <br>
</p>

<p> COCAINE Cocaine, obtained naturally from coca leaves, is a
potent central nervous system stimulant.(c) It stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system, which regulates the activity of
cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. It also produces
bronchodilation in the lungs. It is used medically as a topical
anesthetic for surgical procedures. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Cocaine hydrochloride powder (&quot;coke&quot; or
&quot;street cocaine&quot;)--usually snorted or injected
intravenously.d </p>

<p> 2. Cocaine alkaloid (&quot;freebase&quot; or
&quot;crack&quot;)--smoked.e <br>
</p>

<p> AMPHETAMINES AND RELATED STIMULANTSf 1. Amphetamines
Amphetamines are a group of three closely related compounds, all
of which are potent central nervous system and behavioral
stimulants.(c) Some amphetamines are used medically to treat
attention deficit disorder or minimal brain dysfunction in
children, narcolepsy (recurrent, uncontrollable, brief episodes
of sleep), or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Amphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;uppers&quot;
(BenzedrineR]--taken orally, injected, or snorted.(g) </p>

<p> 2. Methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot; or &quot;crystal
meth&quot; or &quot;ice&quot;) [MethadrineR]--taken orally,
injected, or snorted.(g,h) </p>

<p> 3. Dextroamphetamine [DexedrineR]--taken orally, or injected.
<br>
</p>

<p> 2. Nonamphetamine stimulants Like amphetamines,
nonamphetamine stimulates are central nervous and behavioral
stimulants. Some non-amphetamine stimulants (e.g., PreludinR) are
used for weight control, and some (e.g., RitalinR and CylertR)
are used medically to treat hyperactivity, minimal brain
dysfunction, narcolepsy, or (rarely) depression. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Pheumetrazine hydrochloride [PreludinR]--taken orally or
injected.d </p>

<p> 2. Methylphenidate hydrochloride injected.d </p>

<p> 3. Pemoline [CylertR]--taken orally. [RitalinR]--taken
orally, or injected.(d) </p>

<p> HALLUCINOGENS Hallucinogens, or psychedelics, are a
heterogeneous group of compounds that affect a person's
perceptions, sensations, thinking, self-awareness, and
emotions.(i) </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or
&quot;acid&quot;--taken orally or put in the eyes. </p>

<p> 2. Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethylox- phenylethyl amide) or
&quot;mesc&quot; and peyote--disks chewed, swallowed, or smoked;
tablets taken orally. </p>

<p> 3. Psilocybin (&quot;magic mushrooms&quot;)--chewed and
swallowed. 4. MDMA (methylene dioxymethamphetamine)--taken
orally. </p>

<p> INHALANTS Inhalants are chemicals that produce psychoactive
vapors. Although different in makeup, nearly all of the abused
inhalants produce effects similar to those of anesthetics, which
act to slow down the body's functions or produce feelings of
dizziness. At low doses, users may feel slightly stimulated. Amyl
nitrite is used for heart patients because it dilates the blood
vessels and increases blood supply to the heart. There are no
medical indications for most of the inhalants. </p>

<p> Examples </p>

<p> 1. Solvents (model airplane glue, nail polish remover,
lighter and cleaning fluids, and gasoline)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 2. Aerosols (e.g., paints, hairsprays)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 3. Some anesthetics (e.g.,nitrous oxide)--vapors inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Amyl nitrite (&quot;snappers&quot; or &quot;poppers&quot;)
and butyl nitrite (&quot;rush&quot;)--vapors inhaled.<br>
</p>

<p> OPIATES (NARCOTICS) AND RELATED ANALGESICS Opiates are
natural or synthetic drugs that, like morphine, a substance
derived from the opium poppy, have analgesic (pain-relieving)
properties. Heroin is not approved for medical uses in the United
States. The major medical use of other opiates is for the relief
of pain (i.e., as analgesics); some narcotics are used to relieve
coughing (i.e., as antitussives) or to treat diarrhea. Methadone
is used in the treatment of narcotic abstinence syndromes and as
an analgesic in terminal illness.<br>
</p>

<p> 1. Heroin (&quot;smack&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;)--
injected, smoked, or inhaledd. </p>

<p> 2. Codeine (codeine sulfate)--taken orally or injected.d </p>

<p> 3. Morphine (morphine hydrochloride)--injected, smoked, or
inhaled. </p>

<p> 4. Synthetic opiates (e.g., methadone [DolophineR]);
hydromorphone hydrochloride [DilaudidR], meperidine hydrochloride
[DemerolR], oxycodone and asprin [PercodanR]-- taken orally or
injected. </p>

<p> PCP (PHENCYCLIDINE) AND SIMILARLY ACTING SYMPHATHOMIMETICS </p>

<p> Phencycyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, alters the
functions of the neocortex and has been called a dissociative
anesthetic. It was developed in the 1950s as an anesthetic but
was subsequently taken off the market in 1967 when it was
discovered that the drug caused hallucinations in some people.(j)
PCP is now used legally only in veterinary medicine as an
immobilizing agent. </p>

<p> PCP (&quot;angel dust&quot; or &quot;lovely&quot;)--taken
orally, or smoked (sprayed on joints or cigarettes).(d) </p>

<p> ______________ (a) According to Julien, one could conceivably
classify psychoactive drugs by at least three methods: 1)
mechanism of action, 2) chemical structure, and 3) behavioral
effects. Probably the most useful approach would be to classify
them by mechanism of action, but knowledge of the brain's
physiology is too limited for this approach to be comprehensive.
A limitation of the second approach is that many drugs of
apparently similar structure exert quite different effects, and
many drugs of dissimilar structure exert quite similar effects.
The classification in this table largely reflects the behavioral
effects approach. The classification used here is based on the
categories in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., revised.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, all of the
classes of psychoactive substances listed in this box except
nicotine are associated with both abuse and dependence. Nicotine
is associated with dependence but not abuse. </p>

<p> (b) The potential physiological, psychological, and
behavioral effects of using the psychoactive substance shown are
discussed in the sources listed below. The consequences depend in
part on the specific drug used, the dosage level and mode of
administration. </p>

<p> (c) Central nervous system stimulants are drugs that can
elevate mood, increase alertness, reduce fatigue, provide a sense
of increased energy, decrease appetite, and improve task
performance. They can also produce anxiety, insomnia, and
irritability. The drugs differ widely in their molecular
structures and mechanisms of action. </p>

<p> (d) According to the American Psychiatric Association, the
route of administration of a psychoactive substance is an
important variable in determining whether use will lead to
dependence or abuse. In general, routes of administration that
produce more efficient absorption of the substance in the blood
stream (e.g., intravenous injection) tend to increase the
likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance uses that leads
to dependence. Routes that quickly deliver psychoactive
substances to the brain (e.g., smoking or intravenous injection)
are associated with higher levels of consumption and with an
increased likelihood of toxic effects. Use of contaminated
needles for intravenous administration of amphetamines, cocaine,
and opiates can cause hepatitis, HIV infection, and other
illnesses. </p>

<p> (e) Freebase cocaine is a form of cocaine made by converting
&quot;street cocaine&quot; (cocaine hydrochloride) to a purified
base that is smoked. The effect of smoking freebase is similar to
that of intravenous injection but smoking provides a shorter more
intense high than sniffing or ingestion because of the rapid
absorption of the drug through the lungs. &quot;Crack
cocaine&quot; is the street name given to freebase cocaine that
has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a chemical base
by cooking it with baking soda and water. The term crack refers
to the cracking sound that is heard when the mixture is smoked
(heated), presumably due to the sodium bicarbonate. </p>

<p> (f) Describing a drug as a stimulant does not adequately
describe its properties. Drug use surveys typically mean
amphetamines when they use the word stimulants. Some surveys
regard as stimulants both prescription (amphetamines) and
nonprescription substances (e.g., caffeine-based compounds used
in No-Doz, diet pills, and &quot;fake pep pills&quot;). Cocaine
and nicotine (described above) are also central nervous system
simulants. </p>

<p> (g) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
designer drugs are structural analogs of substances scheduled
under the Controlled Substances Act that are prepared by
underground chemists to mimic the psychoactive effects of
controlled substances or produce other psychoactive effects.
Because such analogs are not identical to their parent compound,
their manufacture and distribution does not violate the law. As
of June 1986, there were synthetic analogs of PCP, fentanyl and
meperidine, and amphetamine and methamphetamine. </p>

<p> (h) In the past, abuse of methamphetamine had been in the
form of tablets or intravenous injection. More recently,
&quot;ice&quot; (one of the common street names for
d-methamphetamine hydrochloride) has gained popularity in a form
suitable for smoking. </p>

<p> (i) Most of the agents in this class of drugs can induce
hallucinations if the dose is high enough. But the term
hallucinogen does not adequately describe the range of
pharmacological actions of the diverse group of substances
usually included in the class. The term psychedelic was proposed
by Osmond in 1957 to imply that these agents all have the ability
to alter the sensory perception and thus may be considered
&quot;mind expanding.&quot; The effects of hallucinogens are
unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the user's
personality, mood and expectations, and the surroundings in which
the drug is used. </p>

<p> (j) PCP is considered a hallucinogen in some surveys of drug
use.<br>

<p> BOX 2-3: Household Survey Demographic Portrait According to
the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse:o Illegal drug
use is most prevalent in the 18- to 25-yearage group.o Most
illegal drug users are in the white population (76percent of all
current users or 8.7 million people).o Men have a higher rate of
current illegal drug use thanwomen.o Illegal drug use is highly
correlated with educationalstatus. Those who had not completed
high school had thehighest rate of use.o Unemployed people are
twice as likely as employed peopleto be using illegal drugs.o The
prevalence of illegal drug use in large metropolitancities is
slightly higher than in nonmetropolitan areas.SOURCE: Office of

<p> BOX 2-4: Two Contrasting Surveys Measuring Cocaine Use </p>

<p> Because of populations not represented in the Household
Surveys (including homeless, run-away children, and
institutionalized populations such as the incarcerated), the
surveys may greatly underestimate the involvement of the poor in
drug use. Two years ago, for example, Abt Associates conducted a
study to determine the number of heavy cocaine users in the
United States. Two measures of heavy cocaine use were employed,
both of which measured use of cocaine in the very recent past.
Estimates of the number of regular weekly cocaine users from the
1990 Household Survey were compared to estimates of the number of
recent cocaine users based on urinalysis tests of arrestees from
the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program. DUF urinalysis tests were
conducted at the time of booking, and the results measured
cocaine use during the day or two before arrest. DUF estimates
therefore measured the prevalence of very recent drug use among
those involved with the criminal justice system in selected major
cities. </p>

<p> The two data systems generated significantly different
estimates. From the Household Survey, Abt estimated that there
were about 662,000 heavy cocaine users in this country in 1990.
This is substantially lower than the Abt estimate of 1.709
million heavy cocaine users derived from DUF data. Reasons for
the differences include both possible underreporting on the
Household Survey and the fact that many heavy cocaine users may
be excluded from the household population or may be exceedingly
difficult to locate and interview. Overall, the study indicated
that approximately two-thirds of the heavy cocaine users in this
country are not counted by the Household Survey and that
approximately 87 percent of all heavy cocaine users are involved
with the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 3 BIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction are complex phenomena that defy
simple explanation or description. A tangled interaction of
factors contribute to an individual's seeking out, use, and
perhaps subsequent abuse of drugs. Since more individuals
experiment with drugs than eventually develop substance abuse
problems, great interest persists in understanding what
differentiates these groups. Factors that can play a role in drug
abuse susceptibility include a person's psychological makeup
(e.g., self-esteem, propensity to take risks, impulsivity,
depression), biological response to drugs, environmental
situation (e.g., peer groups, family organization, socioeconomic
status), and the availability of drugs. The exact combination of
elements that lead to substance abuse varies among individuals. <br>
</p>

<p> Underlying all substance use, abuse and addiction are the
actions and effects that drugs of abuse exert. For a complete
understanding of drug abuse and addiction one must address how
drugs affect the brain, why certain drugs have the potential for
being abused, and what, if any, biological differences exist
among individuals in their susceptibility to abuse drugs. While
many other factors ultimately contribute to an individual's
drug-taking behavior, understanding the biological components is
crucial in understanding substance abuse, addiction, and
dependency.<br>
</p>

<p> Two biological factors contribute to substance use, abuse,
and addiction: the effects drugs of abuse exert on a person; and
the biological status of the individual taking drugs. The former
relates to the acute mechanisms of action of drugs in the brain
and the long-term effects that occur after chronic exposure. The
latter pertains to an individual's biological constitution, most
importantly the presence of inherited characteristics that affect
that person's response to a drug.<br>
</p>

<p> The biological mechanisms of substance abuse are complex and
interactive. A previously published background paper by the
Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) entitled Biological
Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction thoroughly discusses
the basic concepts, neuropharmacology, and genetics of drug
abuse. This chapter is a synopsis of the background paper.<br>
</p>

<p> DRUG ACTION <br>
</p>

<p> Acute Actions <br>
</p>

<p> Drugs of abuse alter the brain's normal balance and level of
biochemical activity (see box 3-1). In order to have these
affects, a drug must first reach the brain. This is accomplished
by the drug diffusing from the circulatory system into the brain.
The routes of administration, methods by which a drug enters the
bloodstream, affect how quickly a drug penetrates the brain. The
chemical structure of a drug plays an important role in the
ability of a drug to cross from the circulatory system into the
brain. The four main routes of administration for drugs of abuse
are oral, nasal, intravenous, and inhalation. With oral
ingestion, the drug must be absorbed by the stomach or gut which
results in a delay before effects become apparent. When the nasal
route of administration is used, effects are usually felt within
3 minutes, as the capillary rich mucous membranes of the nose
rapidly absorb substances into the bloodstream. Intravenous
administration usually produces effects in 1/2 to 2 minutes and
is slowed only by the detour back through the lungs that venous
blood must take to reach the brain. Lastly, the inhalation method
bypasses the venous system completely because the drug is
absorbed into the pulmonary circulation which goes directly from
the lungs to the heart and then to the brain. As a result,
effects are felt within 5 to 10 seconds, making inhalation the
fastest route of administration. The route of administration can
determine the drug's potency and the efficacy the drug will have
on affecting brain activity, thereby contributing to the abuse
potential of the drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Distinct from other psychoactive agents, drugs of abuse, in
part, affect those areas of the brain that mediate feelings of
pleasure and reward (see box 3-2). Evidence is accumulating that
positive sensations experienced during these activities are
mediated by the brain reward system. Studies have shown that
direct stimulation of the areas of the brain involved in the
reward system, in the absence of any goal-seeking behavior,
produces extreme pleasure that has strong reinforcing properties
in its own right (48,60). Animals with electrodes implanted in
these areas in such a way that electrical impulses produce a
pleasurable sensation will repeatedly press a bar, or do any
other required task, to receive electrical stimulation. The fact
that animals will forego food and drink or will willingly
experience a painful stimulus to receive stimulation of the
reward system attests to the powerful reinforcing characteristics
of the reward system. Most drugs of abuse, either directly or
indirectly, are presumed to affect the brain reward system.<br>
</p>

<p> Inducing activity in the brain reward system gives drugs of
abuse positive reinforcing actions that support their continued
use and abuse. Drug reinforcement is defined as increasing the
behavior that led to the taking of the drug. Put more simply,
individuals who use drugs experience some effect, such as
pleasure, detachment, or relief from distress which initially
establishes and then maintains drug self-administration. The
consequence of taking the drug enhances the probability that it
will continue to be used for some real or perceived effect and,
hence, tends to lead to continued compulsive self-administration.
In fact, the ability of a drug to support self-administration in
experimental animals is a measure of the drug's strength as a
reinforcer.<br>
</p>

<p> While growing evidence suggests that the brain reward system
plays a role in the reinforcing properties of most drugs of
abuse, the precise mechanisms involved are complex, vary among
substances, and have yet to be completely described (41,42,43).
For example, while some drugs of abuse directly affect the
chemical release of dopamine (see box 3-3), the interactions of
other neurotransmitters such as gamma amino butyric acid (GABA),
opioid peptides, and serotonin may also be important.<br>
</p>

<p> Chronic Actions <br>
</p>

<p> Chronic, long-term exposure to drugs of abuse can cause
changes in the brain that may take weeks, months, and possibly
years, to reverse once drug use has stopped.<br>
</p>

<p> Most drugs of abuse have complex actions in the brain and
other parts of the body resulting in a variety of behavioral
effects. In general, tolerance develops to many of the effects of
drugs of abuse and a withdrawal syndrome occurs on cessation
after prolonged use. However, the details of these phenomena vary
from drug to drug, and the specific details of the biological
mechanisms that underlie these phenomena are not completely
understood. Recent advances in neuroscience research have begun
to unravel how neuroadaptive responses manifest themselves for
various drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Tolerance to a drug develops when, following a prolonged
period of use, more of the drug is required to produce a given
effect (33,38). This response occurs with many types of drugs. It
is a common, but unnecessary, characteristic of drug abuse (see
box 3-4). For example, while tolerance develops to some of the
effects of cocaine and amphetamines, sensitization can also occur
to some of their other effects. Also, while it is unclear from
available data whether tolerance develops to cocaine's
reinforcing effects, the notion is supported by some experimental
evidence and anecdotal reports from cocaine users that the drug's
euphoric action diminishes with repeated use. In a recent study,
it has been shown that acute tolerance to dopamine response is
induced by binge patterns of cocaine administration in male rats
(51). Tolerance develops to most of the effects, including the
reinforcing properties, of opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p> Sensitization, the opposite of tolerance, occurs when the
effects of a given dose of a drug increase after repeated, but
intermittent, administration. Sensitization to a drug's effects
can play a significant role in supporting drug- taking behavior.<br>
</p>

<p> Dependence is a type of neuroadaptation to drug exposure.
With prolonged use of a drug, cells in the brain adapt to its
presence such that the drug is required to maintain normal cell
function. On abrupt withdrawal of the drug, the cell behaves
abnormally and a withdrawal syndrome ensues. Generally, the
withdrawal syndrome is characterized by a series of signs and
symptoms that are opposite to those of the drug's acute effects.
For example, withdrawal of sedative drugs produce excitation and
irritability. Conversely, withdrawal of stimulants produces
profound depression.<br>
</p>

<p> The magnitude of the withdrawal syndrome varies from drug to
drug. Although the severity varies, withdrawal is associated with
the cessation of use of most drugs of abuse. Opiates, cocaine,
amphetamines, barbiturates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines produce
pronounced and sometimes severe withdrawal symptoms
(20,24,56,68,74) while those for nicotine and caffeine are less
intense (1,31). A mild withdrawal episode is associated with
discontinued cannabis use, while none is associated with lysergic
acid diethylamide (LSD) use (12,63). No matter the severity of
the physical withdrawal syndrome, its existence can create a
craving or desire for the drug and dependence can play a very
strong role in recurrent patterns of relapse and maintaining
drug-seeking behavior to forestall withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> At one time, withdrawal was believed to peak within several
hours after drug-taking was discontinued and then dissipate;
similarly, common knowledge held that tolerance to most drugs was
thought to dissipate gradually with time, as the brain readapted
to the drug's disappearance. Substantial evidence now indicates
that persistent, residual neuroadaptations are present, which can
last for months or possibly years, and may or may not be
associated with the pathways that mediate physical dependence
(33,44,45,77). An important component of this phenomena may be
the learning which takes place during drug-taking behavior.
Moreover, with repeated cycles of abstinence and reinitiation of
drug use, the time required to elicit drug dependence grows
shorter and shorter. Evidence also indicates that the
administration of naloxone, a drug that blocks the actions of
opiates, may elicit a withdrawal syndrome in individuals who have
abstained from use for extended periods of time. These data
indicate the existence of long-lasting, drug- induced
neuroadaptive changes that persist for as yet undefined periods
of time. Although information explaining this effect is lacking,
these changes may help account for the relapses that sometimes
occur in long-term abstinent, drug-dependent individuals. <br>
</p>

<p> Abuse Liability <br>
</p>

<p> The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act
(Public Law 91-513) and the Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978
(Public Law 95-633) gives exclusive authority to the Secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services to determine the
abuse liability of substances and to make recommendations
concerning substance regulation and other drug policy decisions.
Although the Secretary receives advice from the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and
various other regulatory agencies, these laws explicitly state
that the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) must provide to
the Secretary information relevant to the abuse potential of
suspected drugs of abuse and all facts key to an assessment of
their abuse potential. On the basis of this information from
NIDA, and input from FDA and DEA, the Secretary makes a judgment
as to the dependence potential of new drugs. NIDA supports a
variety of activities in commercial and private laboratories
around the country to provide this information. <br>
</p>

<p> A drug's abuse liability is measured by the likelihood that
its use will result in drug addiction. Many factors ultimately
play a role in an individual's drug-taking behavior;
nevertheless, the abuse potential of a drug is related to its
intrinsic rewarding properties and/or the presumed neuroadaptive
motivational effects that result from its prolonged use. Drugs
can be tested and screened for their abuse liability in animals.
Four criteria can be evaluated to classify a drug as having
significant abuse potential:<br>
</p>

<p> o pharmacological equivalence to known drugs of abuse,<br>
</p>

<p> o demonstration of reinforcing effects,<br>
</p>

<p> o tolerance, and<br>
</p>

<p> o physical dependence.<br>
</p>

<p> The capacity to produce reinforcing effects is essential to
any drug with significant abuse potential, whereas tolerance and
physical dependence often occur but are not absolutely required
to make such a determination.<br>
</p>

<p> Testing new pharmaceuticals for their abuse potential is an
important step in new drug development. Many major pharmaceutical
firms today emphasize the development of new and safer drugs for
pain reduction and in the development of psychoactive compounds
for treatment of brain disorders. In particular, scientific
strides in understanding the brain, neurological disease,
psychiatric disturbances, and aging are fueling research into
treatment of brain disorders. As psychoactive compounds become
available, they must be screened for abuse potential. The abuse
liability assessment of new products is not simply at the
discretions of the manufacturer. Various federal regulatory laws
mandate such testing and federal regulatory agencies are charged
with seeing that testing is carried out. The College on Problems
of Drug Dependence (CPDD), and, specifically, its Drug Evaluation
Committee (DEC), provides the majority of abuse liability testing
information to NIDA.<br>
</p>

<p> Animal models are generally used to screen for the abuse
potential of new drugs in earlier stages of drug development or
to evaluate abuse potential in drugs that cannot be readily
studied in humans (2). Laboratory methods for abuse potential
evaluation in humans are also well developed and is an area of
active research (21). However, factors such as the heterogeneity
of drug-using populations, the use of multiple drugs, and the
other biological, social, and environmental factors involved in
human drug use make human studies complex.<br>
</p>

<p> In terms of the validity of animal models as a means of
studying human drug addiction, an excellent correlation exists
between predicting the abuse liability of specific classes of
drugs in animals and humans (34). However, it is recognized that
animal models are imperfect and, in fact, there are examples of
drugs that proved to have significant abuse potential in humans,
whereas the preclinical testing in animals revealed relatively
minimal abuse potential (9,33,38). The ultimate answer to the
issue of whether a drug has significant abuse potential is
long-term experience with the drug once it has become available,
either legally or illegally. Nevertheless, animal models serve as
the only practical means of initially screening drugs for abuse
liability and have proven to be the most effective means of
detecting whether there is likely to be a problem in humans.<br>
</p>

<p> Self-Administration <br>
</p>

<p> The predominant feature of all drugs with significant
addiction-producing properties is that they are self-
administered. In fact, self-administration of a drug to the point
when the behavior becomes detrimental to the individual is the
primary criterion for classifying a drug as having significant
abuse potential for addiction. In addition to
self-administration, another contributing factor to abuse
liability is the notion of craving (9,33,38). Although craving is
a difficult term to quantify, once a drug is voluntarily or
involuntarily withdrawn, the increased desire to take the drug
can play a role in the relapse to substance abuse. As previously
mentioned, the reinforcing properties of the drug may shift the
pattern of administration established during the initial, early
phase of drug?addiction. Specifically, the drug may have
initially been self-administered for its pleasurable effects but
may eventually be self-administered to relieve the discomfort
associated with withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> Animals can be readily trained to self-administer drugs in a
variety of settings (9). Animal models of self- administration
provide a powerful tool that can give a good indication of the
abuse liability of new or unknown drugs. These models also permit
examination of the behavioral, physiological, and biological
factors leading to sustained self-administration.<br>
</p>

<p> Drug Discrimination <br>
</p>

<p> Another tool in the assessment of abuse liability of drugs is
drug discrimination, which refers to the perception of the
effects of drugs (3,9). Specifically, animals or humans trained
to discriminate a drug from a placebo show a remarkable ability
to discriminate it from other drugs with different properties.
These procedures also permit a determination of whether the
subject considers the drug to be the pharmacological equivalent
of another drug. Pharmacological equivalence refers to the fact
that drugs of particular classes, such as opiates, stimulants,
and depressants cause a series of affects on the brain and other
organs which collectively constitute their pharmacological
profile. Drug discrimination provides a useful measure in animals
to assess the subjective effects of drugs in humans.<br>
</p>

<p> Dependence and Tolerance <br>
</p>

<p> Physical dependence and tolerance to drugs of abuse can
readily be induced in animals by chronic administration of these
drugs (37,38). Following abrupt cessation of these drugs, a
withdrawal syndrome will often develop and, if given the
opportunity, self-administration rates will be increased.
Furthermore, since the understanding of the biological changes
which take place during the development of physical dependence
and tolerance are poorly understood in humans, with the possible
exception of opiate dependency (45), animal models offer a unique
opportunity to carry out experiments designed to address these
issues.<br>
</p>

<p> GENETIC FACTORS <br>
</p>

<p> Why does one person abuse or become dependent on drugs while
another, exposed to a similar environment and experiences, does
not? To date, the majority of biomedical research has focused on
the role, if any, that genetics plays in individual
susceptibility to substance abuse and dependence. There is
growing interest, however, in researching other factors that
effect a person's biological status. For example, nutrition,
biological development, in utero experiences, early exposure to
environmental lead, head injuries, and other environmental
components, can modify individual neurophysiology. Thus, while
this section features genetics, there are many other factors that
can influence individual biological susceptibility to the effects
of a drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Progress in understanding the genetics of various conditions
and diseases has brought with it a realization that substance
abuse and addiction probably involve a genetic component. That
is, hereditary biological differences among individuals may make
some more or less susceptible to drug dependency than others.
However, a genetic component alone is undoubtedly insufficient to
precipitate substance abuse and addiction. Unlike disorders such
as Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis that result from the
presence of alterations in a single gene, any genetic component
of substance abuse is likely to involve multiple genes that
control various aspects of the biological response to drugs,
individual temperament, and the propensity to engage in
risk-taking behaviors, or physiological predisposition to become
an abuser. In addition, the involvement of many behavioral and
environmental factors indicates that any genetic component acts
in consort with other nongenetic risk factors to contribute to
the development of substance abuse and addiction. Thus, the
presence or absence of a genetic factor neither ensures drug
addiction nor precludes it. Two questions arise when considering
a genetic component to substance abuse and addiction. Do
inherited factors exist? If so, what are they? To date, most of
the work done in this field is related to alcoholism; much less
is known about the genetics of other drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Do Inherited Factors Exist? <br>
</p>

<p> Results from family, twin, and adoption studies as well as
extensive research on animal models indicate that there are
heritable influences on patterns of alcohol use. Animal studies
using selective breeding techniques have established that alcohol
preference, the reinforcing actions of alcohol, alcohol
tolerance, and alcohol physical dependence can be affected by
genetic factors. Although fewer studies have examined the genetic
component of vulnerability to the addictive properties of other
drugs of abuse, evidence from animal studies confirms the role of
a genetic influence on the use and abuse of drugs other than
alcohol. To study nonalcoholic drug abuse in humans has been
difficult because of substantially lower population prevalence
and marked changes in availability and, hence, exposure to these
substances. Investigation in this area is further hampered by the
complexity of subjects' drug use--most drug abusers have used
(and had problems from using) multiple substances. This has led
researchers either to concentrate on one class of drug or to
treat all illicit drug use as equivalent. The tendency to lump
all illicit drugs into one category makes results difficult to
interpret or compare.<br>
</p>

<p> Family Studies: Alcoholism <br>
</p>

<p> References to a familial tendency or hereditary
&quot;taint&quot; of alcoholism date back to classical times
(23). Family studies have repeatedly confirmed that the risk of
alcoholism is higher among first-degree relatives (i.e., parents,
siblings, children) of alcoholics as compared with the general
population (54). Moreover, while family studies can establish
that a disorder (or liability to a disorder) is transmitted, in
general they fail to distinguish between biological and
environmental transmission. This issue, however, can be evaluated
in large family studies by analyzing multiple classes of
relatives with differing degrees of genetic relatedness.<br>
</p>

<p> Results of numerous family studies indicate that alcoholism
segregates within families, with male first-degree relatives of
alcoholics having a higher incidence (ranging from 27 to 54
percent) than female first-degree relatives (6 to 17 percent) as
compared to first-degree relatives of nonalcoholics (20 percent
of males, 4 percent of females) (26,66,76). In fitting models of
inheritance to family data, researchers concluded that observed
patterns of inheritance were consistent with the hypothesis that
familial factors predisposing to alcoholism were the same in men
and women, but that nonfamilial environmental factors exerted
more influence in the development of alcoholism in women (14).
However, a review of drug abuse research on women presented
several comparative studies of men and women showing that
alcoholism among some women appeared more highly correlated with
a family history of alcohol problems. Compared to alcoholic men
in various studies, alcoholic women had a greater likelihood of
having an alcoholic father and/or parents, as well as alcoholic
siblings (47). Additionally, while perhaps not genetically
influenced, familial alcoholics (those with at least one relative
with alcoholism) appear to have earlier onset, more antisocial
symptoms, more social complications of alcohol use, and worse
treatment outcome than nonfamilial alcoholics (22,62,70).<br>
</p>

<p> Familial is not identical to genetic, and in the case of
alcoholism, the familial patterns of inheritance are not
consistent with those of a purely genetic condition (36,79). In
addition, researchers suggest that the transmissibility of
alcoholism has increased over time (65). Thus, any genetic
factors promoting the development of alcoholism are significantly
moderated by nongenetic influences. <br>
</p>

<p> Family Studies: Other Drugs <br>
</p>

<p> Although fewer family studies have been conducted on the
genetic transmission of liability to other drugs of abuse,
researchers suggest that, as in the case of alcohol, addiction to
other psychoactive substances appears to run in families.<br>
</p>

<p> One study found evidence of drug use running in families,
based on family history obtained from individuals admitted for
substance abuse treatment (53). However, this study combined use
of all illicit drugs into one category and relied on self-reports
by the subject on his or her drug use as well as that of family
members. A large family interview of opiate addicts found that
the relatives of opiate users had elevated rates of drug
addiction as compared with the controls (67). In addition, an
association was found between opiate use and the presence of
antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Further analysis of these
data revealed that the incidence of both drug abuse and ASPD was
higher among the siblings of the opiate subjects than among their
parents (49,50). <br>
</p>

<p> A familial association between opiate addiction and
alcoholism has been noted in some studies (46). However, another
family history study found that while both opiate addiction and
alcoholism clustered within families, co- occurrence of the
disorders within families occurred only as frequently as expected
by chance, thus supporting the hypothesis of independent
transmission (29).<br>
</p>

<p> Little has been done to test hypotheses regarding familial
transmission of liability to addiction to specific substances
other than opiates or alcohol. One study examining treated drug
abusers and their relatives found that alcoholism was equally
common among relatives of individuals who preferentially abused
opiates, cocaine, or sedative-hypnotics (27 percent, 31 percent,
and 24 percent of male relatives, respectively), whereas
relatives of sedative-hypnotic users were subject to diagnoses of
other substance abuses (2 percent of male relatives, versus 11
percent of male relatives of opiate abusers and 16 percent of
male relatives of cocaine abusers) (55). <br>
</p>

<p> Twin and Adoption Studies <br>
</p>

<p> Twin and adoption studies provide information to distinguish
between biological and cultural transmission. Twin studies
observe siblings raised in the same environment, but compare how
often identical twins, who are genetically identical, and
fraternal twins, who have the genetic similarity of nontwin
siblings are concordant for a trait. A high concordance rate for
a trait among identical twins versus fraternal twins usually
indicates a genetic component for the trait. Adoption studies, by
contrast, compare the presence of a trait among biological versus
adoptive family members or other control groups. In this way
individuals sharing the same environment but having different
genetic heritages, or vice versa, can be compared.<br>
</p>

<p> Evidence from twin studies suggests genetic influences on
drinking patterns as well as alcohol-related problems. Results
from twin studies demonstrate genetic influences on measures of
alcohol consumption such as abstention, average alcohol intake,
and heavy alcohol use (28,39,61). Twin studies also indicate an
inherited risk for smoking (16).<br>
</p>

<p> When evaluating the development of alcoholism, twin studies
have generally supported the existence of genetic influences over
the disorder's development. One early study found a higher
concordance rate for alcohol abuse between identical twins (54
percent) than in fraternal twins (28 percent) (35), while two
other studies did not find such a relationship (25,61). A 1991
study examined male and female identical twin pairs, and male and
female fraternal twin pairs, with one member of the pair meeting
the criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence (64). Researchers
found that identical male twins differed from fraternal male
twins in the frequencies of both alcohol abuse and dependence as
well as other substance abuse and/or dependence. On the other
hand, female identical and fraternal twins were equally likely to
abuse alcohol and/or become dependent on other substances, but
identical female twins were more likely to become alcohol
dependent. Another study of 356 twin pairs also found higher
identical than fraternal rates of concordance for problems
related to alcohol and drug use as well as conduct disorder (52).
The same study also noted that among men, heritability played a
greater role in the early rather than late onset of alcohol
problems, whereas no such effect was seen among women. However, a
study of 1,030 female twin pairs found evidence for substantial
heritability of liability to alcoholism, ranging from 50 to 60
percent (40).<br>
</p>

<p> Thus, twin studies provide general agreement that genetic
factors influence certain aspects of drinking. Most twin studies
also show genetic influence over pathological drinking, including
the diagnosis of alcoholism, which appears (like many other
psychiatric disorders) to be moderately heritable. Whether
genetic factors operate comparably in men and women, and whether
severity of alcoholism influences twin concordance is less clear.
How psychiatric comorbidity may affect heritability of alcoholism
also remains to be clarified. <br>
</p>

<p> Adoption studies have supported the role of heritable factors
in risk for alcoholism (6,11,71). The results from a series of
studies conducted in Denmark during the 1970s are typical.
Researchers studied male adoptees, later comparing them with
nonadopted brothers; female adoptees, later comparing them with
nonadopted daughters of alcoholics, comparisons were also made
with matched control adoptees. Sons of alcoholic and nonalcoholic
parents who were put up for adoption were compared for the
development of alcoholism. Sons of alcoholic parents were found
to be four times as likely as sons of nonalcoholic parents to
have developed alcoholism; evidence also suggested that the
alcoholism in these cases was more severe. The groups differed
little on other variables, including prevalence of other
psychiatric illness or &quot;heavy drinking.&quot; Being raised
by an alcoholic biological parent did not further increase the
likelihood of developing alcoholism; that is, rates of alcoholism
did not differ between the adopted-away children and their
nonadopted brothers. In contrast, a study of daughters of
alcoholics revealed no elevated risk of alcoholism (23).<br>
</p>

<p> Another analysis examined factors promoting drug abuse as
well as alcoholism (10). In this study, all classes of illicit
drug use were categorized into a single category of drug abuse.
Most of the 40 adopted drug abusers examined had coexisting ASPD
and alcoholism; the presence of ASPD correlated highly with drug
abuse. Among those without ASPD, a biological background of
alcoholism (i.e., alcoholism in a biological parent) was
associated with drug abuse. Also, turmoil in the adoptive family
(divorce or psychiatric disturbance) was associated with
increased odds for drug abuse in the adoptee.<br>
</p>

<p> Finally, results from other adoption studies suggest two
forms of alcohol abuse (7,13). The two forms were originally
classified by C.R. Cloninger as &quot;milieu-limited&quot; or
type 1 alcohol abuse and &quot;male-limited&quot; or type 2
alcohol abuse (15). Type 1 alcohol abuse is characterized by
moderate alcohol problems and minimal criminal behavior in the
parents, and is generally mild, but occasionally severe,
depending on presence of a provocative environment. Type 2 is
associated with severe alcohol abuse and criminality in the
biological fathers. In the adoptees, it is associated with
recurrent problems and appears to be unaffected by postnatal
environment.<br>
</p>

<p> While the appropriateness of the biological and environmental
parameters used in the Cloninger study have been challenged, the
discriminating characteristics used to classify individuals as
type 1 or 2 alcohol abusers have not been--until recently. A new
study of familial and nonfamilial male alcoholics has
investigated the type 1 and 2 classifications by analyzing the
importance of age differences and cohort distributions (19). The
researchers showed that among the male alcoholics, there was not
a clear distinction between familial and nonfamilial based
alcohol abuse problems and type 1 or 2 characteristics, as
reported in previous studies. Additionally, another recent
publication discusses the absence of paternal sociopathy in the
etiology of severe alcoholism, and the possibility of a type 3
alcoholism (30). This type of research raises obvious questions
as to the validity of the discriminating characteristics
originally outlined by Cloninger and currently used in the
classification of individual alcohol abusers.<br>
</p>

<p> In summary, adoption studies of alcoholism clearly indicate
the role of biological, presumably genetic, factors in the
genesis of alcoholism. They do not exclude, however, a possible
role for nongenetic, environmental factors as well. Moreover,
researchers have suggested more than one kind of biological
background may be conducive to alcoholism. In particular, one
pattern of inheritance suggests a relationship between parental
antisocial behavior and alcoholism in the next generation. Thus,
adoption studies, like other designs, suggest that even at the
genetic level, alcoholism is not a homogeneous construct.<br>
</p>

<p> What Is Inherited? <br>
</p>

<p> While study results indicate a probable genetic component to
alcoholism and probably other drug abuse, they lack information
about what exactly is inherited. For example, do individuals with
a family history of drug abuse have an increased susceptibility
or sensitivity to the effects of drugs with reinforcing
properties? If a susceptibility exists, what are its underlying
biological mechanisms? To understand what might be inherited,
both individuals who have a substance abuse problem and animals
models of substance abuse are studied. Various types of
information can be derived from these studies. As with family,
twin, and adoption studies, much more information is available
about alcoholism as compared with other drugs of abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> First, it may be possible to identify specific inherited risk
markers for alcoholism and other substance abuse. A risk marker
is a biological trait or characteristic associated with a given
condition. Thus, if an individual is found to have an identified
marker for substance abuse, he or she is at risk for developing a
drug dependency. To date, no biological characteristic has been
clearly identified as being a risk marker for either alcoholism
or substance abuse, although evidence suggests some possible
candidates. The identification of a valid and reliable risk
marker could provide important information about the fundamental
mechanisms underlying substance abuse and addiction and would be
an invaluable aid in diagnosis and treatment.<br>
</p>

<p> Second, inherited differences in biochemical, physiological,
and anatomical processes related to differences in drug responses
might be identified and studied. Animal models of substance abuse
allow thorough biological assays to be carried out. Animal
genetic models of substance abuse consist of strains of animals
(usually rodents) that have been selectively bred to either
exhibit a preference for taking or refusing a drug, or to differ
in some way in their behavioral or physiological response to a
drug. In the case of alcohol, studies suggest that low doses of
alcohol are more stimulating and produce a stronger positive
reward in rats bred to have a high preference for alcohol as
compared with normal rats. Experimental data indicate that this
may be due to inherited differences in the dopamine, GABA, and
serotonin systems (27,32, 57,73). These differences represent
inherited traits related to drug taking behavior, and these
animals can be examined to determine what biological mechanisms
are involved in the expression of these traits.<br>
</p>

<p> Third, the genetic technique of linkage analysis can narrow
the area on a chromosome where a gene may be located. It can lead
to the identification of the gene itself which in turn can
improve the understanding of the molecular events that underlie
the expression of the gene. There have been few genetic linkage
studies related to substance abuse since few specific biological
traits associated with drug dependency have been identified. Some
studies in humans have been carried out related to alcoholism but
the findings of these studies are contradictory and inconclusive.<br>
</p>

<p> Several studies have reported an association between
alcoholism and a gene that regulates the number of a type of
dopamine receptor in the brain; other studies have found no such
link (4,5,8,18,58). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.
One study revealed a relationship between the presence of the
gene not only in alcoholics, but in other disorders such as
autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's
syndrome (17). Thus, the presence of this particular gene, while
not uniquely specific for alcoholism, may cause an alteration in
the brain's dopamine system that somehow exacerbates or
contributes to alcohol abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> Few studies have examined possible inherited biological
mechanisms associated with the abuse of other drugs. For example,
strains of rats and mice that differ in their sensitivity to the
reinforcing effects of cocaine and in their cocaine-seeking
behavior have been observed to also have differences in the
actual number of dopamine-containing neurons and receptors in
certain brain areas. Also, a comparison of one strain of rat that
self-administers drugs of abuse at higher rates than another
strain, found that the higher self-administering strain exhibited
differences in the intracellular mechanisms that control activity
in some of the neurons in the brain reward system (see box 3-2)
as compared with the low self-administering strain. Additional
studies exploring the role of genes in drug response are needed
to more fully understand the full range of biological factors
associated with drug abuse. The recent development of new and
more sensitive techniques to analyze brain activity and processes
will facilitate these studies. <br>
</p>

<p> ROLE OF LEARNING <br>
</p>

<p> The learning that occurs during drug-taking activities is an
important force in the continued use and craving of drugs
(59,72). Drugs of abuse often produce feelings of intense
pleasure in the user. In addition, such drugs produce changes in
numerous organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, digestive,
endocrine). Both the behavioral and physiological effects of a
drug occur in the context of the individual's drug-seeking and
drug-using environment. As a result, environmental cues are
present before and during an individual's drug use that are
consistently associated with a drug's behavioral and
physiological effects. With repetition the cues become
conditioned stimuli, that on presentation, even in the absence of
the drug, evoke automatic changes in organ systems and sensations
that the individual reports as drug craving. This is analogous to
Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments in which dogs
salivated at the cue of a bell following repeated pairing of food
presentation with a ringing bell. Evidence for this effect is
seen in numerous studies showing that animals seek out places
associated with reinforcing drugs and that the physiological
effects of drugs can be classically conditioned in both animals
and humans (72).<br>
</p>

<p> Conditioning also occurs in relation to the withdrawal
effects of drugs (75). It was observed that opiate addicts who
were drug free for months and thus should not have had any signs
of opiate withdrawal, developed withdrawal symptoms (e.g.,
yawning, sniffling, tearing of the eyes) when talking about drugs
in group therapy sessions. This phenomenon, termed conditioned
withdrawal, results from environmental stimuli acquiring the
ability, through classical conditioning, to elicit signs and
symptoms of pharmacological withdrawal. Conditioned withdrawal
can also play a role in relapse to drug use in abstinent
individuals. The emergence of withdrawal symptoms as a result of
exposure to conditioned cues can motivate an individual to seek
out and use drugs.<br>
</p>

<p> These associations are difficult to reverse. In theory,
repeated presentation of the environmental cues, without the drug
should extinguish the conditioned association. Animal studies
indicate that stopping the conditioned response is difficult to
achieve and does not erase the original learning. These types of
studies examining drug conditioning have found that various
aspects of extinguished responses can either be reinstated with a
single pairing of the drug and environmental cue, can be
reinstated with a single dose of drug in the absence of the
environmental cue, or canspontaneously recover (72).<br>
</p>

<p> Thus, exposure to environmental cues associated with drug use
in the past can act as a stimulus for voluntary drug- seeking
behavior. If the individual succeeds in finding and taking the
drug, the chain of behaviors is further reinforced by the
drug-induced, rewarding feelings and the effects of the drug on
other organ systems (59). The effects of the environmental
stimuli can be similar to the priming effects of a dose of the
drug.<br>
</p>

<p> The complexity of human responses to drugs of abuse, coupled
with the number of drugs that are abused, complicates
understanding of the role of biology in drug use and abuse.
Nevertheless, scientists know the site of action of many drugs in
the brain, and sophisticated new devices are expected to improve
that understanding. A genetic component to drug use and abuse is
likely, but it has not been fully characterized.<br>
</p>

<p> SUMMARY <br>
</p>

<p> Underlying all alcohol and drug problems are the actions and
effects that drugs of abuse exert. It is important to understand
how drugs work in the brain, why certain drugs have the potential
for being abused, and what, if any, biological differences exist
among individuals in their susceptibility to abuse drugs.<br>
</p>

<p> Two biological factors contribute to substance abuse and
addiction: the effects drugs of abuse exert on the individual,
and the biological status of the individual taking drugs. The
effects the drugs exert can be either acute or chronic and will
vary depending on the drug and its route of administration. Most
drugs of abuse influence the brain's reward system. The
pleasurable sensations that drug use can produce reinforce
drug-seeking and -taking behaviors. These actions differ with
different drugs: and, thus, some substances have greater
potential for abuse and addiction than others.<br>
</p>

<p> Prolonged or chronic use of a substance or substances can
produce both biological and behavioral changes (some long-
lasting). Biological changes can include sensitization and/or
tolerance and, if use is discontinued, withdrawal. The behavioral
changes from continued drug use are directly related to these
biological changes. An individual's drug- craving, -seeking, and
-taking behaviors are amplified through the neuroadaptive changes
in the brain reward system that occur with chronic
administration.<br>
</p>

<p> Environmental cues also play a large role in drug-seeking and
-taking behavior. On encountering certain environmental stimuli
(i.e., specific locations, smells, tastes), drug- craving and
drug withdrawal symptoms have been reported by former drug users
who have been drug-free for months, even years.<br>
</p>

<p> Through family, twin, and adoption studies, most researchers
agree that genetic factors play some part in the heritability of
alcohol problems and, although less clear, other drug problems.
No conclusive evidence has been found to explain precisely what
is inherited or the overall importance of this inherited
material. It has been hypothesized that there are probably
numerous genes (as opposed to one) that interact in complex ways,
and whose expressions are affected by a myriad of environmental
factors. Thus, the presence or absence of a genetic factor
neither ensures nor protects against drug dependency.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 3-1: Neuropharmacology <br>
</p>

<p> Neurons are the cells that process information in the brain.
Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by neurons to
communicate with other neurons. When a neuron is activated it
releases a neurotransmitter into the gap between two neurons (see
figure 3-1). The molecules of the neurotransmitter move across
the gap and attach to proteins, called receptors, in the outer
wall of an adjacent cell. Once the receptor is activated, the
neurotransmitter is removed from the gap, either by reabsorption
into the neuron that released it or by being broken down
chemically.<br>
</p>

<p> For each neurotransmitter in the brain, there are specific
receptors to which it can attach. Receptors and receptor subtypes
can activate a variety of membrane and cellular mechanisms. In
this way, one chemical can have diverse effects in different
areas of the brain. Many chemicals have been identified as
neurotransmitters. Some particularly relevant to the reported
pleasurable sensations associated with drug abuse include
dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, opioids and other
neuropeptides, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.<br>
</p>

<p> A neuron can have thousands of receptors for many different
neurotransmitters. Some neurotransmitters activate neurons
(excitatory neurotransmitters), while others decrease neuron
activity (inhibitory neurotransmitters). Some receptors are
biochemically coupled: the activation of one modulates the
function of the other, either increasing or decreasing its
activity. A neuron can also have receptors for the chemical it
releases. In this way, neurons can regulate their release of a
particular neurotransmitter. Thus, these so-called autoreceptors
act as a feedback mechanism. The activity of a neuron will be
determined by the cumulative activity of all its various
receptors. <br>
</p>

<p> Drugs that work in the brain, including drugs of abuse, alter
normal neuropharmacological activity through a variety of
different mechanisms. They can affect the production, release, or
reuptake of a chemical, they can mimic or block the action of a
chemical at a receptor, or they can interfere with or enhance the
activity of a membrane or cellular mechanism associated with a
receptor. Prolonged drug use has the potential to alter each of
these processes. <br>

<p> BOX 3-2: The Brain Reward System <br>
</p>

<p> Eating, drinking, sexual, and maternal behaviors are
activities essential for the survival of the individual and the
species. Natural selection, in order to ensure that these
behaviors occur, has imbued them with powerful rewarding
properties. The brain reward system evolved to process these
natural reinforcers.<br>
</p>

<p> The reward system is made up of various brain structures. A
key part of this system for drug reward appears to be the
mesocorticolimbic pathway (MCLP). The MCLP is composed of the
axons of neuronal cell bodies in the middle part of the brain
(i.e., ventral tegmental area) projecting to areas in the front
part of the brain (i.e., the nucleus accumbens, a nucleus in the
limbic system, a network of brain structures associated with
control of emotion, perception, motivation, gratification, and
memory; medial prefrontal cortex, part of the front of the brain
involved with higher ordered thinking) (see figure 3-2). Ventral
tegmental neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine to
regulate the activity of the cells in the nucleus accumbens and
the medial prefrontal cortex. Other parts of the reward system
include the nucleus accumbens and its connections with other
limbic structures, and other regions in the front part of the
brain (i.e., substantia innominata-ventral palladium). The
nucleus accumbens also sends signals back to the ventral
tegmental area. Finally, other neuronal pathways containing
different neurotransmitters regulate the activity of the
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and may also be involved in
mediating the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse.<br>

<p> BOX 3-3: How Drugs of Abuse Affect the Chemical Release of
Dopamine <br>
</p>

<p> The rewarding properties of stimulant drugs such as cocaine
and amphetamines are due directly to the effects of the chemical
dopamine. Opiates, on the other hand, indirectly stimulate
dopamine by activating other chemical pathways, which in turn
increase dopamine activity. Similarly, alcohol, barbiturates, and
benzodiazepines likely have an indirect action which increases
dopamine activity. All of these drugs have reinforcing
properties. Phencyclidine (PCP) is also a strong reinforcer but
its relationship, if any, to activity in the dopamine pathway has
yet to be established. Other drugs are either weak reinforcers or
have not been shown to support self-administration in animal
experiments. Nicotine stimulates dopamine neurons; however, its
effect is modest when compared with cocaine or amphetamine.
Likewise, caffeine is a weak reinforcer, but the precise
mechanisms of its reinforcement are unclear. Finally, cannabis
and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) also produce positive
effects that clearly support their use.<br>
</p>

</p>

<p> BOX 3-4: The Two Types of Tolerance <br>
</p>

<p> The two types of tolerance are: dispositional
(pharmacokinetic) and pharmacodynamic. Dispositional tolerance
develops when the amount of drug reaching active sites in the
brain is reduced in some way. Generally, this arises from an
increased breakdown of the drug or a change in its distribution
in the rest of the body. Thus, more drug must be taken to achieve
the same blood levels or concentrations at the active sites in
the brain.<br>
</p>

<p> Pharmacodynamic tolerance represents a reduced response of
the brain to the same level of drug. It develops during the
continued and sustained presence of the drug. It may be that the
mechanism of adaptation may differ from drug to drug and depend
on the original mechanism of action of a given drug. The net
effect is that more drug is required to overcome this new
neuronal adaptation to produce an equivalent pharmacologic
effect.<br>
</p>

<p> Although dispositional tolerance represents a component of
tolerance to some drugs (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates), in most
cases much or all of the tolerance which develops to drugs with
significant abuse potential can be attributed to pharmacodynamic
tolerance. Tolerance can contribute to drug- taking behavior by
requiring that an individual take larger and larger doses of a
drug to achieve a desired effect.<br>

UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION US
Government Office of Technology Assessment </b>October 18, 1994 <b><font
size="5">CHAPTER 4 - AVAILABILITY <img
src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"></font></b> </p>

<p> Availability is a precondition for drug abuse and dependency.
A person cannot become a drug abuser unless a drug is available
to be used. </p>

<p> Drug availability is often thought of as mere physical
presence of an abusable substance. In addition, however,
availability is affected by social norms (social availability),
prices (economic availability), and personal values (subjective
availability) (see table 4-1). Marketing techniques for both
licit and illicit drugs can alter social, economic, and
subjective availability, and thus are addressed in this chapter
(see box 4-1). </p>

<p> A substantial body of literature addressing the relationship
between drug availability and drug demand does exist. However,
most of this information addresses tobacco and alcohol, rather
than illicit drugs. In addition to conducting a literature search
(primarily of mass media), the Office of Technology Assessment
(OTA) contracted with the National Center for Juvenile Justice
(NCJJ) to conduct a survey of juvenile probation officers on the
perceived availability of drugs and to conduct a workshop on
availability issues (see appendix F for a list of participants). </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY </p>

<p> Availability is a concept usually reserved for the supply-
side of the substance abuse policy equation (i.e., making drugs
available to supply an already existing demand). However, the
proximity of drugs and drug dealers to potential users, and the
ease with which these substances can be purchased or otherwise
obtained can affect demand, use, and abuse. This is especially
true when one considers aggressive marketing efforts by
suppliers, who seek to create or expand the demand for drugs by
convincing potential consumers of the benefits, acceptability,
and availability of these substances. While availability is a
concept that applies to the whole range of drugs, most of what we
know about its role in drug use and abuse comes from research in
the arena of alcohol and tobacco abuse (1,9,10,14) (see box 4-2
and figure 4-1). </p>

<p> Research has shown that when alcohol is more available, the
prevalence of drinking, the amount of alcohol consumed, and the
heavy use of alcohol all increase (5). Alternatively, the
literature also suggests that physical conditions that restrict
alcohol availability reduce rates of alcohol consumption (1). A
review of alcohol-related literature reveals that availability
can be conceptualized in four different, yet related categories. </p>

<p> Physical Availability </p>

<p> Physical availability refers to a basic element--the
proximity and accessibility of an abusable substance. Simple
logic dictates that if a substance is absent, it cannot be used.
Government interdiction and law enforcement policies target the
physical availability of illicit drugs. Other policies, such as
limitations on the point-of-sale, hours, or age of purchasers,
target the physical availability of other abusable drugs, such as
tobacco and alcohol products. </p>

<p> Responses to the OTA survey of juvenile probation
administrators indicated that respondents perceived two ways in
which physical availability is increased: through contamination
by outsiders (e.g., youth gangs, tourists, foreigners) bringing
drugs into the community, and through proximity to a source of
drugs or alcohol. </p>

<p> Gangs and organized drug trafficking were mentioned often by
respondents as reasons for increases in the availability of
drugs. Respondents from all over the country, representing both
rural and urban areas, registered concerns about gangs and their
role in marketing and trafficking drugs. A respondent from
Canton, Mississippi, for example, attributed the increase in drug
availability simply to &quot;gang leaders from California.&quot;
A respondent from Waterbury, Connecticut, was more explicit about
the age and ethnicity of the gang influences, attributing the
observed increase in drugs to the &quot;emergence of gang
activity for the 12-to-15-year-old age group, particularly in the
Hispanic and black ethnic groupings.&quot; A respondent from
Paducah, Kentucky, said that the &quot;increase in drugs has been
from gangs entering the community from Memphis, Tennessee,
Arkansas, and Chicago, Illinois.&quot; The respondent from
Davenport, Iowa, attributed the increase to attempts by
&quot;Chicago gang members to establish crack markets in Quad
Cities--lots of arrests of Chicago residents including
juveniles.&quot; Even cities with an established history of youth
gangs identified gangs as being responsible for increases in
drugs. For example, a respondent from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
attributed the observed increase to the fact that &quot;gang
participation has become increasingly sophisticated.&quot; </p>

<p> However, gangs were not the only phenomena associated with
increasing the physical availability of drugs and alcohol. Many
respondents were concerned with the potential for contamination
due to proximity to areas thought to be established drug markets
or through proximity to the means for widespread drug
distribution (e.g., major highways and roads, prisons). </p>

<p> Physical availability is necessary but not solely responsible
for drug use. For example, drugs often are physically available
but are not always used. Also, seeking to prevent or reduce drug
use solely by eliminating or reducing physical availability may
be doomed to failure, since it has proven to be very difficult to
keep drugs out of communities. So although the concept of
physical availability is important, it is limited, both as a
cause and a cure to drug use and abuse. </p>

<p> Economic Availability </p>

<p> Economic availability may be increased when a person has
access to surplus income or the costs of drugs are low, illegal
drug sales are a key component of the local economy, or the price
per unit of a drug or drugs in general is reduced. In describing
the difference between &quot;private&quot; and
&quot;flagrant&quot; drug markets, one article specified some of
the dimensions of the changing economics of addiction: </p>

<p> If cigarettes were sold only by the carton and whiskey only
by the case, the effect would be to decrease the total
consumption of tobacco and whiskey. Presumably, few people would
start smoking cigarettes if the first experimental purchase were
a $20 carton rather than a $1 pack. Similarly, fewer poor people
would drink if they were required to buy whiskey by the case. A
similar effect would, in all likelihood, hold true if open air
and flagrant drug markets were eliminated (3). </p>

<p> In addition to overall conditions, economic availability of
all substances can be affected by the pricing of products. For
licit products such as alcohol and tobacco, economic availability
is also affected by taxes levied by federal, state, and local
authorities. </p>

<p> In 1989, federal excise taxes on tobacco, alcoholic
beverages, and motor fuels raised $24.4 billion in revenue--
about 2.5 percent of total federal revenues (11). Excise
taxes--taxes on specific products--while representing a small
part of total taxes, are an important consideration in the
economic availability of licit substances. </p>

<p> Excise taxes are seen by many as having three impacts: </p>

<p> o to raise revenue for government programs; </p>

<p> o to make certain harmful substances less affordable and,
hence, less used and abused; and </p>

<p> o to cover societal costs that accrue from the use of various
substances (e.g., environmental costs from the use of gasoline,
health costs resulting from smoking and drinking). </p>

<p> Whether taxation of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products
is an appropriate means of reducing societal costs caused by
their use is a continuing public debate. Some argue that the
public health costs and other external costs are so significant
as to justify substantial excise taxes. Others counter that such
taxes are regressive--impacting the poor more than the rich--and
reduce the satisfaction experienced by millions of sensible
drinkers without necessarily reducing the harm caused by
excessive drinkers (8). </p>

<p> Social Availability </p>

<p> Social availability refers to those factors within the
community conducive to drug use. One study explored alternative
explanations for reported declines in cocaine use among high
school seniors, using questionnaire data from annual nationwide
surveys conducted from 1976 to 1988 (2). Results of this analysis
indicated that although lifestyle factors showed strong links
with the use of marijuana and cocaine, these factors had not
developed trends in ways that could account for declines in the
use of either drug. Reported physical availability of either drug
had not been reduced. Instead, increases in perceived risks and
disapproval appear to have contributed substantially to the
recent declines in the use of marijuana and cocaine. The study
concluded that it was important to lower demand by reducing
social availability, as opposed to trying to reduce supply by
reducing physical availability. </p>

<p> Increasingly, grass roots community action groups are working
to diminish both the subjective and social domains of
availability. These efforts usually entail developing and
presenting public awareness and fact-based education to consumers
and potential consumers, decreasing community tolerance for drug
use while increasing collective pride in the community, and
developing or otherwise demonstrating alternatives to substance
use and abuse. </p>

<p> Subjective Availability </p>

<p> Subjective availability encompasses individual differences in
how people perceive their access to substances. For example, an
individual may choose to use one type of abusable substance, but
not another. Or, an individual may choose to use a drug (e.g.,
cocaine), but only in certain forms (i.e., a person may choose to
snort a line of cocaine but refuse to smoke or inject it). The
person who refuses to use illicit drugs has interjected his or
her personal values in a way to make illicit drugs unavailable,
even if they are physically and economically available. </p>

<p> One reviewer identified four components of subjective
availability as it relates to alcohol: 1) willingness to go out
of one's way to purchase alcohol, 2) perceived convenience of
buying alcohol, 3) discomfort about buying alcohol, and
4)?importance of the price of alcohol. Subjective and social
availability were demonstrated to have direct influences on
alcohol consumption, and subjective and social aspects of
availability can mediate and outweigh the influence of physical
availability (1). </p>

<p> Subjective availability is likely to increase when an
individual holds attitudes or values favorable toward use; lives
in a community that condones, or even celebrates, drug use; and
has ready access to drugs that are highly valued, particularly if
those agents are addictive. </p>

<p> ARE DRUGS READILY AVAILABLE? </p>

<p> A number of surveys exists for measuring drug use (see
chapter 2). In addressing the question of whether drugs are
readily available, several measures exist (e.g., marketing
figures related to alcohol and tobacco sales, tallies of illegal
drugs seized by law enforcement authorities). In addition to
quantitative measures of drug use, many people perceive various
drugs to be widely available. In an attempt to measure these
anecdotal perceptions, OTA surveyed juvenile probation
administrators randomly selected from a database maintained by
NCJJ. </p>

<p> The purpose of the survey was to identify communities that
have experienced a sudden, observable change in the abuse of
drugs or alcohol in the past 12 months and to collect preliminary
data about the events and circumstances leading to the change in
abuse. Such anecdotal evidence could be gathered from a number of
groups; OTA chose to survey juvenile justice officials because of
their involvement in drug issues and the availability of a
nationwide database of such officials who could be accessed. </p>

<p> Responses were received from 246 juvenile justice
administrators across 38 States. The data provide a glimpse at
some of the drug and alcohol availability issues being addressed
by juvenile courts and probation departments across the United
States. Seven findings resulted from the survey: </p>

<p> o Most respondents consider substance abuse to be a serious
problem in their communities. Using a scale of 1 (not serious) to
10 (very serious), the respondents, on average, rated the problem
of substance abuse among juveniles in their communities at 7.4.
In addition, 85.8 percent of the respondents rated substance
abuse seriousness at six or above. </p>

<p> o Almost half of the respondents indicated a dramatic
increase in availability of drugs and/or alcohol in their
communities. A total of 46.7 percent of the survey respondents
reported a dramatic increase in the availability of drugs and/or
alcohol in their communities. Some 50.8 percent of the
respondents indicated &quot;no dramatic changes&quot; in
perceived availability of drugs and/or alcohol. Only 2.4 percent
indicated a dramatic decrease in availability. </p>

<p> o Factors affecting physical availability (i.e., sales and/or
distribution of drugs) were selected most often and were rated
highest in terms of increasing availability of drugs. Given an
opportunity to select and rate commonly cited reasons for
increased availability of drugs and alcohol, the respondents
selected items that were strongly associated with the sales and
distribution of drugs and alcohol (see table 4-2). </p>

<p> o Crack cocaine and cocaine were much more likely than other
drugs to show dramatic increases in availability. Respondents
were given an opportunity to report whether they had noticed a
change (ranging from a dramatic decrease to a dramatic increase)
in the availability of a range of drugs, including alcohol. Crack
(24.5 percent) and cocaine (17.8 percent) had the highest
percentage of respondents indicating a &quot;dramatic
increase&quot; in availability. The next closest were inhalants
at 14.6 percent (see table 4-3). </p>

<p> o Economic conditions and the perceived lack of real
opportunities for many youths were frequently cited as factors
contributing to the increased availability of drugs in many
communities (see box 4-3). </p>

<p> o Survey respondents listed several factors contributing to a
sense of social availability, including lack of parental/guardian
supervision, consequences for alcohol and drug offenses,
alternative activities, as well as portrayals of alcohol and drug
use by the mass media as a glamorous and healthy activity (see
box 4-4). </p>

<p> o Substance abuse prevention and early intervention efforts
were rated highest as important community responses to increases
in the availability of drugs and alcohol. Over 80 percent of
respondents agreed that an increase in prevention and
intervention efforts was an important response to an increase in
the availability of drugs. Trailing behind prevention and early
intervention were increased law enforcement (68.4 percent),
increased treatment (68.2 percent), and stiffer judicial
penalties (68.0 percent). Respondents were also asked to rate the
relative effectiveness of the listed responses to availability on
a scale of 1 (not effective) to 10 (very effective). Prevention
and early intervention (6.4 percent) was rated the highest in
terms of perceived effectiveness, but not much higher than law
enforcement (6.2 percent), increased treatment (6.0 percent), and
stiffer judicial penalties (6.2 percent) (see table 4-4). </p>

<p> MARKETING </p>

<p> Standard marketing strategies used to increase consumption of
legal goods are used in equally effective ways to increase
consumption of illicit drugs. Marketing refers to efforts by
individuals interested in the sale or trade of a product to
maintain or increase sales by maintaining market shares and
opening new markets. Marketing includes efforts to increase the
perceived availability of a product or products by enhancing the
sense of both subjective and social availability in prospective
consumers. To the extent that those efforts are successful, then
purveyors of consumer products will attempt to make the supply
match the demand (physical availability) at a cost that maximizes
both sales to consumers (economic availability) and profits to
the sellers. </p>

<p> Illegal Drugs </p>

<p> Illegal drugs are marketed aggressively in the United States.
Some of the strategies for marketing illicit drugs are very
similar to those strategies for marketing licit products.
Sometimes the distinction between licit and illicit products is
difficult to determine. Take, for example, the case of so-called
head shops. Drug paraphernalia are items sold specifically to
promote the preparation, manufacture, or marketing of drugs. Head
shops may sell a wide variety of products that are often
associated with specific drugs, for example: </p>

<p> o Stash cases, rolling machines, pipes, bongs (marijuana). </p>

<p> o Bottles, concert kits, brass straws, spoons (cocaine). </p>

<p> o Glass pipes, vials, stems, screens, shaker bottles (crack
cocaine). </p>

<p> o Testing kits, scales, adulterants (heroin). </p>

<p> o Canisters, balloons, tanks (inhalants). </p>

<p> Head shops represent the most shrewd form of pro-drug
marketing by targeting mostly young customers and providing the
technology and products required to increase the ability of users
to procure, prepare, hide, and ingest drugs. Despite Federal
legislation prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia (18 USC
Ap4), heads shops continue to flourish. These shops can avoid the
intention of the law because the definition of what constitutes
drug paraphernalia is ambiguous and open to interpretation. Head
shop owners will simply emphasize the legitimate use of their
products. For example, they may sell a scale designed to weigh
drugs as a product to weigh food for dieting purposes.
Specifically, head shops contribute to the drug abuse problem by:
</p>

<p> o sending a double message--if drugs are so bad, why is drug
paraphernalia sold openly? </p>

<p> o operating, in some cases, in the guise of candy stores,
exposing children to drug paraphernalia and stimulating curiosity
about drugs; </p>

<p> o serving to facilitate the use, marketing, and sale of
drugs; </p>

<p> o selling items designed as conversation pieces which serve
to glamorize drug use; and </p>

<p> o becoming hubs for drug abusers, indirectly serving to
increase crime in the neighborhoods in which they operate. </p>

<p> Another example of a marketing strategy used for licit
substances and now being adapted for illicit substances is total
marketing, which consists of four basic strategies-- promotion,
product, price, and place--to maximize theexposure of a product
in a positive light to the most likely consumer groups (4). </p>

<p> A key component of total marketing is promotion, or
advertising particular product lines to appeal to particular
subpopulations of the consuming public. Promotion is a standard
practice in the marketing of legitimate products-- it is also a
very powerful force for manipulating consumer habits. </p>

<p> Promotion includes activities like advertising and
sponsorship of sporting and entertainment events (7). For illicit
drugs, promotional activities may include sponsoring a party in
which the illegal drug is dispensed free or at a dramatic
discount along with other attractions (e.g., sex, drug
paraphernalia) (15). </p>

<p> Total marketing also entails the development of a product
line that can be targeted to subpopulations within the larger
consumer community. For example, alcohol and tobacco
manufacturers will produce an array of products targeted at
several consumer groups--premium beers for one group, wine
coolers for another, rugged masculine cigarettes for one group,
thin feminine cigarettes for another. Similarly, purveyors of
illegal drugs have begun to develop product lines--powdered
cocaine for one group, crack cocaine for another. The use of
brand names is one technique used by marketers to establish a
niche in the larger market, which is one reason people become
unwilling participants in the marketing wars between Coke and
Pepsi or Visa and American Express or even Bud and Bud Light. </p>

<p> A great deal of uniformity exists in the price, quantity, and
quality of drugs sold in the same city, especially in the same
neighborhood or street market. As a result, a dealer will
occasionally try to capture a larger share of the market by
increasing the weight or strength of the product and applying a
brand name for recognition (3). </p>

<p> In Washington, DC, for example, brand name heroin is sold
under the name of &quot;Smurf,&quot; &quot;Mr. T,&quot;
&quot;Brown Wrapper,&quot; and &quot;Black Poison.&quot;
Phencyclidine (PCP) is occasionally sold under the brand name
&quot;Hinkley&quot; (after John Hinkley, the man who shot Ronald
Reagan), &quot;Gofer&quot; (a reference to a television character
on the &quot;Love Boat,&quot; which is a popular street name for
PCP), and &quot;Keys to St. E's&quot; (a reference to a local
mental institution). Crack cocaine is sometimes hawked under the
brand names of &quot;Conan,&quot; &quot;007,&quot; and
&quot;Baseball.&quot; </p>

<p> Pricing is the process of assigning a retail cost to each
item in a given product-line that matches the ability of the
targeted subgroup to pay. By producing a line of products at a
wide range of prices, the purveyor of the goods can maximize the
consumer population. For example, whether a consumer of tobacco
products is smoking low-priced generic cigarettes from the
supermarket or high-priced cigarettes from the tobacconist, that
individual is included in the range of consumers. Illegal drug
sellers also price their particular products to move. For
example, while powdered cocaine may be too expensive for some
economically disadvantaged consumers to purchase regularly,
almost everyone can afford a $5 vial of crack cocaine. Drug
dealers also manipulate the cost for their goods to attract
customers. </p>

<p> Once a product has been developed, promoted, and priced to
move, a place must be found to most effectively sell the product.
Legal nonmedical drugs are packaged and made available at retail
outlets in such a way as to make their purchase as convenient as
possible. </p>

<p> Wine coolers, for example, are a type of beverage aimed
particularly at women and young people. With its sweet, light
taste, low prices, and convenient packaging, the wine cooler
competes with beer and soft drinks for occasions such as picnics
and sports events, where traditional wine products are unlikely
to be consumed. Wine cooler ads promote just these types of uses.
Packaging has taken on a beer or soft drink look, and the
industry is successfully obtaining access to convenience stores
and supermarket outlets to make purchases easier (6). </p>

<p> Illicit drugs can also be packaged and made available at
&quot;retail&quot; outlets where purchasers can conveniently
obtain the product(s) of their choice. One news account suggests
that &quot;mass marketing that would have made McDonald's
proud&quot; is responsible for the evolution of crack cocaine
from a drug derided as &quot;garbage rock&quot; just a few years
ago into a national craze. </p>

<p> Crack was not invented, it was created by a sharp crowd of
sinister geniuses who took a simple production technique to make
a packaged, ready to consume form of the product with low unit
price to entice massive numbers of consumers. Cocaine powder
required an investment of nearly $75 for a gram, but a hit of
crack costs as little as $5. Equally alluring was crack's
incredible &quot;high&quot;--an instantaneous euphoria because it
was smoked--that could create addicts in weeks (16). </p>

<p> Two kinds of retail drug markets exist in the United States:
the private market place and the open-air or flagrant drug
markets (3). The private drug market involves transactions that
occur between people who are known to one another or are referred
by a trusted acquaintance. Referrals in the private marketplace
are usually not very far removed from the original connection;
they may be classmates in college, business associates,
relatives, or persons belonging to the same club. </p>

<p> The familiarity of the parties in the private drug market
usually means that there is a reduced level of public exposure
and violence. The desire to keep the flow of traffic to the site
of transactions at a minimum means that sales in the private
marketplace tend to be of larger quantities of drugs than those
in street transactions. Because most of the transactions take
place &quot;behind closed doors&quot; or in some other
clandestine fashion, a high degree of impermeability exists in
the dealer-customer relationship (3). Examples of private drug
markets include &quot;speak easies&quot; during prohibition and
the &quot;traditional&quot; (i.e., before crack) cocaine markets.
</p>

<p> Another aspect of the private drug market is the ritualistic
aspect of procuring the product. Consider, for example, the
ritual associated with purchasing cocaine. One author describes
&quot;a day in the office&quot; of a street-level cocaine
distribution network. The office itself is a highly structured
operation, complete with receptionists to screen potential
customers, guards, a &quot;catcher&quot;--held on retainer to
retrieve cocaine thrown out of a window during a bust-- and the
merchant who sets prices, arranges to barter goods and services,
gives credit, and makes day-to-day decisions regarding sales
(15). </p>

<p> A typical transaction involves a positive identification of
the buyer, a greeting and brief social contact (e.g., handshake,
hug, kiss) between the merchant and the buyer, a formal request
for an amount of cocaine, and a discussion of method of payment
(e.g., cash, barter). Sometimes the transaction involves a brief
discussion of the relative quality of the drugs in the street, a
sample of the drug available from this particular merchant, and
possibly some haggling over price. The public weighing and
packaging of the cocaine is central to this type of transaction.
The scale, in fact, becomes a central point of power and
authority in the business; only those with the highest level of
trust and respect can operate the scale (15). </p>

<p> Open air and flagrant drug markets, on the other hand, tend
to be far more impersonal and much less ritualistic than the
private marketplace. Many of the concepts used by mass marketers
of licit products are used in the flagrant marketplace--targeted
consumer groups, small and widely affordable units of sale,
prepackaged goods with fixed prices, convenient retail outlets.
One research team describes the mechanics of a typical open-air
drug market transaction: </p>

<p> A car drives down a residential street with enormous
apartment buildings on either side. Young men wave to the car; a
few of the more aggressive dealers step into traffic to signal
autos to stop. Even before the wheels have stopped rolling,
several young men are at the window; &quot;You looking?&quot;
says one. &quot;Smoke, smoke. I've got crack. Whatever you
want&quot; says the other peering over his shoulder. The answer
from the driver is simple and short: &quot;Two dimes.&quot; Two
small brown glass vials are exchanged for a 20 dollar bill and
the transaction is over in a matter of seconds (3). </p>

<p> Although the exact method for conducting a transaction may
vary slightly from place to place around the country, the essence
of the transaction is remarkably similar across the United
States. Flagrant or open-air drug markets have many of the same
structural characteristics as legal marketplaces: demographic and
product segmentation, brand loyalty, cartel pricing, aggressive
salesmen working on commission, and careful recruitment of loyal
and productive employees (3). </p>

<p> Alcohol and Tobacco </p>

<p> The marketing of legal yet addictive substances, especially
tobacco and alcohol, has become controversial in recent years.
Issues stemming from the marketing of licit substances include
advertising, taxation, and labeling. </p>

<p> Advertising </p>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco products have long been advertised in the
United States. In the 1950s and 1960s, these products were
advertised with minimal restrictions. Following the Surgeon
General's report on the hazards of smoking in 1964 (13), public
sentiment against cigarette advertising increased. The most
famous example of Federal regulation is the ban on broadcast
cigarette advertising in January 1971 resulting from the passage
by Congress of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969
(Public Law 91-222). In recent years, attention has focused on
legislative proposals to ban all forms of cigarette advertising,
and to control the advertising of alcoholic products. </p>

<p> Taxation </p>

<p> The federal government currently levies excise taxes on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes on all
types of alcoholic beverages were raised in 1990 to their current
levels. Currently, for example, beer (six pack 12-ounce cans)
carries a 33 cent federal excise tax, a 750 ml bottle of wine
carries a 21 cent federal excise tax. A pack of cigarettes
carries a federal excise tax of 24 cents. </p>

<p> A number of studies in the 1980s focused on the impact of
federal excise taxes on cigarette consumption. A 1986 study
concluded that an 8- to 16-cent increase in the federal cigarette
excise tax would encourage from 1 to 2 million young persons and
8,000 to 1.5 million adults to quit smoking or not to start.
Thus, a tax increase could prevent hundreds of thousands of
premature smoking-related deaths, while a tax decrease would
contribute to the disease burden of tobacco (14). The General
Accounting Office, in a review of the literature on teenage
smoking and excise taxes, concluded that an increase in the
cigarette excise tax would be an effective way to reduce teenage
smoking (12). </p>

<p> Labeling </p>

<p> Federal law addresses the labeling of both cigarettes and
alcoholic beverages. In both cases, Congress declared that the
purpose of such labeling is to make sure the American public is
informed about the potential health hazards that may result from
consumption (36 USC 1331; 27 USC 213). Manufacturers of
cigarettes must use one of four rotating warnings on each
package, while manufacturers of alcoholic beverages must post a
prescribed warning (see box 4-5). Proponents of labeling have
stated that such warnings do not create legal restrictions, but
only help to inform the consumer about possible health risks.
Opponents of labeling have argued that no scientific proof exists
to link labeling with reduced use or improved health. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> The second set of preconditions for drug abuse and dependency
includes availability and marketing. A person cannot become a
drug abuser unless a drug is physically available to be used. In
addition, however, availability is affected by social norms
(e.g., factors within the community conducive to drug use,
including level of parental or guardian supervision, lack of
consequences for alcohol and drug offenses, lack of alternative
activities, portrayals of alcohol and other drug use by friends
and the media as a glamorous and healthy activity), prices
(economic availability), and personal values (subjective
availability). </p>

<p> The primary focus of U.S. antidrug policy has been to attack
the physical availability of illicit drugs through law
enforcement efforts aimed at disrupting the production,
transport, and sale of drugs. While this focus has increased
drug-related arrests--nearly half of newly sentenced federal
inmates in 1991 were imprisoned on drug charges--illicit drugs
are still widely available. </p>

<p> Marketing techniques for both licit and illicit drugs can
alter social, economic, and subjective availability. Key
components of marketing include the promotion and advertising of
particular product lines to appeal to particular subpopulations
of the consuming public; development of a product line that can
be targeted to subpopulations within the larger community of
consumers; pricing strategies to attract new buyers; and
identification of retail outlets for sales. </p>

<p> Federal law regulates the merchandising of licit yet abusable
substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and prescription drugs by
placing a variety of restrictions on how such products may be
marketed. Despite current restrictions, debate continues as to
whether and how a variety of legal drugs should be marketed.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 4-1: What Is Marketing? </p>

<p> Marketing includes any activity involved in moving goods from
producer to consumer. In the context of drugs, marketing includes
a variety of activities covering a wide range of licit and
illicit substances. </p>

<p> For licit substances, such as alcohol, tobacco, and
inhalants, it includes market research, advertising, pricing, and
taxation. A number of government policies in the marketing
arena--taxes, advertising restrictions, point- of-sale controls,
and age restrictions on certain products-- directly affects the
availability of licit, yet abusable, substances. </p>

<p> For illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, and
hallucinogens, marketing techniques can include street markets,
gang activity, and private, closely controlled distribution and
sales systems. Government control in this area--prohibiting the
possession, use, and sale of such substances--likewise affects
the availability of these substances. </p>

<p> Box 4-2: Availability and Tobacco </p>

<p> The evolution of tobacco from a relatively rare product
requiring preparation, thought, and ritual to a product that is
ubiquitous, prepackaged, and consumed without much fanfare
provides a graphic illustration of how increased physical
availability of a product can dramatically increase drug use,
abuse, and addiction. Three major developments in the history of
tobacco use paved the way for making this drug imminently
available for use by consumers: the invention of the cigarette
manufacturing machine, the invention and perfection of matches,
and the proliferation of the use of vending machines to sell
tobacco products. </p>

<p> The first successful cigarette manufacturing machine was
developed in 1881 by James A. Bonsack. This machine had the
capacity to produce more than 200 cigarettes per minute. Prior to
the advent of this machine, smokers had to roll each cigarette by
hand, a time-consuming and often ritualistic process. </p>

<p> Once rolled, a cigarette must be lit to be consumed. This was
no easy task prior to the introduction of the safety match, first
invented in 1896 but not perfected until 1912. Without matches,
smokers were required to enter cigar stores to light cigarettes
from gas or oil lamps provided specifically for the purpose of
lighting tobacco products. These developments changed forever the
way that cigarettes were consumed by making them readily
available for consumption at any moment during the day. Instead
of a thoughtful, often ritualistic exercise, cigarette
consumption has evolved for some into an almost unconscious
habit. Following the invention of the manufacturing machine and
the safety match, the rate of cigarette consumption soared during
the late 19th and early 20th century. </p>

<p> The use of vending machines may be the most revolutionary
aspect of tobacco availability. First introduced in 1926, vending
machines require no sales person, are not restricted by selected
hours of operation, and are not concerned with the age or
legality of the purchaser. Vending machines make cigarettes
available almost anywhere, appearing in bars, hotels, train and
bus stations, airports, hotels, and restaurants. By 1953, nearly
half a million cigarette machines existed and were responsible
for sales of more than 3 billion packs of cigarettes a year. The
upward trend in sales from cigarette machines continued through
the mid- 1970s: by 1973 more than 900,000 vending machines were
in operation, selling almost 5 billion packs per year. Some early
research indicated that the existence of vending machines
throughout the physical environment is a major inducement to
impulse smoking. </p>

<p> BOX 4-3: Survey Comments, Economic Availability </p>

<p> Economic factors impact on perceptions of availability in a
number of ways. For example, because Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
was experiencing a &quot;strong economy . . . juveniles have had
an abundance of cash available for alcohol/drug usage.&quot; More
frequent, however, were comments stating the opinion that a poor
economy increased the economic availability of drugs and alcohol:
</p>

<p> Frankfort, Kentucky: &quot;Profit motive due to national
economy and lack of job training/jobs. Lack of hope and
opportunity for some causes increased sale of drugs due to high
profit.&quot; </p>

<p> Barbourville, Kentucky: &quot;Drug dealers that cannot make
it flipping hamburgers, but are successful at selling drugs and
have a lot of material evidence of their success. Law enforcement
needs to confiscate these material items in prosecution of case.
Also, involvement of drug dealing by law enforcement and
politicians is a problem. &quot; </p>

<p> Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: &quot;Teenaged drug dealers have
status, money, jewelry, cars, designer clothes, etc., which many
of their peers cannot afford.&quot; </p>

<p> Fort Worth, Texas: &quot;Depressed economic conditions--Lack
of legitimate means to obtain income. It's easy money with
minimal consequences for conviction.&quot; </p>

</p>

<p> BOX 4-4: Survey Comments, Social Availability </p>

<p> Conway, New Hampshire: &quot;Our law enforcers are known and
make little inroads towards prosecuting drug traffickers or
sellers. Many young adults supply liquor and drugs to underage
kids in our area.&quot; </p>

<p> Mount Holly, New Jersey: &quot;The legal system does not
fairly prosecute offenders. It gives some juveniles the message
that depending upon your circumstances it is OK to use and sell
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> Muskogee, Oklahoma: &quot;The lack of prosecutive vigor in
alcohol-related offenses (Minor in possession, public
intoxication, D.U.I.). District attorney does not vigorously
pursue and law enforcement treats D.U.I. as public
intoxication.&quot; </p>

<p> Prineville, Oregon: &quot;This community is basically a blue
collar community. There is an attitude of acceptance of juveniles
using alcohol. Kind of a boys will be boys attitude.&quot; </p>

<p> South Bend, Indiana: &quot;We have seen an increase in
alcohol consumption that appears to be tolerated or even
encouraged by adults (primarily parents).&quot; </p>

<p> Hillsboro, Illinois: &quot;Lack of education, interest,
cooperation of parents. Not enough interest with higher officials
(e.g., school teachers, church members, government officials,
businesses, and senior citizens).&quot; </p>

<p> Baraboo, Michigan: &quot;Lack of appropriate teen activities.
Lack of parental interest.&quot; </p>

<p> Jacksonville, Illinois: &quot;Decrease in the ability and
willingness of individual family units to educate, instruct, and
monitor juvenile behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p> Nicholasville, Kentucky: &quot;Alcohol is supplied willingly
to juveniles by a large number of adults. Inhalants are available
at any department store.&quot; </p>

<p> Brownstown, Indiana: &quot;Children, mostly high school age,
come in contact with adults, ages 18-23, who are very willing to
buy alcohol or sell drugs to their younger friends. In addition,
these children who do not have money on hand are likely to steal
items and trade them for drugs or cash to buy alcohol and
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> BOX 4-5: Cigarette and Alcoholic Beverage Warnings </p>

<p> It is unlawful for any person to manufacture, package, or
import for sale or distribution within the United States any
cigarettes the package of which fails to bear one of the
following labels: </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart
Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy. </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly
Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health. </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May
Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth Weight. </p>

<p> SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon
Monoxide. </p>

<p> It is unlawful for any person to manufacture, import, or
bottle for sale or distribution in the United States any
alcoholic beverage unless the container of such beverage bears
the following statement: </p>

<p> GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General,
women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy
because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of
alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or
operate machinery, and may cause health problems. </p>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 5 </b> </p>

<p> <b>SUBSTANCE USE AND TRANSITIONS TO ABUSE AND ADDICTION <br>
</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Substance use is another precondition and contributor to
addiction, since one cannot become dependent on a substance
without first using it, continuing its use, and passing through
stages of progressively more serious use. </p>

<p> Patterns of progression from use to addiction are not,
however, consistent or predictable for all individuals. They can
vary widely, depending on numerous individual and contextual
factors and on characteristics of the use itself, such as age of
onset and the type, frequency, and quantity of substance used.
While other chapters in this report focus on individual and
contextual factors, this chapter focuses only on the
characteristics of drug use itself that can contribute to the
progression to abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Researchers have failed to identify specific levels of
substance use or of substance-related problems that clearly
distinguish use from abuse (16). This is the case, in part,
because substances can differ greatly in their abuse liability
and, in part, because the same levels of use of a particular
substance can affect the functioning of various individuals
differently. For example, for some individuals, the initial use
of certain substances may constitute substance abuse, because of
the severe adverse consequences of the initial use itself.
(Although abuse is usually associated with large quantities of
substance use per occasion, resulting in either the risk of harm
to others (e.g., drunk driving) or to self (e.g., blackouts),
some in the prevention field define any initial use of an illicit
substance as substance abuse, because the substance being used is
illicit and should not be used.) </p>

<p> Although the distinction between use and abuse is unclear,
the causes of substance use--especially initial or casual
use--are thought to differ in many cases from the causes of
substance abuse and addiction. Some researchers have asserted
that substance use results primarily from social influences
(e.g., peer pressure), while abuse results more from internal
psychological and physiological processes (13). Others have
reported, based on longitudinal data, that current substance use
was related more to the early modeling of use by adults and to
one's own prior use, whereas problem use was related more to
early rebelliousness (22). A review of prevention programs also
supports the conclusion that the factors associated with the
initiation of use differ from the factors associated with
escalation to abuse (23).<br>
</p>

<p> SUBSTANCE USE <br>
</p>

<p> Because substance use is necessary as a precondition to abuse
and addiction, prevention efforts can be directed at initial use,
continuing use, or progression in use to block the later
development of addiction. </p>

<p> Possible goals are: </p>

<p> o Prevent initial use. One way to prevent substance abuse and
addiction is to prevent any initial use. The surest way to
succeed would be to keep abusable substances out of the
community, since, if they are unavailable, they cannot be used.
However, once the substances are available in a community, other
preventive approaches can be tried, including scare tactics (as
with a policy of zero tolerance, backed up by stern parental,
school, and legal penalties for use), educational efforts
(through media campaigns or prevention curricula in the schools),
training in refusal skills, and promotion of safe
nonsubstance-using activities. The lack of clear standards and
penalties, credible information, and alternative activities may
certainly increase the vulnerability of youth to the appeals of
abusable substances, but the presence of such efforts has not
guaranteed success in preventing initial use among all youth. </p>

<p> o Delay initial use. Another goal is to delay initial use as
long as possible, thus delaying the point at which any
progression from use to abuse to addiction can begin. Such an
approach can provide at least some protection for some
chil-dren--i.e., those who might otherwise initiate use at
earlier ages and then more rapidly progress to abuse and possibly
addiction. Early onset of substance use is often more severe than
late onset and, as is discussed later in this chapter, early use
of substances is one of the better predictors of subsequent
problems. Thus, a delay in initial use may offer significant
protection even if substances are used later on. </p>

<p> o Prevent, reduce, or control continued use. Another approach
is to try to prevent current users from continuing or escalating
their use of one substance or moving on to other substances with
greater abuse liability. Many youth experiment with cigarettes,
alcohol, and marijuana, but do not progress to problematic use of
these or other substances. Others, however, do progress. Efforts
to reduce, prevent, or control continued and progressive use, if
successful, can protect individuals from the problems of abuse
and addiction. </p>

<p> Preventing, delaying, reducing, or controlling the use of
substances can help prevent abuse and addiction. Because of their
directness and apparent simplicity, these goals can be very
appealing. Detracting from their appeal, however, is that they
can be difficult to achieve, especially for multiproblem
individuals in communities where abusable substances are widely
available and aggressively marketed, and for individuals who may
be physiologically predisposed to the continued and escalating
use of substances. </p>

<p> In addition to being a precondition (without which abuse and
addiction become impossible), substance use can also be an
important contributor to later abuse and addiction, by affecting
individuals physiologically, psychologically, and
socioculturally.<br>
</p>

<p> Physiological Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Addictive substances affect processes in the brain, some of
them operating through reward systems, and can produce drug
tolerance and dependence. Tolerance manifests itself when, to
produce a given response (e.g., a high), an individual must
ingest more of a substance. Physiological drug dependence has at
least two defining characteristics: the development of tolerance
to the effects of the drug and the manifestation of symptoms of
withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation or reduction in dosage. The
development of physiological tolerance and dependence can
contribute to the progression from use to abuse and addiction: as
tolerance to a substance increases, an individual must ingest
more of the substance to continue to obtain a given desired
response; as dependency develops, an individual must continue to
ingest the substance to avoid the unpleasant experience of
withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p> Psychological Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Substance use may contribute to further use and abuse through
psychological means as well. For example, an initial successful
experience of use may reduce an individual's fear about the
substance, thus opening the way to continued use that can lead to
growing tolerance and dependence. </p>

<p> Changes in expectations about the consequences of alcohol use
have also been associated with increases in behavioral tolerance.
Specifically, less impairment from drinking alcohol occurred
when, after the ingestion, successfully performing certain tasks
was rewarded, while all other variables that increase tolerance
were controlled. Several recent studies and a literature review
have found that the ingestion of alcohol increased when the
rewards for alternative behaviors were constrained (24). Also,
social drinkers who expect the effects of alcohol to be better
than the outcomes of other activities may well be more likely to
make the transition to abusive drinking. Such a hypothesis is
supported by several studies that found that alcohol abusers
identify a greater number of favorable conseqences of alcohol
consumption than do nonabusers (24). </p>

<p> Continued use of substances can also impair the learning of
skills, especially among the young, and the ability to remember
lessons once learned. Developmental processes may be slowed,
which may hamper decisionmaking, in general, and about the use of
substances, in particular. However, the progression from use to
abuse may also, in many cases, not be simply linear, as when
individuals move in and out of substance abusing patterns,
depending on the developmental stages and social and cultural
situations and contexts that may be affecting them.<br>
</p>

<p> Sociocultural Effects <br>
</p>

<p> Sociocultural factors, triggered by substance use, can also
contribute to progression in use. An individual who initiates
use, for example, may begin to participate in a subgroup that
encourages use, such as the patrons of crack houses, groups of
heroin users, members of substance-using motorcycle gangs,
adolescent peer groups, cocktail party groups, after-work beer
groups, and groupies who follow certain rock bands. (In some
cases, too, such groups and subcultures may provide the impetus
for the initiation of use as well.) Such social and cultural
environments encourage, reinforce, maintain, and increase
substance use and abuse--all of which can develop after the
initiation of use outside the group. Conversely, the lack of
rewarding, substance-free alternative groups and activities may
render individuals more vulnerable to the appeals of substance-
using groups and subcultures.<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN THE INITIATION OF USE <br>
</p>

<p> Do individuals first use one substance (e.g., alcohol or
tobacco) and only later use another (e.g., cocaine or heroin)?
Are stages in the first use of different substances similar
across cultures? Does the use of one substance (e.g., marijuana)
directly increase the likelihood of later use of another
substance (e.g., heroin)? Or is progression in use caused more by
other mediating factors, such as multiple behavior problems? If
so, might these other problems contribute to later use of certain
substances even in the absence of the use of other substances
earlier on? </p>

<p> The basic question about whether there are stages in the
initiation of the use of different substances has been studied in
the United States (9,11,12,21,27) and in Israel and France (1).
While study results vary somewhat, the sequence most often
reported is that alcohol and cigarette use come first, followed
by marijuana use and then by the use of other illicit substances.
Some variations in this sequence have been found for individuals
of different sexes, racial and ethnic groups, and cultures. The
idea that the use of some substances increases the likelihood of
the use of other substances has led to several hypotheses.<br>
</p>

<p> The Stepping Stone Hypothesis <br>
</p>

<p> In its strongest form, the so-called &quot;stepping
stone&quot; hypothesis asserted that the use of marijuana often
or almost always led to violent crime and to the use of other
illicit substances (28). This hypothesis has never been proved.
An even earlier version of the stepping stone hypothesis goes
back to the beginning of the 20th century, when the presumed
progression from tobacco to alcohol to morphine use was presented
as an argument for prohibiting both alcohol and tobacco. One
observer commented that there was no strong evidence that the use
of these substances causes progression from one to another;
rather, some individuals are more prone to the use of multiple
substances. Also, the criminalization of marijuana may have
caused some marijuana users to move on to other illicit
substances through contact with the subculture of illicit users
(14).<br>
</p>

<p> The Gateway Hypothesis <br>
</p>

<p> More recently, a more moderate hypothesis, the gateway
hypothesis, has been put forward. It asserts that use of certain
substances increases somewhat the chances of progression to the
use of other substances. For example, in one longitudinal study,
men who had used both alcohol and cigarettes by age 15 had a 52
percent greater chance of using marijuana, compared to men who
had never used alcohol or cigarettes by age 25 (26). For women,
the increased chance of marijuana use among alcohol and cigarette
users was 46 percent. Similarly, for the next stage, men who had
used marijuana by age 15 had a 68 percent greater chance of
initiating the use of other illicit substances, compared with
those who had never used marijuana. For women, the increased
probability was 53 percent. <br>
</p>

<p> Early and Frequent Use <br>
</p>

<p> A still more constrained version, but one that may be more
predictive, suggests that early and frequent use increases the
probability of movement to later levels in the sequence (12). For
example, researchers have reported that early use of substances
is associated with later problematic use (7,20).<br>
</p>

<p> Nonuse of a Substance at an Earlier Stage <br>
</p>

<p> Another hypothesis proposes that the nonuse of a substance at
an earlier age reduces the chances of later use of other
substances. A longitudinal study has found that the chance that
an individual who had never used marijuana would move up a level
to use other illicit substances was very low (26). This finding
corroborated conclusions reached earlier based on a
cross-sectional study (18). </p>

<p> Because of variations among communities and cultures, the
search for a universally applicable sequence in the initiation of
the use of different substances may be less fruitful than the
study of why there may be somewhat different sequences, depending
on factors such as availability and social norms. The relative
ease of availability of some substances (e.g., cigarettes, beer,
wine) may well account for their frequent appearance at an early
stage in the sequence of use. However, this may vary among
cultures. In France, for example, wine is widely available and
used both at an early age and at an early stage in the sequence.
In other cultures, where wine is less available but inhalants are
widely available and inexpensive, inhalants are used at an early
age and early in the sequence. Use at a young age may be a
marker, at least in some cultures, for other risk factors, such
as parental substance abuse and other family problems, which can
contribute to later substance abuse problems, independently of
early and frequent use. For example, one study found that,
irrespective of the age of onset of use, individuals who
exhibited numerous behavioral problems in their youth moved on to
problem substance use, no matter how early or late in their youth
they began to use substances (20).<br>
</p>

<p> Limitations in the Research <br>
</p>

<p> Research into stages in the initiation of the use of
different substances has itself evolved through stages. A number
of issues, which have not been thoroughly addressed, remain: </p>

<p> o The identification of stages in the progression from use to
abuse and addiction is more a description of the stages some
individuals move through than a prediction of necessary stages
for most individuals, since the majority of substance users do
not move on to abuse. Reasonable questions are: What prevents
some individuals from progressing from initial use to abuse and
addiction? Are the obstacles primarily due to the absence of
preconditions, such as biological and pharmacological
preconditions or availability and marketing. Studying those
individuals who do not progress from use to addiction may provide
insights and lessons about how to prevent progression among those
who do progress. Of particular importance are studies of the
changing vulnerabilities and resiliencies of individuals in
different developmental stages from childhood through
adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood. </p>

<p> o What is the role of substance use in progression to abuse
and addiction? The initiation of use of a particular substance
may often not be the most important contributor to the use of a
substance higher in the sequence. Other factors directly related
to use may play a larger role. For example, age of onset,
quantity, frequency, techniques, and purposes of the substance
use may be more salient. Longitudinal risk factor and expectancy
studies have begun to look at the role of these other elements. </p>

<p> o Are some individuals more predisposed to use and abuse
substances than others? Individual biological and psychological
factors may also strongly influence which individuals progress
from use to abuse. </p>

<p> o What environmental factors contribute to substance use and
abuse? Availability, marketing, social norms, peer groups,
subcultures, and settings that encourage substance use may also
be key in determining which individuals progress. </p>

<p> Despite the need for greater understanding about the issues
above, already completed research into stages in substance use
has been influential in providing the basis for policy and
program recommendations. The gateway hypothesis has encouraged
some prevention advocates and program planners to focus on
preventing or delaying the use of gateway substances (e.g.,
alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana) as a possibly effective way to
prevent later use of illicit substances. Longitudinal studies
have found that the use of cigarettes by youth can be a strong
predictor of later problems with substances (17).<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN THE CYCLE OF USE, ABUSE, AND ADDICTION <br>
</p>

<p> One approach to the study of stages in substance use focuses
not just on the initiation of use; but also on the continuation
of use, maintenance and progression of use within a class of
substances; progression across classes; and regression,
cessation, and relapse cycles in use and abuse (2).<br>
</p>

<p> Initiation of Use <br>
</p>

<p> Initiation is clearly a key first step in the progression to
more serious levels of use. Because substance use is often
initiated during adolescence, most substance use research has
focused on initiation of use among adolescents. However, most
individuals who initiate substance use do not progress to harmful
use. Also, the factors associated with such progression may often
differ from the factors associated with initiation. Thus, the
focus on the initiation of use during adolescence is not
sufficient for an understanding of the progression from use to
abuse and addiction. <br>
</p>

<p> Continuation of Use <br>
</p>

<p> After trying a substance for the first time, one person may
say, &quot;I won't be trying that again,&quot; while another may
say, &quot;That's for me.&quot; Although only limited research
has been conducted on risk and protective factors associated with
the transition from experimentation to continued use, the
continuation of use can apparently be influenced by the
pharmacology of the substance (e.g., whether it produces desired
or pleasant experiences), the biology of the individual (e.g.,
whether specific individuals have genetic or acquired biological
predispositions or intolerances to the use of specific
substances), the availability and marketing of the substance
(e.g., whether a substance is widely available, used, and
accepted for use), other characteristics of the individual (e.g.,
at what developmental stage one is, and whether one has mental or
emotional problems, which may be ameliorated at least temporarily
by substances), and community contexts (e.g., substance-using
subcultures or settings that strongly encourage and reinforce a
continued use of substances).<br>
</p>

<p> Maintenance and Progression of Use Within a Class of Drugs<br>
</p>

<p> Maintenance and progression may include conformity with norms
of consumption--for example, initial and continued heavy use of
alcohol in a college fraternity. Progressionwith cocaine could
entail movement from snorting to smoking or injection. College
students in some fraternities and sororities with drinking
traditions may be at higher risk for heavy substance use,
especially of alcohol. But very little research has been
conducted on the risk factors for maintenance of high levels of
use or for progression within classes of substances to excessive
use among this age group.<br>
</p>

<p> Progression in Use Across Classes of Substances <br>
</p>

<p> At this stage, an individual may try different substances for
different, and often compensating, effects. For example, the
antiemetic properties of tetrahydracannabinol in cannabis can be
used to facilitate greater use of alcohol, alcohol or marijuana
can be used to smooth out the aftermath of snorting cocaine, and
heroin can be used for similar purposes after a binge with crack.<br>
</p>

<p> Regression, Cessation, and Relapse Cycles <br>
</p>

<p> The transition away from abuse may occur a number of times
before an individual succeeds in getting off a substance or,
failing that, remains dependent. It may also be influenced by the
same factors, or kinds of factors, that contributed to the
substance abuse problem in the first place, including the full
range of biological and pharmacological factors, availability and
marketing, individual emotional needs, or contextual factors.<br>
</p>

<p> STAGES IN PROBLEM BEHAVIORS <br>
</p>

<p> Does substance use itself contribute to conduct disorders,
delinquency, and other problem behaviors? Do these behaviors
then, in turn, contribute to the progression to more use and to
abuse and addiction? </p>

<p> Adolescents who use substances, especially those that are
illegal, are more likely than nonusers to exhibit various problem
behaviors, including: early sexual experimentation, delinquent
activities, eating problems, and psychological or psychiatric
problems, including suicide and suicidal thoughts (10). Less is
known, however, about the sequencing of these behaviors. The
interrelations among the factors is likely to vary widely among
individuals, but some sequences may predominate. Several such
sequences have been proposed. One suggested developmental
sequence, for example, includes six stages: oppositional
(characterized by disobedience at home); offensive (including
disobedience in school, fighting, lying); aggressive (physical
attacks on others, theft at home); minor delinquency (shoplifting
and status offenses, such as alcohol use, truancy, running away);
major delinquency (break-in and entry, car theft, substance
abuse, robbery, drug dealing); and violence (assault, rape,
homicide) (15). </p>

<p> One of the few studies of problem behavior sequences looked
at the order of initiation of four different substances,
delinquency, and sexual activity, among a sample of black
adolescents (3). For males, it found involvement proceeded
generally from beer use to cigarette use, then to delinquency,
sexual activity, marijuana use, and the use of hard liquor. For
females, the progression was generally from cigarette use, to
delinquency, beer use, sexual activity, marijuana, and hard
liquor. For both sexes, delinquency and youthful sexual activity
tended to precede the use of marijuana and hard liquor. </p>

<p> While a high correlation among problem behaviors has been
frequently found, the sequencing of those behaviors is less
clear. The early use of so-called gateway drugs, such as beer and
cigarettes, may contribute to later problem behaviors, while the
later use of marijuana, hard liquor, and other illicit substances
may be more the result of extended participation in problem
behaviors. More research is needed in this area if these
hypotheses are to be better understood and tested.<br>
</p>

<p> KEY ASPECTS OF USE <br>
</p>

<p> Some research has focused on characteristics of substance use
that can strongly influence the progression from use to abuse and
addiction. In addition to the age of first use, these
characteristics include the frequency, quantity, and type of
substance used, and the technologies and purposes and
expectations of use.<br>
</p>

<p> Age of First Use <br>
</p>

<p> Initiation into substance use at a young age is one of the
most striking and often-found predictors of later problems,
including abuse. For example, in one large community epidemiology
study, men who first used substances before age 15 developed
mental and behavioral problems in 51 percent of the cases,
compared with 16 percent among those who began at age 18 or
later. For women, the comparable figures are 39 and 12 percent,
respectively. Other studies have also found problems later on
associated with the earlier introduction to alcohol or other drug
use (19). </p>

<p> This pattern seems to hold specifically for later substance
use and abuse as well. Early use of substances was found to be
associated with later problematic use (7,20). Another study
estimated that, of the men who had initiated the use of marijuana
by the age of 14, 71 percent would be expected to initiate the
use of other illicit substances by age 25, compared with 9
percent of those who first started at age 21 (12). </p>

<p> One report asserted that frequency of use was the mechanism
through which early onset probably operates (12). However,
another study concludes that preexisting conduct problems are a
better predictor of later substance abuse problems than is early
use (19). It found that, in individuals with many conduct
problems, any use of a substance, no matter how late in youth,
was followed by abuse. <br>
</p>

<p> Frequency and Quantity of Substance Used <br>
</p>

<p> When addiction occurs, it usually results from a period of
increasing intensity and frequency of use (5,6). Although
frequency has often been employed as a measure of problematic
use, one study found that quantity of substance used, rather than
frequency of use, was a more powerful predictor of disruptive and
problematic use (21). Quantity and frequency are often related,
but they are not identical. An infrequent user could go on a
binge, where large quantities are consumed, that could be
extremely harmful. By contrast, a frequent user, such as someone
who drinks alcohol every day but in strict moderation, may not
encounter substance-related problems (although a maintenance
alcoholic may drink daily with no apparent intoxication, but with
the later development of associated health problems). The
quantity and frequency of substance use can be strongly affected
by the availability and marketing of the substance and by the
techniques or technologies for administering the drug.<br>
</p>

<p> Type of Substance Used <br>
</p>

<p> The type of substance used can also influence the chances of
later substance problems. More addictive substances--those with
greater abuse liability--will make restraint from continued and
possibly escalating use more difficult. Cigarettes provide an
example experienced by many individuals: nicotine is extremely
addictive, and only a minority of those who try cigarettes and
continue to smoke them will be able to control or easily cut back
on their use.<br>
</p>

<p> Techniques of Use <br>
</p>

<p> Techniques of administration can also influence the
progression of substance use. The introduction of prewrapped,
prepackaged cigarettes, together with widely distributed matches,
was followed by the rapid escalation of cigarette use, and
presumably addiction to nicotine, in the United States in the
late 1800s and early 1900s. Similarly, the introduction of
smokable free-base and crack cocaine, the administration of which
is much more efficient than the snorting of powdered cocaine, led
to an explosion of cocaine abuse and addiction. The Bahamas, for
example, experienced a hundredfold increase in cocaine-related
hospital emergency room admissions following the introduction of
crack and free-base cocaine in the 1980s (8).<br>
</p>

<p> Expectations and Effects of Use <br>
</p>

<p> The expectations and effects of use can also reinforce use
and influence progression from use to abuse and addiction.
Research reviews have discussed some examples of the expectations
and effects of using illicit substances that can reinforce their
use and may increase the likelihood of progression to abuse and
addiction (13,25). These purposes include: </p>

<p> o The reduction of negative feelings, including the use of
stimulants to alleviate depression and weakness; psychedelics to
combat boredom and disillusionment; alcohol to assuage feelings
of guilt, loneliness, and anxiety; and tranquilizers,
amphetamines, and sedatives to reduce painful feelings. </p>

<p> o The reduction of self-rejection. Some researchers have
found an association between substance use and indices of
insecurity, dis-satisfaction with self, desire to change oneself,
defensiveness, low self-esteem, and low self- confidence. </p>

<p> o The increase in potency. Increases in physical and sexual
potency, daring, and toughness can be achieved by using specific
substances in certain situations. This can be especially
appealing to youth, who may be wrestling with feelings of
powerlessness, dissatisfaction, and frustration. </p>

<p> o The expression of anger. Substances can heighten
expressions of anger (e.g., in opposition to mainstream norms) or
can medicate away anger and rage. Narcotics and hypnotics may
help reduce rage, shame, jealousy, and impulses toward extreme
aggressiveness. </p>

<p> o The achievement of peer acceptance. Peers often play the
largest role in endorsing and encouraging substance use, and in
supplying substances. The initiation, continuation, and
progression of use can be important ways for individuals to gain
acceptance into peer groups. This can be true in school (e.g., in
a fraternity), at work (e.g., in a sales force that demands that
one be able to &quot;hold one's liquor&quot;), in substance-using
gangs, and among certain groups of artists (e.g., some
contemporary painters and musicians). </p>

<p> o The seeking of euphoria. Many substance users, especially
addicts, report favorably on drug-induced euphoria. Indeed, the
prospect of euphoria may be the initial attraction of the
substance. It can also encourage continued use, even to the point
of addiction and negative consequences. </p>

<p> o The coping with problems. For some users, substances
temporarily alleviate problems they have been unable to resolve
in other ways. While the problems may be causing emotional pain,
the use of substances, especially for the young, can inhibit the
development of other problem-solving skills and may alleviate
symptoms only in the short-run, since the underlying causes of
the problems are likely to remain unresolved. </p>

<p> o The reduction of overwhelming trauma. Post-traumatic stress
(e.g., after a war, or after physical or sexual abuse) can result
in the use of addictive substances, since use may temporarily
reduce fears, flashbacks, and other negative feelings. </p>

<p> o The suppression of appetite or hunger. Another function of
using some psychoactive substances is appetite suppression. An
extensive literature exists on the use of nicotine, from
cigarette smoking, to control appetite and weight. This
phenomenon often manifests itself in the negative: for example,
current smokers (especially women) are reluctant to stop smoking
for fear they will gain weight (4). </p>

<p> o The seeking of stimulus. Individuals who seek higher levels
of external stimulation can also turn to substances, for a high,
for hallucinations, for unpredictable effects. </p>

<p> o The regulation of affective and behavioral impairments.
Those with mood disorders, such as depression, and behavioral
impairments may find that some substances alter moods and allow
them to modify behaviors. </p>

<p> The above expectations and effects might well be expected to
contribute to more continued and progressively heavier substance
use than would more casual purposes such as curiosity,
experimentation, or recreational use. The more
&quot;serious&quot; the expectations, effects, and functions of
substance use, the greater the likelihood of continued use and
abuse may be. As noted earlier, the use of substances, especially
by the young, to address problems or to achieve feelings may
impede the development of skills for managing feelings and
behaviors and for solving problems, and thus may result in
deficiencies in handling problems in life later on. Indeed, the
use of substances at very young ages may even contribute to
permanent changes in the brain that may contribute to further use
and abuse. More research is needed to clarify the connections
between the expectations and effects of use and the progression
to heavier and more problematic use and abuse.<br>
</p>

<p> SUMMARY <br>
</p>

<p> Substance use, including the progression to heavier and more
harmful use, is a precondition and contributor to abuse and
addiction. Researchers have focused on stages in the progression
of substance use in several ways. They have studied stages in the
initiation of the use of different substances, finding a sequence
that moves from the use of cigarettes and wine or beer, to the
use of marijuana, then hard liquor, and finally other illicit
substances. Because many individuals who use substances do not go
on to substance abuse, and because use at one level does not
guarantee use at a higher level, these stages are descriptive but
not predictive. </p>

<p> In addition to the biologically and pharmacologically
reinforcing properties of addictive substances that can lead to
tolerance and dependence, key aspects of substance use that
contribute to abuse and addiction include age of first use, the
frequency, quantity, and type of substance used, and the
techniques and expectations and effects of use. _ <br>

ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 6 INDIVIDUAL RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> No single or generic set of variables explains the misuse of
substances for every individual. Depending on an individual's
biological makeup, developmental stage, and interaction with
various environmental forces, individual risk, vulnerability, and
resilience to substance abuse and addiction will vary for
different factors at different times (3). </p>

<p> Much of the research on substance abuse has focused on
identifying factors for drug and alcohol use (see table 6- 1),
specifically among adolescents and young adults. Risk factors for
substance abuse have been identified as those cognitive,
psychological, attitudinal, social, pharmacological,
physiological, and developmental characteristics that foster
initiation of drug and alcohol use and abuse by an individual.
There is some consensus in the field of risk factor research that
probably two fairly distinct sets of risk factors affect
individuals differently. Social, situational, and environmental
factors are likely to be more influential in initial or low-level
substance use, while individuals who progress from use to abuse
or addiction are influenced to a greater extent by biological,
psychological, and psychiatric factors (27). This distinction
between risk factors is more thoroughly discussed in chapter 5.
Protective factors are those characteristics that reduce the risk
of substance abuse and addiction and promote positive development
such as, appropriate role models, involvement in positive peer
groups, and a positive self-image and outlook for the future. </p>

<p> This chapter focuses on a select group of individual factors
that has been combined under the three headings: Demographics, </p>

<p> Economics, and Psychosocial/Behavioral. Factors not directly
discussed in this chapter are reviewed in either Part I or III of
the report. These factors may not appear in every individual with
substance abuse and addiction problems, nor will all individuals
exposed to these factors use or abuse drugs. In addition,
unanimous agreement is lacking within the field of substance
abuse and addiction on the importance, number, order of
appearance, or interactive effects of many of these factors. </p>

<p> Where applicable, each of the factors has been reviewed in
the following manner: historical perspectives; current
prevalence; psychosocial and cultural antecedents; biological and
genetic antecedents; relevant prevention programs; and areas for
future research. </p>

<p> DEMOGRAPHICS </p>

<p> Age </p>

<p> The preponderance of substance abuse research points to the
fact that children who use drugs and alcohol before the age of 15
have a greater likelihood of becoming problem alcohol and other
drug users, versus those youth who begin use at a later age (28).
</p>

<p> Highlights from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA) provide a somber picture of substance use among the
Nation's children (77). Lifetime and past month substance use,
rates for continued substance use, as well as differences in
racial and ethnic substance use (see box 6-1) are reviewed in
this section. </p>

<p> As part of NHSDA, data on lifetime use of alcohol and
cigarettes (whose use is illicit for minors) has been collected
for youth aged 12 to 17 since 1974; data collection on other
illicit drug use began in 1979 (see figure 6-1). The lifetime use
findings include: </p>

<p> o Rates in 1991 for lifetime use of alcohol, cigarettes, or
other illicit drugs were the lowest recorded since the survey
series began 17 years ago. The highest rates for any substance
use appeared in the late 1970s. </p>

<p> o In 1979, 70 percent of youth aged 12 to 17 reported some
lifetime use of alcohol compared to 46 percent in 1991. Since
1979, lifetime cigarette use has dropped from 54 percent to 38
percent. </p>

<p> o Since 1979, the use of other illicit substances
(methaqualone, inhalants, heroin, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP),
crack, tranquilizers, stimulants, other opiates, barbiturates,
nitrites, lysergic acid diethylamide, hallucinogens, and
marijuana) has followed a similar trend with rates decreasing
from a high of 34 percent to the 1991 rate of 20 percent. </p>

<p> A complementary study of adolescents shows 1991 data for
substance use within the past 30 days among a sample of
approximately 17,500 eighth graders, 14,800 tenth graders, and
15,000 twelfth graders (75). </p>

<p> o Any alcohol use within the past 30 days was reported by 25
percent of the eighth graders, 43 percent of the tenth graders,
and 54 percent of the twelfth graders. Having had more than five
drinks in the last two weeks was reported by 13 percent of the
eighth graders, 23 percent of the tenth graders, and 30 percent
of the twelfth graders. </p>

<p> o Fourteen percent of the eighth graders, 21 percent of the
tenth graders, and 28 percent of the twelfth graders reported
smoking cigarettes within the past month. Those who smoked more
than one-half pack per day included 3 percent of the eighth
graders, 7 percent of the tenth graders, and 11 percent of the
twelfth graders. </p>

<p> o The other most commonly used substance for eighth and tenth
graders was smokeless tobacco with 7 and 10 percent reported,
respectively. Eighth graders had the highest percentage of past
month inhalant use (4 percent), and of those individuals,
approximately 1 percent reported using inhalants on 3 to 5
occasions within the past month. </p>

<p> o For tenth and twelfth graders, the other most commonly used
substance was marijuana and/or hashish with 9 percent of the
tenth graders and 14 percent of the twelfth graders reporting
past 30-day use. Of those individuals, approximately 2 and 3
percent, respectively, had used marijuana and/or hashish on three
to five occasions. </p>

<p> Another important indicator of potential substance abuse
problems among adolescents is the noncontinuation rate for the
use of certain substances. This is an indication of the extent to
which people who try a drug do not continue to use it, and is
based on the number of individuals who reported ever using a drug
divided by the those who have not used the drug in the past 12
months (75). </p>

<p> Among a sample of twelfth graders in 1991, the data show that
noncontinuation rates vary widely among the different drugs, with
the highest rates observed for methaqualone and inhalants (62
percent). As mentioned previously, inhalant use is higher among
younger individuals. The noncontinuation of methaqualone may be
due, in part, to the decrease in its availability. A high
noncontinuation rate is also seen for heroin (56 percent),
cocaine (55 percent), PCP (52 percent), and crack (52 percent).
Marijuana has one of the lowest noncontinuation rates (35
percent) in the senior year of any of the illicit drugs;
primarily because a relatively high proportion of seniors
continue to use it at some level over an extended period of time.
</p>

<p> Additionally, the noncontinuation rates for alcohol and
cigarettes are extremely low. In other words, 88 percent of the
seniors reported some lifetime use of alcohol, and of those
individuals, 78 percent have continued to use it within the past
year, thus only 12 percent of the seniors reported no alcohol use
in the preceding 12 months. Cigarette noncontinuation was defined
somewhat differently, as the percentage of those who said they
had ever smoked &quot;regularly&quot; and who also reported not
smoking at all during the past month. Of the regular smokers,
only 17 percent stopped smoking within the past month. </p>

<p> An obvious drawback to these data is the fact that only those
individuals who have not dropped out of school are included in
the survey. It is not unrealistic to assume that those students
with serious drug problems may well have left school before the
twelfth grade. More specific discussion of the factors that
influence the risk of adolescent substance abuse, as well as
prevention programs targeting youth, are thoroughly reviewed in
chapter 8. </p>

<p> While the majority of attention is focused on adolescent
substance use and abuse, young adults and older adults also show
significant levels of substance use and abuse. The 1991
statistics from the NHSDA reveal that heavy drinking (defined as
drinking five or more drinks per occasion on 5 or more days in
the past month) was reported by 2 percent of 12 to 17 year olds,
11 percent of 18 to 25 year olds, 7 percent of 26 to 34 year
olds, and 4 percent of those 35 and older (77). For those same
age categories, smoking a pack or more of cigarettes per day was
reported by 1, 13, 17, and 17 percent, respectively. The illicit
substances reported being used most often in the past month among
all age groups were marijuana and hashish. Individuals 18 to 25
had the highest percentage (13 percent) and those 26 to 34 the
next highest percentage (7 percent). The second most commonly
reported illicit substance was the nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics, which was again highest among 18 to 25 year
olds (3 percent) followed by those 26 to 34 (2 percent); all
other age groups reported less than 2 percent. </p>

<p> Clearly then, the heavy use of some substances is not
exclusive to adolescents. Young- to middle-aged and older adults
can also be exposed to stressful risk factors, such as loss of a
job, divorce, or death of a child, which could contribute to
alcohol or drug problems. The adult population presents unique
and often overlooked challenges for the planning and
implementation of substance abuse prevention programs. </p>

<p> Gender </p>

<p> Historically, the vast majority of biological and behavioral
substance abuse studies were conducted on male participants,
although that has begun to change. A distorted picture emerged,
in which women were assumed to misuse the same substances, and
for the same reasons, as their male counterparts. It has only
been within the past 10 to 20 years that separate research has
been conducted on the causes and consequences of alcohol and drug
problems among women. </p>

<p> Women have not been immune to the harmful effects of alcohol
and other drugs. In the late 1800s twice as many women were
addicted to narcotics as men. The majority of these women were
white, middle-aged, and of upper-middle class status. Some had
become addicted through the prescription of narcotics for a host
of so-called female problems, while others knowingly misused
opium, heroin, morphine, and cocaine (53). </p>

<p> The number of women drinking alcohol and experiencing
alcohol-related problems has risen steadily since World War II.
At least one-third of the estimated 18 million alcoholics and
problem drinkers in the United States are thought to be women.
These figures, which many consider to be conservative, would
suggest that close to 6 million women are currently dealing with
the medical, legal, and social problems of alcohol misuse (53). </p>

<p> Overall, men report more frequent use of alcohol, cigarettes,
and all illicit substances (except nonmedical use of
psychotherapeutics) than women (79,77). However, this does not
mean that there is not substantial alcohol and drug use among
women (see table 6-2). Additionally, some gender and ethnic
differences may be attributable to failure to survey hidden
populations. The risk status of women who are not in the
workforce, do not receive prenatal care, and are not visible
through arrest, is less reliably known. </p>

<p> Neither men, nor women, should be considered homogeneous. For
example, alcohol use and its misuse can vary widely between
different racial and ethnic groups. Among men, Hispanics (60
percent) were slightly more likely to have used alcohol within
the past month than whites (59 percent) or blacks (52 percent)
(77). In general, white women drink more frequently than other
women. Large numbers of Native American, Hispanic, black, and
Asian women do not drink at all (70). Additionally, poor and
minority women appear to come under closer scrutiny for alcohol
and drug abuse than do financially secure or white women (see box
6-2). These racial and ethnic differences are more fully
discussed in the following section. </p>

<p> Do men and women cite different reasons for the misuse of
alcohol and other drugs? Over the last several decades within the
United States, the socially defined roles for men and women have
undergone substantial changes. When given a choice, many women
have opted for the traditional role of a stay-at-home mother and
homemaker, while other women have pursued career paths that may
or may not include marriage and children, and still others have
attempted to combine the two. These fairly recent changes have
brought pressures and risks many women had not been subjected to
previously. </p>

<p> Women in the workplace are more likely to encounter drinking
opportunities such as business lunches and office celebrations,
where they may feel encouraged or even pressured to drink (53).
Women have also been recently targeted by the beer, tobacco, and
liquor industries, as well as by small-scale marketing by
nightclubs and bars in the form of ladies' nights. </p>

<p> In the early 1970s, researcher Sharon Wilsnack postulated
that some women may abuse alcohol to submerge those aspects of
themselves that did not conform to the traditional female sex
role, thereby allowing them to feel more acceptably feminine
(53). More recently, several studies on female alcoholics have
shown that women, more frequently than men, can pinpoint a
specific traumatic life event that they believe precipitated
their problem drinking. The crises identified most often by women
included a partner's infidelity, the death of a family member, a
child leaving home, postpartum depression, divorce or separation,
infertility, gynecological problems, and menopause (39,53). </p>

<p> A similar study focused on the impact of various life events
on alcoholic men and women. Alcoholic men placed significant
importance on work-related events, marriage issues, sexual
difficulties, and arguments with spouses. In addition to those
events cited by the men, alcoholic women focused on social
activities, family troubles, stillbirth and adoption, and death
of a close relative (40). </p>

<p> While much of the substance abuse research has focused on
alcohol issues, various researchers have examined the differences
between men and women in their use of illicit substances with or
without the presence of alcohol. For men and women cocaine
addicts in treatment, the following significant differences were
noted (40,41,35): </p>

<p> o Women had started to use cocaine at a younger age than men,
conversely to what is generally found among opiate users and
alcoholics. </p>

<p> o Women had a significantly lower level of social adjustment
than male patients. </p>

<p> o Women patients were less likely to be employed, to hold
high status jobs, to be self-supporting, and to be financing
their own drug use. </p>

<p> o Women were more likely than men to cite specific reasons
for their drug use: depression, feeling unsociable, family and
job pressures, and health problems; whereas men more often cited
the intoxicating effects of cocaine as a reason for their drug
use. </p>

<p> o Men reported experiencing more guilt (47 vs. 23 percent),
whereas women noted that one of the desirable effects of cocaine
use was a reduction in their feelings of guilt. </p>

<p> o Women were more often diagnosed with depression than men,
and their depression took longer to treat, while men were more
often diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. </p>

<p> o Most men and women reported that they used cocaine to be
more sociable. </p>

<p> o Women demonstrated a slower recovery than men, and had more
residual problems. </p>

<p> Gender differences among opiate addicts have also been
explored. Researchers have shown that female addicts are more
likely than male addicts to have first been introduced to heroin
by family members or others close to them, and to have
experienced severe family disruption (36). The development of the
women's opiate dependence is also more likely to be linked to the
family's approval of use or the absence of clear disapproval of
use, in combination with easy access to the drug (35). </p>

<p> Differences in marijuana smoking may also be partially
attributable to gender. In a recent review, it was shown that
men's marijuana smoking was tied more to the availability of the
drug, while women's smoking was affected to a greater degree by
social influences, such as weekday versus weekend smoking, and
the smoking of their male partners. Women have also been shown to
increase their marijuana smoking during periods of anger and
other unpleasant dispositions (41). </p>

<p> In addition to discovering some sociocultural
dissimilarities, gender differences in biological and genetic
susceptibility to substance abuse have been examined. The role of
heritability and genetics in influencing individual
susceptibility is more thoroughly discussed in chapter 3, thus
the discussion in this section will concentrate on biological
differences. Again, a large portion of these studies has
concentrated on alcohol and its effects. </p>

<p> In the late 1970s it was reported that when men and women of
comparable body weight were given equivalent doses of alcohol,
women achieved higher blood alcohol levels. However, these
findings have been challenged, as more recent studies have shown
that if the blood alcohol level is based on total body water
rather than weight, the difference in levels between men and
women is insignificant (65). </p>

<p> Another avenue that has been explored in explaining the
gender difference in blood alcohol levels has to do with the
metabolism of alcohol. Based on findings from animal research,
Mario Frezza et al. (25) investigated differences in the
&quot;first-pass metabolism&quot; between men and women. Data
from animal studies reveal that a significant amount of ingested
ethanol does not enter the circulatory system, but rather is
neutralized in the stomach by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.
Using a small study sample (6 alcoholic and 14 nonalcoholic men,
6 alcoholic and 17 nonalcoholic women) Frezza et al. investigated
whether the first-pass metabolism and enzyme activity level
varied between men and women, and alcoholic and nonalcoholic
individuals. They discovered that both gender and chronic alcohol
abuse had statistically significant effects on the first-pass
metabolism of alcohol, specifically, the first-pass metabolism
was considerably lower among alcoholic women compared to
alcoholic men, which in turn was lower than nonalcoholic men.
Similar findings were reported for the alcohol dehydrogenase
activity level; with the highest activity levels (70 to 80
percent) found in the nonalcoholic men and women, less activity
among the alcoholic men (37 to 46 percent), and the smallest
activity level among alcoholic women (11 to 20 percent). To
summarize, the women in general had lower rates of first- pass
metabolism and lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase activity,
which both lead to an increase in the amount of ethanol in the
circulatory system. The levels of enzyme activity further
decreased among the alcoholic women and the first-pass metabolism
was essentially nonexistent, indicating little neutralization by
the stomach. </p>

<p> Researchers have also been studying the effect of hormonal
changes during the menstrual cycle on alcohol absorption rates.
Alcohol absorption has been reported to vary during a woman's
cycle--specifically, the rate of alcohol absorption increases
premenstrually. However, data from other clinicaland animal
trials have disputed these findings (65). </p>

<p> What is clear from this type of biological research is that
few firm conclusions can be made about gender differences in
response to alcohol ingestion, and even fewer still about
biological responses to drugs other than alcohol. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the psychosocial differences that have been
identified between the sexes could assist practitioners in the
development of more gender specific substance abuse prevention
programs. For example, because many women can pinpoint specific
events in their lives that they believe contributed to their
heavy alcohol or drug use, it would behoove professionals working
with women to be cognizant of these factors. General inquires
could be made at yearly physical or gynecological exams, which
could also serve as informational sessions on the dangers of
alcohol and drug use (39). In addition, special attention should
be paid toward adolescent girls whose first experience with
alcohol and drugs is often through a male family member or
boyfriend. </p>

<p> Broadly speaking, there are basic gaps in knowledge
concerning gender differences and substance use within virtually
all the parts identified in this report: Part I- necessary
preconditions; Part II-individual factors; and Part III-activity
settings. Until these gaps are addressed, the practice of
transferring data garnered from studies specific for one gender,
to the other gender, is inaccurate and misleading. </p>

<p> Race and Ethnicity </p>

<p> Historically, racial and ethnic minorities have been linked
with, and often blamed for, many of the drug problems within the
United States. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, the
general public associated the growth in opium addicts with the
arrival of Chinese immigrants; although numerous physicians had
been freely prescribing narcotic preparations to their patients,
many of whom were middle- to upper-class whites. The drug cocaine
has long been associated with blacks. A popular image during this
time was one of cocaine-crazed blacks, although use of cocaine
was widespread among whites as well (86). Throughout this same
period, marijuana was thought to have been brought into the
country and promoted by Mexican immigrants and later picked up by
the subculture of black jazz musicians. Due in part to public
paranoia, the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which was a direct
attempt to control marijuana use, was born (45). </p>

<p> In the minds of many individuals, this derogatory link
between minority populations and rampant drug abuse has
continued. Certainly, many urban areas have high concentrations
of minorities, and within these areas the prevalence of alcohol
and drug abuse may be high. Often over-looked, however, is the
existence of alcohol and drug problems in suburban and rural
areas throughout the United States, which have varying
percentages of minorities. </p>

<p> Prevalence rates for past month use of an illicit substance
in 1992 (see figure 6-2) are not drastically different between
whites, blacks, and Hispanics, although it should be kept in mind
that this statistic does not accurately reflect abuse or
addiction. Even though the prevalence of illicit substance use
was highest among blacks, over three-fourths (76 percent) of the
past month illicit substance users were white. In other words,
there were approximately 8.7 million whites, 1.5 million blacks,
885,000 Hispanics, and 315,000 individuals of other racial and
ethnic groups who reported past month use of an illicit substance
in 1992 (79). </p>

<p> Also for 1992 among individuals aged 12 and older, whites
reported the highest percentage of alcohol use within the past
week (21 percent), followed by blacks (19 percent), and Hispanics
(18 percent) (79). The rates for heavy drinking were not
statistically different by race or ethnicity (5 percent for
whites and blacks, and 6 percent for Hispanics) (78). </p>

<p> Until fairly recently, much of the analysis of substance use
data has concentrated on the correlations between the use of a
substance and one or two variables such as race and ethnicity
and/or educational level. Often a positive association was found
between minority populations and the use of certain substances.
While statistically correct, these analyses can be simplistic and
misleading (see box 6- 3). Clearly many risk and protective
factors interact to produce substance use and abuse. If the
majority of these variables are excluded from the analysis, a
skewed picture may arise as to the importance of certain
variables as risk factors for substance use and abuse.
Additionally, to simplify the data collection, racial and ethnic
categories are often broad. The most popular groupings are
blacks, white non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other. Though each of
these categories contains many distinct cultures, gross
generalizations are commonly made within each category. </p>

<p> In recent years, there has been a shift toward analyzing more
carefully the complex relationship between cigarette, alcohol and
illicit drug use, and socioeconomic and demographic variables.
The previous research had drawn on relatively small databases.
However, in 1992, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
critically analyzed the national drug use data collected in its
1988 and 1990 NHSDA. Predictors of drug and alcohol use included
an extensive array of both individual variables (e.g., age,
educational level, marital status) and aggregate variables based
on the attributes of the census block, community, or region in
which the respondent lived (see table 6-3 for a complete list). </p>

<p> The effect of select variables such as race and ethnicity
were measured, while simultaneously controlling for all other
variables (e.g., age, educational level, employment status).
Individuals of racial and ethnic minorities were found to be no
more likely than whites to use alcohol heavily (defined as having
five or more drinks on five or more days in the past month) or to
use marijuana, cocaine, or psychotherapeutic drugs (inclusion of
crack or heroin in the analysis was impossible due to the small
number of respondents reporting use). In fact, when socioeconomic
status was controlled for, both blacks and Hispanics had a
substantially lower likelihood of heavy alcohol use than whites
(76). </p>

<p> A reanalysis of the 1988 NHSDA data was accomplished by an
independent group of researchers who clustered the respondent
data into neighborhood risk sets. The original analysis on the
1988 data revealed that for all ages, blacks and Hispanics were
twice as likely to have ever used crack cocaine than were whites.
Once neighborhood clusters were established, the data revealed
that given similar social and environmental conditions, crack use
did not differ significantly for blacks or Hispanics compared
with whites (9). However, the number of reported crack users in
the study was relatively small (138), and neighborhoods were
identified as crack neighborhoods with as few as one reported
crack user, thus the research findings should not be generalized.
</p>

<p> The new research hypothesized that the previous racial
differences found in the prevalence of crack cocaine smoking may
have been due to macrosocial environmental risk factors
including: differences in the availability of crack; employment
rates; premature death rates; community contact with the criminal
justice system; socially acceptable mechanisms for coping with
life stressors; distribution of wealth; and access to social
resources. </p>

<p> While both studies had specific limitations, the importance
of these types of analyses cannot be understated. Focus should be
placed on the interaction between communities and individuals and
the relative influence on subsequent drug and alcohol use, rather
than a person's race or ethnicity. </p>

<p> Race or ethnicity has not been shown to be either a
biological or genetic risk factor for substance use or abuse. To
date, the preponderance of investigative studies has focused on
racial and ethnic differences in response specifically to
alcohol. Virtually no study has been completed on differences in
racial and ethnic biological responses to other licit or illicit
drugs. </p>

<p> Individual metabolism of alcohol is essentially controlled by
two enzymes, aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. If
the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase is inactive for any reason,
ingestion of even a small amount of alcohol can cause rapid and
prominent facial flushing. Continued drinking leads to nausea,
dizziness, palpitations, and faintness. This reaction is seen
among many Asians (84,16). </p>

<p> A mutant form of alcohol dehydrogenase will effect the
efficiency of alcohol metabolism as well. Altered forms of the
alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme have also been reported in several
Asian populations. </p>

<p> The two enzymes, aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase, probably
interact in some individuals to amplify the adverse reaction to
alcohol consumption (57). Since this reaction discourages heavy
drinking, the observation that it commonly occurs in some
populations where alcoholism is relatively rare suggests that
alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase mutations might be a major
determinant of alcohol consumption, abuse, and dependence. This
would seem to hold true for Taiwan and Japan where the reaction
occurs in 30 to 50 percent of individuals. Research on these two
enzymes among other racial and ethnic groups is scanty and
inconclusive. </p>

<p> The role genetics plays in the heritability of alcohol and
other drug problems has been studied for the past 30 years. While
this topic is more thoroughly addressed in chapter 3, one point
is worth mentioning here. Of the more than 30 family, twin, and
adoption studies that have been completed, the vast majority have
used white males as study subjects. Clearly, among different
racial and ethnic groups the relationship between genetic
heritability and increased susceptibility to alcohol and other
drug problems is an area that deserves further study. </p>

<p> While race and ethnicity in and of themselves are not
predictive risk factors for future substance abuse, by reviewing
when, how, and why certain substances became problematic within
different racial and ethnic groups, insight can be gained into
the generational impact drugs have had on these populations. Four
broad racial and ethnic groups (and one multiracial and ethnic
group, see box 6-4) are discussed below in the following manner:
historical perspectives; prevalence statistics; psychosocial and
cultural antecedents; and selected prevention programs. A
separate section on areas for future research is also included. </p>

<p> Native American Indians/Alaska Natives </p>

<p> There are more than 1.5 million Americans Indians and Alaskan
Natives throughout the United States, with vastly different
languages and cultural beliefs. Even within the same tribe there
may be a good deal of cultural diversity, since differences exist
between reservation and rural tribal members, and those residing
in urban settings. While urban dwelling American Indians may
constitute more than 50 percent of the total Indian population,
little is known concerning their health status (59). </p>

<p> The American Indians' introduction to alcohol dates back to
the early 1600s and their initial interactions with European
trappers and settlers. Much of the early trading between the
Europeans and American Indians involved an exchange of alcohol.
It was not long before alcohol became a considerable problem for
many American Indian tribes. Some researchers speculate that
because American Indians lacked a prior drinking history, or role
model for moderate drinking practices, many tribes adopted a
quick and copious style of drinking, consistently drinking to the
point of intoxication. However, in other tribes, it is appears
that being intoxicated was deemed unacceptable, and over time
these tribes developed a &quot;social&quot; drinking style (35). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Studies among American Indian adolescents have shown that
prevalence rates for licit and illicit drug use vary
insignificantly between tribes (5,4). However, compared to
non-Indian youth, Indian adolescents consistently begin using
alcohol, illicit substances, cigarettes, and inhalants at a
younger age, at higher rates, and in combination with each other
(10,60,69). With regard to alcohol, there is often a great deal
of peer pressure to drink as the Indian thing to do (42). Studies
have shown that Indian youth are three times more likely to be
involved in alcohol-related offenses than their white or Hispanic
counterparts. A 1982 study indicated that alcohol was involved in
as many as 58 percent of Indian juvenile arrests (63 percent for
males, 37 percent for females)(60). </p>

<p> In some tribes, up to 30 percent of American Indian
adolescents have used inhalants, most notably, gasoline and glue.
The age group with the highest rate of inhalant use was 11- to
13-year-olds. Contrary to the popular belief that inhalant abuse
occurs primarily among boys, research among American Indians
revealed that eighth grade girls and boys were equally likely to
have inhaled volatile substances. While the rate for Indian
inhalant use decreases substantially among high school age youth
(down to 4 percent), it is still 2.5 times greater than the rate
for non-Indian youth of that age. Interestingly, while the rate
of inhalant use has remained relatively stable among Indian youth
since 1984, there has been a steady rise of reported use among
non-Indian adolescents (66). </p>

<p> While there is no substantial difference in alcohol use among
various tribal adolescents, rates do differ between the drinking
patterns of tribal adults. Contrary to the still pervasive
drunken Indian stereotype, many tribes have levels of adult
alcohol use below the national average (42). Consistent with the
U.S. population as a whole, American Indian males are more likely
to drink than females (42,35). In some tribes it is permissible
for adolescent females to experiment with alcohol, with the
understanding that when adulthood is reached they are expected to
abstain or drink only rarely. </p>

<p> As is true for adolescents, adult Indians encounter an
increased rate of legal complications due to alcohol and drug
use. Data on urban American Indians has shown that while under
the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs, they are arrested at
four times the rate for blacks and 10 times the rate for whites
(44). </p>

<p> Few statistics exist to quantify illicit substance use among
the adult American Indian population. While alcohol is clearly a
major problem for some tribes, future research efforts should
include data on the use of illicit substances. </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> The relationship between the majority of American Indians and
the early settlers was suffused with violence, distrust, deceit,
and perhaps more than anything, forcible and abrupt change. The
food American Indians ate, how they dressed, where and how they
lived, what language they spoke, tribal governing structures, and
how they worshiped were, for the most part, forcibly altered to
conform with the newly dominant society's cultural and moral
views. While these involuntary changes occurred several
generations ago, their impact on the American Indian culture
should not be underestimated. </p>

<p> In some instances, tribal traditions, languages, and methods
of worship were lost. Thousands of American Indian children, some
as young as 3 years old, were removed from their families and
placed in federally funded and run boarding schools, where
physical, verbal, and sexual abuse were common. Nuclear and
extended families were dispersed, and with them, a vital social
support system. Acculturation issues abounded. Children returned
home from boarding schools unable to speak their native language,
or understand the importance of their cultural traditions. These
cultural problems are multigenerational, and current studies
reveal that American Indian children report more emotional
problems, mental health problems, and low self-esteem than
non-Indian children (60). While the relationship between many of
these psychosocial/cultural antecedents and increased substance
abuse levels has yet to be formally evaluated, clearly the
American Indian people have been, and in some may continue to be,
subjected to cultural disruption. </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> For substance abuse prevention programs to be effective
within the American Indian population it is important to realize
the diversity that exists between tribes and villages. For
example, a specific program tailored to New Mexico Navajos living
on the Navajo reservation may be culturally unacceptable to
Winnebago Indians living in urban Minneapolis, MN. However,
several fairly universal themes permeate American Indian culture:
the importance of tribal identity, which is an individual's
membership or affiliation with specific tribe(s); a belief that
each human is a multidimensional being made up of a body, mind,
and spirit, and that the spirit world coexists and intermingles
with the physical world; the importance of sharing and
generosity, allegiance to one's family and community, respect for
elders, noninterference, orientation to present time, and harmony
with nature; the importance of an oral tradition as a primary
method of teaching values, attitudes, legends, and stories; an
emphasis on observant, reflective, and integrative skills which
lead to communication patterns that give virtue to silence,
listening, nonverbal cues, and learning by example; and the
presence of rituals and symbols that are acknowledged for their
underlying significance, which is expected to emerge as time and
experience go on (72). </p>

<p> One example that assists communities in the development of
culturally sensitive programs is an instructional publication
compiled by The Four Worlds Development Project in Alberta,
Canada. Information has been collected on health promotion and
prevention efforts by various indigenous people from around the
world. The text assists American Indian communities in tailoring
program planning, training, and implementation techniques with
their culture beliefs and specific needs (24). </p>

<p> Blacks </p>

<p> A great deal of diversity exists within the black community.
One reflection of that diversity is the use of the terms African
American and black. Some researchers use African American to
define black persons who are direct descendants of men and women
brought to the United States as slaves, whereas blacks is used to
define all people and cultures of African descent, including
black people from the West Indies, Africa, and the Americas. At
times, the two terms are used interchangeably (72). For this
section, both terms will be utilized where appropriate. </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> Many of the first blacks to arrive in the United States did
so as slaves. Plantation owners were responsible for regulating
much of their slaves' alcohol consumption. During holidays,
alcohol was routinely distributed to the slaves in reward for
their loyalty and hard work, and the subsequent drunken revelries
were tolerated. This controlled permissiveness began to change in
the early 1800s, as clandestine groups of black slaves began
their quest for freedom. It was at this point that blacks were
prohibited from owning stills, or even being in possession of
alcoholic beverages. These laws persisted after the Civil War,
when technically, blacks had been granted citizenship (14). </p>

<p> Spanning the late 1800s through the late 1960s, hundreds of
thousands of blacks left the South and, looking for work, headed
for northern cities. This period was later described as the
&quot;Great Migration,&quot; with a total outmigration estimated
at 4.3 million individuals (72,14). This outmigration contributed
substantially to defining the large number of blacks currently
found in many of the northern urban areas. Unfortunately, many of
those seeking work did not find it, nor did they find that they
were free from racism, discrimination, and oppression. Slowly,
the numbersleaving the South decreased, and by the 1970s there
was actually some migration back into the southern states by both
northern-born blacks and individuals returning home after
unsuccessful moves to the North. </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Differences in adolescent drug use among high school seniors
by race and ethnicity were discussed earlier in this chapter (see
box 6-A). Among this group, alcohol, cigarette, and illicit drug
use was lowest among black and Asian youth, even after inclusion
of background and lifestyle factors. Obviously, a drawback to
this type of survey is that high school dropouts are not included
in the analyses. The 1991 event dropout rate (which measures the
proportion of individuals who dropped out of school over a
specified time period) for grades 10 to 12, ages 15 to 24, reveal
dropout percentages of 3.2 for whites, 6.0 for blacks, and 7.3
for Hispanics (63). While the event dropout rate for blacks is
double that of white students, low alcohol and drug usage rates
have also been found among black eighth and tenth graders, so the
low rate of substance use among black twelfth graders cannot be
due entirely to dropout rates (75). </p>

<p> While use of alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs is
relatively low among blacks, data on heavy or frequent use of
such substances differs. The 1991 NHSDA data for individuals aged
12 to 20 found that 7.3 percent of whites reported heavy alcohol
use (defined as having 5 or more drinks on one occasion on 5 or
more days in the past 30 days), Hispanics reported 3.9 percent,
and blacks reported 2.7 percent. However, for those individuals
aged 21 or older, heavy alcohol use did not differ significantly
between whites and blacks (5.0 vs. 6.0 percent), but was
significantly higher among Hispanics (6.6 percent) (77). Other
studies on heavy alcohol use, by gender, have shown that white
men aged 18 to 29 report the highest prevalence of heavy
drinking, which then declined in subsequent age groups.
Conversely, the abstention rate for black males was highest among
those aged 18 to 29, while subsequent age groups showed
significantly increased levels of heavy drinking--among whom half
report either frequent heavy or frequent high maximum drinking
(70). Similarly, white women in the 18 to 29 age group were
significantly more likely to drink, and to drink heavily, than
were young black women (67). </p>

<p> Past-month use (which does not necessarily constitute abuse)
of an illicit substance by race and ethnicity was discussed at
the beginning of this section (see figure 6-2). However, the 1992
NHSDA also contains more specific data for some of the most
commonly used substances such as marijuana and cocaine. Of the
blacks age 12 and older surveyed, 3.2 reported using marijuana
once a week or more compared to 2.5 percent for whites and
Hispanics. Blacks also had the highest reported weekly use of
cocaine (0.5 percent) compared to Hispanic and white percentages
(0.4 and 0.3, respectively) (78). </p>

<p> Persistence of drug use has also been used as another
indicator of substance use severity and is measured by percent of
monthly users divided by percent of lifetime users. It has been
shown that blacks and Hispanics have a different pattern of drug
persistence from that of whites. Data on cocaine use analyzed
from the 1990 NHSDA showed that the persistence rate for blacks
age 18 to 25 was almost three times that of whites (.29 vs.. 09),
and among those aged 26 to 34, the rate for blacks was four times
higher than that for whites (.21 vs.. 05). In both age groups,
the persistence rates for Hispanics were between those of blacks
and whites. It is important to note that the differences in
persistence did not appear to extend to alcohol and marijuana
(32). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> At least initially, many blacks did not arrive in the United
States voluntarily. The legacy of slavery has shaped much of
black culture. Black slaves struggled with many of the same
issues as American Indians: loss of languages, traditions, and
religious beliefs; assimilation and acculturation issues; and the
breakup of nuclear and extended families. Not allowed to express
their original languages, cultures, and beliefs, blacks attempted
to establish new cultural identities amidst oppression,
segregation, and racism. </p>

<p> Hypotheses concerning alcoholism among black males have been
proposed by several studies. Some researchers believe that the
increase in the number of heavy drinkers among black males in
their thirties may be due to feelings of frustration and failure
concerning career expectations. A complementary view points to
the combination of high unemployment rates among black males
coupled with the large numbers of liquor stores found in many
urban black neighborhoods, as having contributed to the alcohol
problems faced by black men (14,82). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> With respect to the use of alcohol and other drugs, common
themes link blacks. In general, social stratification, church and
community involvement, and racial identity are thought to be
important variables in attitudes toward alcohol and drug use
(72,14). The level of importance will vary between individuals
and groups depending on environmental factors. One program cited
as exemplary by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP)
is called Super II, and targets primarily at risk, black
inner-city youths 11 to 17 and their parents. The design and
implementation of the program emphasizes holism and cultural
competence, viewing them as crucial in reducing the strength of
risk factors and increasing the strength of resiliency factors.
The program takes place through already established agencies in
the communities (Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs) and incorporates the
childrens' caregivers, youth and recreational workers, police
officials, local corporations, and a variety of social service
agencies. The first-year evaluation report found reductions in
four of five major categories of alcohol- and drug- related
behavior. These included frequency of use and amount of use,
number of modalities of use, alcohol- and drug-related behavior
problems, and media influenceability (71). </p>

<p> Another antidrug abuse campaign is being waged by the
Congress of National Black Churches, Inc. (CNBC), a national
nonprofit religious organization comprised of a variety of
denominations. Through a variety of programs, the CNBC clergy are
mobilizing, creating, and coordinating groups of individuals
interested in bringing about positive change in their
communities. Program strategies are implemented in partnership
with the police, criminal justice agencies, school systems,
social service agencies, private organization and businesses, and
informal community networks to reduce the supply of and demand
for drugs. </p>

<p> Hispanics </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> The term Hispanic was first used by the U.S. Census Bureau in
1980 to designate those individuals who resided in the United
States and whose cultural origins were in Mexico, Puerto Rico,
Cuba, Central America, and other Latin American countries. Not
all members of this group accept the term and prefer to use
phrases such as Latino or la raza (literally, &quot;the
race&quot;). Data from the 1990 census reveal an Hispanic
population of more than 20 million, and projections indicate that
Hispanics will be the largest minority group in the United States
sometime between the years 2000 and 2010. Hispanics of Mexican
origin, by far the largest Hispanic group (63 percent), are
clustered in the southwest, particularly California and Texas.
Puerto Ricans, excluding those living on the island of Puerto
Rico, are the second largest subgroup (12 percent) and live
primarily in the Northeast, especially in and around New York
City, New York. Cubans (5 percent) live primarily around their
port of entry, Miami, Florida, though large numbers are found in
New Jersey and New York. Dominicans, who reside primarily in the
Northeastern Atlantic States, are also beginning to grow in
number. In the past 10 years, there has been a large immigration
of Central Americans to the United States. These individuals have
come primarily from civil war-plagued countries including
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. It is highly possible that
many of the problems faced by newly arrived Hispanic immigrants
may be exacerbated among this population who have left their
countries involuntarily. Refugees escaping political turmoil or
open warfare often show signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(72). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> NIDA data collected from 1975 to 1991 on drug use among
twelfth graders, as well as data from 1991 for eighth and tenth
graders, reveal the following for Hispanic students: as a group,
Hispanic youth had the highest lifetime and annual prevalence
rates in the senior year for PCP, cocaine, crack, heroin, ice,
and steroids, compared to whites and blacks, and the rates for
crack and steroid use were particularly high; among eighth
graders, Hispanics had higher rates of past month use for
virtually all the drugs surveyed including, cocaine, heroin,
inhalants, alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens, and cigarettes. In
other words, in eighth grade, before a considerable number of
students has dropped out, Hispanic youth have the highest
prevalence of nearly all drug use, but by twelfth grade, whites
have the highest usage rates. The researchers suggest two
possible explanations, which are not necessarily exclusive. The
first being that the high dropout rate for Hispanics in later
grades (in some areas as high as 40 percent) is causing a shift
in the rates, and the second is that while Hispanic youth begin
experimenting earlier, white youth catch up by the later grades
(75). </p>

<p> National statistics for 1992 of past-month use of any illicit
substance indicated that rates for Hispanics and whites were not
significantly different, and were slightly lower than those for
blacks (see figure 6-2). The same database also revealed that for
the illicit substances measured, Hispanic rates either fell
between black and white rates, or were the lowest rates reported
by an ethnic group. The only exception would be the heavy alcohol
use data (defined as having 5 or more drinks on one occasion on 5
or more days within the past 30 days) for 1991 (1992 data not yet
available) which showed that Hispanics aged 21 or older reported
significantly more heavy alcohol use within the past month as
compared to whites and blacks (77). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> Dignidad, respeto, confianza--dignity, respect, and trust--
are important elements in the Hispanic culture. Like many
immigrants to the United States, Hispanics deal with language,
cultural, racial, and economic barriers. These barriers and how
they are handled within the Hispanic culture have a great deal to
do with subsequent alcohol and drug problems. To a large extent,
drinking (at times heavily) among Hispanic males is not only
expected, but encouraged. Much of the research literature has
therefore centered around alcohol and its misuse. To be able to
drink heavily and maintain &quot;control&quot; is a valued
characteristic among most Hispanic men (38). Personal identities
for a vast majority of Hispanic men are intricately entwined with
the notion of machismo, which generally connotes strength,
masculinity, independence, and responsibility (1). The man of the
family is expected to provide for and take care of his wife and
children. For those who may be unable to fulfill this role, due
to difficulties learning English and/or procuring employment, the
social drinking pattern can change from one of low frequency and
high quantity, to high frequency and high quantity (38,1). This
drinking pattern varies between Hispanic groups, however. A study
completed in 1981 found that drinking levels among newly arrived
Dominicans, Guatemalans, and Puerto Ricans, when compared to
preimmigration levels, decreased, increased, and remained the
same, respectively (1). </p>

<p> As is relatively true for other cultures, heavy drinking is
not condoned for Hispanic women. This is not to say that it does
not exist. While the majority of first generation Hispanic women
generally abstain or drink very little, changes in drinking
patterns among the following generations have been observed. To
the distress of many first generational Hispanic families, as
their daughters and granddaughters become increasingly
acculturated, the drinking patterns and alcohol problems more
closely mirror those found in the general population (26).
Another change observed among more acculturated Hispanic women is
the diminishment of marianismo, which is the female complement to
machismo, and encompasses such behaviors as submissiveness,
humility, tolerance, virtuosity, and devotion to the male
(whether father, husband, or first son). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> Important intergroup differences need to be understood for
the planning, implementation, and evaluation of substance abuse
prevention programs. For example, while two immigrants, one
Mexican and the other El Salvadorian, may both speak Spanish and
may both be experiencing many of the same difficulties in
adjusting to life in the United States, they are very likely to
have had vastly different lifetime and cultural experiences (72).
</p>

<p> Funds from CSAP as well as the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have been distributed to several
demonstration projects throughout the United States and Puerto
Rico that target high-risk Hispanic youth and their families.
Many of these programs are similar to others previously outlined
in this report in their attempt to be as comprehensive as
possible through the coordination of families, schools, law
enforcement, and local social services and businesses. Several of
the programs are creating their own audiovisual and written
materials in Spanish, others are utilizing activities such as
English courses, puppet shows, and live theater performances,
while others employ peer group counseling and mentoring programs
(69). </p>

<p> Asian and Pacific Island Americans </p>

<p> Historically </p>

<p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asian and Pacific Island
Americans are the fastest growing population in the United
States. Between 1980 and 1988, the number of Asian and Pacific
Island Americans increased by 76 percent compared with an
increase of 36 percent within the Hispanic population. Similar to
the other racial and ethnic categories, the term Asian and
Pacific Island American gives one the impression of homogeneity,
while in reality, over 60 different racial and ethnic groups are
lumped in this bracket. Some of the diverse populations included
in this group are Hawaiians, Guamanians, Filipinos, Thais,
Bengalis, and Sri Lankans. Beside the obvious differences in
language, and cultural norms and beliefs, is the degree to which
different subpopulations have acculturated and/or assimilated to
the dominant culture. Many Chinese and Japanese families have
been in the United States for three generations or more, which is
in sharp contrast to the majority of first-generation Vietnamese,
Koreans, Asian Indians, and Filipinos (72,85). </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics </p>

<p> Research on substance use and abuse within the Asian and
Pacific Island American population appears to be sporadic, and
often limited to alcohol. While the three national surveys NHSDA,
the National Adolescent School Health Survey, and the High School
Senior Survey, all collect separate data for Asian and Pacific
Island Americans, only the High School Senior Survey routinely
analyzes the data separately. Due to small sample sizes, the
remaining two surveys included Asian and Pacific Islanders under
the racial and ethnic category of &quot;other.&quot; </p>

<p> Research on alcohol consumption patterns among adult Asian
and Pacific Island Americans consistently shows that this
population drinks substantially less than whites and Hispanics,
and slightly less than blacks. Though subgroup variation does
exist, as data reveal, native Hawaiians drink at levels
comparable to those of whites, among mainland Asian Americans,
Japanese Americans drink the most, followed by Koreans and
Chinese Americans. However, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino men
all have roughly the same percentage of heavy drinkers at 28
percent. This style of heavy drinking is typically associated
with business entertainment and after work socializing (68).
Among Asian and Pacific Island American women, four-fifths of
Korean and Filipino women were reported to be abstainers, as were
two-thirds of Chinese women, and one-third of Japanese women.
Among women who drank, the percentage who did so heavily varied:
12 percent for Japanese women; less than 4 percent for Filipino
women; and virtually none for Chinese and Korean women (68). A
similar statistic for white women showed 14.5 percent reported
drinking heavily (73). Evidence suggests, however, that the
prevalence of drinking may be on the rise among both men and
women Asian and Pacific Island Americans, although the exact
reasons for this remain unclear. Some researchers have suggested
that paralleling other immigrant populations, the more
acculturated and assimilated generations will tend to adopt the
drinking patterns of the dominant culture. Yet other researchers
point to the fact that a significant number of second and third
generation Asian and Pacific Island Americans have not adopted a
more copious style of drinking. </p>

<p> For adolescent Asian Americans, the majority of the studies
mirrors the findings for the adults--this group consistently has
the lowest prevalence of alcohol and other drug use for all
racial and ethnic groups with the possible exception of black
youth. Although, a prospective study conducted in North Carolina
found an alarming increase in reported alcohol and other drug use
among Asian Americans over a three-year period in the late 1980s.
The reason for this increase at a time when prevalence rates for
other races and ethnicities was decreasing remains unknown (72).
Another study on youth in California reported that Chinese
American youth used quaaludes twice as often as white and
Hispanic youth, and five times as often as black youth (68).
Drinking statistics for Asian American youth are again similar to
those reported by the adult population, that is, their overall
prevalence rate is one of the lowest, but statistics for heavy
drinking are similar to those found among white youth (72). </p>

<p> Psychosocial/cultural antecedents </p>

<p> Why does this population have such low overall rates of
alcohol and other drug use? The diversity present within the
Asian and Pacific Island American group makes it impossible to
list all the different cultural factors that could influence
alcohol and drug use patterns. However, among many of the
subpopulations, anthropologists and substance abuse experts have
found the existence of the following philosophies: moderation,
family reputation, humility, keeping a low profile, negative
community sanctions on excessive drinking and behavior, and the
impact of parental drinking practices (83). Among Chinese
specifically, alcohol is in an important part of many religious
and celebratory ceremonies, yet excessive use is strongly
discouraged. </p>

<p> One study in California uncovered additional behavioral
factors that influenced drinking patterns among some Asian
American men. Japanese respondents were heavily influenced by
their friends' drinking; among Chinese men, those with more
education were more likely to drink; and Korean men were strongly
influenced by their parents' drinking habits (68). </p>

<p> Few researchers have examined psychosocial influences on
Asian and Pacific Island American adolescent drinking or other
drug use. One factor which has been mentioned, though, is the
pressure Asian American youth, in particular, are under to
succeed, especially academically. Thirty-four percent of Asian
Americans are college educated, more than twice that of the
United States population as a whole. Those with the least amount
of college education were American Indians (7.7 percent) and
Pacific Islanders (9.3 percent). Asian parents are similar to
parents, in general, in their hopes for their children's success.
However, among some subpopulations (notably Japanese, Korean, and
Chinese) the feelings for their children are often tied to the
child's academic achievement. When their children perform poorly
in school, some parents respond with strong
criticism,disapproval, and shame. This can understandably add a
substantial amount of stress to an adolescent who may already be
coping with language and cultural differences (72). </p>

<p> Prevention programs </p>

<p> Mainstream culture in the United States, to a great degree,
emphasizes individuality, competitiveness, and monetary success.
Conversely, for many Asian and Pacific Island Americans the
qualities most stressed are the needs of the family, sharing and
generosity, and a belief in who you are rather than what you own.
Because the extended family is so important in many of the
cultures, it is often the first group that an individual with
problems will turn to versus an &quot;outsider&quot; or social
service agency. Substance abuse prevention practitioners need to
be aware of the strong resistance within many Asian and Pacific
Island Americans to seek outside assistance. </p>

<p> One innovative substance abuse program entitled Na Keiki O
Ka`Aina (Children of the Land) is being implemented in Oahu,
Hawaii. Children attending the local Makaha elementary school
work several hours a week on a farm where they learn to care for
the land, their environment, and themselves as alternatives to
lifestyles that rely on alcohol and other drugs. The program uses
the cultural values of native Hawaiians, which emphasize
&quot;warm, open friendship and love,&quot; love of the earth,
and other spiritual values. Since the program's inception, class
behavior has noticeably improved, English scores have increased,
and a survey measuring drug use in the district schools showed
that Makaha school was the only school that reported a decrease
(74). </p>

<p> Areas for Future Research Among Different Racial and Ethnic
Groups </p>

<p> While this section of the report has reiterated the need to
view racial and ethnic groups as heterogeneous, the majority of
substance abuse data is not collected or examined in this way. To
date, a variety of distinct cultures are usually grouped under
one classification, and generalizations are made concerning this
group's drug use. While substance abuse prevention programs are
often better tailored to specific subpopulations and cultures, it
is virtually impossible to adequately evaluate these programs
when little baseline substance abuse data exists for specific
subpopulations. There is therefore room for improvement in the
collection of prevalence data on alcohol and other drug use and
abuse among distinct racial and ethnic groups. Furthermore, long-
term prospective studies, which are essential for understanding
risk and protective factors specific to different groups, are
extremely scarce. </p>

<p> Biomedical research on different racial and ethnic groups has
also been inconclusive and scanty (with the possible exception of
alcohol research and Asians). </p>

<p> ECONOMICS </p>

<p> Economics can be viewed as a factor in individual substance
abuse in two ways. In areas where substance abuse is already well
established and viable employment opportunities are scarce,
selling illicit substances can seem very appealing. Several
questions arise from this scenario. Are individuals lured into
the world of illegal drug sales by income potential? And, are
drug dealers more likely to become drug abusers because they are
dealers? Both of these questions have been addressed under the
first section. </p>

<p> A parallel issue is that of poverty and the daily stresses
encountered by individuals living in chronically poor areas. Do
individuals living in these poor areas abuse substances in
greater numbers or are fewer social services available in these
areas, and thus the consequences from substance abuse are more
acutely felt and visible? </p>

<p> Generated Income </p>

<p> While few studies have attempted to ascertain the individual
incomes of drug dealers, two studies have concentrated on the
street sale of illicit drugs by urban youth (21,52). The research
revealed that individual dealers reported mean gross monthly
incomes of $3,558 to $5,934. Even if these self-reported earnings
were exaggerated, this sum of money is clearly more than many
urban youth could hope to obtain in legitimate jobs at a median
of $7 per hour. </p>

<p> This earning potential may be a serious obstacle to
prevention, intervention, and treatment programs targeted toward
urban adolescents. The staff at an innovative treatment program
for drug dealers in Baltimore, Maryland, has discovered the
difficulties former dealers have in giving up the fast lifestyles
they once led. </p>

<p> Most dealers say they do it because of the money,&quot; says
a staff counselor. &quot;They can't see working at McDonald's for
minimum wage when they're making $500 to $1,000 per day,&quot; he
adds. Counselors try to help clients think beyond the idea of
making fast money to the moral, social and legal issues
associated with drug dealing. They find, however, that the moral
issue is not always clear-cut. In many cases, clients are
supporting their families and it is hard for them to see they are
doing something wrong when they are paying the bills. </p>

<p> Overall, counselors say their clients are addicted to the
money. &quot;What we do is help them see what is all around them,
what they're doing to themselves and their community by selling
drugs (48). </p>

<p> The potential for monetary gain may be especially true within
the crack trade. A young black male from San Francisco,
California, explained his preference for the immediate rewards of
selling crack over the seemingly meaningless rituals of school: </p>

<p> Forget about school. I'd rather have a life of selling drugs.
?.?. When you go to school, you do nothing. You sit around, have
books in your backpack, take`em home, do your homework, come back
to school, get some grade. When you sell drugs, see, I had
satisfaction of seeing my work, getting some money for it (22). </p>

<p> It would appear then that for many urban youth, selling
illicit drugs supplies purpose, companionship, and income without
compromising dignity. More money can be gained from the sale of
illicit drugs than through petty crimes, and certainly more than
through minimum wage jobs. </p>

<p> Another issue to be addressed is the dealer-turned-client.
From the two previously cited studies, dealers were estimated to
spend between 59 and 71 percent of their income each month on the
purchase of illicit drugs. For example, out of $3,558 gross per
month, $1,226 was spent purchasing additional drugs for business,
$883 was spent on drugs for personal consumption, and an
additional $533 on expenses associated with drug dealing. </p>

<p> The Urban Institute has also reviewed the relationship
between using and selling drugs. Its study population was
composed of 387 inner-city adolescent males of ninth- and tenth-
grade age. Of this sample, 79.6 percent reported that they
neither used nor sold drugs within the past year. Of the
remainder, 19.0 percent reported both using and selling drugs,
44.3 percent reported selling only, and 36.7 percent reported
using only. They also discovered that the greater the level of
involvement in either using or selling, the higher the likelihood
of doing both (13). </p>

<p> In summary, the research completed thus far neither confirms
nor negates the possible influence income potential has on luring
individuals into drug dealing. Nor can one conclude that drug
dealers are more likely to become substance abusers than
nondealers. </p>

<p> Poverty </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug problems are present not only among the
poor, but are poor individuals at greater risk for developing
these problems? While a relatively straight forward question, not
only is poverty difficult to define, but drawing conclusions
concerning an individual's potential for future substance abuse
based on one or two variables, such as family income or
educational level, is overly simplistic and deceptive. To
adequately review this question, a milieu of both individual and
aggregate measures should be present in any analysis done. </p>

<p> In recent years, great attention has been paid to the plight
of the urban poor, many of whom are minorities. These inner- city
communities are often riddled with high rates of crime, violence,
unemployment, and inadequate social and medical services. For
individuals living in these localities, the consequences of these
problems are serious and far reaching. Yet according to the 1980
census only 9 percent of all the poor, and 21 percent of all the
poor blacks, lived in these types of areas. </p>

<p> To define the problems of the urban poor as predominantly
&quot;black problems&quot; does a disservice to the two-thirds of
African Americans who are not poor, as well as to the two- thirds
of the poor in our central cities who are not black (8). </p>

<p> Poverty within rural communities, while lacking much of the
violence and crime of urban areas, is no less oppressive. In
1987, compared with the general population, rural residents were
less likely to be employed and to have completed high school.
They had lower average incomes and higher poverty rates than did
urban residents, and one out of every six rural families lived in
poverty (compared with one in eight urban families). This ratio
approached one out of two for black rural families. Areas of
chronic poverty were concentrated in the South, where 25 million
of the Nation's 57 million rural residents live (48 percent), and
where four out of every ten rural residents were poor, elderly,
or both (61). </p>

<p> To assess poverty and its relationship to alcohol and drug
abuse problems, one must find appropriate measures. Some
researchers have utilized the Federal guidelines for poverty,
while others employ measures of Socioeconomic Status (SES), such
as educational level and household income. To date, the largest
and most comprehensive analysis of SES variables and substance
use has been accomplished by NIDA (76). Both bivariate and
multivariate analyses were completed on data collected in 1988
and 1990 from NHSDA (see box 6-C). </p>

<p> The NIDA report has two major limitations. First, the
analysis focused on indicators of drug and alcohol use, rather
than indicators of problem use or hard-core use. While the report
has categories for frequent/heavy use and recent use, it cannot
be assumed that individuals who reported such use had alcohol or
drug problems. Secondly, the report lacks data for transient,
homeless, or institutionalized individuals, many of whom have
serious alcohol and/or drug problems. </p>

<p> Table 6-3 presents the findings from the multivariate
analysis of the NHSDA data. The SES variables pertinent to a
possible link between poverty and substance use are educational
level, occupation of chief wage earner, employment status, number
of jobs held in past 5 years, median housing value, and percent
of housing that is owned. Neither personal income nor household
income were included in the analysis, as personal income was most
meaningful only for persons who worked and household income data
were not available in the 1988 survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol consumption within the past month was measured on
three levels: abstinence; nonheavy use; and heavy use. Marijuana
use was measured by any past-month use and cocaine use was
measured by any past-year use (both categories could include
frequent as well as casual users). Major findings from the
analysis include: </p>

<p> o SES variables associated with poverty and predictive of
past month abstinence from alcohol were: not having worked in the
past 5 years and having lived in a census block with a high
percentage of owner occupancy. For users, versus abstainers, SES
attributes predictive of nonheavy alcohol use included having
attended college (regardless of completion) and living in census
areas with high housing values. Significant for heavy alcohol use
was not having completed high school, holding three or more jobs
in the past 5 years, and living in a census area with low housing
values. No employment status or occupational categories were
found to be independently predictive of heavy alcohol use. </p>

<p> o For any past-month marijuana use the independent SES
predictors associated with poverty were being unemployed and
having held three or more jobs in the past 5 years. Individuals
who reported no marijuana use in the past month were more likely
to have had some degree of college participation. </p>

<p> o Many of the SES predictors for cocaine use in the past year
were similar to those identified for marijuana use: being
unemployed and having worked three or more jobs in the past 5
years. SES characteristics predictive of no reported cocaine use
in the past year were being a college graduate and having a
part-time job. </p>

<p> This type of analysis is an exercise in inclusion and
exclusion. A myriad of individual and aggregate characteristics
are initially considered in the equation and, depending on the
outcome of interest, whether it be heavy alcohol use or marijuana
use in the past month, different variables will show themselves
to be either predictive or not predictive of the outcome. Because
personal income and household income were not included in the
multivariate analysis, but are often used as SES measures for
poverty, tables 6-4 and 6-5 depict the bivariate analysis done by
NIDA (76). Again, this analysis reveals associations, not
causality. </p>

<p> Personal income (which is highly correlated with an
individual's age and sex) was examined only for respondents who
reported working full time during the year prior to the survey.
Associations between personal income and drug use were
significant for most drugs. For every drug use measure (except
past-month use of alcohol), plus heavy use of alcohol, the
percentage of users declined as the income level rose.
Differences between income levels for frequent use of marijuana
and cocaine, concurrent heavy use of alcohol with marijuana, and
use of psychotherapeutics, hallucinogens, inhalants, and crack
were all statistically significant and more than twice as common
in the lowest income group as in the highest. Low income was also
associated with higher rates of abstinence from alcohol as well
as higher rates of heavy drinking. </p>

<p> The associations between household income (which is less
affected by age and sex) and drug and alcohol use were
considerably weaker than those observed for personal income. The
only statistically significant associations were for alcohol use,
concurrent heavy alcohol use with marijuana, and use of
hallucinogens. Those with household incomes of $40,000 or higher
were about twice as likely as those with incomes of less than
$12,000 to have used any amount of alcohol in the past month.
However, the rates of heavy drinking differed little across the
income levels. Other categories of drug use appear to be slightly
less common among the wealthiest households, but, in general,
drug use was not strongly related to household income. </p>

<p> From these types of analyses, a straightforward &quot;yes or
no&quot; response to the initial question, which linked poverty
to increased individual risk for drug abuse, is clearly
impossible. The NIDA analyses demonstrated that the type and
quantity of an individual's substance use is correlated with a
variety of both individual as well as geographic characteristics.
Furthermore, while the NIDA report was the largest and most
comprehensive to date, some segments of the population, many of
whom were possible alcohol and drug abusers, were excluded from
the survey. </p>

<p> As one economist noted, &quot;There is much we still need to
learn about poverty. Much of the past research has focused
primarily on economic questions, reflecting the extensive
involvement by economists in this work. Research is much more
limited on topics such as the causes of changing family
structures, the impacts of neighborhoods and family structure on
children's opportunities in life, personal and family coping
strategies among the poor, how expectations about future
opportunities are formed, and how these expectations influence
behavior&quot; (8). </p>

<p> PSYCHOSOCIAL/BEHAVIORAL </p>

<p> Aggressiveness </p>

<p> In much of the research literature the term aggression is
used almost exclusively when referring to young children and
adolescents between the ages of 13 and 15. Shortly after this age
a divergence appears within this identified aggressive group. The
vast majority of children &quot;outgrow&quot; their aggressive
behavior, while a smaller percentage progress into or also
exhibit, among other things, conduct disorders, antisocial
behavior, delinquency, and violence. Discussing each of these
areas is beyond the scope of this report. However, it should be
noted that as is true for many individual risk factors, a number
of these behaviors are intricately meshed. </p>

<p> Definitions for the term aggression vary considerably and may
include tardiness, breaking rules, fighting, vandalism, cruelty
to animals, and verbal abuse of other children. Many studies
simply fail to define it. Wherever possible, study definitions of
aggression will be outlined. </p>

<p> The children in the various studies on aggressiveness and
subsequent drug abuse ranged in age from 5 to 20 years old.
Aggressive behavior in the majority of the studies was exhibited
almost exclusively by boys. While girls were included in the
study populations, the number exhibiting aggressive behavior was
very small. However, the presence of aggressive behavior among
some young girls has not been shown to be predictive of later
adolescent delinquency or substance use (49). This disparity
between the sexes has not been addressed at any length. </p>

<p> Of the preadolescent boys who exhibited aggressive behavior,
30 to 40 percent maintained this behavior into adolescence. This
continued aggression has been shown to be a strong predictor of
subsequent alcohol and drug problems (28,33, 51). Interestingly,
the combination of shy and aggressive behavior has also been
correlated with later substance use problems. It has been
postulated that aggressive boys may be more likely to be shunned
by conventional peer groups, but accepted by other aggressive
children who could encourage drug and alcohol use. Another
theory, while not confirmed, suggests that young children
rejected by conventional peer groups gravitate toward each other
and that these groups of former so-called loners may foster
delinquent behavior in later adolescence (28). Conversely, boys
(but not girls) exhibiting shy behavior have been shown as less
likely to partake in alcohol and drug using activities as they
grew older (28,33,51). </p>

<p> Where does this aggressive behavior originate? Some studies
have shown that young children exhibiting sociable, spontaneous,
and fearless behavior are at greater risk for future aggressive
and violent conduct. Factors that seem to be protective include a
shy temperament, being first born, having a small and stable
family characterized by low discord (i.e., effective family
management), and having parents who regularly attend religious
services (51). </p>

<p> Current psychological perspectives emphasize that aggressive
and violent behaviors are &quot;learned&quot; responses to
frustration, that they can also be learned as instruments for
achieving goals, and that the learning occurs by observing models
of such behavior. Such models may be observed in the family,
among peers, elsewhere in the neighborhood, and through the mass
media (51). </p>

<p> This observation could, in part, explain why so few young
girls are identified as aggressive. While socially defined roles
for adults have changed considerably in the last several decades,
the socialization of children's behavior to a large extent has
not. Certain behaviors by boys are still classified by many
adults under the &quot;boys-will-be-boys&quot; axiom, while the
same behaviors by girls are oftenconsidered inappropriate. </p>

<p> Biological and genetic precursors to aggressiveness have also
been explored. Events associated with brain dysfunction that
appear to increase an individual's potential for aggression
include: brain injuries; in vitro exposure to opiates, cocaine,
alcohol, and tobacco; and early environmental exposure to lead
(e.g., air contaminated by leaded fuels, lead-based paint, water
from older plumbing systems) (51). </p>

<p> No genetic studies specific to aggressive behavior have been
conducted. Several Scandinavian countries have researched the
association between genetics and violence, obtaining mixed
results. No such studies have been attempted in the United States
(51). </p>

<p> By understanding the antecedents of aggressive behavior,
prevention programs targeted at reducing such behavior are much
more likely to succeed. It has been asserted that
multidimensional programs are more effective than those that
focus on one or two components of aggressiveness. Researcher
Karen Dodge submits: </p>

<p> Most intervention approaches are implemented without regard
for the type of aggressive behavior under scrutiny, and that
different types of aggression are likely to respond differently
to different types of intervention. Reactive aggressive children
who overly attribute hostility to others in provocative
situations may respond best to treatment aimed at training them
to understand better others' thoughts and feelings. Proactively
aggressive children may respond more favorably to consistent
punishment of aggressive behavior and reinforcement of
nonaggressive responses; this latter group many also have a
better prognosis than the former group. Three intervention
programs cited as being particularly suitable for differential
implementation with these two types of aggressive children
include social problem-solving skills training, anger-control
training, and parent training (17). </p>

<p> Several unanswered questions point to areas for future
research. Why do boys disproportionately exhibit aggressive
behavior? Are specific aggressive behaviors unique to certain
subpopulations? What are the differences between those
individuals who &quot;grow out of&quot; their aggressive behavior
and those who do not? </p>

<p> Answers to these questions and others will allow for more
detailed understanding of aggressive behavior and its connection
to alcohol and drug abuse, which could in turn provide for an
improved structure for the planning of appropriate prevention
programs. </p>

<p> Delinquency and Crime </p>

<p> Similar to aggression research, studies define and collect
data on delinquency and crime differently. Some studies use the
two terms interchangeably, while others define delinquent acts as
those less serious versus acts such as rape, armed robbery, and
manslaughter, which are clearly illegal. Self-reported data are
relied on by some studies, while others utilize only arrest
records. These differences must be considered when attempting to
generalize delinquent behavior to subsequent misuse of alcohol
and drugs. </p>

<p> As is true for aggressiveness, males are at greater risk for
developing delinquent and criminal behavior. Delinquent behavior
for most youths appears to peak between the ages of 15 to 17,
while alcohol and drug use are on the rise. However, only a small
percentage (2 to 6 percent) of these adolescents become young
adults who continue to engage in serious criminal activity
coupled with frequent drug use. Statistics reveal that many
arrests for property and violent crimes can be attributed to this
small group of individuals (29). </p>

<p> Several researchers have linked delinquent and criminal
behavior to alcohol and drug abuse and have concluded these
activities precede the use and abuse of certain substances
(28,29,13,56). </p>

<p> One such study conducted on adolescents examined the
relationship between later drug use and earlier individual
delinquent behavior and delinquent peer group bonding (DPGB).
Females were found less likely to engage in individual delinquent
behavior before but not after participating in a delinquent peer
group. Additionally, minority students doing well in school had
lower rates of delinquent problems than did nonminority youth who
were also doing well in school. Strong positive belief systems
(beliefs that committing illegal or rule-violating acts are
morally wrong) also decreased the potential for future use of
alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. Conversely, those
adolescents who had high DPGB levels had increased rates of
alcohol, marijuana, and polydrug use (20). </p>

<p> A separate study of male and female cocaine addicts analyzed
the psychosocial factors present among individuals who
substantially increased their cocaine use from adolescence to
young adulthood. Those who progressed to heavier use displayed a
significant lack of law abidance or social conformity (46). </p>

<p> Several points have come to light from studies on heroin
addicts. Studies conducted in the late 1970s found that while
delinquency preceded illicit drug use, use of alcohol and first
alcohol intoxication took place before delinquency. In fact, an
average of two years lapsed between first alcohol intoxication
and first criminal activity for both males and females who later
became heroin addicts (64). A further study on male heroin
addicts that grouped participants into low-crime versus
high-crime categories found that men who had been placed in the
high-crime group admitted significantly more contact with the
criminal justice system before becoming addicted than did those
in the low-crime group. Also, the high-crime group showed earlier
and more frequent use of substances, as well as use of a wider
variety of narcotic and nonnarcotic substances (47). </p>

<p> While a relatively small number of individuals who exhibit
delinquent behavior progress to serious alcohol and drug
problems, understanding the cause(s) of the delinquent behavior
may help to decrease this number further. Psychosocial elements
that have been associated with later delinquent behavior include:
</p>

<p> o low parent-child attachment </p>

<p> o family conflict </p>

<p> o family social deprivation </p>

<p> o school failure </p>

<p> o parental and sibling drug use and criminal behavior </p>

<p> o poor and inconsistent family management practices (e.g.,
harsh or lax discipline, lack of supervision) </p>

<p> o attitudes and beliefs </p>

<p> o lack of neighborhood attachment and community
disorganization </p>

<p> o family mobility. </p>

<p> Neurophysiological and cognitive dimensions have also been
examined for serious delinquents, adult criminals, and children
with conduct disorders. However, the findings were scanty and
inconclusive (29,37). </p>

<p> When discussing prevention programs for these children, there
is the hazard of labeling them predelinquent. This concern could
be applied equally to most risk factors linked to future alcohol
and drug problems. Labeling children as aggressive, high risk,
delinquent, or developmentally slow may be a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Some researchers have suggested that broad,
encompassing programs should be implemented in targeted areas
where groups exhibit a number of the risk factors previously
described. This type of approach would not single out individuals
but rather would assist communities, schools, and families (29). </p>

<p> Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Researchers and clinicians have increasingly addressed the
possibility that physical and sexual abuse, especially in
childhood, may be associated with an increased likelihood of
later substance abuse and addiction. Although there are many gaps
in this literature, and substantive and methodological issues
that remain to be addressed, findings from several studies that
have measured the prevalence of substance abuse strongly suggest
that additional research and the evaluation of targeted clinical
interventions are warranted. This section highlights selected
research findings on the relationship of physical and sexual
abuse to later substance abuse. </p>

<p> One review article on physical abuse found that children
subjected to physical abuse had higher levels of later substance
abuse compared to children not physically victimized. The review
also cited another study which found that 84 percent of the
females in treatment for alcohol or drug addiction reported a
history of childhood abuse (18). </p>

<p> Childhood sexual abuse appears to be rising. The National
Incidence Study reported in 1988 that approximately 156,000
children had been recognized by public agencies (such as child
protective service agencies, mental health agencies, and the
schools) as being sexually abused each year, for an annual rate
of about 0.3 percent (58). This is an increase in recognized
cases of child sexual abuse of more than 300 percent between 1980
and 1988, and due to the sensitive nature of the topic, is
probably a gross underestimation of the actual numbers of cases. </p>

<p> Prevalence statistics on childhood sexual assault specific to
women range from 6 to 62 percent, depending on the definitions,
methodology, and study populations used (54). One study that
relied on a random sampling method discovered that of the 391
women who agreed to participate in the study, almost 34 percent
reported being sexually assaulted by age 18, which provides a
lifetime prevalence rate of one out of every three women. Of the
respondents, over 24 percent reported an experience such as rape,
15 percent had been victims of molestation, and 10 percent
reported some type of noncontact sexual assault (e.g., voyeurism,
verbal threats of sexual assault, being forced to watch
pornography) (54). Other researchers, measuring childhood
molestation histories among women psychiatric outpatients, have
cited figures of 50 to 70 percent, versus 20 to 30 percent
reported by women in nonclinical populations (12). </p>

<p> While causality has not been established between childhood
sexual abuse and later substance abuse problems, an association
between the two variables has been shown. Several review articles
have summarized the findings from researchers who consistently
report that children exposed to sexual abuse present with a
greater number of symptoms and problems compared to children who
are not victimized (12,34,55). While substance abuse problems are
not measured in all the studies, where it is measured,
individuals who have been sexually abused show a much higher
incidence of later substance abuse than their study counterparts
(55). For example, 60 to 80 percent of individuals in substance
abuse treatment programs report having been sexual abused (12).
Other researchers have classified common symptoms by age group,
discovering that among adolescents who had been sexually abused
at some time in their lives, 53 percent reported abusing some
substance (34). </p>

<p> Studies on sexually abused women have demonstrated similarly
high rates. One study of women requesting appointments at a
crisis counseling unit of a community health center found that 44
percent of the women walk-in clients reported a history of sexual
abuse as children. The sexually abused women differed from the
nonabused women in many ways, but they differed most in their
substance abuse. The abused women were about 10 times more likely
than the nonabused women in this population to report a history
of drug abuse (21.1 percent vs. 2.3 percent) and more than twice
as likely to report a history of alcoholism (26.9 percent vs.
10.5 percent) (11). </p>

<p> A review of four separate studies on women seeking treatment
for alcoholism shows 34 to 85 percent of the women report a
history of sexual abuse (30); and among recovering chemically
dependent women, the topics discussed most often are sexual child
abuse, incest, and rape. Uncovering the memories of these early
childhood experiences is thought to be a contributing factor in
drug relapse for some women (31). Thus, early experiences of
abuse, especially sexual abuse, may require attention in
treatment programs, since they may have been important precursors
and contributors to the substance abuse and addiction, and may be
major obstacles to successful treatment and the prevention of
relapse. </p>

<p> Clearly, physical and sexual abuse are not uncommon
phenomena. While this section has focused on the association
between abusive experiences and subsequent substance abuse, there
are many other psychopathologies that also arise from sexual and
physical abuse. The research question need not be whether
physical and sexual abuse &quot;cause&quot; the later substance
abuse and addiction. Clearly, many factors interact, especially
in the home, school, and peer settings of children as they grow
up. However, the consistent finding of higher levels of physical
and sexual abuse among substance abusers warrants further
research to disentangle the many factors that are at work. Unlike
race, ethnicity, and poverty (which are not by themselves
strongly and independently associated with substance abuse and
addiction, but must be understood in the context of subcultures
and the availability and marketing of drugs in neighborhoods and
communities), physical and sexual abuse may more directly
contribute to later behavioral problems, including substance
abuse. </p>

<p> Mental Disorders </p>

<p> The sheer number of Americans with mental disorders
transforms personal tragedy into a widespread public health
problem. Nearly one in three American adults will experience a
mental disorder during his or her lifetime. Moreover,
approximately 1.7 to 2.4 million Americans currently suffer from
a persistent and severely disabling mental disorder, such as
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic
depression) (62). </p>

<p> There exists a wide array of behaviors classified as
symptomatic of mental disorders, ranging from premenstrual
syndrome, hostility toward others, and other maladaptive
personality traits, to full-blown psychosis (2). It can at times
be difficult to delineate where mental health ends and mental
illness begins. </p>

<p> While many alcohol and drug problems may not be attributable
primarily to mental disorders, they can certainly be exacerbated
by these disorders. One comprehensive study found a high
prevalence of comorbid (i.e., occurring at the same time) mental
disorders and alcohol or other drug disorders--including both
abuse and dependence syndromes as defined in the DSM-III-R. Using
data from NIMH's Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) survey of
20,291 adults (aged 18 and older) in communities and in various
institutional settings (prisons, mental hospitals, nursing homes,
and specialized treatment centers), they assessed the prevalence
of comorbid alcohol, other drug, and mental disorders.
Schizophrenia, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders were among
those studied. Specific drugs studied, in addition to alcohol,
included marijuana, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, amphetamines,
and hallucinogens (50). </p>

<p> Alcohol Disorder as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> An estimated 13.5 percent of all adults in the United States
will have a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence
(see figure 6-3). For these individuals, the rate of mental
disorder was almost double that of persons with no history of an
alcohol disorder, and the rate of another drug disorder was
almost six times greater. Specific comorbid mental disorders
found in people with alcohol abuse- dependence disorder include
anxiety disorders (19.4 percent), mood disorders (13.4 percent),
and schizophrenia (3.8 percent). </p>

<p> Drug Disorder (Other than Alcohol) as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> Some 6.1 percent of the total adult population will have had
a primary diagnosis of drug abuse or dependency at some time in
their lives. Over half of these individuals have also been
diagnosed with a comorbid mental disorder such as anxiety
disorder (28.3 percent), mood disorder (26.4 percent), or
schizophrenia (6.8 percent). Compared to those persons without a
drug disorder, these individuals are at more than four times the
risk of having some type of mental disorder. Additionally, these
individuals are also seven times more likely to be addicted to
alcohol. </p>

<p> Mental Disorder as the Primary Diagnosis </p>

<p> In contrast, at some time in their lives nearly one-quarter
of all adults in the United States will have had a primary
diagnosis of mental disorder. Compared with individuals having no
history of mental disorder, people with a mental disorder face
twice the odds of having alcohol abuse- dependence and over four
times the odds of drug abuse dependence. </p>

<p> Comorbid alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence disorders
occur frequently in people with the specific subtypes of mental
disorders included in the study: </p>

<p> o Of those who develop schizophrenia and related disorders
during their lifetimes (approximately 1.5 percent of the U.S.
population), nearly half will abuse or be dependent on alcohol or
other drugs, or both. </p>

<p> o Thirty-two percent of people with mood disorders (8.3
percent of the total adult population) will abuse or become
dependent on alcohol, other drugs, or both. </p>

<p> o The anxiety disorders, as a group, occur at sometime in the
lives of 14.6 percent of the population and are highly likely to
be associated with an alcohol or other drug abuse or dependence
disorder. For example, 35.8 percent of people with panic
disorder, and 32.8 percent of people with obsessive-compulsive
disorder will have some form of alcohol or other drug abuse or
dependence disorder. </p>

<p> People with both mental disorders and alcohol or other drug
disorders are likely to suffer more severe psychiatric symptoms,
disruptive behaviors, aggression, and criminal behaviors. The
importance of early detection for mental disorders is clear if
subsequent alcohol and drug abuse problems are to be avoided. In
other cases, an individual's drug and/or alcohol problems may
precede his or her mental disorder. In whatever order these
complications are distinguished, it is essential to remember that
millions of men and women suffer through not one, but two
illnesses (62). </p>

<p> Resiliency </p>

<p> The majority of funding and research has been devoted to
understanding and identifying those elements that appear to place
individuals at a greater risk for substance abuse. However, many
of these same factors can, to some degree, be protective. For
example, the vast majority of adolescents who have used alcohol,
cigarettes, and other drugs do not grow up to become substance
abusing adults. The process of aging and successfully passing
through various developmental stages is in itself protective. In
other cases, the lack of a particular factor is protective. This
is true for many of the psychosocial factors such as
aggressivity, delinquency, mental disorders, and physical and
sexual abuse. </p>

<p> But what about those individuals who live in stressful and
chaotic conditions--who are constantly exposed to many of these
risk factors--yet who do not develop substance abuse problems.
How do these individuals emerge relatively unscathed, while many
of their immediate family succumb to substance abuse? This
section addresses a complimentary set of protective attributes,
characteristics identified inindividuals who display resiliency
to the effects of various risk factors. </p>

<p> The term resiliency can be described as the ability to
recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. A 1991
conference sponsored by the Children of Alcoholics Foundation
released a report in which resiliency was conceptualized in the
following manner (15): </p>

<p> o Resiliency is a dynamic process, not a static condition. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is contextual; adaptive behavior in one context
may be maladaptive in another. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is the result of inherent personality
characteristics interacting with environmental factors. </p>

<p> o Resiliency is more complex in multiple-risk situations. </p>

<p> o Resiliency can be learned. </p>

<p> For the most part, social science research on resiliency in
children has not specifically addressed environmental substance
abuse, and where it has, the research has focused to a large
extent on alcoholism within the family. However, in general,
resiliency studies have examined high-risk children from a
variety of families and communities, of which many had substance
abuse problems. </p>

<p> One of the largest longitudinal studies spanned a period of
30 years and was completed by Emmy Werner on the Hawaiian island
of Kauai (80,81). An entire multiracial cohort of children was
followed from the prenatal period to young adulthood, revealing
invaluable information on resiliency in the presence of certain
risk factors. Of the 700 children originally included in the
study, 200 were identified as at- risk for later problems based
on perinatal stress, poverty, family instability, and parents
with mental health problems. Through the children's first decade
of life, approximately 25 percent had at least one parent with a
serious alcohol problem. Of these children, 41 percent later
developed serious learning and behavioral problems by age 18,
while the rest did not. All the children of alcoholic mothers
developed problems, with the exception of one. Conversely,
children of alcoholic fathers &quot;were represented in roughly
equal proportions among those who did and those who did not
develop serious coping problems by age 18&quot; (80). </p>

<p> More general findings from the study highlighted the
difference between the prevalence of serious physical, learning,
and behavior problems among girls and boys. Up to age 10, when
confronted with a variety of risk factors, boys were
significantly more likely to display a greater number of
childhood problems requiring some type of social service and/or
medical intervention. However, this ratio changed markedly by the
second decade (ages 10 to 18). While high- risk boys were still
three times more likely than girls to have records of serious
delinquency (77 vs. 26 percent), by age 18 more than twice as
many high-risk girls reported serious mental health problems.
Additionally, of those children in the first decade identified
with serious learning and/or behavioral problems, a greater
number of boys than girls had improved by age 18. </p>

<p> Interestingly, the researchers also showed that some of the
resilience factors identified differed between the sexes. For
example among young girls, experiences that tended to foster
greater maturity and independence, such as absence of a father,
responsibility for younger siblings, and maternal employment
outside the home, also appeared to bolster resiliency and
competence. On the other hand, resiliency among young boys was
correlated with the presence of the father, little family discord
or crowding, and the existence of adequate structure and
supervision. However, overall, a greater number of high-risk
girls than high-risk boys grew into resilient young adults. </p>

<p> Several other studies have also identified factors associated
with resiliency in children (6,19,23). One such factor is
described as adaptive distancing whereby the child accomplishes
two things: the child emotionally and psychologically detaches
from the chaos of the family and resumes more &quot;customary
pursuits&quot; in the outside world of school and friends, and
the child does not allow the caregiver's drug or alcohol problem
to be the central focus of his or her world. These behaviors have
been observed in children as young as 3 years old. </p>

<p> A sense of purpose and future have also been identified with
resiliency. Clinicians have observed very young children
attempting to make sense of their situation upon experiencing an
array of hardships such as chronic poverty or familial substance
abuse. Resilient children display such attributes as hopefulness,
hardiness, motivation, and a belief in a bright future even when
faced with challenges and adversity. </p>

<p> Researchers have also found that the ability to develop
competency skills was associated with resiliency. Competence
includes &quot;the qualities of responsiveness, flexibility,
empathy and caring, communication skills, a sense of humor, and
any other prosocial behavior&quot; (6). Researchers have
consistently documented the presence of these characteristics
among resilient individuals, and equally important, have noted
the lack of these characteristics among individuals with severe
behavioral, criminal, and mental health problems. </p>

<p> Another element that has been associated with resiliency is
the ability to use support systems effectively. Those children
who tapped into school activities, spoke with counselors,
actively sought an alternative parent figure or role model, and
confided in others were much more likely to be resilient than
those children not involved in these supportive networks. </p>

<p> Much of a person's resiliency depends on a variety of
elements including the individual's developmental stage, cultural
perceptions, and &quot;the acuteness or chronicity of the adverse
circumstances&quot; (19). Nonetheless, many men and women who
have gone on to lead productive and fulfilling lives, often did
so in spite of their circumstances. By understanding how this was
achieved, prevention programs can incorporate activities to
bolster the protective factors in the lives of all children. </p>

<p> Spirituality/Religiosity </p>

<p> The terms religiosity and spirituality are neither mutually
exclusive nor inclusive. Both terms encompass an enormous array
of fellowships and individual values, including institutionalized
religion, new age religion or quasi- religious groups,
traditional beliefs, and nonreligious persons. </p>

<p> Within the drug and alcohol abuse research field, studies
have focused almost exclusively on the relationship between
institutionalized Christian religions (with the exception of a
handful of studies on Judaism) and its effect on substance use
among adolescents and young adults. Virtually no data are
available on other methods of worship, or discussion of the
effect spiritualism/religiosity may have on the progression from
adolescent alcohol and drug use to problem use and addiction. </p>

<p> A succinct and thorough review of recent literature on
religion and substance use was completed by social psychologist
Peter Benson (7). With rare exceptions, religiousness, in varying
degrees, has been associated with decreased levels of substance
use. The substances studied included alcohol, cigarettes, and
numerous illicit drugs. This protective factor held true for men
and women across the four U.S. census regions, and to some extent
among blacks and Hispanics (although only a few studies analyzed
race and ethnicity). The most widely used measures of religiosity
were church attendance, church affiliation versus nonaffiliation,
and religious importance; yet it also appeared that such indirect
associations as parents' religiousness and belief in life after
death were correlated with decreased substance use. Multivariate
analysis was employed to examine the relative importance of
religiousness by controlling for other demographic and social
variables. In most instances the protective effect of
religiousness was relatively small, but it did appear to be more
predictive than several personal factors (e.g., self-esteem,
purpose in life, locus of control) and less predictive when
compared to social variables such as parental standards, peer
pressure, and social tolerance. Benson puts forth several
explanations for this apparent protective element, most of which
center around the idea that organized religion fosters and
maintains a certain set of morals and values. Depending on the
religion, deviating from these norms can be somewhat tolerated
or, at the other extreme, considered a profound sin. </p>

<p> For countless individuals, spirituality, while a more
nebulous concept than religion, is intricately tied to emotional,
psychological, and physical well-being. A practitioner of Zen
(Buddhist) meditation and various New Age spiritualities stated: </p>

<p> I think of health at every level: a healthy mind, a healthy
spirit, as well as a healthy body. So that a person would have to
have energy, alertness, enthusiasm, a love of life, a love of
people, a love of themselves (43). </p>

<p> Many traditional cultures think of illness and disease as
indicators of personal spiritual discord. For example, the
American Indian Navajos strive for a state of personal wholeness,
beauty, and well-being. The Blessingway rite, composed of sacred
songs and prayers, is often used to restore an individual's
harmony with those around him or her, the environment, and, in a
larger sense, the universe. </p>

<p> By ignoring different racial and ethnic religious and
spiritual beliefs, their importance is minimized and/or
trivialized (perhaps inadvertently) by more dominant religions.
From a drug and alcohol prevention point of view, it would seem
both cost-effective and relatively simple to encourage and
celebrate religious and spiritual differences among individuals
and communities; and acknowledge the protective benefits these
factors provide for many people. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> No single or generic set of variables explains the harmful
use of alcohol and drugs for every individual. While this chapter
reviewed a number of selected individual and protective factors,
this information should be viewed in a broader context. To gain a
complete understanding of the complexity of the substance abuse
issue, the information presented before and after this chapter
must be incorporated in any argument concerning factors that in
some way effect an individuals potential for substance use and
abuse. </p>

<p> By reviewing the individual risk factors under the three
broad headings of Demographics, Economics, and
Psychosocial/Behavioral, certain gaps in the literature appeared.
Within the demographics section, the vast majority of the
research to date has focused on identifying psychological as well
as social characteristics that place preadolescent and adolescent
children at greater risk for the initiation and continuation of
drug use. While the benefits of this type of research are
obvious, the majority of data point to the fact that alcohol,
tobacco, and illicit drug use are highest among those aged 18 to
25 and 26 to 34. However, few research studies have been devoted
to these age groups. Also, under the demographic section there
was a general paucity of data on risk factors that may be unique
to racial and ethnic minority populations and to some extent
women (although this continues to change). </p>

<p> Within the economics section, while there may be quotes in
the general media of tremendous financial earnings by drug
dealers, research substantiating these figures is scanty. There
is also little known about whether those individuals dealing
drugs are at an increased risk for becoming drug abusers. </p>

<p> Many of the psychosocial/behavioral factors reviewed in the
chapter have been extensively studied, and their associations to
alcohol and drug use documented. However, one of the sections
that has fairly recently been scientifically studied is that of
physical and/or sexual abuse. Those studies that have been
rigorously conducted are beginning to yield data that positively
links childhood abuse to later alcohol and drug problems. Future
research in this area is probably warranted. Also included in the
section were select studies on resiliency and/or protective
factors. While research has been conducted in this area for quite
some time, much of the literature is not specific to alcohol and
drug use situations, but rather, encompasses a wide array of
variables that place individuals at a greater risk for
behavioral, developmental, and learning problems.<br>
</p>

<p> BOX 6-1: Racial and Ethnic Differences in Adolescent Drug Use
Among High School Seniors Research on adolescent substance use
has documentedsubstantial racial and ethnic differences in use
among highschool seniors. On average, alcohol, cigarette, and
otherillicit drug use is highest among American Indian
youth,somewhat lower among white and Hispanic youth,
substantiallylower among black youth, and lowest among Asian
youth.Additional research explored the hypothesis that
thesedissimilarities could be partially attributed to
differencesin background (e.g., urban versus rural, family
structure,parental education) and lifestyle factors (e.g.,
grades,truancy, evenings out, religious commitment).The findings
indicated that controlling for backgroundfactors alone did not
account for most racial and ethnicdifferences in drug use, but it
did reduce American Indians'relatively high levels of use, which
suggests that their usemay in part be related to disadvantaged
socioeconomicstatus. When both background and lifestyle factors
wereincluded in the analysis, the racial and ethnic
differenceswere substantially reduced. Educational values
andbehaviors, religious commitment, and amount of time spent
inpeer-oriented activities were particularly importantexplanatory
variables.Racial and ethnic differences were also found in a
study ondrug-related attitudes and perceptions. Perceived risk
ofusing drugs, disapproval of drug use, and perceptions
ofdisapproval of drug use by friends were typically highestamong
black seniors, at intermediate levels among Hispanicseniors, and
lowest among white and American Indian seniors.Conversely,
perceived peer use of drugs and exposure topersons using various
drugs for &quot;kicks&quot; were generallylowest among black and
Asian seniors, at intermediate levelsamong Hispanic seniors, and
highest among white and AmericanIndian seniors.While these
findings are not applicable for thoseadolescents who drop out of
school, researchers areconfident that the results are valid for
the majority ofadolescents who remain enrolled through the senior
year ofhigh school.SOURCE: U.S. Department of Health and Human

<p> BOX 6-2: Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Discrepancies in
Mandatory Alcohol and Drug Use Reporting Practices for Pregnant
Women In one county of Florida, anonymous alcohol and drug
testswere conducted on urine samples obtained from all
pregnantwomen seeking prenatal care from both public health
clinicsas well as private obstetrical offices. White and
blackwomen were discovered to have insignificantly
differentprevalence rates for alcohol or illicit drug use
duringpregnancy. While black women used cocaine more
frequentlythan white women (7.5 percent versus 1.8 percent),
whitewomen had higher rates of marijuana usage (14.4
percentversus 6 percent). The relative similarities between
alcoholand drug use also held true for poor versus
middle-classwomen. However, the study also documented that
afterdelivery, black women were 10 times more likely to have
beenreported to the health authorities for substance use
duringpregnancy than were white women. Poor women also had
agreater chance of being reported than middle-class women.This
study reflects a discrepancy in reporting practicesamong staff at
some public clinics and private obstetricaloffices, which appears
to be influenced by an individual'ssocial status as well as
race.SOURCE: I.J. Chasnoff, H.J. Landress, and M.E. Barrett,

Analysis Bivariate analysis is the process of taking one
variablesuch as employment status and testing its correlation
andstatistical significance to reported alcohol or drug use.
Amajor drawback to this type of analysis is its
relativesimplicity; it does not control for the potential effects
ofother variables. For example, if a relationship betweenbeing
unemployed and heavy alcohol use was shown to bestatistically
significant, one could not be certain of thenature of the
relationship. Perhaps the individual wasunemployed due to his or
her heavy drinking. Alternatively,a person's unemployment could
have caused his or her heavydrinking. Furthermore, if more
sophisticated analyses usingadditional variables were completed,
the originalassociation between being unemployed and heavy
drinkingcould disappear altogether.Multivariate analysis, while
having its own limitations, isa much more comprehensive way in
which to study therelationships between several variables and
alcohol and drugconsumption. The multivariate analysis used by
the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse systematically incorporated
avariety of individual variables such as educational
level,employment status, race and ethnicity, and sex, in
additionto certain aggregate variables including region
(South,Northeast, North Central, West), metropolitan status,
andracial and ethnic composition of census blocks. Each one
ofthese variables was then separately analyzed for itspotential
predictive value for alcohol and drug use, whilethe other
contributing variables were also taken intoaccount. While
multivariate analyses fall short ofdemonstrating causality,
because additional variables areused to control for plausible
alternative explanations, moreconfidence can be placed in the
significant correlationsfound.SOURCE: Office of Technology

<p> BOX 6-4: A Population at Risk--Migrant and Seasonal
Farmworkers Migrant and seasonal farmworkers (M/SFWs) are
individuals&quot;whose principal employment is in agriculture on
a seasonalbasis [and who have] been so employed within the last
24months&quot; (Public Law 100-386). Migratory workers are
those&quot;who establish ... for the purposes of such employment
atemporary abode,&quot; while seasonal workers are those who
meetthe seasonal definition but are not migrant workers
(PublicLaw 100-386). While seasonal is not explicitly defined
inthe public law, the Department of Agriculture defines aseasonal
farmworker as one who performs 25 to 149 days offarm wage work in
one year, and does not migrate.Due to the transitory nature of
the job and the employees,obtaining a precise estimate on the
number of farmworkers isdifficult. State data suggest that
upwards of 4 millionfarmworkers are in the United States and
Puerto Rico, and ifratios from the late 1970s hold true,
approximately 30percent (or 1.2 million) of these are
migrants.The racial and ethnic background of the farmworkers
varieswith the so-called &quot;stream.&quot; The East Coast
stream isprobably the most diverse with American blacks,
Haitians,Jamaicans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,
anincreasing number of Central American Indians, and a
smallpercentage of whites. In the Midwest and West, the
greatmajority of migrant farmworkers are of Mexican
descent,although increasingly, Asian immigrants are making their
wayinto the stream. American Indians make up a
substantialproportion of the farmworker population in the West
andSouthwest.Farmworkers are most often hired through a
middle-person or&quot;crewleader&quot; who is usually in charge
of negotiating lengthof employment, transportation, wages,
housing, and meals. Itis not uncommon for migrant farmworkers to
move anywherefrom two to eleven times in a year. Besides the
physicallytaxing nature of the work, numerous environmental
stressors(some unique to this population) increase the likelihood
foralcohol and drug abuse. Some of these stressors
includephysically and socially isolated camp locations;
unsanitary,overcrowded, and unsafe camp conditions; towns which
oftendo not welcome the presence of farmworkers; long periods
ofseparation from family members; feelings of boredom,isolation,
and powerlessness; and language and culturaldifferences.The job's
high mobility requirements hamper the collectionof health data on
this population. Anecdotal informationfrom health care providers
located at Migrant/CommunityHealth Centers (M/CHCs) and local
health departments citealcohol and drug abuse problems as some of
the mostsignificant health issues faced by M/SFWs, followed
byanxiety and depression (McCaw 1991). However, fewquantitative
or qualitative studies have documentedsubstance abuse within this
population. One study of blackand Haitian farmworkers in upstate
New York found that themajority of the heavy drinking on the
migrant camps was doneby older, single, black males, and that the
drinkingpatterns of the study participants who traveled with
theirfamilies differed little from individuals in the
generalpopulation. To a large extent, this was attributed to
thesocial controls family members exerted on one another(Mattera
et al. 1983). This is an important point, as thegreater
mechanization of farmwork has reduced the need formanual labor,
and many of the farmworkers who previouslytraveled with their
families can no longer afford to do so.Anecdotal evidence
suggests that the composition of themigrant workforce has been
shifting toward one of singlemales, rather than families. With
this shift, a generaldecrease in social control among the migrant
camps is likelyto occur, and a greater number of alcohol and drug
problemsmay begin to appear.Providing substance abuse prevention
programs to M/SFWs is achallenge. Few M/CHCs have the financial
or personnelcapabilities to implement substance abuse
preventionprograms. Many farmworkers simply do not stay in
onelocation long enough. Language and cultural differences
arevast, not to mention the geographical distances
sometimesrequired to reach the camps, which often are located 20
to30 miles away from the nearest social service and/or eachother.
Two organizations (BOCES Geneseo Migrant Center inNew York, NY,
and Tri-County Community Health Center inNewton Grove, NC) have
successfully implemented similartypes of programs based on the
premise of providing weekendactivities as an alternative to
drinking and drug use. Full-day programs are normally held away
from the camps, andinclude educational, creative, athletic, and
culturalactivities. The activities are free and transportation
isoften provided. However, farmworkers can attend only if
theyhave not been drinking or using drugs.Clearly, greater
research is necessary to adequatelydocument the prevalence of
alcohol and drug use within themigrant streams, as well as the
changing composition of thestreams, and how this may affect
substance use. Little isknown about the differences in substance
use between thevarying racial and ethnic groups within the
streams, and howthe growing number of immigrants from war-torn
countrieswill affect the health problems seen within the
streams.SOURCES: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology

<p> Ethnographic techniques allow researchers to study how
environmental and cultural factors affect values, attitudes, and
behaviors of individuals and groups. Historically, ethnography
has roots in both anthropology and sociology (see box 7-1). </p>

<p> ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG USE </p>

<p> Since the 1960s the number of drug ethnographies has grown
steadily. Many of the nation's social issues were in one way or
another associated with drug use: poverty, urban unrest among
minorities, counter culture, failure of social programs, AIDS
transmission, and urban violence. Research conducted by
anthropologists and qualitative sociologists was an important
part of understanding new drug-related social problems and
trends. By the mid-1970s, &quot;street ethnography&quot; or
simply &quot;ethnography&quot; were the terms commonly used to
describe the drug research they were conducting in the United
States (60). </p>

<p> Alcohol </p>

<p> Nineteenth century and early twentieth century
anthropologists conducted comprehensive community studies in
nonindustrial societies in which they recorded ritual and social
uses of alcohol. This extensive but generally unfocused
documentation provided data for later cross- cultural analyses
relating alcohol use patterns to other cultural variables. </p>

<p> The contribution of ethnographic studies conducted outside
the United States was to provide data on the social conditioning
of alcohol's effects. The findings from one such study conducted
in </p>

<p> Bolivia during 1958, alerted the alcohol research community
to the existence of culturally accepted alcohol use patterns
quite different from those customarily encountered in the United
States. For example, &quot;virtually all of the Camba (of eastern
Bolivia) drink to the point of passing out, at least twice a
month.&quot; Although the beverage they drink is stronger in
alcoholic concentration than that customarily drunk by other
populations, there appeared to be no major health or social
problems associated with their drinking (35). </p>

<p> These data along with findings from research on four other
societies (the Aritama of Colombia, the Ifaluk of Micronesia, the
Takashima of Japan, and the town of Juxtlahuaca in Oaxaca,
Mexico), support the view that the experiential effect of alcohol
is socially conditioned (37). Each of these societies possessed
distinct messages regarding the use of alcohol, which were clear
and consistent. In contrast, individuals in modern societies are
influenced by overlapping, and sometimes contradictory, social
messages based on religious, ethnic, occupational, generational,
regional, and class differences. Drinking habits and behaviors
within the United States vary enormously. </p>

<p> Since the 1970s, ethnographic research on alcohol use in the
United States has concentrated on specifying and explaining the
variations in American drinking patterns. Some ethnographers have
focused on specific subcultures defined by their problematic
alcohol use (53). Other ethnographers have focused on alcohol
beliefs and behaviors in ethnically, religiously, and
professionally constituted subcultures-- usually exploring the
adaptation of culturally sanctioned drinking patterns, passed on
through family and community modeling, to changing social
contexts (5). </p>

<p> Heroin </p>

<p> The majority of ethnography studies conducted in the 1960s
focused on heroin use. Several of these studies challenged the
accepted perception &quot;that heroin provides an escape for the
user from his psychological problems and from the
responsibilities of social and personal relationships--in short,
an escape from life&quot; (47). Researchers documented drug use
as a way of life, rather than just as an escape from life. Two
such articles, based on three years of field work in Oakland,
California, detailed several distinct patterns or styles among
heroin users. Varying levels of prestige were associated with
these different styles, and heroin users at the top of the
hierarchy were observed to work hard to maintain their lifestyles
(54,55). </p>

<p> Another study in New York City, New York, in the late 1960s,
asked why heroin use periodically mushroomed, in epidemic
proportions, in lower class communities. The data revealed that,
regardless of ethnic background, in poor neighborhoods
&quot;there are pressures on adolescent boys to live up to the
ideals of toughness, strength, daring, and the willingness to
challenge the bleak fate of being poor.&quot; Simply put,
&quot;movement into heroin use was one route to becoming a
`somebody' in the eyes of the important people who comprised the
slum social network&quot; (20). Later articles elaborated on the
idea of so-called street status. Based on 4 years of research, a
hierarchy of illicit drugs was defined by perceived risk
components, such as physical harm, addiction potential, parental
discovery, police, and intragroup dangers. The use of drugs
perceived by the group to be risky, increased a user's personal
status within that group. The researcher concluded that reliance
on legal sanctions and scare tactics to reduce the use of certain
drugs will only make the use of these drugs appear more daring
and hence to some, more attractive (21,23). </p>

<p> Cocaine and Crack </p>

<p> Although ethnographers noted that cocaine use was on the rise
among some middle-class professionals and drug experimenters by
the mid 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that extensive studies
on cocaine users were begun. </p>

<p> While some of these early users, many of whom were white,
progressed from experimental use of cocaine to heavy use with
subsequent biological and behavioral problems, many others did
not (57,58). Several years later, though, middle- class users
with cocaine-related problems were becoming more common,
prompting many would-be experimenters to steer clear of the drug.
During this same time period, cocaine smuggling escalated,
resulting in increased availability, lower prices, and higher
quality. Within low-income, minority communities, cocaine
smoking, first as free-base and then as crack, grew so
precipitously that it was commonly called an epidemic. In New
York City, ethnographers provided complementary perspectives on
the rapidly changing crack culture. </p>

<p> In a series of ethno-historical articles, Ansley Hamid
documented the history of cocaine smoking as it evolved in lower
income minority neighborhoods in New York City. Among the
elements identified as central to the widespread diffusion of
crack smoking was the interest shown by heroin injectors with
collapsed veins in the concentrated high of smoked cocaine; the
entry of Rastafarian marijuana distributors into the cocaine
trade; the emergence of young, nonusing street distributors able
to sell unit doses in vials at relatively low prices; and the
rise in crack prices due to increased demand combined with
suppliers who had greater control over the market. Hamid believes
the rise and fall of cocaine smoking to have followed a
developmental cycle similar to that of heroin use between 1964
and 1972 and marijuana use in the 1960s and 1970s (31,32,33,34). </p>

<p> A 1992 study of crack use focused on the children of crack
users. It found that the extended family networks in the African
American community, a major source of stability and support, were
being overwhelmed by the drug crisis as the number of children
whose mothers were no longer able to care for them because of
increased drug use. Further, children exposed to drug-taking
behavior by adults may be more likely to display similar
behavior. In one family headed by a 60- year-old woman, an adult
son was a crack dealer and a daughter was a crack-abusing
prostitute (18). </p>

<p> Hallucinogens </p>

<p> Most ethnographic studies of hallucinogens and mind-altering
drugs (e.g., peyote, mescaline, mushrooms) have focused on tribal
societies. Anthropologists have uniformly found that the use of
hallucinogens was socially approved and integrated into the
religious and social life of the community. If one defines abuse
as use of a drug in such a way that it interferes with physical,
economic, or social functions, then little if any evidence points
to drug abuse among tribally organized peoples (1,27,15,42). </p>

<p> Other than scattered studies of hallucinogenic drug use among
hippies (12,14,45,46), few ethnographic studies have been
completed on use of hallucinogenic substances in American
society. However, the persistent use of lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) by some young people, and concerns that its
use may be increasing, have sparked new interest among
ethnographers (30,38). </p>

<p> Marijuana </p>

<p> As with hallucinogens, most of the ethnographic research on
marijuana use has been conducted outside the United States. Much
of it was initiated in the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing use
of marijuana among American youth led researchers to question the
social and medical consequences of marijuana use, especially
long-term use. Research was conducted in countries in which
marijuana use was long standing and widespread, such as Brazil,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Jamaica, Mexico, Rwanda, and South
Africa (11,16,17, 51). </p>

<p> In Jamaica, for example, anthropologists Vera Rubin and
Lambros Comitas directed a research team of 45 social scientists
and medical professionals to conduct original ethnographic
research at several field sites, in addition to medical,
psychological, and psychiatric testing in hospitals and clinics.
Their controversial findings were that none of the deleterious
social or medical consequences believed by many to be associated
with the drug in the United States could be found among Jamaican
users: </p>

<p> .?.?. There is no evidence of any causal relationship between
cannabis use and mental deterioration, insanity, violence or
poverty; or that widespread cannabis use in Jamaica produces an
apathetic, indolent class of people. In fact, the ganja complex
provides an adaptive mechanism by which many Jamaicans cope with
limited life chances in a harsh environment (52). </p>

<p> Other than a few studies of middle-class users (10,39) and
young African American dealers (24,25), substantial U.S.
ethnographic research on marijuana use in the United States has
been generally lacking, despite the fact that marijuana has been
the most commonly used illicit substance for decades. </p>

<p> Phencyclidine (PCP) </p>

<p> An ethnographic study in 1979 of PCP users is frequently
cited for its substantive findings and methodological
contribution as the first multisite ethnographic drug study.
Initiating the study when PCP use was believed to be spreading
among white working-class and middle-class young people, the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) contracted for a
four-city ethnographic study of PCP users not in treatment. After
3 months of working in Miami, Florida, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington,
ethnographers documented groups of users and the underlying
social processes. They found that it was relatively rare for a
young person to use PCP exclusively. Use occurred mainly within
socially distinctive groups of young people who displayed &quot;a
kind of restlessness, an orientation for action, and a sense that
life generally was boring, uninteresting, and lacked recreational
activities&quot; (22). </p>

<p> The young people studied were very knowledgeable about drug
effects and understood that the PCP drug experience varied
dramatically with dosage. Low doses of the drug were reported by
different user groups to be mildly euphoric and hallucinogenic
like LSD, or sedating like barbiturates. What concerned regular
PCP users was not the acute adverse effects reported in the media
(e.g., psychotic episodes, assaultive outburst, irreparable
harm), but rather &quot;burning out&quot;--a &quot;spacey&quot;
state accompanied by incoherent thoughts, forgetfulness, and
memory loss. As burnout became apparent, individual users and
groups of users consciously cut back their PCP use. Within this
group, violent episodes were found to be rare, mainly involving
efforts by law enforcement or hospital treatment staff to
restrain users, thereby seeming to set off panic reactions and
struggle. </p>

<p> The study suggested that a significant gap existed between
official agencies responsible for drug education and prevention
and street drug users. When PCP use increased dramatically in the
mid 1970s, there were no official responses because quantitative
national data sources, such as surveys of high school students
and hospital emergency reports, failed to include PCP as a
separate drug. When the official agencies recognized the
widespread use of PCP, their prevention efforts were viewed by
users as distorted and were discounted. Ethnographers attribute
the eventual decline in PCP use to &quot;the general consensus
among users themselves on the negative features of its long-term
effects rather than the kind of expert opinion that accompanies
legitimate efforts at prevention&quot; (22). </p>

<p> SOCIAL CONTEXT OF DRUG USE </p>

<p> Specificity in Drug Abuse Research </p>

<p> As more questions are asked about alcohol and other drug use,
it becomes clear that drug use is not one phenomenon, but many.
There is no generic pattern of drug use; rather, there is use of
specific drugs in specific situations. </p>

<p> Quantitative researchers frequently use ethnic categories to
increase study specificity. While studies on different ethnic
groups are useful, often the definitions of ethnicity vary and
the concept is employed uncritically. Moreover, most of the
quantitative researchers using the concept of ethnicity
implicitly assume what anthropologists call a &quot;static&quot;
concept of culture, viewing ethnicity as a trait one is born
with, an unchanging characteristic, like hair color or body type.
In contrast, most ethnographers view culture as &quot;a dynamic
process through which individuals and societies learn the sum
total of their society's behaviors and associated belief systems,
including those encompassing drug use practices and beliefs&quot;
(4). </p>

<p> Many recent ethnographic studies focus on socially meaningful
units in which members share social statuses, behaviors, and
attitudes. For example, a recent book on drug use among Hispanics
included ethnographic accounts of Cuban so-called streetside drug
use in Miami, Florida, drug use among male and female gang
members from the East Los Angeles, California, barrios, and drug
use and dealing among low-income Puerto Ricans in New York City,
New York, and Chicago, Illinois. (28). </p>

<p> Inclusiveness in Drug Abuse Research </p>

<p> One drawback of studying increasingly specific drug-using
communities is losing sight of the larger whole. Ethnographic
drug studies at times fail to link the customs of the specific
study communities to customs in other communities or to place the
customs in a larger framework. A way that both highlights and
critiques the contribution of ethnography in the field of drug
research is to focus on the social relationships around drug use,
specifically, on the pattern of use in relation to
self-identification with a social group. In the ethnographic
literature, four basic patterns appear: </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with others who share an
identification with a lifestyle or subculture in which drug use
is the central component. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with others who share an
identification with a lifestyle or subculture in which drug use
is customary and openly accepted, but not the central component. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs with friends and acquaintances,
but there is no self-identification with a drug-using lifestyle
or subculture. </p>

<p> o Individuals who use drugs by themselves while maintaining
self-identification with a group that stigmatizes drug use (see
table 7-1). </p>

<p> Drug Use Within a Drug Subculture </p>

<p> Numerous studies have documented that, for pragmatic and
social reasons, individuals whose lives have become oriented to a
drug often associate with others who use the drug in a similar
fashion. Over time a subculture develops with specialized
knowledge, norms, and expectations. Individuals think of
themselves as belonging to the subculture, and others define them
as such. &quot;Where subcultures exist, social-psychological
barriers separate participants from onlookers&quot; (13). It has
often been noted, for example, that for many heroin users, use of
the drug overrode background characteristics, such as race,
class, and national origin, to become the defining
characteristic. As one heroin user related: </p>

<p> I always refer to myself as a junkie, even when I'm not
hooked on anything. And when you're introduced to somebody for
the first time the first thing you find out is whether he's a
junkie or not. It's like belonging to some fantastic lodge, you
know, but the initiation ceremony is a lot rougher (57). </p>

<p> However, even within a drug-using subculture variations
exist, especially with regard to frequency and amount of use.
This difference was emphasized by a 38-year-old regular heroin
user from New York City: </p>

<p> .?.?. all heroin addicts are not heroin abusers, okay? And
you get the abuser, he's a dog, right? He's the one who sits in
the drug house and shoots all day long. That's an abuser. I'm a
visitor, you never catch me in the drug house. Not me, no (41). </p>

<p> A similar distinction was made by a female crack user, who,
although her life revolved around crack, was still attractive,
healthy, in a relationship, and the social center of a network of
users. In contrast, for her: </p>

<p> The crack addict is the person who's lost all sense of what's
going on. They are like zombies. They are out there standing in
the pouring rain. If it's cold and snowing, they'll be walking up
and down out there .?.?.?. They are .?.?. to the point of
desperation where they will take off [rob] people they know. They
will set you up. It comes to the point where they will set up
family, friends, anybody--the point where they don't care anymore
(61). </p>

<p> One ethnographer noted that these types of individuals were
attempting &quot;to become `visitors' in social networks of other
users, to establish a degree of contact and membership while
remaining somewhat detached from the network. Their attempts to
remain partially marginal to both street and straight society are
a central part of their strategies for controlling their use and
their own lives&quot; (41). </p>

<p> Drug Use as Part of a Lifestyle or Identity </p>

<p> Drug use often occurs within a lifestyle or subculture
inwhich drug use is common and accepted, but is not the defining
characteristic. The subculture may be professionally oriented.
For example, some of the earliest drug research was done among
jazz musicians (2,62). Anabolic steroid use was common among
professional and amateur athletes in certain sports (29). During
its peak, cocaine use was rampant among entertainers. </p>

<p> In one study, a waitress at a rock-and-roll bar called
cocaine use an &quot;occupational hazard.&quot; She and other
restaurant workers in the study described how groups of workers
would pool funds to purchase small amounts of cocaine for use
while working: &quot;For them. ?.?. hard work, constant activity,
and long, late hours seemed instrumental to their cocaine
use&quot; (59). </p>

<p> Recent research has documented that at times the nuclear or
extended family may act as the subcultural unit in which illicit
drug use is common and accepted. </p>

<p> We was with my mother over her girlfriend's house when Aunt
Jeannie came by and she had some coke. She cooked it up and told
Ma and Ruth to try it. After that things started goin' crazier. I
had to take care of my oldest sister's two sons, my son, and my
younger brother. I had to do everything. Most of the time we
didn't have nothin' to eat. We stayed hungry all the time. When I
washed clothes I'd find vials in her [mother's] pockets.. ?.?. I
`member comin' home one day and she'd been smokin' for awhile
then, but the house was full of people smokin' all over the
place. I went to go to my bedroom and close the door and it was
full too. I said to her, `what's happenin'? I just turned round
and left. I was tired, the house was dirty with vials on the
floor and the tables and I'd just had my son.. ?.?. I just wanted
to get away.. ?.?. At first I had smoked some crack to kill my
appetite, to keep me from bein' hungry. ?.?. I just felt like I
couldn't take it no more so I took my son to my sister and left </p>

<p> .?.?. I went on a binge and smoked for three months. Nobody
knew where I was, but I was out smoking crack and gettin' money
anyway I could get it (18). </p>

<p> Drug Use With Partners and Peers </p>

<p> Drug use can also occur when there is no subcultural support
or membership in a group that approves of drug use. In some
cases, an orientation toward, or acceptance of, drug use may have
been acquired earlier in life when the individual was part of a
drug-accepting subculture: former hippies, student drug users, or
participants in street life. Such individuals may continue their
drug use long after ending their other associations with the
subcultures. </p>

<p> Recently reported by ethnographers is the recreational use of
MDMA (Ecstasy) by some middle-class individuals. </p>

<p> Some professionals, particularly those whose ideas about
drugs were formulated during the 1960s, quietly view psychoactive
substances as one of many ways to relax, to relate, to &quot;kick
back.&quot; It is within this context, coupled with the need to
relax fast and relate quickly, that Ecstasy is used (50). </p>

<p> Drug Use in Social Isolation </p>

<p> Last, some individuals use illicit drugs primarily by
themselves. Often they identify themselves with a professional
subculture or social group that is opposed to drug use. One
well-documented pattern is that of physicians, nurses, and other
health workers who illicitly use psychoactive pharmaceutical
drugs, especially narcotics (63,64). </p>

<p> Other patterns of use in social isolation are known but
poorly documented in the ethnographic literature. Unsupervised
use of pharmaceutical drugs is fairly common and often the line
between licitly obtained and illicitly obtained drugs can be
blurred. Emergency room and family physicians, for example,
encounter suspected middle-class prescription drug abusers. One
middle-class housewife interviewed as part of a study of
emergency room drug episodes began her use of prescription pain
killers because of a back problem, and then continued chronic
(and essentially unsupervised) use of the drug for years by
obtaining prescriptions from multiple physicians (49). </p>

<p> Typology as a Whole </p>

<p> The ethnographic method of describing how and, to some
extent, why people use drugs differs from the purely quantitative
method that analyzes the association of drug use with the social
and demographic characteristics of the users. </p>

<p> To date, most of the ethnographic research has concentrated
on drug-focused subcultures or on crime-related subcultures.
There are few studies on other populations, and many of these are
now dated. For example, there have been no significant
ethnographic studies of student drug use in almost two decades.
The drug problem has been defined in the public mind and among
some funding sources as a problem of poor minority communities.
Some ethnographers acknowledge that, to some extent, their own
attitudes have contributed to the skewing of the drug research as
well. Ethnographic field work with drug-focused and criminal
subcultures is considered by some to be more adventurous and
professionally rewarding. Also, in its own way, it may be easier
than field work in the general population, since study
participants can be readily delineated from onlookers and
subjects can be relatively easily located on the street or
through their relationship with treatment and law enforcement
agencies. </p>

<p> One consequence of the absence of information concerning drug
use within the general population is that, like a self-
fulfilling prophecy, attention continues to be paid almost
exclusively to minority drug use. Drug use and drug users are
defined as the &quot;other,&quot; different from the rest of
society. Ethnographers have paid relatively little attention to
the relationship between culturally approved drug use (e.g.,
caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, psychoactive prescription drugs) and
illicit drug use. </p>

<p> Another consequence is that there are few data available on
which to base prevention programs for individuals who are
unlikely to become members of a drug or criminal subculture.
Virtually nothing is known about experimenters, casual users,
controlled users, or chronic users not associated with a drug
subculture. </p>

<p> POVERTY, RACISM, AND CYCLE OF ABUSE </p>

<p> The preceding section outlined a variety of drug using
contexts in the United States and documented the presence of drug
use and abuse among different social, racial, and ethnic classes.
Equally important, however, is the realization that the
consequences of drug abuse are especially devastating in
chronically poor, often minority, communities. While poverty as
an individual risk factor for substance abuse is described in
chapter 6, this section considers ethnographic observations on
the links between the poverty of the inner-city communities and
substance abuse. </p>

<p> The Social Context of Poverty </p>

<p> Drug ethnographers have noted that urban poverty means more
than lacking money. Often it means living in substandard housing
in communities that lack basic municipal services, and for young
people it usually means attending overcrowded, underfunded,
demoralized schools. Researchers regard illicit drug use,
especially the use of heroin, cocaine, and crack, as both a
result of oppressive social conditions and a cause of the
worsening of these conditions. </p>

<p> To cope with difficult social circumstances, ethnographers
have documented the effective utilization of extended family
networks and kin relationships. However, even with these
safeguards, it is not uncommon for children to encounter
alcoholism, other drug use, depression, physical abuse and
neglect, sexual abuse, and other traumatic experiences. </p>

<p> Lack of Opportunity </p>

<p> In ethnographic life histories of men and women who become
deeply involved with illicit drugs, the characteristic of
inner-city life most often mentioned is the lack of opportunity
for meaningful work. For example, an ethnographer studying heroin
addicts in the early 1970s noted: </p>

<p> Often in interviews with addicts I have thought that this
antiwork attitude was a sour-grapes defense because so few have
had meaningful work experiences and many do not consider
good-paying or creative jobs work, but I think that these
attitudes are more than psychological mechanisms. They are, I
believe, deeper in the fabric of our society and arise out of
poverty and the reality of poor, uneducated persons who can only
expect the most dull, stultifying, and meaningless work. Most, I
would expect, held these attitudes before their addiction and
when they became addicted simply added another good reason not to
pursue something that offered so little (56). </p>

<p> More recently, ethnographers studying the crack subculture,
have related changes in drug use patterns to structural changes
in the world economy. For many inner-city residents the difficult
economic situation of the 1950s and 1960s became impossible in
the 1970s and 1980s, as many of the secure semiskilled and
unskilled jobs shifted overseas. New York City, for example, lost
a half million manufacturing jobs and 100,000 jobs in wholesale
and retail trade between 1967 and 1987 (36). For individuals
without post secondary degrees, jobs that could support a family
became scarce. </p>

<p> Because of the structural shifts, basic expectations around
work have changed dramatically: </p>

<p> The option of a steady, legal job appears so distant for
inner-city high-school dropouts (and even graduates), that they
cease job searches after a few attempts or experiences in
low-wage jobs. Adult household members can rarely provide
concrete assistance in finding jobs or help in accessing networks
of employers (19). </p>

<p> Racism </p>

<p> Clearly a person need not be a member of a racial or ethnic
minority group to use drugs. Much of the early ethnographic
research was done on white heroin-using individuals (20,21,48) or
with mixed ethnic and racial backgrounds samples (47, 20,56).
Nonetheless, many ethnographers introduce race as an explanatory
element. It is not used in the genetic or biological sense but
rather that racial discrimination has shaped the social context
and opportunity structure for many people of color. Ethnographers
cite the indirect racism of some politicians who have been
unresponsive to the worsening social conditions of schools,
housing, and municipal services in many minority communities.
Also reported is the active racism encountered by many minority
people in daily life (9,8). </p>

<p> Ethnographers describe inner-city minority residents as
having a pervasive sense of not fitting into white mainstream
society. Within most poor inner-city communities, whites are
rarely encountered except as representatives of conventional
institutions such as police, teachers, and social workers. </p>

<p> Development of an Oppositional Culture </p>

<p> While oppressive social conditions, limited economic
opportunities, and racism are identified by ethnographers as
contributing to the high prevalence of drug abuse in the inner
city, in and of themselves they offer little insight into the
specific attitudes and behaviors of those involved in illicit
drug use. For this, ethnographers have often relied on the notion
of an oppositional culture, one of resistance or refusal. </p>

<p> Some ethnographers argue that amidst oppression and
exclusion, minorities, such as blacks, Hispanics, and American
Indians, develop &quot;a collective identity or sense of
peoplehood in opposition to the social identity of white
Americans.&quot; Developed in tandem with this oppositional
social identity is a cultural frame of reference that defines
&quot;certain forms of behavior and certain activities or events,
symbols, and meanings&quot; as not appropriate because they are
characteristic of white Americans while &quot;other forms of
behaviors and other events, symbols, and meanings [are defined]
as more appropriate because they are not a part of white
Americans way of life. To behave in the manner defined as falling
within a white cultural frame of reference is to `act white' and
is negatively sanctioned&quot; (26). </p>

<p> Many ethnographers studying inner-city communities argue that
illicit drug use is embedded in an oppositional culture, formed
in response to oppressive social conditions and lack of
opportunity. Ethnographer Terry Williams explains: </p>

<p> .?.?.?to some extent, it is possible to see the violence,
crime, and substance abuse that plague the inner city as
manifestations of resistance to a society perceived as white,
racist, and economically exclusive. This could be called a
culture of refusal. The young people in the crackhouses refuse to
be part of the system, refuse to obey their parents, reject
school or any adult-controlled education or training, spurn
prevailing social values and most authority. In the crackhouses,
teenagers and adults refuse to obey the law, refuse to stay
sober, refuse to engage in safe sexual practices--even though
this refusal leads them to behaviors that are manifestly harmful
both physiologically and psychologically (61). </p>

<p> Cycle of Abuse </p>

<p> Attraction of the Drug </p>

<p> Ethnographers have emphasized three factors to help explain
the use of illicit drugs, especially heroin and crack by poor,
inner-city, and minority populations. </p>

<p> First, ethnographers report that as the use of a drug begins
to spread through a community, its use is seen as a status symbol
within the street hierarchy. Many ethnographers attributed the
quick expansion of cocaine smoking that occurred in the middle
1980s to cocaine's reputation as a high-status drug, especially
when smoked or free based (23). </p>

<p> Second, initiation into drug use almost always occurred
through an established friendship or kin relationship. Virtually
every ethnographic study of drug use quotes users as saying: I
was at a party (or with a friend) and someone offered me some
heroin (cocaine, crack), so I tried it. </p>

<p> The third theme is simply that many people, when they try
heroin or crack cocaine, like it. For some individuals, at least
in the beginning, their drug experiences are more highly valued
than anything else in their lives (6,61). </p>

<p> Several ethnographers have suggested that once crack became
available at relatively low cost in the late 1980s, the sharp
rise in its use was due primarily to the intensity of the drug
experience, comparable in somatic effect to arterial injection.
The drug's effects attracted intravenous drug users with
collapsed veins or with concerns about HIV transmission, as well
as many nonintravenous drug users (23,40,43). </p>

<p> Slide Into Abuse </p>

<p> In explaining the slide of inner-city residents into drug
abuse, addiction, and dependency, ethnographers have highlighted
two complementary themes. One theme explains the function drug
dependency serves in simplifying and giving meaning to a drug
user's life. Stated succinctly: &quot;The euphoria of heroin and
the excitement of hustling serve many addicts in the same way
that jobs, sex, and consumption serve nonaddicts&quot; (56). </p>

<p> A similar conclusion was drawn by another ethnographer
studying crack use patterns: </p>

<p> Substance abuse in general, and crack in particular, offer
the equivalent of a millenarian metamorphosis. Instantaneously
users are transformed from being unemployed, depressed high
school drop-outs, despised by the world--and secretly convinced
that their failure is due to their own inherent stupidity,
&quot;racial laziness&quot; and disorganization-- into being a
mass of heart palpitating pleasure, followed only minutes later
by a jaw-gnashing crash and wide awake alertness that provides
their life with concrete purpose: get more crack--fast! (8). </p>

<p> The complementary perspective emphasizes the lack of a viable
lifestyle alternative to drug use. One researcher contends that
due to the unequal distribution of viable nonaddict social roles
in society, some groups will have more difficulty in recovery
than others: </p>

<p> For example, a white, middle-class, high-school-educated,
male addict will have more personal and social resources to draw
from when he decides to give up drugs than will a Chicano addict
living in a barrio. In fact, a relatively uneducated Chicano
addict may opt to retain the junkie- dealer role and identity
because it provides him with greater status and financial rewards
than any other social role available to him (7). </p>

<p> End of the Cycle </p>

<p> Despite little improvement in the social conditions of many
inner cities, recent journalistic accounts, ethnographic studies,
and reports from surveillance systems indicate that the
prevalence of crack use may be decreasing. Ethnographers report
that for many individuals, the initial appeal of crack use has
faded. &quot;Youths under 16 have made a new pastime of
ridiculing or beating up crackheads who they say disgrace
neighborhoods or are nuisances or thieves. Five years ago,
youngsters their age had initiated crack use after first becoming
distributors, as youngsters had previously been drawn into heroin
use&quot; (34). </p>

<p> Ethnographers present several possible explanations for this
downturn. Epidemiologically, a parallel could be drawn to the
decrease seen in bacteria-based epidemics, where all individuals
most likely to be infected have been. Economically, it could be
argued that all possible wealth to be extracted from the inner
city has been. There are simply fewer resources for drug
traffickers, smugglers, and importers. </p>

<p> A complementary explanation is based on concepts put forward
25 years ago (3). It was argued that the social consequences
resulting from a drug's use could be related to the historical
stage of the drug's introduction in society. Most importantly,
over time, a subculture of drug users develops &quot;.?.?.
material on how to obtain and ingest the drug, definitions of the
typical effects, the typical course of the experience, and the
permanence of the effects.. ?.?.&quot; In the case of marijuana
and LSD, this type of shared information may have accounted for
the sharp decrease in reported psychotic reactions even though
the actual number of users was increasing. </p>

<p> This subculture can also define certain drugs or styles of
use as dangerous. For example, ethnographers argue that the
downturn in cocaine use in the late 1980s among middle- and
working-class individuals was due to the belief that
&quot;cocaine can mess you up,&quot; and that this subculture of
users understood this warning as more than just propaganda of
prevention proponents (59). </p>

<p> This same process may be occurring in inner-city communities
among the subculture of crack users. Researchers note that the
crack epidemic has followed a predictable developmental cycle,
previously seen with heroin use, &quot;characterized by periods
of onset, incubation, widespread diffusion, peak, and decline.
The final stage is stabilization at reduced levels of use&quot;
(34). </p>

<p> In exploring the devastation caused by crack epidemics on
inner-city communities, ethnographers have called attentionto the
process through which harm-reducing information develops within a
subculture of users. For example, among middle-class,
cocaine-using individuals, many users gained information from
conventional sources (such as books, magazines, and even
scholarly journals) on the progression of cocaine dependence,
long-term negative consequences, danger signals, and methods to
control or end use. This information then spread through the
wider user community. In contrast, researchers note that the
inner-city subculture of crack users paid little attention to
conventional information sources and were ideologically
predisposed to discount what information did reach them. While
there was no deficit of warnings about the dangers of crack use
in the popular media, ethnographers observed that little effort
was made to translate prevention information into more
appropriate media messages for inner-city communities. </p>

<p> FUTURE RESEARCH </p>

<p> Over the past 30 years, ethnographers have contributed to the
understanding of substance abuse research through their work
among different countries and among different subpopulations in
the United States. However, some additional contributions could
be made in the following areas. </p>

<p> Filling in the Gaps </p>

<p> The earlier sections on the social contexts of drug use
emphasized that drug use in the United States is much more than
heroin and cocaine in the inner cities and LSD in the suburbs.
Research is needed, for example, on middle-class prescription
abusers, substance abusers in rural areas, and hidden populations
(e.g., homeless, runaways, dropouts); since many of these
individuals are either excluded from, or under sampled in, the
national drug abuse surveys. To further complete the matrix of
substance use and abuse in the United States, future research
could address not only those individuals whose use is
unmanageable, but individuals and communities who do not use, or
whose use is moderate and controlled. </p>

<p> Expanding Research Hypotheses </p>

<p> The documentation that cultural and societal norms, to a
large degree, shape individuals' and groups' behaviors toward
drugs use, could be used to formulate new substance abuse
research hypotheses, or expand on existing hypotheses. For
example, understanding the etiology of drug use through studies
of children will help explain initiation of drug use and provide
guidance for prevention efforts. Basic studies that document how
children come to perceive drugs are lacking. &quot;...when it
happens, how it happens. How they conceptualize, for example,
what is a drug and what is a poison, and how that changes when
they begin experimenting with drugs&quot; (44). </p>

<p> Planning Prevention Programs </p>

<p> The insight gained by ethnographic research on a community's
or subculture's view on substance use could be incorporated to a
greater degree in the needs assessment, planning, implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation components of substance abuse
prevention research. The information gained from ethnographic
research could help assure that the prevention information is
culturally appropriate not just in a generic ethnic sense, but in
terms of the specific cognitive framework and concerns of the
target audience. Additionally, the qualitative tools used in
ethnography can assist quantitative researchers in the
interpretation of substance abuse data in varying contexts. </p>

<p> Identifying Emergent Trends </p>

<p> Ethnographic research is also useful in its ability to
relatively quickly document changes in existing drug use patterns
or identify the use of new drugs by a particular subculture. This
timely information could assist in the planning of appropriate
prevention strategies. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> Studies on drug-using subcultures have provided a wealth of
knowledge on why, how, and who uses and abuses drugs.
Experience-based methods of data collection, such as ethnography,
provide the field of substance abuse research with unique
information on drug abuse among individuals, groups, and
communities. Some of the contributions discussed in this chapter
have been theoretical, substantive, and programmatic. </p>

<p> Ethnographic studies have documented drug use patterns
worldwide and in so doing have assisted the understanding of
societal influences on drug use. These insights have, for
example, been utilized in the planning, implementation, and to
some extent, evaluation of drug prevention programs in a variety
of different social contexts. </p>

<p> Researchers have also utilized ethnographies to follow
constantly changing drug use patterns. Moreover, ethnographers
provide valuable data on new drug use such as who is using it,
how the drug is being used, and where the probable epicenters of
the drug use are. </p>

<p> While not without methodological limitations, ethnography and
other experience-based research provide new insights into
substance abuse, as well as complimenting more quantitative
methods of data collection. </p>

<p> BOX 7-1: What is Ethnography? Ethnographic research is
descriptive, subjective, analytical, and comparative. The focus
on context is central to the ethnographic approach, explaining
how a particular behavior, institution, or process is acted on by
larger forces outside of the control of the participants. It
describes how events happen and the social life of the study
individuals. While qualitative interviewing and other more formal
methodologies are usually part of an ethnographic study,
participant observation (i.e., informally interacting with
participants and observing events as they naturally occur) is a
hallmark of ethnographic research. Studies are subjective in that
they focus on the understandings, interpretations, and world
views of the participants. Ethnographic accounts describe not
only what occurs, but also the multiple levels of distinctions by
which individuals and groups make sense of and purposively act in
the world. Ethnographic studies are also analytical. The
observations, interviews, and documents are raw data, as forms
and responses are raw data for survey statisticians. The
ethnographer's analytic responsibility is to condense and order
these data. The analytic work can include the identification of
nonobvious patterns, associations, and themes, as well as the
construction of typologies, process models, or explanatory
frameworks. Finally, ethnographic research is comparative in two
senses of the term. First, it often explores how attitudes and
behaviors are shaped by social forces in two or more contexts.
The contexts are at times spatial (two different cultures or
subcultures), at other times temporal (the same culture or
subculture at different times). Ethnographic studies are also
conducted within a research tradition, so that each new project
draws on the methods and findings of previous research. Over
time, a corpus of work develops regarding a particular cultural
community (e.g., Samoans, inner-city drug users) or a particular
topic (e.g.,witchcraft, ethnic boundaries). As new work appears
it is scrutinized for fit with the existing corpus. Lack of fit
may be attributed to differing circumstances, methodologies,
theoretical concerns, or possibly to inferior research or
analysis._ <br>

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b><font size="5">CHAPTER 8 </font></b> </p>

<p> <b><font size="5">COMMUNITY ACTIVITY SETTINGS <br>
</font></b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> This chapter reviews substance use and abuse-related research
on factors and interventions in homes, schools, workplaces,
recreational and other developmental settings, and community-wide
settings. These community activity settings are the major
physical and social arenas in communities where individuals
interact and learn their values, attitudes, and behaviors, some
of which can increase or reduce the likelihood that individuals
will use and abuse substances. The addition of treatment settings
of all types and correctional settings would provide a fairly
comprehensive and systematic overview of all the major settings
in communities. Those settings are not discussed at length in
this report, however, because of its focus primarily on
prevention, even though comprehensive prevention strategies will
almost always want to include treatment and correctional
components as well. </p>

<p> By focusing on any one of these settings, researchers
interested in substance use and abuse can study the interplay of
multiple factors in a context, and practitioners can implement
programs designed for specific settings. By examining all of
these settings together, policymakers and practitioners
interested in substance abuse and the healthy development of
individuals and communities can identify and, within available
resources, implement concrete, systematic, and comprehensive
preventive interventions for communities as a whole. The
development and strengthening of community-wide norms against the
use of substances may well be one of the more important ways to
protect individuals against the use of substances. The section on
communities discusses some of the issues and tools for
community-wide prevention planning and coordination. </p>

<p> HOMES AND FAMILIES </p>

<p> Although American society expects families in their homes to
take the lead in dealing with substance abuse and other problem
behaviors (69), families in this country generally receive only
limited outside support in protecting themselves against
substance abuse. This situation may result in part from the
belief that most nuclear families can raise their children
largely independently and therefore do not need outside support,
and in part from the belief that teens and young adults are more
influenced by their peers. The first belief, however, is not
supported by long- standing practices in most societies, where
extended families and life-long neighbors have traditionally
helped raise children (although in the United States many parents
do not have access to these additional child-rearing resources
because of urbanization, high technology, and family mobility).
And the second belief is being questioned by growing evidence
that certain parenting practices and family intervention programs
can significantly reduce the risk of substance abuse among
adolescents and young adults. </p>

<p> An extensive and growing body of research strongly suggests
that many families do need, and can benefit from, support from
outside the family, and can often protect their children from
substance abuse, even into adolescence and adulthood. While some
of the findings reported here may appear to be commonsensical,
they are presented because they have been addressed by
researchers as part of a growing body of increasingly rigorous
research. Some of the studies focus on risk and protective
factors that are known or thought to be associated with substance
use and abuse, while others focus directly on substance use and
abuse. To reduce redundancy, factors and programs discussed
elsewhere in this report are for the most part not considered
here. </p>

<p> Protective Factors </p>

<p> Families can protect against substance use and abuse by
providing close family relationships, sufficient monitoring,
clear messages about substance use and abuse, and attractive
alternatives to substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Close Family Relationships </p>

<p> Family relationships can help protect against substance use
and abuse when they are characterized by closeness and warmth,
effective and positive discipline, and successful problem solving
and communications. For example, young people who report feeling
close to their families are less likely to abuse substances than
those who report not feeling close to their families. Parents in
such families are more likely to comfort their children when they
are afraid, have two-way communications, and give children some
say in what happens to them (83,86,152). Because such parents
spend more time with their children, there can be more conflict,
but the time spent together can also lead to greater mutual
understanding and acceptance (23,59). </p>

<p> Parents can better channel their children away from substance
use and abuse if they have routinely used effective,
age-appropriate discipline methods, including clear expectations
and rules about homework, television, curfews, and drugs and
alcohol. Such methods are particularly effective when they are
enforced by praise and encouragement, instead of by threatening,
nagging, and blaming (42,47). In contrast, ineffective or
provocative family management practices, including overly harsh
or reluctant discipline practices and inconsistent followthrough,
are associated with early sampling of substances and later abuse
(8,115). Unruly behaviors in childhood can lead children to poor
achievement in school, social rejection by more conventional
peers, and greater association with other children with behavior
problems (46). </p>

<p> Skillful handling of problems by families helps children
learn how to distance themselves from problems and address them
with specific problem-solving strategies (77). Such skills can
help children later avoid the use and abuse of substances. By
contrast, families where children eventually abuse substances do
not make decisions and solve problems as well as other families
(97). Positive caregiving and discipline can prevent negative
outcomes even for highly stressed, minority, low socioeconomic
status (SES), urban families (177). When the birth parents are
not available, effective parenting by a surrogate, relative, or
neighbor can also be protective (173). </p>

<p> Sufficient Monitoring </p>

<p> When parents or parent surrogates know how their children are
spending their time, the risk of substance abuse is low (47).
Such monitoring may prevent abuse by reducing access to
substances, preventing use of substances, or allowing parents to
identify substance use earlier and to apply sanctions. Monitoring
may also entail greater involvement by parents in their
children's lives, which may help render substance use and abuse
less appealing by enhancing feelings of trust, warmth, and
closeness in the family. Such monitoring prevents substance
sampling across ages, ethnicities, and settings. </p>

<p> Single parents and working parents are often less able to
monitor their children thoroughly, because they can be in only
one place at a time. However, grandmothers, aunts, after-school
personnel, and other caring and supportive adults can also
monitor children and help reduce deviant behaviors (59,88). Early
autonomy and unsupervised leisure time apparently increase the
risk of substance use and abuse by children. </p>

<p> Clear Messages About Effects of Substances, Including
Sanctions </p>

<p> Children are more likely to avoid the use of substances if
they know that use will bring negative outcomes, such as adverse
physical and psychological effects, disapproval, and penalties
imposed by parents. Many children develop expectations about the
effects of substances as early as the preschool years (100),
influenced primarily by their parents. Frequent parental use even
of aspirin, cold pills, prescribed psychotropic medications (85),
and cough medicine can give children positive expectations about
the effects of substances (61). </p>

<p> When parents apply reliable penalties, such as revoking
privileges, and coach their children about the adverse effects of
substances, use is likely to discontinue (6). By contrast, if the
possible adverse effects (e.g., illness and depression) are not
emphasized and few negative sanctions are applied when
adolescents first use marijuana, while the immediate experiences
are to feel pleasantly stoned and potent (87), then continued use
and adult drug problems are more likely (37). Parental
disapproval of children's alcohol use has been found to be
protective across ethnic groups (33). Increased appreciation of
risks and social disapproval of substance use is credited with
the recent downturn in cocaine and marijuana use nationally (5). </p>

<p> Attractive Alternatives to Substance Use and Abuse </p>

<p> Participation in religious and other conventional and
challenging activities can protect against substance use and
abuse (26,81,111,173). Especially important are activities about
which youth are passionate. </p>

<p> Parents are more likely to guide their children away from
substance use and abuse if parents have instilled hope in their
children to succeed as adults (172). By contrast, some children
do not look forward to and plan for adulthood, but learn only
short-term thinking (see box 8-1) and have been encouraged by
their parents to believe they cannot succeed. </p>

<p> Parents of inner-city African American children face special
difficulties in holding out hope for their children's success
through traditional opportunities. Unemployment among African
American men is almost 50 percent (24) and the marriage rate
among African American women is low and still declining (10),
with substance use and abuse among African Americans increasing
as they reach 26 to 34 years of age, instead of decreasing as
with other racial and ethnic groups (164). </p>

<p> Risk Factors </p>

<p> Families also face risk factors, such as parental neglect and
rejection, behavioral problems and crime, physical and sexual
abuse, substance abuse in the family, failure in school,
emotional problems, negative life events, early use of
substances, substance abuse in the neighborhood, and poverty,
unemployment, and homelessness. Because some of these factors are
discussed elsewhere in this report, this section will focus only
on parental neglect and rejection, physical and sexual abuse,
substance abuse in the family, negative life events, and drug
trafficking in the neighborhood. </p>

<p> Parental Neglect and Rejection </p>

<p> Children who are neglected anytime, but especially from
earliest childhood, are at greater risk of substance abuse
(17,142). When children have been continually rejected, they
become immune to parental guidance. Such children fail to form
close relationships, get along with others, solve problems, and
regulate impulses. </p>

<p> Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Physical or sexual abuse in childhood leads to greater
vulnerability to substance abuse in adolescence and adulthood
(38). Rape victims, particularly those with Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, are 20 times more likely to have
subsequent substance abuse problems (165). Substance abuse
rehabilitation programs report that as many as 60 to 70 percent
of the female patients and 25 percent of the male patients have
been sexually victimized, while 43 percent have been beaten
(45,99,92). Victims of sexual or physical abuse often report
wishing to avoid unpleasant memories, including flashbacks to the
abuse (126). The use of substances may help some victims forget
for awhile (see box 8-2). </p>

<p> Substance Abuse in the Family </p>

<p> The biological children of alcoholics have a higher than
average chance of abusing alcohol, even if they are reared away
from their alcoholic parents (40,63). Thus, a part of the
vulnerability to alcohol abuse, at least for some, may be
inherited. Children of alcoholics, for example, may experience
more positive effects or fewer negative effects from the use of
alcohol. Either of these responses could result from individual
differences in experienced pharmacological effects of drugs (135)
or differences in temperament that can be modified by the use of
alcohol and other drugs (154). </p>

<p> In addition to friends and acquaintances, relatives are a
common source of alcohol and other drugs for teens. Family
members and other relatives can be very persuasive when they
offer such substances to teens. One study, that included both
abstainers and heavy users, found that young people refused
available substances, mainly alcohol, 46 percent of the time when
friends offered them, but only 18 percent of the time when
relatives outside the family offered them. When their own parents
offered such substances, the young people never refused (9).
Family members who use substances can also inadvertently make
them available to teens by leaving family cabinets containing
alcohol or pills unlocked (35). </p>

<p> Family members can learn how to use alcohol and other drugs
by watching and listening to abusing family members; they can
also adopt the abusing members' expectations about the effects of
these substances. For example, children of alcoholics are more
likely to think that the purpose of drinking is to get drunk
(107). They also have greater expectations for the use of alcohol
(143), and sometimes believe they can do things better after a
few drinks. </p>

<p> Families with a substance abusing parent experience
significant disruptions in many aspects of their lives, including
child rearing (160). Substance abusing parents and spouses often
have difficulties guiding their children, especially away from
substances, because of inconsistent nurturing, monitoring, and
disciplinary practices (36,47). Their abuse of substances can
also rob children of stability in life and of competent adult
role models. Even a nondrinking spouse can become so involved
with the drinking spouse and so depressed and isolated from
social support that children feel neglected (13). Marital quality
can be affected (160), and the level of conflict and verbal and
physical aggression can be high (151). In addition, adolescent
and adult children of substance abusers are less influenced by
their parents and have lower parental attachment, less
involvement with other people, more difficulty getting along with
other people (84), lower self- esteem, lower academic
achievement, higher depression (128), and a greater number of
other psychiatric symptoms (143). </p>

<p> Major Negative Life Events </p>

<p> Substance use and abuse often increase as children experience
more negative events (106,174) (see table 8-1). Adult alcoholics
report a significantly higher number of severe life events just
before their alcohol dependency begins (65), with seven out of
eight of them reporting disruptions in important personal
relationships, such as with friends, lovers, or spouses. Among
the elderly, late- onset alcoholism is reportedly preceded by new
feelings of loneliness and depression, perhaps also due to recent
losses of important relationships (120,134). </p>

<p> Such negative life events may heighten vulnerability to
substance abuse by increasing depression (174). For instance, one
study found that children who had lost a parent to death had a
7.5 times greater risk of developing a depression than other
children (60). Negative life events may also occasion perceptions
of helplessness and decreased personal control; these too can be
offset, at least for awhile, by some drugs (91). </p>

<p> Families are likely to have the greatest difficulty
preventing substance abuse if friends abuse substances (86,109)
or if substance use is rampant in the neighborhood
(39,44,51,124). Such conditions encourage substance use and
reduce the barriers against use by making drugs continuously
available and socially acceptable (even appealing) and by
providing temporary escape from the frequent hassles and
tragedies of life among highly transient and troubled (rather
than stable and helpful) neighbors (146). </p>

<p> Programs To Enhance Protective Factors </p>

<p> This section discusses some of the numerous programs that
have been developed for families with infants, school-aged
children, and young adults. Few of these programs specifically
target substance abuse and addiction, but many have been found to
enhance family-based protective factors and/or reduce risk
factors that can be associated with drug abuse. Unlike some
school-based programs, methodologically rigorous studies
correlating the efficacy of these programs to the level of
substance abuse and addiction have yet to be done. </p>

<p> Families With Infants </p>

<p> Parent education, prenatal and infant care, and social
support programs help strengthen involved and responsive
parenting (4), which in turn can significantly reduce substance
abuse risk factors such as child abuse and neglect and childhood
accidents. </p>

<p> Parents who had participated in such programs attained more
education, had fewer other children, and were less likely to be
on welfare by the time their children were 10 years old, than
parents who had not participated in such programs. Participating
parents reported less stress and more confidence in their
parenting (175). Most importantly, children were dramatically
less likely to experience attendance, behavior, or academic
problems in school (112,138,139). </p>

<p> These programs can take many forms: </p>

<p> o a neighborhood house where parents and their infants can
come during the day for companionship, child care advice, social
services, and health care from a stable professional staff (139);
</p>

<p> o twice-a-week home visits by the same nurse, from pregnancy
until the child is 2 years old (112); </p>

<p> o home visits, with child development advice, help in
acquiring other services, and time-limited family counseling to
lower conflict and increase support from the extended family; </p>

<p> o a public school dedicated to pregnant teens and new mothers
and that provides health and child care education, social
services, and intensive high school education (138); and </p>

<p> o parent meetings in the hospital where the baby was born
(175). </p>

<p> Families With School-Age Children </p>

<p> Parent training and support programs can help parents of
school-aged children motivate their children to more willingly
pay attention to and accept parental guidance and to develop
skills for success outside the family. A parent training program
called WINNING, provided through a Texas school system, increased
positive and corrective feedback from parents to children,
increased parent-child interactions, and decreased the attention
parents gave to inappropriate child behavior. Concomitantly, the
portion of their children's behavior that was inappropriate
decreased (43). </p>

<p> Another parent training and support program, &quot;How to
Help Your Child Succeed in School,&quot; was offered through
Seattle, Washington schools to increase protective factors and
reduce risk factors for substance use and abuse. After the
program, parents spent more time reading with their children and
provided more consistent positive and negative consequences for
behavior (70,71, 72,73,74). </p>

<p> Involving parents more in schools can further
supportparenting and prevent it from being undermined by peers
and by school environments. In the School Development Program in
New Haven, Connecticut, for example, parents serve as members of
the School Advisory Council and as employees or volunteers in
classrooms. Significant improvements have been seen in student
attendance, language skills, math scores, and social competence,
and virtually all classroom behavior problems have been
eliminated (34,41). </p>

<p> A community grassroots effort to provide these and other
resources for parents began 17 years ago in the Ravendale section
of Detroit, Michigan. The &quot;Joy of Jesus&quot; programs now
support families living in more than 30 contiguous blocks. Every
day after school about 250 youth of all ages participate in
scheduled activities such as tutoring, music, dance, gym,
writing, teen sex education, cultural field trips, university
tours, and an entrepreneur's club (for 30 teens who are starting
their own businesses). This program provides several substance
abuse protective factors and prevents the risk factor of school
failure, by monitoring report cards and enrolling students in an
individualized after-school motivational learning program, if
necessary. </p>

<p> In Los Angeles, California, an after-school tutoring and
activities program has been developed in a for profit apartment
building. The program, called EEXCEL, provides a room in the
building and live-in counselors and tutors who offer children a
&quot;sanctuary for education [and]...incentives for
learning.&quot; When report cards come out, good grades are
recognized at parties. Only those families that want this
resource for their children are accepted as tenants in the
building (108). </p>

<p> Atlanta, Georgia-based Inner-City Families in Action has been
presenting comprehensive information in a series of 2- hour
sessions about how specific drugs, such as alcohol or crack,
affect every system in the body, to residents in two Atlanta
housing projects. The curriculum is called &quot;You Have the
Right to Know.&quot; After 2 years of using the curriculum in
many locations, the narcotics arrests in both housing projects
are down (52). </p>

<p> Through flyers, personal invitations from schools, and a 1-
hour television special, parents were recruited to 87 local sites
around Seattle, Washington, for workshops on &quot;Preparing for
the Drug (Free) Years,&quot; led by trained parents. Surveys
showed that parents' attitudes and behaviors were changed in the
direction of providing protective factors. Parents also rated
highly the workshops' content, process, and leaders (71). </p>

<p> The Midwestern Prevention Project (Project STAR) in Kansas
City, Missouri, used the local media to recruit parents to become
involved in a school and parent substance abuse education course
and to repeat the messages for more than one year. This intensive
effort reduced the rate of increase in initiation of alcohol,
tobacco, and marijuana use among seventh and eighth graders who
had participated in the program, as compared to those who had not
participated (116). </p>

<p> Families With Young Adults </p>

<p> Job Corps, Peace Corps/VISTA programs, American Conservation
and Youth Service Corps, National and Community Service Programs,
universities, and the military all provide young people sheltered
work experiences, educational training if necessary, and
opportunities to live away from home with other young people in
structured environments. Research shows that such experiences
enhance the confidence of participants in their ability to work
hard (48). </p>

<p> Programs To Reduce Risk Factors </p>

<p> Reducing Drug-Trafficking and Substance-Using Peers </p>

<p> Operation Clean Sweep, now being run by the Chicago,
Illinois, Housing Authority, is designed to reduce drug dealing
and other crimes in housing projects. Staff approach one
high-rise building at a time, spending at least a whole day at
the building. State and local law enforcement officers and
housing authority security officers search apartment units (if
there is reasonable cause) for illegal weapons and unauthorized
residents. Authorized residents are given photo I.D. cards, while
others are put on the lease, given a 2-week pass, or asked to
leave. The maintenance staff makes repairs, cleans graffiti,
encloses lobbies, and builds a security station for 24-hour-a-day
surveillance and review of photo I.D.'s and passes for
admittance. The program is being replicated in cities across the
nation, with funding and technical assistance from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). </p>

<p> Reducing Physical and Sexual Abuse </p>

<p> Physical and psychological security is important for the
emotional well-being of children (30) and may well reduce their
risk of later substance abuse. Mandatory arrest and brief
incarceration for physical and sexual abuse of children or
mothers has been shown to deter more repeat offenses than do
warnings or counseling alone (144), and court-mandated treatment
for convicted offenders seems to reduce later abuse even further
(50). Since 40 to 87 percent of adult sexual or physical abusers
also report alcohol or drug abuse, individuals treated for family
violence should perhaps also be screened and, if appropriate,
treated for substance abuse (176). </p>

<p> Reducing Substance Abuse in the Family </p>

<p> Substance abuse treatment for the family can reduce substance
abuse in the short-term and maintain those reductions in the
long-term (27,75, 101,147,149,153,). Substance abuse treatment
for married adults is more effective when both spouses are
involved (96), and especially with a behavioral approach to
marital problems (110). Clearly, families can help rehabilitate
substance abusers, thereby reducing the risk of substance abuse
for other family members. </p>

<p> Reducing Impact of Negative Life Events </p>

<p> Linking people with modest community supports during crises
or adjustments can reduce risk factors and enhance protective
factors. For example, when widows were contacted individually by
trained, previously widowed persons to discuss grief and
decisions to be made, 61 percent accepted the widow-aide services
(145) and one month after bereavement were less depressed and
less preoccupied with the past than widows who had received no
intervention. One year later, the intervention group was
significantly more resocialized in their roles as singles; two
years later, the health of the intervention group members was
significantly better than that of control group members (168). </p>

<p> Also, a 6-month program for newly separated or divorced
people in Colorado (which included both one-to-one counseling by
trained volunteers and group meetings about practical problems,
such as career planning and child- rearing) significantly reduced
the participants' problems and their anxiety, nervousness, and
fatigue. It also improved their psychological adjustment (less
guilt and self-blame, more competence), as compared with a
randomly selected control group (18). More indirect approaches
have also been tried. For example, socially isolated and lonely
individuals, who were provided a free blood pressure station in
the lobby of their innercity single room occupancy hotel, were
introduced to each other by the nurse and later formed a
&quot;Senior Activities Club.&quot; In another example, a surplus
food distribution service, that required individuals to work
together to get their food, produced new friendships (117). </p>

<p> Reducing Parental Neglect </p>

<p> Parents whose children failed to maintain gains after parent
education or family therapy are often socially isolated and
subject to seemingly insurmountable daily problems (49). An
experimental program--with weekly follow-up sessions with
isolated parents, to discuss environmental problems that affected
how parents saw their children's behavior--reduced maternal
criticisms of children, negative responses by children to
mothers, and child problem behaviors (170). When the weekly
discussions stopped, however, the negative interactions resumed. </p>

<p> In a more comprehensive program for low SES parents believed
by Child Protective Services to be at high risk for child abuse
or neglect, Project 12-Ways held meetings with parents in their
homes (95). Treatment goals were developed and, as needed,
behavioral training was provided in stress reduction,
assertiveness, self-control, leisure time planning, marital
counseling, and job finding. Social support groups, alcohol
treatment referral, homemakers, physicians, and mental health
workers were also involved. Parent compliance and involvement in
this 5- to 6-month program were high. Twenty months after
treatment, only 2 percent of Project 12-Ways parents abused or
neglected their children, while 10 percent of a nonprogram
comparison group did. </p>

<p> Families on the verge of having children placed in foster-
care, group homes, or psychiatric hospitals can benefit from
family preservation programs. Children have fewer behavioral and
academic problems when they are raised by birth-parents in safe
homes (130). Thus, the goal of a family preservation counselor is
to help the family out of the crisis and learn how to retain the
child safely at home. The interventions are typically intensive
and brief--for example, a counselor is available for meetings in
the home 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for about 6 weeks. The
counselor deals with any relevant problems, helping the family
clarify values, set goals, and solve problems, and helps connect
family members with community resources (see box 8-3). </p>

<p> Many families, especially those with substance abuse
problems, need more prolonged help. A family support program that
provides such longer term support is Camden House, in the
Ravendale section of Detroit, Michigan. A rundown house was
purchased, renovated, and made the center of an outreach and
drop-in program for about 10 local families with multiple
problems that included substance abuse, lack of skills, chronic
unemployment, early pregnancy, and crime. After staff had worked
with the families for one to two years, taking one problem at a
time and actively mentoring the parents, six out of 10 of the
original parents were out of the Camden House program, drug-free,
trained and employed, and safely and responsibly raising their
children. </p>

<p> SCHOOLS AND PEERS </p>

<p> Millions of school-age youth in the United States experiment
with alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs annually, often
(especially with alcohol) in ways that can cause overdose deaths,
accidental injuries or deaths, and permanent impairments. Many
school-age youth continue to use substances and later develop
long-term addictions. To address these substance abuse problems,
schools provide the most important settings for reaching young
people with standardized, broadly applied educational and
preventive messages. </p>

<p> Because school-age youth are especially likely to initiate
the use of alcohol and other drugs, much of the research has
focused on use, rather than on abuse and dependency. Such
research is nevertheless relevant to an understanding of abuse
and dependency, since use is a precondition and contributor to
abuse and dependency and even experimental use can be harmful.
For example, nearly half of all youth who experiment with
cigarettes develop long-term smoking habits, and alcohol and
marijuana use by youth with no chronic problems still contributes
to highway deaths, crime, and violence. This section summarizes
results from an analysis of survey research on the causes of
school-age substance use and discusses school-based prevention
programming. </p>

<p> Analysis of Survey Research on Causes of School-Age Substance
Use </p>

<p> OTA commissioned a review of the survey research literature
on school-aged substance use that compiled, classified, and
examined 9,930 statistical analyses from 242 separate studies.
This is by far the most extensive systematic examination of this
body of research conducted so far. Most of the studies dealt with
school-based populations, but some focused on school-age army
recruits, dropouts, children of alcoholics, and individuals
involved in clinics. The studies reported statistical
relationships between substance use and its postulated causes.
Statistical findings from the study reports were sorted into 11
major categories and 50 subcategories (see table 8-2), and then
analyzed to identify strong, moderate, and weak statistical
relationships, as well as those that had been insufficiently
studied. </p>

<p> Characteristics of Database </p>

<p> The studies tended to focus on so-called gateway substances,
with tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana analyses accounting for 82
percent of the completed analyses (see figure 8-1). Cocaine,
inhalants, heroin, and prescription drugs, which have recently
received extensive social attention, have been relatively ignored
by quantitative researchers to date; none of these latter
categories of substance use accounted for more than 5 percent of
the analyses in the research reports examined. Gateway drugs are
indeed important, since they may lead some individuals to later
abuse. Nevertheless, the literature has gaps. Inhalants, for
instance, may well be one of the most commonly used and abused
substances among some youth, but they have received almost no
attention from survey researchers. </p>

<p> Although the primary measures were of use, not abuse, the
database included some measures of alcohol abuse (e.g., drunk
driving and impairment from alcohol use). Abuse of cocaine,
heroin, and analgesics was not measured. The percentages of
analyses in the database for each of the 11 major types of
independent variables is displayed (see figure 8-2). The types of
independent variables most studied were personality, use by
others, and cognitive factors (including attitudes, beliefs, and
values). </p>

<p> Results of Analysis </p>

<p> After being sorted into the 11 major categories and 50
subcategories, the average of all the correlations in each
subcategory was calculated. Then, each subcategory was ranked by
its average correlation and the rankings were divided into three
groups, defined by ranges of correlations: primary (with
correlations over .30), secondary (with correlations between
about .20 and .30), and tertiary (with correlations under about
.20) (see figure 8- 3). </p>

<p> Primary correlates </p>

<p> The four variables that dominate as correlates of and
possible contributors to substance use are: 1) prior and
concurrent use of substances, 2) substance use by peers and
friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about substance use, and 4)
offers to use substances. The prominence of prior and concurrent
use is consistent with the reinforcing nature of substance use
itself. The prominence of the other three variables emphasizes
the importance of the social environment in contributing to and
reinforcing substance use among school-age youth. </p>

<p> Secondary correlates </p>

<p> Of the 15 variables judged to be of secondary importance,
seven are social variables: 1) susceptibility to peer pressure,
2) resistance skills, 3)??perception of social pressure to use
substances, 4)? beliefs that such pressure can be effectively
handled, 5) beliefs about social consequences of use, 6)
bondedness (especially to school), and 7) peer group
characteristics. With the exception of parent attitudes about
substance use, other parental variables--such as parental
supervision, monitoring, and relations--are notably missing as
primary or secondary correlates. </p>

<p> Tertiary correlates </p>

<p> Of the 38 variables found to have no more than a minor role
in substance use, 10 were included in at least 100 of the
correlational analyses in the database for this review. They are:
1) substance use by parents, 2) personality traits, 3)
intelligence, 4) social personality traits, 5) parental
relations, 6) affect, 7) participation in structured activities,
8) bonding with the peer group, 9) beliefs about health
consequences of using substances, and 10) self-esteem. </p>

<p> Variables requiring further study </p>

<p> Several of the secondary and tertiary variables in the
studies reviewed here were insufficiently examined to allow
general conclusions to be drawn. However, they may later prove to
be useful to the field. For example, religious affiliation and
the development of substance use-specific values, while not
extensively studied as separate variables, both address issues
related to social norms and influences that have often been found
to be associated with substance use; thus, an association between
these two variables and the onset of substance use might be
expected. Also, availability may prove to be important,
especially if it is defined in future studies more broadly (e.g.,
as physical and social availability, as discussed in ch. 5)
rather than as potential availability (that is, how easy it
appears to be to get a substance, if motivated), as many current
surveys define it. </p>

<p> Preventive Interventions </p>

<p> Schools can seek to prevent substance use and abuse through
curriculum-based drug prevention programs and through other, more
novel approaches, such as school-based clinics, student
assistance programs, and holistic environmental interventions.
School-based prevention efforts have been hampered, however, by a
lack of good evaluation data on the most widely marketed programs
and by insufficient information about and dissemination of the
more promising programs. </p>

<p> Numerous studies of the effectiveness of curriculum-based
drug prevention programs have been completed and reviewed (67).
Studies of prevention programs focusing on tobacco have been
extensively reviewed (16,20,54,58,94,132,155) and alcohol studies
have been reviewed several times (62,64,102). Reviews of
school-based prevention curricula that specifically target
marijuana or cocaine do not exist. However, several reviews have
examined studies of programs designed to prevent the use of
multiple substances (7,25,102,131,156). Even these reviews,
however, typically focus primarily on tobacco and alcohol. </p>

<p> Effectiveness of Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program </p>

<p> Three merchandised curriculum programs have captured a
sizable share of the prevention program market: DARE (Drug Abuse
Resistance Education); Quest: Skills for Living; and Here's
Looking at You 2000. Of these, evaluations only of DARE have been
reported in sufficient numbers to allow conclusions to be drawn. </p>

<p> The DARE program is delivered in schools by uniformed police
officers who have been trained in any of five regional training
centers. It was designed by the Los Angeles, California, Unified
School District, which borrowed from research-based programs
developed in the early 1980s. DARE is delivered annually to about
5 million students in all 50 States, at a total cost of about $50
million (an average annual cost of about $10 per student) (93).
DARE is thus one of the better funded drug prevention programs in
schools. </p>

<p> One research team examined 17 published and unpublished
evaluations of DARE (53). For the 11 studies that met minimal
standards of methodological rigor, the average reductions in
substance use were very small. Use among control schools and DARE
schools was roughly equal. The few studies that were longitudinal
found neither short-term nor long-term reductions. </p>

<p> DARE has important strengths, including favorable reactions
among students who have participated in DARE programs, widespread
political support, substantial funding, uniformly reported
improvements in school-police relations, highquality of program
implementation, and expert marketing. However, these strengths
have not guaranteed that DARE is always effective as a drug
prevention program. A scientific advisory group has been
established to review research and evaluation of the DARE program
and to consider changes in the curriculum. </p>

<p> The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated that about
one-fourth of the funds given to the States and local schools
under the Drug-Free School and Communities Act went toward
purchasing and delivering school curricula (163). However, widely
adopted curriculum packages (such as Quest: Skills for Living;
Here's Looking at You 2000; Project Adventure; BABES; Project
CHARLIE; and Children Are People) have presented no adequate
evaluation results that allow program effectiveness to be judged.
Evaluations conducted to date have been primarily short-term
reviews for dissertations and theses, and they lack interpretable
behavioral end-points. Given the widespread dissemination of
these curricula, quality evaluation studies would be important. </p>

<p> Conclusions About Curriculum-Based Prevention in Schools </p>

<p> Curriculum-based drug prevention efforts to date can be
characterized as showing promise (67,156), but critics point out
that the effectiveness of these programs, especially those that
are being commercially marketed, has not yet been proven and that
significant difficulties remain (102). Some of these are
methodological difficulties intrinsic to all field trial
research, while others relate to the possibly intrinsic
limitations of curriculum approaches when used alone. Individual
studies suggest that curriculum-based prevention programs in the
schools may ultimately be proven to be effective for preventing
substance use among some youth, especially when used as
components in more comprehensive substance use prevention
efforts. However, school-based prevention technologies currently
in use have not been refined and tested enough to demonstrate
their effectiveness for reducing substance use for students in
general, and especially not for multiproblem youth, who are at
higher risk of substance abuse. Clearly, for DARE and for the
other major school-based curriculum prevention programs,
resources must be set aside to properly evaluate program results.
</p>

<p> Noncurricular Approaches to School-Based Prevention </p>

<p> Curriculum-based efforts have dominated the field, largely
because they are relatively simple to understand, implement, and
replicate, and because methods to evaluate them have become
standardized. However, curriculum-based prevention programs have
not been demonstrated to be effective, and several noncurricular
approaches have recently emerged, including student assistance
programs, school-based clinics, and more holistic
school-community collaborations and alterations of psychosocial
environments in schools. These approaches have been evaluated
only rarely, but interest in them has been growing. For example,
although student assistance programs remain largely unevaluated,
they accounted for about half of the spending, under the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act, in six recently evaluated urban
school districts (163). </p>

<p> Student assistance programs try to identify substance-using
students early on and then provide social support, build skills
for dealing with life problems, or refer to treatment, as
appropriate. Peers often help as crisis managers, small group
facilitators, and referral agents, while adults often act as
program facilitators and counselors. Programs typically counsel
students who are children of alcoholics, who use alcohol or drugs
abusively, and who are performing poorly at school. Programs can
also help parents address their children's needs. </p>

<p> Only three evaluations of student assistance programs were
found by OTA for this review. Two focused on process issues only
(89,118), while one addressed program outcomes (90). The outcome
study focused on interventions for students in six residential
facilities, including a locked correctional facility. Although
the sites are atypical for student assistance programs, the
program otherwise resembled student assistance programs in
schools. </p>

<p> The outcome study found that marijuana and tobacco use
declined among program participants in five of the six
facilities. Alcohol use declined in half of the sites, while
alcohol use in two sites remained unchanged and in one site rose
slightly. The declines in use were observed at about nine and 15
months after participation in the program. Although these results
are promising, one study (especially a study conducted in
nonschool settings) cannot support general conclusions about the
effectiveness of student assistance programs in schools. </p>

<p> Many schools, either directly or through community agencies,
are bringing services into schools to help deal with social and
health problems that are often interrelated, such as depression,
violence, substance use, and sexually transmitted diseases.
School-based clinics and youth service centers are being set up
to provide comprehensive and integrated health and social
services. This new wave of programming has been supported by
State governments, local school districts, and private
foundations. </p>

<p> School-based clinics have been developing in response to
growing poverty, widespread lack of insurance, and increases in
health and social problems among youth. One study indicates that
the percent of adolescents defined as living in poverty increased
from 15 percent in 1979 to 19 percent in 1986 (22). Not all youth
living in poverty are covered by Medicaid or other health
insurance, and millions of other youth (e.g., in near-poor or
recently unemployed families) also lack health insurance.
Violence, teen pregnancy, and substance use and abuse remain high
or are increasing in many communities, and these problems often
require direct one-on-one medical or social interventions, if
they are to have a chance of being resolved. </p>

<p> Self-referral and other data suggest that school-based
clinics are providing health care and social support. For
example, a survey of 306 such clinics in 33 States and Puerto
Rico (22) found that about half the visits were for medical
problems, such as injuries and illnesses, with 40 percent of the
visits for counseling and 10 percent for birth control supplies
or counseling about reproductive issues more generally. No
evaluations seem yet to have focused on the effectiveness of
school-based clinics for assisting with the treatment and
prevention of substance use and abuse. School-based clinics
perhaps should not focus primarily on these problems, but as
clinics expand in numbers questions will naturally and more
frequently arise about their role in addressing substance use and
related problems. </p>

<p> Several notable collaborations between schools and other
community agencies and resources have been supported and, at
least in part, studied. For example, the Community Partnership
Program, administered by the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, has supported more than 250 local partnerships for
the prevention of substance use and abuse, with over 60 percent
actively involving schools as coalition members. Each site must
have a local evaluator that will monitor primarily program
activities, and a national evaluation to monitor program
activities and outcomes has begun. The local evaluations are
expected to vary widely, in part because uniform, accepted
standards for community-wide program evaluation have yet to be
developed. Outcome findings are expected by 1997. </p>

<p> The Midwest Prevention Project (116) provides and studies
school-based interventions in the greater Kansas City, Missouri,
metropolitan area and in Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana.
Due to constraints in the study design, the evaluation results to
date speak directly only to the impact of the school-based
curricular interventions; the impact of community organization,
parental, and media components cannot be evaluated. Nonetheless,
this approach suggests the potential for communities to support
school- based prevention efforts. </p>

<p> Cities-in-Schools is a national nonprofit organization
devoted to preventing students from dropping out, through
partnerships among schools, local governments, and businesses.
Cities-in-Schools operates in 122 communities in 21 states with
384 schools participating in the program. The national
organization strives to bring health, social, and employment
services into schools across the nation, to help youth find jobs,
tutors, and counseling and to motivate them to stay in school. A
national staff assists local boards. A prominent person in
business presides over each local program, directs fund-raising,
and organizes a team of professionals to help potential dropouts.
In most programs, a case manager is assigned to each high-risk
child. Beyond these basics, programs vary greatly, focusing on a
diversity of prevention and intervention strategies. Several
Cities- in-Schools sites have achieved national attention.
Although little concrete evaluation data are available about the
effects of these programs in general or on substance use, the
model appears promising and warrants further study. </p>

<p> Changing the social or physical climate in schools may also
help reduce substance use and abuse. Future research and
evaluation studies could focus on the impacts on substance use
and abuse of this and other holistic models, such as open versus
closed campuses, alternative schools, and after- school care
programs. These models may be especially promising for high risk
youth suffering from multiple risk factors and limited protective
factors, many of which are rooted in problematic (often substance
using and abusing) homes, neighborhoods, peer groups, and other
subcultures, which cannot easily be influenced by more limited
school- based prevention approaches alone. </p>

<p> WORKPLACES </p>

<p> Workplaces can also contribute to and protect against alcohol
and drug abuse. This section reviews literature on factors and
interventions associated with substance abuse in the workplace,
with a special focus on the role of workplace settings
themselves. Researchers have investigated the causes of substance
abuse among workers for nearly four decades, and U.S. management
and labor have been concerned about workplace substance abuse for
over a century (150,158,159). Alcohol has been the drug most
studied in workplaces and appears to be the drug most commonly
used. </p>

<p> Magnitude of Problem </p>

<p> The prevalence of substance abuse among the employed remains
inadequately documented, based on a small number of flawed
studies. For American workers more information exists on the
extent of alcohol use and dependence (although gaps remain) than
on the use and abuse of illegal substances (57, 68,114). </p>

<p> The 1988 National Health Interview Survey found that about 13
percent of employed men and 6 percent of employed women were
alcohol dependent (68). This nationwide household survey of
almost 27,000 individuals found that, for both men and women, the
percentage of white-collar workers who drank was greater than the
percentage of blue-collar workers who drank. However, among those
who drank, blue-collar workers drank more than white-collar
workers. Consistent with an earlier survey in Detroit, Michigan,
alcohol-related disorders were also found to be greater among
blue-collar workers, with the rates highest for men who were
craftsmen, laborers, and service workers, and for women who were
machine operators, laborers, and service workers (114). Another
investigator has reported that the rate of on-the- job substance
use among young men in the 6 months prior to the study was about
28 percent (105). </p>

<p> Substance abuse contributes to workplace problems, such as
accidents, injuries, absenteeism, turnover, lost productivity,
compensation claims, and insurance costs (11). The total cost to
the American economy related to substance abuse has been
estimated to be more than $144 billion a year, with about 60
percent due to alcohol abuse and 40 percent due to the abuse of
other drugs (121). Costs to the economy include costs due to
medical care, prevention, law enforcement, and lost productivity.
The 1985 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that
substance-using employees were 3.6 times more likely to have
accidents than nonusing employees. They had 2.5 times more
absences of 8 days or more. They were three times more likely to
be tardy than nonusing employees and were 2.2 times more likely
to ask for early dismissal. They requested sick leave three times
as much as nonusing employees. They were five times as likely to
file for worker compensation. The total cost of lost productivity
due to alcohol and other drug abuse has been estimated at more
than $33 billion in 1985 and a little more than $43 billion in
1988 (122). </p>

<p> Factors Affecting Individuals in Workplaces </p>

<p> Substance abuse in workplaces can be affected by nonworkplace
factors and workplace factors. </p>

<p> Nonworkplace Factors </p>

<p> Early research attributed drinking and other drug problems on
the job to factors outside the workplace. Substance abuse was
seen as a problem brought to the workplace but not caused by the
workplace, and some believed that substance abusers selected
workplaces where they could conceal their problems. This view
assumed that substance abusers had the knowledge and freedom to
choose jobs on this basis, an assumption unlikely to apply to
all, given the limits of education and work experience among many
substance abusers, especially blue-collar workers (113). In any
case, family and community experiences interact with workplace
experiences (2), and workers from families and other subgroups
that drink may find that drinking influences their work lives as
well. </p>

<p> As noted earlier, drinking problems are more common among
those with lower SES, although drinking occurs more frequently
among higher SES individuals (31). Workplaces that employ more
lower SES employees may therefore be expected to have more
alcohol abusers (157). </p>

<p> The acceptance of alcohol and other drugs in the larger
society outside the workplace can also influence substance use
and abuse in the workplace. This can be seen in the new attitudes
in American society toward smoking. Consumers used to be assailed
constantly by advertisements presenting smoking in a positive
light, but are now more informed about its negative effects on
health. As a result, smoking has been banned from many airplane
flights, restaurants, stores, and public and private workplaces. </p>

<p> The availability of alcohol in the local community from which
a work organization derives its employees can also influence
workplace drinking (157). Higher rates of drinking problems exist
in communities where alcohol is cheaply and widely available and
alcohol outlets remain open for long hours. </p>

<p> Workplace Environment Factors </p>

<p> Several decades ago, researchers distinguished four
categories of workplace factors that place employees at risk for
excessive drinking (127). They are: </p>

<p> o lack of work visibility, </p>

<p> o absence of job structure, </p>

<p> o lack of social controls that discourage alcohol use, and </p>

<p> o job stress. </p>

<p> A more recent review (157) of risk factors internal to
workplace environments identified the following elements: </p>

<p> o alienation and powerlessness, </p>

<p> o work stress, </p>

<p> o structural features of the workplace, </p>

<p> o influence of administrative subcultures, </p>

<p> o poorly implemented intervention programs, and </p>

<p> o union-management conflict. </p>

<p> It has also been suggested that individual factors and
perceived work situations may be more important for alcohol use
than objective work situations (136). Those with boring and
routine jobs, or jobs over which they have little control, may be
more likely to drink (3,76). For example, a study of auto factory
assembly line workers found that 40 percent drank alcohol at work
(129). Other research found a consistent relationship between
powerlessness and alcohol use, and no evidence that work
experience or social support moderated alcohol use (137). </p>

<p> Workplace subcultures, whether administrative or
occupational, may also encourage drinking or the use of other
drugs at work. Administrative support for heavy drinking can
exist throughout the work organization or can be limited to
specific sites or occasions. Subcultures that can support the
heavy use of alcohol, but strongly discourage the use of illicit
drugs, are found in the military (28,119). Anecdotal reports
suggest that other occupational settings have encouraged the use
of cocaine (e.g., entertainment industry). Although available
research does not support the conclusion that workplace
subcultures are the primary cause of substance abuse, there is
evidence that at least alcohol problems vary widely according to
occupation (148). </p>

<p> Workplaces can offer protective factors as well. For some,
the fact of being employed, with the income and stability and
status that employment can convey, may offer protection against
substance use and abuse. If unemployment and underemployment are
viewed as risk factors, then employment by itself, at a decent
wage in a decent job, may offer protection. In addition, the
specific characteristics of a workplace can be protective. For
example, the risk factors listed above could be viewed as the
extremes on a continuum, the other end of which could be expected
to offer protection. Thus, work visibility, job structure,
manageable stress, worker involvement and empowerment, supportive
administrators, well implemented treatment and prevention
programs, and union-management harmony could be expected to be
protective factors. </p>

<p> Interventions </p>

<p> Two primary ways of dealing with employee substance abuse and
health have emerged: traditional employee assistance programs
(EAPs), which seek to help employees with identified problems,
and health promotion programs, which seek to prevent illness and
promote health (56). </p>

<p> Employee Assistance Programs </p>

<p> EAPs help employees with personal problems at the employer's
expense, by providing services directly (through the work
organization) or indirectly (through a provider in the community)
(140). In some workplaces, for example, EAPs are located in
medical departments, which generally provide emergency medical
care and may also provide preventive or rehabilitative care.
Medical departments, however, appear to be declining as sites for
EAPs (141). </p>

<p> EAPs rely on a strategy of constructive confrontation, which
assumes that supervisors or coworkers of substance abusers will
help refer them to the EAPs. In addition, workers are encouraged
to refer themselves to EAPs for assistance. </p>

<p> A review of what works in fighting substance abuse in the
workplace stresses that an employee assistance program is a key
to a good workplace program (167). It also recommends a written
drug-free workplace policy, management and supervisory training,
drug testing in workplaces where appropriate (one example of
which is when substance abuse may be dangerous to self or
others), and employee education programs focused on substance
abuse. Testing may well prevent substance use and abuse in
workplaces. </p>

<p> Some studies suggest that EAPs can be cost-effective for
business. The Department of Labor has reported thatemployers
generally find that for every dollar invested in an EAP, savings
of from $5 to $16 are achieved (167). Other reviews of the
limited evaluations of the economic and other benefits of EAPs
have found that health care costs and absenteeism, for example,
decline after employees have been served by EAPs (178). </p>

<p> However, EAPs have also been criticized in some cases, for
their inability to reach those at greatest risk, their incomplete
coverage of lower status employees, their failures to identify
problem drinkers early enough, their inadequate handling of
situation-dependent drinking problems, and their uncertain
effectiveness in rehabilitating problem drinkers (140). The
relative lack of EAPs in medium and small workplaces is an
important constraint on the ability of EAPs to offer more
widespread protection to the employed. </p>

<p> Health Promotion Programs </p>

<p> Health promotion programs seek to prevent illness and promote
wellness through behavior change. For example, they provide
information and support activities to help individuals increase
exercise, quit smoking, change diets, and manage stress and
hypertension. There are several advantages to using such general
workplace health promotion programs to prevent substance abuse in
the context of promoting positive life-style changes for all
employees. These include: </p>

<p> o little or no stigma; </p>

<p> o the use of positive, optimistic approaches; </p>

<p> o ease in selling to employees and generating enthusiasm;
and, </p>

<p> o generous corporate financing of health promotion programs
(103). </p>

<p> The use of health promotion programs to prevent substance
abuse can also present problems, however. For example, prevention
historically has been one of the lowest priorities for Federal
funding (104). When implemented by businesses, health promotion
programs may inadequately deal with the needs of a particular
work organization's employees, since the programs often come from
outside and have not been tailored to fit the needs of a
particular group of employees. Decision makers within a workplace
may decide on the basis of intuition, whim, or trendiness to buy
a health promotion program from the increasing number of
purveyors of programs (140). Furthermore, many of the proponents
of marketed health promotion programs have failed to adequately
evaluate their programs. Unfortunately, this has been
particularly true of activities intended to prevent substance
abuse. </p>

<p> Environment-Oriented Approaches to Substance Abuse Prevention
</p>

<p> A third approach, often associated with Scandinavia, focuses
less on changing employee behaviors and more on altering
workplace factors that influence worker health. The Swedish Work
Environment Fund, established in 1972, supports research,
workplace innovations, information dissemination, and training to
achieve better working environments. Grants that support
occupational health centers and research programs in Sweden are
financed through a combination of employer fees, payroll taxes,
and government financial assistance. </p>

<p> By contrast, the goal of alcohol policy in the workplace in
the United States has for centuries been to change individual
drinking behavior (1). Researchers have recently begun to focus
on how the workplace environment influences problem drinking. The
Harvard School of Public Health, jointly funded by the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, is surveying thousands of managers and work
groups in up to 10 large multinational corporations (171). The
study will determine corporate and work site patterns of
drinking, levels of work site drinking problems as they relate to
attitudes and practices of management, how corporate culture
affects managerial behavior and drinking problems in the
workplace, and what role the work group plays in promoting or
preventing problem drinking. </p>

<p> RECREATIONAL SETTINGS </p>

<p> Recreational and other developmental activities and settings
may also contribute to the prevention of substance use and abuse,
or by their absence increase the risk. Examples of such
recreational and other developmental activities and settings
include Boys and Girls Clubs, Boy and Girl Scouts, organized
sports, cultural activities, and local park and recreation
department programs. </p>

<p> Organized Activities and Drug Abuse </p>

<p> Research on the impact of organized youth activities on
substance use and abuse is limited, and only a few studies have
addressed the issue directly, while others have addressed it more
indirectly. </p>

<p> One study (which relied extensively on reports from employees
of Boys and Girls Clubs) found that public housing developments
served by Clubs had 22 percent less drug activity than
developments not served by Clubs. The presence of crack in
particular was 25 percent lower, and even lower in developments
served by new Clubs with SMART Moves, a substance abuse
prevention program (133). </p>

<p> A more extensive investigation has been conducted by the
Search Institute, which has surveyed 180,000 6th through 12th
grade youth in 430 school districts since 1988. Analysis of the
data found that as developmental assets increased (including
involvement in music, school team sports, nonsport school-based
cocurricular activities, nonschool clubs or organizations, and
churches) at-risk behaviors decreased, including the use of
alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs (12). Specifically, the
correlations: </p>

<p> o tend to be small; </p>

<p> o are strongest for tobacco use and weakest for alcohol use;
and, </p>

<p> o are slightly higher for church involvement than for other
activities. </p>

<p> Involvement in youth programs and activities has been found
to be associated with fewer at-risk behaviors among youth. One
study found that higher levels of four youth assets (perceived
positive school climate, family support, involvement in
structured youth activities, and involvement in church or
synagogue) were associated with lower levels of 20 at-risk
indicators, contained mainly in eight at-risk domains (alcohol,
tobacco, illicit drugs, sexuality, depression/suicide, antisocial
behavior, school, and vehicle safety) (12). High school students
who listed no assets, for example, reported an average of 5.6
at-risk indicators, while students listing all 4 assets reported
only 1.7 at- risk indicators. </p>

<p> A study of different communities found that 55 percent of the
youth in the healthier communities (defined by fewer at- risk
behaviors among youth) were involved in structured activities,
whereas only 39 percent of the youth in the least healthy
communities were involved in such activities (19). </p>

<p> Qualitative assessments across prevention disciplines support
these findings. For example, although a review and analysis of
delinquency, adolescent pregnancy, substance abuse, and school
failure and dropout prevention programs did not directly
investigate connections between youth development programs and
substance abuse prevention, its authors concluded that the
elements in youth development organizations can play a critical
role in preventing each of these problem behaviors (48). </p>

<p> The Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development has identified
several successful prevention efforts launched by national
youth-serving organizations, including the adolescent pregnancy
efforts of the Association of Junior Leagues and of Girls, Inc.,
and found that participation in such programs was associated with
fewer at-risk behaviors (32). The Carnegie Council's Task Force
on Youth Development and Community Programs concluded that, taken
together, current social science theory and field evaluations
provide a solid rationale for strengthening and expanding the
role of community-based programs in promoting healthy adolescent
development, since unsupervised after-school hours represent a
period of significant risk, with young adolescents standing a
greater chance of engaging in substance abuse. </p>

<p> Another study tested whether inactivity or boredom was
associated with substance abuse. It compared adolescents who had
been clinically diagnosed as substance abusers with a comparison
group of nonsubstance abusers, and found that the substance
abusers experienced their leisure activities as more boring, even
though they had participated in more leisure activities
(including such activities as going to concerts and going for a
drive). Available leisure activities may, for some youth, fail to
satisfy &quot;their need for optimal arousal,&quot; leaving them
more vulnerable to the appeal of drugs (78). </p>

<p> Thus, being active does not by itself protect against
substance abuse. Some activities, such as those that are
unstructured and unsupervised, may even increase the risks of
substance use and abuse through association with a wider range of
peers, some of whom are using substances. In addition, activities
perceived as boring may not protect against substance use and
abuse. More research is needed, to clarify the aspects of
recreational and other leisure activities that may protect
against substance use and abuse. Research might profitably focus
on whether activities that are supervised, structured, drug-free,
empowering, skills- building, self-esteem-promoting, active,
shared, and nonboring (or some combination of those) are
associated with lower levels of substance use and abuse. </p>

<p> Elements of Notable Programs </p>

<p> Several of the most important elements of notable substance
abuse prevention programs are provided by youth development
programs as well. These include: </p>

<p> o Promoting social and life skills. Programs that rely
exclusively on transmitting information about the health, legal,
and social risks of substance use and abuse are generally
ineffective (79). If, as the author of a recent longitudinal
study contends, substance use is a symptom rather than a cause of
personal and social maladjustment, promoting social and
psychological well-being may help prevent substance abuse (66).
Many alcohol and other drug prevention programs focus on the
development of social and life skills, as a way to help youth
understand their emotions, control their anger, curb
aggressiveness, and presumably reduce their inclination to turn
to substances (66,166). </p>

<p> o Strengthening families. Increasingly, alcohol and other
drug prevention programs are recognizing and addressing family
factors. Youth development organizations afford opportunities for
involving parents in recreational and other nonschool, nonfamily
activities. </p>

<p> o Promoting healthy peer interactions. Several studies have
shown the value of using peers as role models in prevention
programs. One study conducted a meta-analysis of 143 adolescent
drug prevention programs and collapsed prevention programs into 5
strategies or types: knowledge only, affective (i.e., addressing
feelings) only, peer programs, knowledge plus affective, and
alternatives. Peer programs that highlight peer influences and
emphasize skill building were found to be the most successful
(156). Peers are often the best positioned to help others build
resistance skills and bring about significant results in reducing
substance use, as compared to teachers or other adults. Peer
counseling and student assistance programs, for example, offer
unique opportunities for youth to cope with difficult issues and
develop skills to resist peer pressure (33). </p>

<p> o Indirect and participatory approaches to substance use.
Substance prevention programs are more likely to be effective if
they develop creative ways to reach and connect with their
participants. Many programs incorporate lessons concerning
substance use into activities such as games, theatrical
performances, creative arts, and sports. Some programs avoid
stating in their names that they are focusing on substance use
prevention, and in this way often attract more youth and preclude
them from feeling stigmatized (161). Because youth spend so much
time in school, where didactic, lecturing approaches so often
predominate, these approaches may well be less effective in
nonschool activities. GAO has recommended that programs engage
youth in activities that are more motivational and participatory,
such as support groups, dramatic productions, leadership
training, and role- playing (161). </p>

<p> o Alternative activities. Communities are beginning to create
healthy, substance-free alternative activities, such as teen
centers or drug-free parties, for youth who may feel there is
nothing else to do. This alternatives approach grows from the
idea that youth who turn to substances to meet certain social and
psychological needs can meet those needs in more positive and
healthy ways without chemicals. In its guide book, Prevention
Plus III, CSAP stresses the importance of incentives for youth to
participate in such alternative activities. At a minimum,
activities should reflect the interests and preferences of the
youth involved. A 10-year study with over 500 subjects found that
the largest percentage (67 percent) of assuredly recovered
substance abusers, defined as those who have been clean for five
years, used alternative activities to cope with or improve their
moods (169). However, although it remains a promising strategy,
many agree that more substantial research is needed. </p>

<p> The elements of notable programs suggest that youth
development organizations may be able to play a greater role in
the prevention of substance abuse. First, they can provide
specific information about substances and training in refusal
skills. Second, they can address life skills development,
emotional issues, and academic remediation. Further, they can
involve both youth and their families, as well as peers, in
settings for collaborative, substance-free interactions. Research
has shown the importance of building supportive communities
through such networks of social support that can diminish
substance use and abuse and promote healthy youth development
(14,19,133). PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, AND EVALUATING
COMMUNITY-WIDE PROGRAMS </p>

<p> If substance abuse and addiction problems in a particular
community affect individuals via multiple risk and protective
factors interacting in multiple settings, then efforts to prevent
these problems may require multipronged efforts involving
schools, parents, media messages, and other community resources
(116). While it is possible that an assessment of problems may be
carried out by relatively few individuals, it is extremely
unlikely that the planning, implementation, and evaluation of
community-wide efforts can be achieved without participation of
residents and leaders throughout the community. Widespread
coordination and cooperation are intrinsic to community-wide
efforts. To help achieve such community-wide coordination and
cooperation, several different types of community coalitions have
been created. The CSAP has studied the ability of 7 pilot test
communities, under Community Partnership grants, to gather
information on 15 community-wide indicators of alcohol and other
drug abuse (see table 8-3). Some of these indicators are directly
related to and measure the extent of substance abuse and
addiction among subpopulations in a community (e.g., number of
drug positive urine samples from pregnant women at time of
delivery). Some of the indicators measure the extent of behaviors
or outcomes that may be directly related to substance abuse
(e.g., number of single vehicle nighttime accidents and number of
deaths due to alcohol and other drugs). Some of the CSAP
indicators relate to community activity settings, such as
workplaces and schools. </p>

<p> CSAP has recently supported, through the Community
Partnership program and the High-Risk Youth program, the use of
nonquantitative techniques to gain insights into substance abuse
and addiction and related problems in communities. This
information can be garnered by ethnographers and citizen
informants, who can report on the values, attitudes, purposes,
behaviors, and experiences of individuals in the subcultures of
communities. </p>

<p> The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded 13 community
coalitions in its &quot;Fighting Back&quot; program to reduce
substance abuse and addiction. About 600 coalitions now belong to
a national organization, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of
America (CADCA). Some coalitions have been formed to address
other health and social issues, including the ASSIST and COMMIT
community tobacco control programs, funded by the National
Institutes of Health, and the Planned Approach to Community
Health (PATCH) program, funded by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention to encourage local coalitions for community health
planning and implementation (29). HUD now has funds to support
Community Coalitions Against Crime, which also address substance
abuse and addiction. And CSAP has supported numerous activities
conducted by approximately 250 coalitions through its Community
Partnership program (see table 8-4). </p>

<p> A recent review of some of the Community Partnerships
revealed the wide range of activities they have so far
implemented, including general prevention programs, public
education, alternative activities, community organizing and
empowerment, advocacy for policy change, and other community
activities. </p>

<p> Although coalitions have not been extensively evaluated as
yet, and although the evaluations that are now in process will
not produce outcome results for several years, there is reason to
believe that community coalitions offer promise for
community-wide efforts to prevent substance abuse and addiction.
First, as documented by this report, the factors contributing to
substance abuse and addiction are multiple and interactive.
Second, these factors interact in subcultures and community
activity settings that can encourage or inhibit substance abuse
and addiction and are widely dispersed. Thus, especially in
communities severely impacted by these problems, multiple efforts
addressing multiple factors in multiple settings may be required.
A recent report from the General Accounting Office concluded that
&quot;preliminary research results indicated that a
community-based approach may hold promise in preventing drug
use,&quot; and went on to emphasize the need for comprehensive
evaluations of such efforts (162). </p>

<p> Community coalitions could make use of the framework in this
report to develop plans for preventive interventions addressing
targeted populations in selected community activity settings.
Building on a systematic quantitative and nonquantitative
assessment of needs, a coalition could identify optional
preventive interventions that address selected populations and
settings, and then phase them in as resources permit. However,
some community coalitions may need additional support and
technical assistance to help them resolve conflicts, form
consensus on goals and plans, and sustain cooperative,
coordinated efforts that are subject to more rigorous evaluations
and midcourse corrections. Each community coalition needs to take
a critical look at what works and what does not work, and needs
to be flexible enough to try promising and proven analytical and
programmatic technologies, even if they are somewhat new to the
coalition. </p>

<p> SUMMARY </p>

<p> This chapter has reviewed research on factors and
interventions relevant to the onset and prevention of substance
use, abuse, and addiction in the four principal community
activity settings--homes and families, schools and peers,
workplaces, and recreational and other community settings.
Research indicates that families may influence whether family
members, especially (but not limited to) the young, initiate
substance use and progress to abuse and dependency, and can be
the target of a wide range of increasingly tested preventive
interventions that can help family members resist the use of
substances. Similarly, schools, especially through peer group
norms and behaviors related to substance use, can also be
important locations for the onset of substance use (including
alcohol use) and for preventive interventions, especially those
that focus on social influences, including peers. Factors in
workplaces, although less studied, can also contribute to and
protect against substance use and abuse, and workplace
interventions that focus on individuals and environments provide
opportunities for prevention. Finally, an emerging literature on
the role of recreational settings and activities, especially for
youth, suggests that the availability of attractive and
compelling substance-free activities can play a role in

<p> BOX 8-2: Janice Janice, a 28-year-old, white, married female,
was inoutpatient treatment for bulimia nervosa, a
binge-purgepattern of eating that began when she was 18 years
old. Shealso had an intermittent history of alcohol abuse
datingfrom midadolescence. Janice appeared to be well-motivated
intreatment. She used the psychoeducational approach taught byher
therapist to increase her knowledge of how her binge-eating and
moodiness were related to her restricted dailycaloric intake. She
made progress quickly, using cognitivebehavioral techniques to
challenge her distortions andunderstand her behavior; she began
to eat consistent mealsin adequate amounts. These changes led to
a decrease in herbinge-eating and self-induced vomiting. However,
along withthis progress she became increasingly anxious, fearful,
andagitated about weight gain (despite the fact that little
ornone had occurred). At the same time, she became overwhelmedby
the intensity of the feelings she experienced, was havingbad
dreams, and withdrew from her support system in waysthat angered
her friends. She once more resorted toinconsistent meal patterns,
dieting, poor nutrition, and--inevitably--binge-eating and
vomiting. Her alcohol useincreased.Janice's symptomatology
shifted once she significantlydecreased her bulimic behavior.
Instead of dealing witheveryday feelings, behavior, and thoughts,
she began torelive memories from her unresolved traumatic past.
Thesememories started with vague feelings of uneasiness,
whichgrew more intense as she binged less. She then began
toremember her dreams, which, as they came into clearer
focus,caused her to be suspicious of her friends, and
particularlyof the men around her. Janice reported feeling fine
oneminute and then very frightened the next. Whereas she usedto
be flattered by any male attention, she now felt fearfulwhen men
looked at her. She started to remember multiplesexual assaults in
her past, both by persons known to herand by strangers. She felt
increasing urges to suicide, andobserved the reality of her
internal suffering as being &quot;tooawful.&quot; As she said,
&quot;If this is what recovery is all about,I don't think it's
worth it; I'll take my chances andstruggle with addictions. If I
can't stand that, there'salways suicide.&quot;SOURCE: M.P. Root,

<p> <b>TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING SUBSTANCE
ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> October 18, 1994 </p>

<p> <b>CHAPTER 9 POLICY OPTIONS </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> Issues related to substance abuse and addiction have long
occupied the attention of the American public. Congress has:
authorized a multitude of federal programs aimed at reducing or
preventing the supply and demand of illicit drugs and to regulate
the availability of illicit substances, appropriated billions of
dollars each year to federal agencies, provided oversight of
federal programs, and passed broad-based legislation to
coordinate programs as part of the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Congress faces several fundamental difficulties in addressing
the causes of substance abuse and addiction: </p>

<p> o No scientific consensus exists as to what is the driving
cause of substance abuse and addiction. A range of risk and
protective factors have been associated with drug use, abuse, and
addiction. </p>

<p> o Federal antidrug efforts, though coordinated by the White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), are spread
among many federal agencies, whose authorization and
appropriations are the subject of action by numerous
congressional committees and subcommittees. ONDCP efforts in drug
demand reduction efforts alone involved the efforts of federal
agencies across at least 11 Cabinet-level departments. This makes
coordinated legislative action difficult to achieve. </p>

<p> o The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the creation
of new domestic programs that target known risk and protective
factors in individuals and communities. The framework and
literature reviews presented in this report make clear that
multiple factors in individuals, groups, and substance abuse and
addiction can arise and be influenced by communities. Thus,
effective intervention requires prevention practitioners to
select from a variety of options, so they can target the specific
factors that are especially important for the particular
populations and communities they are addressing. This does not
mean that everything must be done at once nor that everything be
known in advance of taking action. To the contrary, policymakers
and practitioners can take small steps at a time, and then, as
resources and new knowledge permit, take additional steps that
address a fuller range of factors and contexts in greater depth. </p>

<p> o Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically
accepted standards for determining their success or failure.
While federal supply-side efforts yield hard data (e.g., amount
of illicit drugs confiscated, number of persons incarcerated), it
is much more difficult to demonstrate and quantify the impact of
a domestic program designed, in part or in whole, to prevent drug
abuse. Whatever methods are developed, tested, and incorporated
into prevention programs, a critical component of success is
careful, rigorous evaluation. Answering &quot;what works?&quot;
is essential in making advances in preventing substance abuse. </p>

<p> This chapter addresses some of the policy issues brought to
the Office of Technology Assessment's (OTA's) attention during
the course of this assessment, and possible options for
congressional action. The issues and options are broken into four
broad categories: federal focus and prevention program structure,
research needs, community activity settings, and availability.
Given the broad nature of federal antidrug efforts, many
important issues relating to federal antidrug efforts remain
beyond the scope of this report. Such topics include drug
treatment, interdiction and enforcement, and drug legalization. </p>

<p> The order in which the issues and options are presented does
not imply priority. Moreover, the options presented under each
policy question are intended as a short menu from which Congress
can choose one or more options for consideration and
implementation, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. </p>

<p> FEDERAL FOCUS AND PREVENTION PROGRAM STRUCTURE </p>

<p> Supply vs. Demand Reduction </p>

<p> The federal substance abuse control policy has as its primary
focus the eradication of the supply of drugs. The federal
government currently spends over $12 billion annually on antidrug
efforts, with approximately two-thirds of this amount supporting
drug interdiction and law enforcement activities, and the
remainder supporting demand- side activities, such as drug
treatment, research, and prevention programs. While ONDCP's most
recent National Drug Control Strategy argued for a slightly
increased percentage of funds for demand-side reduction, the
larger percentage of funds remain devoted to supply-side efforts.
Congress could decide that existing levels of effort and program
approaches in interdiction may need to be continued for a longer
period of time before they can succeed in reducing the
production, distribution, and local availability of illicit
substances. Congress could direct that interdiction efforts, and
the balance between supply and demand efforts, continue on the
same track. </p>

<p> If Congress decided to increase federal efforts in demand
reduction efforts, it could adopt any of three methods: 1)
increase appropriations for treatment and prevention programs; 2)
redirect some of the interdiction funds to increase support for
treatment and prevention programs; or 3) require that assets
forfeited in drug seizures be increasingly used to support
treatment and prevention programs. If Congress chose to simply
increase appropriations for additional treatment and prevention
programs, this option would require raising the current level of
federal spending for drug control efforts at a time when the
federal deficit is a key concern. Since costly interdiction and
incarceration programs have not eliminated either the supply of
illicit substances or the demand for and use of such substances,
Congress could decide to increase appropriations for treatment
and prevention programs by reallocating funds currently spent in
drug interdiction and law enforcement activities; this would mean
a drop in supply-side efforts such as drug interdiction and law
enforcement activities. The reallocation of assets forfeited in
drug seizures to treatment and prevention programs, if done
together with closer coordination of local antidrug efforts among
law enforcement and treatment and prevention practitioners, may
be an attractive small step. Congress could direct that ONDCP
monitor the reallocation of such assets, to ensure the flow of
funds to programs that directly focus on substance abuse and
addiction and, programs that do not directly address substance
abuse and addiction but that target risk and protective factors
known to be associated with abuse and addiction. </p>

<p> Many stakeholders agree that the federal antidrug effort
should be more focused on treatment and prevention. Widespread
disagreement exists, however, as to whether such additional
treatment and prevention efforts should be created at the expense
of, or in addition to, current supply-side efforts. </p>

<p> Structure of ONDCP </p>

<p> Since its creation in 1988, ONDCP has served as the most
visible federal entity in the war on drugs. The Director, the
so-called drug czar, has the opportunity to galvanize public
attention on federal antidrug efforts, and to propose and
advocate policies within the White House. ONDCP's effectiveness
is limited, however, both in its statute and through its
operation as a White House office. Congress could choose to
reauthorize ONDCP, and in so doing maintain or alter its mission
and authority; or allow ONDCP to expire. </p>

<p> If Congress chooses to reauthorize ONDCP, a number of options
exist for altering its mission. Congress could: </p>

<p> o Direct ONDCP to address the full range of the most harmful
abusable substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and inhalants.
Although federally funded prevention programs address the range
of abusable substances, the statute creating ONDCP emphasized
illicit substances. As a result, ONDCP has historically provided
limited attention on abusable substances that have been
associated with higher levels of death and injury than illicit
drugs. More recently, ONDCP increased the focus in its National
Drug Control Strategy on the illicit use of alcohol and tobacco
by minors because of the extensive damage to the health and
safety of minors, resulting from the use and abuse of these
substances. This approach could be enhanced through congressional
authorization. </p>

<p> o Alter ONDCP's leadership structure. ONDCP by statute has a
Deputy Director of Supply Reduction and a Deputy Director for
Demand Reduction. This structure has, in part, resulted in an
ongoing public policy debate regarding the overall federal focus
on antidrug efforts, with supply-side and demand-side reduction
efforts seen by some as philosophically incompatible (see
discussion on supply versus demand reduction earlier in this
chapter). By creating an alternative structure, ONDCP may be
encouraged to adopt programs that more closely link various
elements of the antidrug strategy (e.g., a focus on drug
availability could link current supply-side elements that target
physical availability of a drug with current demand-side efforts
that focus on economic and social availability, as discussed in
chapter 4). Despite the advantages that may result from a new
organizational structure, the simplicity of the current structure
makes it easier to provide a sharper focus on supply and demand
elements of the National Drug Control Strategy. </p>

<p> o Give ONDCP increased authority over federal agency antidrug
programs. Although ONDCP is charged with leading a war on drugs,
its authority is limited to a coordinating function. Congress
could provide the Director of ONDCP with specific authority over
certain elements of various federal programs, or with additional
authority over federal agency budget proposals. Such actions
would give the drug czar more substantive authority to direct the
war on drugs, but would likely be viewed by some federal agencies
as an unwarranted intrusion in agency matters. </p>

<p> o Mandate the size of ONDCP. Because it is part of the
Executive Office of the President, ONDCP is subject to increased
political manipulation by each administration. Recently, for
example, ONDCP took the largest personnel cut of any White House
office to meet President Clinton's pledge of a 25 percent
reduction in overall size of White House staff. While mandating a
specific size for ONDCP might lead to increased effectiveness for
the office, it would hamper White House efforts to control staff
size. </p>

<p> Alternatively, Congress could allow the authorization for
ONDCP to expire. While ONDCP has produced National Drug Control
Strategies that summarize and set policy for federal efforts, the
office lacks the authority to shape the antidrug policies of the
federal agencies. Coordination of antidrug efforts is difficult
at best when the number of relevant agencies is so large; since
antidrug policy involves many federal agencies, it might make
sense to disband ONDCP and rely on efforts by diverse federal
agencies to continue to address the many aspects of the drug
problem. Recent reductions in the size of the ONDCP staff, as a
part of the down-sizing of the White House staff, could make this
an opportune time to eliminate the office altogether. Terminating
ONDCP would, however, be viewed by many as federal abdication of
the war on drugs. </p>

<p> Structure of Federal Substance Abuse Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Federal efforts supporting substance abuse prevention
programs are housed at a number of agencies. Congress recently
reorganized the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Administration (ADAMHA), splitting service-based components into
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) and research-based components--the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Mental Health
(NIMH)-- into the National Institutes of Health (NIH). More
recently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has been renamed
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), which has
already expanded its title and mission to include prevention.
Congress could maintain the current structure if it determines
that substance abuse is a problem that has many aspects and
deserves to be addressed by many agencies and in many settings. </p>

<p> If Congress decided to create a more centralized structure,
it could enact legislation designating a single federal entity as
the chief agency for prevention efforts, or merge the components
of various agencies under one federal roof. Possibilities
include: </p>

<p> o Merging NIDA and NIAAA into a single National Institute on
Substance Abuse and Addiction. The use of multiple substances
(including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin) is
increasingly reported by researchers and practitioners. Indeed,
the gateway theory or hypothesis focuses on the progression in
the use of substances, beginning with alcohol and tobacco (which
are illegal for youth, but legal for adults) and moving to
marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Since clinicians and researchers
have increasingly commented on the progression in substance use
and on the co-occurrence of the use of multiple substances, the
separation of the major federal research agencies into an alcohol
agency (NIAAA) and a drug agency (NIDA) is more and more
inconsistent with the shape of the problem. The Center for
Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is an integrated substance
abuse agency that explicitly focuses on alcohol, tobacco, and
other drugs, and all state alcohol and drug abuse agencies are
now integrated or located in the same place. To facilitate more
integrated and coherent research on the range of abusable
substances, NIDA and NIAAA could be combined into a national
institute on substance abuse and addiction. Such a merger would
further integrate the federal research efforts in substance
abuse, but might be seen by some as downplaying the emphasis
given to illicit substances. </p>

<p> o Place CSAP in CDCP or in the Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA). CDCP could give the substance abuse
prevention field a solid base in the health and medical sciences,
especially in the tracking and prevention of diseases. HRSA could
give CSAP a broader health care environment to work within, which
includes Community Health Centers and the National Health Service
Corps. One disadvantage to the merging of CSAP into either of
these other health agencies is that it would emphasize the
medical aspects and interventions of drug prevention and downplay
the many nonmedical factors and interventions that are important
in the onset of substance use and abuse. Merger would also
present problems of moving people--CSAP is headquartered in
Rockville, Maryland, while CDCP is headquartered in Atlanta,
Georgia--and threaten the loss of identity that some proponents
of CSAP say is found in an agency that solely addresses substance
abuse and prevention. However, the fragmentation of the federal
effort on substance abuse prevention has been viewed by some as
extreme and counterproductive, and the efforts of ONDCP have not
succeeded in achieving coordination across departments. </p>

<p> o Merge federal substance abuse prevention efforts into a
single agency, such as CSAP. CSAP has been working
collaboratively with the staff in many other federal agencies,
and would be seen as a natural leader for this effort. In
addition, its recent efforts to begin to develop standards of
practice for substance abuse and addiction prevention programs
could be continued and more effectively infused into the
components of programs currently in other agencies and
departments. </p>

<p> Evaluation of Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically accepted
standards for determining their success or failure. Most
evaluations focus on the processes used in formulating and
implementing a prevention program (e.g., who was involved, what
type of program was used) and outcome evaluation (e.g., how many
people were part of the program, how the program was replicated).
Congress could allow the current level of process and outcome
evaluation related to substance abuse prevention programs to
continue. </p>

<p> If it chose to improve the quality of program evaluation,
Congress could direct NIDA and NIAAA, or CSAP to design, lead,
and support a multiyear national process (involving
representatives of other federal agencies and of outside
organizations) to forge consensus on standardized definitions and
outcome measures, using technical reviews, consensus-forming
techniques, and technical assistance monographs. These
definitions and measures could include substance use, heavy
drinking, substance abuse, substance addiction or dependency, and
related behavioral problems such as school truancy, unemployment,
delinquent and criminal behaviors, and the like. CSAP, NIDA,
NIAAA, the Department of Education (DOE), and other federal
agencies could be required to increase funding and technical
assistance for process and outcome evaluations through grants and
contracts. CSAP could focus on process evaluations that may
assist program managers throughout the course of a program. NIDA
and NIAA could focus on outcome evaluations that are more
rigorously designed and conducted by individuals who are
independent of the programs being evaluated. DoE could require
both process and outcome evaluations by states and by schools,
using Drug-Free School monies. NIDA, NIAAA, or CSAP could be
directed to provide incentives for researchers and programs to
participate in a national program database, using consistent
definitions and including data from multiple evaluations. The
creation of such a database would allow researchers to extend
their own analyses by tapping into data from other program sites
and populations that have used consistent definitions and
measures. </p>

<p> States could be required by legislation to use a portion of
their 20 percent prevention set-asides under the Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Block Grant program and a portion of their Drug- Free
Schools funds for evaluation of substance abuse prevention
programs. Since evaluations of prevention programs can be
expensive, Congress could consider increasing block grant funding
levels to allow increases in evaluation studies without requiring
decreases in programs. If such an option were enacted, Congress
could mandate that evaluations be conducted by independent
bodies, such as university-based researchers, rather than by
state government agencies that have vested interests in
demonstrating program effectiveness. </p>

<p> RESEARCH NEEDS </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> The National Household Survey and the National Survey of High
School Seniors have developed credibility over the years for
their regular reporting of substance use in households and high
schools. These surveys could be allowed to continue, with no
substantial changes in the cost, frequency of data collection,
focus on target groups, analysis, and sharing of the database. </p>

<p> Because of the methodology employed, national surveys miss or
underreport various populations. Much of the data now collected
focuses on substance use (e.g., any use within the past 30 days
or anytime in a lifetime), rather than on more intense substance
abuse and addiction. In addition, questions are
substance-specific, and less oriented to the use and abuse of
multiple substances. Such polydrug users and abusers are
increasingly being identified by researchers and clinicians.
While substance use is a key precondition to later abuse and
addiction, most individuals who use illicit substances do not go
on to addiction. Thus, an important question for the development
of prevention policies and programs is: What are the
characteristics of individuals who abuse and become addicted to
substances, and how do they make the transition from use to abuse
and addiction? </p>

<p> If Congress felt that current data do not provide adequate
information, it could direct that the Household and High School
Surveys be conducted less intensely or less frequently. The
expense of these surveys, especially the National Household
Survey, is high. In 1992, the High School Survey cost about $3
million, and the Household Survey costover $12 million. Spending
could be reduced if the survey data were compiled less intensely
(e.g., with fewer questions or from a smaller sample) or less
frequently. Alternatively, Congress could direct NIDA to develop
and support survey methodology that reaches populations missed by
current surveys (notably the homeless, school dropouts, and
residents of some inner-city and rural areas), or through
legislation, create a mechanism, comparable to the release of
economic indicators, for the regular and nonpolitical release of
survey data. Data could then be released through a well-defined
process that includes careful and timely technical reviews for
compliance with high standards of data collection and analysis,
rather than being subjected to bureaucratic or political reviews
that may delay the release of or bias the data. </p>

<p> Individual Risk and Protective Factors </p>

<p> A substantial body of research has been developed regarding
potential risk and protective factors for children and
adolescents. A variety of theories has been developed concerning
how many and which risk factors increase the chances for a child
or adolescent to first use alcohol or other drugs. Historically,
one of the flaws with much of the risk and protective factor
research has been that studies analyzed one factor in isolation
from all others. Increasingly though, researchers are examining a
wider variety of factors among different populations, as well as
using more complex data analysis procedures. Even so,
sophisticated multifactor research studies are still in the
minority. </p>

<p> While a substantial amount of risk and protective factor
research has focused on children and adolescents, not as much is
known about factors among other populations. Recent research has
led to interest in the possibility of further analyses in
selected populations and/or selected risk or protective factors.
Some examples: </p>

<p> o Adults. Additional research in this area could result in
learning more about factors associated with long-term drug abuse
and addiction as well as the importance of factors more often
found in adult populations (e.g., effects of aging, death of a
spouse or child, divorce). Data from a recent National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse show that individuals aged 18 to 25, and 26
to 34, respectively, have the two highest reported rates for
heavy drinking and smoking, past month use of cocaine, crack,
marijuana and hashish, or psychotherapeutic drugs. Additionally,
gender, racial, and ethnic substance use differences appear
within the adult population. Some research has indicated that
women who drink heavily do so several years later than men,
although the reasons for this remain unclear. Researchers also
indicate that black men who drink heavily, do so in their late
twenties and early thirties, in contrast to white men whose
drinking peaks at age 15 to early twenties. Increased research on
the adult population could be useful in developing appropriate
substance abuse prevention and treatment programs for adults. </p>

<p> o Race and Ethnicity. The biological and genetic substance
abuse studies completed on different racial and ethnic groups
have been few in number, mostly limited to alcohol, and
inconclusive. While race and ethnicity have not been shown to be
biological or genetic predictors for substance use, abuse, or
addiction, certain risk factors appear to be unique for specific
cultures. To date, however, the racial and ethnic categories used
in many large-scale studies are so broad that many researchers
consider them useless. Increased federal funding for studies of
specific subpopulations living in geographically different areas
(e.g., urban versus rural, reservation versus nonreservation)
will provide much needed baseline data on which to plan,
implement, and evaluate appropriate substance abuse services. </p>

<p> o Poverty. Disagreement exists on the appropriate definition
of poverty and its exact relationship to substance abuse. While
few researchers deny that the daily stresses associated with
living in chronic poverty probably contribute to substance abuse,
poverty is certainly not the only factor, or perhaps even the
most important. There are after all, more individuals living in
poverty who do not abuse substances than who do. However, the
consequences of substance abuse appear to be worse in chronically
poor areas. Additional research to study the complex relationship
between poverty and substance abuse could provide substance abuse
practitioners with a framework from which to build programs most
suitable for the special needs of chronically poor areas. </p>

<p> Congress can, through its reauthorization and oversight
powers, monitor the amount and scope of risk and protective
factor research that is being conducted, and redirect federal
efforts toward more extensive multifactor research and analysis,
as appropriate. Such focus could include factors other than
substance use that may contribute to later abuse and addiction,
such as other problem behaviors, availability, marketing,
psychological factors, social norms in communities, and
subcultures. The increased use of ethnographers as part of a
multidisciplinary drug abuse prevention research teams could also
be encouraged. </p>

<p> Biomedical Research </p>

<p> Biomedical research on substance abuse helps explain the
acute and chronic biological effects of substances on the brain
and other organs, and also points to appropriate short- and
long-term medical treatments for substance abuse. This in turn
helps treatment providers understand treatment outcomes and
relapse rates for long-term abusers. Most federally supported
biomedical research is administered by the 17 institutes that
comprise the NIH. With the passage of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse,
and Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act of 1992
(Public Law 102-321), NIDA and the NIAAA were moved to NIH.
Research targeting substance use, abuse, and addiction is
supported primarily by these two institutes, whose combined
appropriation level ($580.7 million in fiscal year 1994) is
approximately 5 percent of the NIH total. </p>

<p> Congress has historically increased annual appropriations for
biomedical research at NIH; if Congress continues this trend,
both NIDA and NIAAA annual appropriations will rise, although not
at the dramatic levels many scientists would like. If Congress
were to decide that substance abuse and addiction should command
more of the nation's biomedical research budget, it could
substantially raise appropriation levels for NIDA and NIAAA. Such
an action would allow increased levels of research in a number of
areas including: genetics; drug development; identification of
biological factors related to transitions from casual drug use to
abuse, addiction, and dependence; the pharmacology of multiple
drug use; environmental factors and their effect on individual
biological susceptibility; and the biological effects of drug use
and abuse on the development of children and adolescents. Given
budget realities, however, an increase in the funding levels
available for basic biomedical research could mean a decrease
somewhere else. </p>

<p> A number of budgetary pressures have recently slowed robust
NIH budget growth, including the need to fund disease- specific
research (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), indirect
costs of research, and the increasing pressure to limit
discretionary spending. Some scientists identify stable budget
growth--as opposed to sporadic increases targeted at particular
topics--as most important for continued progress in research. In
fiscal year 1994, both NIDA and NIAAA received a 5.2 percent
increase in appropriations, following an Administration request
that would have raised NIDA's appropriation by less than 1
percent, and decreased NIAAA's appropriation by 1.6 percent.
Fluctuations in appropriation levels could impede the development
of scientific advances that are necessary to the creation of new
medications and therapies. </p>

<p> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in its March 1994
report to Congress, Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue
Options, identified a reduction in funding for NIH research as
one of nearly 200 policy options. As noted by CBO, a reduction in
NIH funding could have adverse effects on biomedical research and
might cause some researchers to leave the field. NIH cannot
currently fund the majority of grants it approves; in addition,
funding is insufficient to support some important areas of
research. According to a 1992 General Accounting Office report on
Drug Abuse Research: Federal Funding and Future Needs, antidrug
research appears now to have a very modest role, with only about
4 percent of total drug strategy spending devoted to research and
development. </p>

<p> COMMUNITY ACTIVITY SETTINGS </p>

<p> Substance abuse and addiction occur in communities around our
Nation. Those who believe that drug abuse and addiction are
closely related to social and economic problems argue that
antidrug programs should more directly address the risk and
protective factors that have been identified by researchers. Many
prevention program providers also argue that the most successful
programs are those that are more comprehensive in scope (i.e.,
tailored to address the many community settings in which drug
abuse can occur) rather than addressing one or two risk factors
in isolation. </p>

<p> In conducting this assessment, OTA surveyed literatures
addressing substance abuse and addiction in various community
settings--families and homes, schools and peers, workplaces, and
recreational settings (see ch. 8). The literature reviews
presented in this report make clear that substance abuse and
addiction can arise and be influenced by multiple factors in
individuals, groups, and communities. Thus, effective
intervention ideally should be comprehensive, employing multiple
services and addressing the many factors that cause drug abuse
and addiction; and community-based, sensitive to and directed at
the needs of the local population. </p>

<p> Still, three problems arise in assessing policy options
related to community settings: </p>

<p> 1. There is the inherent difficulty in drawing a link between
many social services and their effect on drug abuse and
addiction. </p>

<p> 2. Since broad-based social services are provided through the
work of many federal agencies, further analysis (e.g., by ONDCP
or a congressionally enacted national commission) could identify
which federal agencies are best suited to implement the variety
of options that Congress may wish to employ. </p>

<p> 3. The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the creation
of new domestic programs that target known risk and protective
factors in individuals and communities. </p>

<p> Schools and Peers </p>

<p> The primary focus of federal efforts at community-based drug
prevention is programs aimed at our nation's schoolchildren. In
fiscal year 1993, Congress appropriated $598 million to DOE under
the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986. The federal
government could continue to fund school-based prevention
programs, with a continued emphasis on prevention curricula and
evaluations that are limited to substance use prevention. The
likely limited effects on preventing abuse among high-risk youth
would continue. Other school-based prevention programs would
continue to be implemented sporadically, without significant
evaluation and with few or unknown effects. </p>

<p> If Congress decided that more rigorous evaluation of school-
based programs was called for, it could mandate DOE to spend a
set percent of its Drug Free Schools monies on research and
evaluation of prevention curricula and the dissemination of
findings. A special initiative could be launched to test
prevention curricula for high-risk youth and for different racial
and ethnic groups, since most of the research and evaluation to
date has been based on samples of schools with middle income
white youth. Special expertise would need to be brought in, on
staff and as advisers, to assure the research and evaluation meet
high standards of methodological rigor. This could be achieved by
hiring staff with research and evaluation expertise, detailing
staff from the NIDA, setting up an interdepartmental advisory
group that guides and oversees a research and evaluation program,
or appropriating funds directly to NIDA (e.g., as a set- aside
from the Drug-Free Schools appropriation) to support such a
research and evaluation program. Also, easier access to
information about the many drug prevention curricula that exist
could help school personnel select curricula that fit their
needs. DOE could be directed to prepare and disseminate more
widely information about the purposes, design, methods, resources
required, and evaluations (if any) of drug prevention curricula
currently available, and to inform school personnel of the
limitations of school- based curriculum approaches and the
growing availability of supplementary and alternative approaches.
If Congress decided that Drug-Free Schools funds should be used
more widely to target risk and protective factors found in
school-aged populations, it could require DOE to set aside a
certain percentage of Drug-Free Schools funds for a variety of
activities that target high-risk youths and to work individually
with them and their families. Such targeting could enhance
activities already carried out under the Drug- Free Schools Act
(e.g., Drug Abuse Resistance Education, replication of successful
programs, local programs for high- risk youth, school personnel
training). However, congressional mandates could reduce state and
local flexibility in tailoring programs best suited to local
needs, and could increase administrative costs associated with
implementing the Drug-Free Schools Act. </p>

<p> In addition to Drug-Free Schools programs, comprehensive
primary health, mental health, and social services can be
provided in many school-based clinics. School-based clinics can
be supported by a variety of federal funding sources, including
Medicaid, the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, Drug-Free
Schools, and Special Education funds. DOE and the Department of
Health and Human Services could be encouraged or directed to
collaborate on the support of such services in schools. </p>

<p> Since researchers have found that peers and other social
influences strongly affect substance use, programs that
strengthen total school environments may be potent in preventing
substance use and abuse. Models that involve school
restructuring, parent involvement, mental health components, and
elevated expectations for achievement have been developed and are
being tested. The hypothesis is that engaging high-risk youth in
positive educational environments and experiences can profoundly
influence their behaviors for the better. Congress could expand
research on the effects of restructuring of school environments
on substance abuse by appropriating funds for extensive large-
scale longitudinal research that could be supported by DOE, NIDA,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), and other
federal agencies that conduct and support research on youth
outcomes. </p>

<p> Homes and Families </p>

<p> Congress appropriates funds for federal programs addressing
substance abuse and addiction in homes and families, which are
supported by the HUD and HHS' Administration on Children, Youth,
and Families (ACYF) and CSAP. Also relevant to the health and
welfare of families are health funding programs (e.g., Medicaid
and Medicare) and welfare programs (e.g., Aid to Families with
Dependent Children). Through its oversight, authorization, and
appropriations of these programs, and others that impact on the
quality of family life, Congress can support a number of
preventive interventions that are both comprehensive and
intensive. Programs can be initiated by almost any local service
or support setting, such as health care, school, family
preservation, juvenile justice, and housing authority, with
coordination with other services and settings. Such interventions
can include health care, counseling, intensive in-home services,
neighborhood patrols, clean sweeps of public housing, and family
and parent education for all family members. </p>

<p> Because substance abuse and other related problems can be
influenced by so many family factors and programs, a long- term
effort to identify family needs may be desired. Congress could
enact legislation to create a Presidential commission or task
force to formulate a national family policy and create a
blueprint for long-term national efforts to shore up the many
families, rich and poor, that would benefit from more guidance,
skills, and support. Such a national policy could be framed in
the near-term, based on the many studies and program
interventions that have been documented so far. Alternatively, it
could be formulated later, after additional research and program
interventions have been supported and major gaps in knowledge
have been filled. </p>

<p> Workplaces </p>

<p> Congress could allow current activities that focus on
providing workplace employees with information, development of
drug-free workplace policies, drug testing, and employee
assistance programs to continue. These programs are scattered
among many federal agencies, with some leadership by the
Department of Labor (DOL), CSAP, and the Office of Management and
Budget. </p>

<p> If Congress chose to increase efforts in workplace antidrug
prevention, it could mandate that federal agencies increase the
information that is made available to workplaces about drug-free
workplace programs and policies. For example, DOL is implementing
an electronic database, with information about workplace
substance abuse treatment, prevention, and other control programs
and research. Such a database, if properly supported, publicized,
and accessed by businesses and unions, could help workplaces
identify and implement approaches that can meet their needs in
affordable ways. </p>

<p> Recreational and Community Settings </p>

<p> Congress currently funds community partnership demonstration
programs administered by CSAP. These partnerships foster
public/private sector partnerships that create and preserve
comprehensive strategies for addressing substance abuse
prevention within communities. A major advantage of these
partnerships is the ability to create programs that address
substance abuse prevention within individual communities. As with
other drug prevention programs, however, evaluation has generally
been limited. Congress could, through appropriations and
authorization, direct CSAP to expand the provision of technical
assistance and expand the national process and outcome evaluation
of partnerships. More site visits would be possible, with
additional resources for national and regional workshops,
conferences, and training. </p>

<p> Other federal activities in this area remain limited and
largely uncoordinated. Major current programs are administered by
the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service
(with its 4-H program, which is refocusing its efforts on
high-risk youth) and CSAP (through some of its High Risk Youth
Demonstration Grants). The President's Council on Physical
Fitness addresses one aspect of recreational and leisure
activities--that is, physical fitness. If Congress decided to
provide more information and support more research on
recreational, leisure, and other youth development programs, an
information clearinghouse could be established to share
information about federal and non-federal recreational, leisure,
and youth development activities. The purpose would be to help
communities and program developers identify and develop such
programs especially for youth at risk of drug use and abuse. The
clearinghouse could be managed in-house or under contract, and
could be located in the Cooperative Extension Service (which is
now attempting to redirect 4-H programs to address high-risk
youth); ACYF; or CSAP (perhaps in the existing National Center
for Alcohol and Drug Information, a federally sponsored
clearinghouse). </p>

<p> The dearth of recreational places, especially in highly
developed urban areas, can be remedied by an enhanced national
effort to acquire land and facilities for park and recreation
purposes. Such an effort could focus especially, but not
exclusively, on rural and inner city areas where low property
values make the acquisition of such properties financially
attractive as long-term investments in the future development and
enrichment of communities. Such a national effort could be
comparable in scope and long-termcommitment to the development of
the national park system, but could contribute to a broader
national system of parks owned and managed by the federal, state,
and local governments specifically for more intense human uses.
Such a system could focus on the developmental needs of youth,
especially in urban areas, where usable open spaces are often in
short supply. Congress could designate a lead federal agency for
such an effort (e.g., Department of Interior or HUD), and could
acquire properties outright or by encouraging and subsidizing the
acquisition of properties by nonprofit groups and by state and
local governments. The latter approach would require less federal
funding and administration. Possible sources of land and
facilities include: closed military bases, holdings of the
Resolution Trust Corporation, assets forfeited through drug
seizures, individual gifts and bequests, and corporate and
philanthropic gifts. </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY </p>

<p> The primary current focus of federal antidrug efforts is
stemming the physical supply of illicit drugs. A multitude of
policy issues arise in addressing drug availability, most of
which are beyond the scope of this report. The discussion in
chapter 4, however, touches on two availability issues currently
on the congressional agenda. </p>

<p> Taxes </p>

<p> The federal government currently levies excise taxes on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes on all
types of alcoholic beverages were raised in 1990 to their current
levels. Currently, for example, beer (six pack, 12-ounce cans)
carries a 33 cent federal excise tax, a 750 ml bottle of wine
carries a 21 cent federal excise tax. A pack of cigarettes
carries a federal excise tax of 24 cents. If Congress takes no
action, current federal levies will remain in effect. </p>

<p> Congress could enact legislation raising the federal excise
tax on a variety of tobacco and alcohol products if it sought to
decrease consumption of such products, to recover estimated
societal costs (i.e., health costs, injury, </p>

<p> death) resulting from consumption of such products, or to
raise revenue for federal spending programs. Such tax hikes could
be targeted at all tobacco and alcohol products, or at selected
products in these industries. Advocates of increased excise taxes
have argued that abuse of and addiction to tobacco and alcohol
products cost the United States more than any illicit substance;
that increased taxes would make such products less economically
affordable and hence less used and abused; that increased taxes
could be used to pay for financial damages arising from the use
of such products; and that such excise taxes, which have
increased less rapidly than the general rate of inflation, should
be adjusted upward to reflect inflation. Opponents of taxation
have argued that excise taxes are regressive in that they target
primarily low- and middle- income taxpayers, that increased taxes
would result in significant losses to major companies that are
important players in the American economy, and that targeting
so-called sin taxes unfairly singles out millions of Americans
who use tobacco and alcohol products. </p>

<p> Alcohol Labeling </p>

<p> Federal law currently requires that each alcoholic beverage
container bear a specific warning statement that is conspicuously
and prominently located (27 USC 215). This requirement was
enacted by Congress in 1980. Both Congress and States have
authority regulating alcohol advertising. At least 35 states
regulate alcohol advertising, and self-policing by segments of
industry places some limits on advertising (e.g., the distilled
spirits industry code prohibits the advertising of liquor on
radio or television). </p>

<p> Congress has considered legislation that would require
warnings on all alcohol beverage advertising, both print and
electronic media. Congress could amend current alcohol labeling
law to require stricter labeling (e.g., multiple labels, rotating
labels, specific messages). Opponents of such action argue that
no significant relationship has been found between exposure of
individuals to alcoholic beverage advertising and/or labeling and
drinking behaviors. _ <br>

ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b> </p>

<p> <b>US Government Office of Technology Assessment</b> </p>

<p> <b>APPENDIX A: DRUG CONTROL POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES:
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> The United States has always been a drug-using country. In
colonial days, people drank more alcohol than they do today, with
estimates ranging from three to as many as seven times more
alcohol per year (13) While public drunkenness was a criminal
offense, it was generally considered a personal indiscretion.
(1). The temperance movement began in earnest after the
Revolution, when heavy drinking was revealed to be a problem, and
religious figures became committed to temperance. (1). Since
then, the American experience with both licit and illicit drugs
can be viewed as a series of reactions to the public's shifting
tolerance toward their use (9). </p>

<p> THE EARLY 1900s: NARCOTICS AND COCAINE </p>

<p> In the late 19th century it was possible to buy, in a store
or through mail order, many pseudomedical preparations,
containing morphine, cocaine, and even heroin (9). The ubiquitous
soft drink Coca-Cola used to contain cocaine until 1903, when it
was replaced with caffeine (9). Pharmacies sold cocaine in pure
form, as well as a number of opium-derived drugs, such as
morphine and heroin, the latter of which became well-known when
it was marketed by the Bayer Co. beginning in 1898 (10).
Physician prescriptions of these drugs increased from 1 percent
of all prescriptions in 1874 to between 20 to 25 percent in 1902;
they were not only available but they were widely used, without
major concerns about negative health consequences (14). </p>

<p> Cocaine and narcotic preparations were taken off the market
for various reasons. Increasing awareness of the hazards of drug
use and adulterated food led to such regulations as the Pure Food
and Drug Act of 1906 that required that fraudulent claims be
removed from patent medicines, as well as disclosure of
habit-forming substances. The passage of several antinarcotic and
pharmaceutical labeling laws was spurred on by these health
concerns, a growing temperance movement, the development of safe
pain relievers (such as aspirin), a broader range of medical
treatments, and the growing immigrant population thought to be
associated with specific drug-using practices. However, these
laws did not make patent remedies, cocaine, and opium illegal.
Some individual states imposed tighter restrictions on their
availability, but there was no uniformity among state laws. It
was United States involvement with international narcotics
concern that led there (9,10,14). </p>

<p> In 1909, the International Opium Commission called by the
United States, met in Shanghai, to begin an international
discussion concerning the problems of narcotics and the narcotics
trade. Twelve nations, in addition to the United States, were
present to discuss problems relating to opium. At that time the
perception in the United States was that Chinese immigrants were
to blame for the opium smoking problems. This angered the
Chinese, who had instituted strict campaigns against the sale and
use of opium within their own country. The Chinese were seeking
U.S. assurances for help in ending Western opium trafficking into
China. The State Department not only wanted to support China's
drug control efforts, but thought that international drug control
measures would help stanch the flow of drugs into the United
States, and thus the nonmedical consumption of these drugs. It
would not be until two years later, in the Hague, that a treaty
would be signed stating that all the signatories would enact
domestic legislation controlling narcotics trade, specifically
limiting the use of narcotics for medicinal purposes (9,10). </p>

<p> Hamilton Wright, the State Department's opium commissioner,
attempted to draft legislation but met opposition from the
States, the medical profession, pharmacists and pharmaceutical
companies. After nearly three years of debate, Congress passed
the Harrison Act in December 1914 (named for Representative
Francis Burton Harrison, who introduced the initial form of the
bill for the Administration). The bill provided for strict
control of opium and coca and their derivatives: both their entry
into the country and their dispersion to patients. Maintenance of
addicts by physicians was allowed until 1919. Opposition to the
Harrison Act came mainly from pharmaceutical companies and
pharmacists, who objected to what they called the Act's confusing
and complex record keeping requirements (9). </p>

<p> Passage of the Harrison Act reflected, in part, growing
public sentiment that opium and cocaine were medicines to be
taken only in times of illness (and then only when prescribed by
a physician) and that these substances could cause insanity and
crime, particularly in foreigners and minorities. Smoking opium
was associated with Chinese immigrants; popular belief also held
that cocaine would affect blacks more forcefully than whites and
incite them to violence. Marijuana was believed to have been
brought into the country and promoted by Mexican immigrants and
then picked up by black jazz musicians. These beliefs played a
part in the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act, which attempted to control
the drug's use (9). As early as 1910, many people argued against
any nonmedical use of narcotics. </p>

<p> PROHIBITION AND BEYOND </p>

<p> Focus on Alcohol </p>

<p> Ratification in 1919 of the 18th amendment prohibited the
manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, and exportation
of alcohol and shifted the Nation's focus for more than a decade
from the dangers of narcotics to the Nation's alcohol problems.
Prohibition had its roots in the Temperance Movement, which began
shortly after the Revolution. In 1784, Benjamin Rush, a physician
and signer of the Declaration of Independence, published a
pamphlet entitled, &quot;An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent
Spirits on the Mind and Body,&quot; which was widely disseminated
among Temperance leaders. In it he described a &quot;disease
model&quot; of excessive drinking, which characterized
drunkenness and alcohol addiction as a &quot;disease of the
will,&quot; in addition to causing many physical diseases. By the
mid-19th century, the American middle class had become more aware
of the dangers of alcohol to the family, the nation, and the
factory (1). By the late 19th century and early 20th century, the
Temperance Movement came to be associated almost exclusively with
American Protestantism as a political mechanism to control the
growing numbers of non-Protestant immigrants. This political and
social strength helped, in 1919, to ratify the 18th amendment
which forbade the sale of alcoholic beverages, and to implement
it by means of the Volstead Act in 1920 (1). </p>

<p> The shifting tolerance of Americans toward substance use is
evidenced by the successes and failures of the Prohibition era.
In 1919, many were optimistic that the prohibition of alcohol
would solve many of the country's social problems. If alcohol
contributed to the crime and unemployment associated with the
cities, then removing it from the market might help solve those
problems. However, despite evidence that consumption declined
(based on declining rates of death due to cirrhosis and of
alcoholic psychosis in State mental hospitals), there is also
evidence that widespread dishonesty existed in the enforcement of
dry laws. Jobs to enforce Prohibition were doled out as political
favors, which may have contributed to graft, corruption, and the
surge in underworld crime (9,17). In addition to the perceived
rise in corruption, the passage of progressively stricter laws
regarding violations of the Volstead Act also contributed to
waning public support of prohibition (17). The 1933 repeal of
Prohibition signaled that public sentiment had once again become
favorable toward alcohol, and alcohol and its related problems
returned to private, rather than public, arenas. </p>

<p> The scientific literature of the 1930s and early 1940s
concentrated mainly on captive alcoholic populations in jails,
mental hospitals, and skid row, allowing many Americans to
distance themselves from alcoholism (1). During this same period,
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded, but lacked mainstream
recognition until the 1950s and 1960s when the scientists lent
support to the disease model of alcoholism, which has always been
the central tenet of AA (1,11). </p>

<p> Focus on Narcotics </p>

<p> While alcohol experienced a transition period in respect to
public tolerance, negative attitudes toward narcotics and other
drugs remained constant, or became even more severe. During the
1920s, the Federal government expanded its antidrug efforts
through new Treasury Department regulations (8). In 1930,
President Hoover created the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and
appointed Harry Anslinger as the Commissioner of Narcotics, a
position Anslinger held from 1930 to 1962, a precursor, perhaps,
to the modern day drug czar. For more than three decades,
Anslinger oversaw all aspects of drug control, from interdiction
to domestic supply, to public relations. He effectively used
religious and other antidrug groups to maintain a high antidrug
sentiment in the country. He also controlled the flow of legal
drug supplies, by keeping watch over doctors who might prescribe
unusually large amounts of narcotics. Anslinger was opposed to
the medical treatment of addiction, and addicts, like alcoholics,
were seen as deviants (9,15). </p>

<p> Prior to the mid-1960s, marijuana use in the United States
was mostly confined to various subgroups such as Mexican
laborers, jazz musicians, and beatniks. Although portrayed as a
killer weed and a menace by antimarijuana reformers, there is
little evidence that it was either at this time. In 1937, the
Marihuana Tax Act (the Federal government then spelled marijuana
with an &quot;h&quot;), became law, making the use and sale of
marijuana without a tax stamp Federal offenses. Some companies
were permitted to apply for a license to use cannabis products
(e.g., for birdseed, paint and rope), and doctors could still
prescribe marijuana in limited circumstances. However, starting
in 1937, recreational use was punished with greater severity
(15). Some speculated that the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act
resulted from strong anti-Mexican sentiment in the Southwest and
the political power of Anslinger (5). </p>

<p> Intolerance toward drug use was very strong in the 1930s and
40s. Federal laws concerning the sale and use of drugs got
progressively stricter, culminating in the introduction of the
death penalty for the sale of heroin to anyone under 18 years old
by anyone older than 18 (10). Illicit drug use during these
decades was low in the mainstream population. This
marginalization of narcotics (or at least, of the people who used
them) may have played a part in the resurfacing of these drugs
after the 1930s. There was a concern during World War II that
American soldiers in Asia would succumb to drug supplies
available in those countries and return home with drug habits.
The Bureau of Narcotics received no budget increases, since
Congress apparently believed it was well equipped to deal with
the current drug levels (9). </p>

<p> In the 1950s, however, heroin was brought into the country in
larger quantities than at any time since it was outlawed. Dealers
learned that poor quality heroin could be sold at inflated
prices, and this higher cost pushed users into criminal
lifestyles heretofore not seen on such a wide scale (12). A
nationwide scare that drug use would spread from the urban poor
(mostly minorities) to the rest of the country erupted. The fact
that young people appeared to be the biggest users of heroin was
particularly alarming. This fear was reflected in the passage of
the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which increased penalties for
the sale and possession of marijuana and heroin (15). </p>

<p> The reaction to this rise in drug use was not entirely
fearful, however. Scientific and technological advances offered
alternative answers to coping with the drug problem a switch from
the past tactics of law enforcement. Even though the
stereotypical heroin user was still a poor minority, new ideas
for treating and helping these people emerged as part of
increasing acceptance of the medical model of addiction. In the
1960s, methadone maintenance pilot programs were launched. By
using the long-acting opioid methadone for treatment of addiction
to the short- acting opiate heroin, these programs offer a way
for heroin addicts to control their addiction (6). </p>

<p> 1960s-PRESENT </p>

<p> In the 1960s, white middle-class youths, who were more
visible than their minority counterparts, began experimenting
with drugs, including marijuana and heroin, causing wide public
concern and demand for more treatment approaches and additional
law enforcement (17). Some of this new interest in drug use may
be attributed to the intolerance toward it in the preceding
decades. Marijuana had never been widely used, and after the
1930s its use was not a widespread concern. It was rediscovered
by young people in the 1960s, who had grown up with parents who
used alcohol. Some of the drug consumption may also be linked to
an increase in consumption generally during the late 1960s and
early 1970s, the Vietnam War protest movement, and the rapid
changes in American society that occurred in those years
(9,10,17). </p>

<p> Despite the image of the sixties as a time of widespread
experimentation, the increase of drug use activated many who had
been quiet on the issue. Marijuana, the drug of choice among many
young people, was seen by some researchers as the gateway to more
dangerous drug use. Richard Nixon was elected President in 1968
on a law and order platform, and it is said that no other
President has campaigned as hard against drug abuse (9). As
during World War II, concern rose that soldiers serving in
Southeast Asia would develop drug habits while there. In this
case, the fears were well- founded, as many servicemen did avail
themselves of cheap supplies of heroin and marijuana. However,
even among those who became addicted, many stopped their drug use
upon returning to the United States. During the 1960s, the old
linkages between corruption, Asians, and opium surfaced once
again in public opinion, leading to more stringent measures to
stop the flow of drugs into the United States from both Asia and
Latin America (8). </p>

<p> Public support of law enforcement against drugs was high
during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and President Nixon spoke
of mounting &quot;a frontal assault on our number one public
enemy [drugs],&quot; but long mandatory minimum sentences for
possession of small amounts of marijuana disturbed many
Americans, even those who did not approve of marijuana use. The
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970
lessened penalties for possession of marijuana. It also
established a system for classifying drugs into five schedules,
which is still used today. Drugs are placed in each schedule
based on their potential for abuse, their known harmfulness, and
medical value. Marijuana and heroin are listed in schedule
1--drugs with high potential for addiction and no recognized
medical value. There have been, however, limited experimental
programs approved by the DEA and FDA for the use of marijuana in
treatment of nausea due to chemotherapy and of ocular pressure
due to glaucoma. Cocaine is listed in schedule 2--drugs with
potential for addiction for acceptable for some medical
applications. Subsequent to the establishment of this system,
drug policies and laws for individual drugs have been based on
the drug's schedule (3,16). </p>

<p> In 1972, the President's National Commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse recommended that the laws against the use of marijuana
be relaxed, since the enforcement of these laws was becoming too
burdensome to police in some areas, and was considered intrusive
on individual privacy in others. The drug was increasingly
thought to be innocuous in its effects, both by scientists and
others (4). Several States passed decriminalization laws, which
allowed possession or use of small amounts of marijuana and
imposed fines instead of prison sentences for transgressions of
minor possession laws (10). The Commission remained strict on
cocaine, which was also seeing a surge in use, but few experts
thought it was physically addictive or should be classified in
the same category as other narcotics. </p>

<p> Despite President Nixon's emphasis on &quot;law and
order&quot; responses to drug use, his drug budget favored
prevention, education, and treatment. The National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) was created as the lead agency for demand
reduction, directing Federal prevention and treatment services
and research. The Drug Enforcement Administration was created as
the lead agency for supply reduction, and single state agencies
were created to guide Federal funds into state and local antidrug
programs (3). </p>

<p> From the mid-sixties to the late seventies, the composition
of drug users changed substantially. While drug use was still
associated primarily with minorities and the lower classes, drug
use by middle-class whites became a widespread and more accepted
phenomenon. As in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, when middle class whites haphazardly used narcotic
preparations, this new group of drug users down-played or ignored
the dangerous effects of drugs, and extolled their virtues as
agents of nonconformity and mind-expansion. Cocaine was an
expensive and high-status drug, used mainly for recreation by
upper- and middle-class whites. </p>

<p> From the drug experiences of this cohort, which were by no
means entirely positive, the public of the late seventies was
better educated about the effects of drugs, and public
disapproval of drug use began once again to increase. Drug use,
however, particularly of cocaine and marijuana remained high. The
Ford Administration (1974-1977) focused on the drugs it thought
posed the greatest danger--heroin, amphetamines, and
barbiturates. Some even thought that drugs such as cocaine and
marijuana should be legalized, &quot;so as to end the enormous
government expenditures of money and time on a problem that only
seemed to bring profits to drug dealers and elicit contempt for
the law from an ever-growing body of drug users&quot; (9). </p>

<p> During the Carter Administration (1977- 1981), Peter Bourne,
a special assistant for health issues, argued for Federal
decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana,
while focusing interdiction efforts on heroin. But Bourne
resigned over a scandal involving criticisms over his prescribing
practices. His resignation forced President Carter to take a
harder position on drugs, and Federal decriminalization never
occurred. There were still States in which marijuana was
decriminalized, but these decreased in numbers through 1990, when
the last State--Alaska--to have decriminalization repealed those
laws. </p>

<p> The departure of Bourne coincided with the emergence of
several parents' groups concerned about drug use by their preteen
children. One group in particular, in Atlanta, Georgia, became
enraged when they found that in addition to drug use at parties,
their children were able to buy drug paraphernalia and prodrug
literature in local stores. The group formed the Parent Resources
Institute on Drug Education, National Families in Action, and the
National Federation of Parents. These groups were instrumental in
prodding NIDA to publicize more widely the dangers of marijuana
and other drugs once thought of as harmless. </p>

<p> The Administration of Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) favored a
strict approach to drug use and increased law enforcement. First
Lady Nancy Reagan actively campaigned against drug use, urging
school children to &quot;Just Say No.&quot; At the same time,
funding for research and treatment decreased, while the
availability of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana remained the same
(9). The budget for antidrug related activities rose from $1.5
billion in 1981 (split nearly equally between supply reduction
(domestic law enforcement and international/border law
enforcement) and demand reduction (research, prevention and
treatment) to $4.2 billion by the end of President Reagan's
second term. Two-thirds of the funds were now allocated for law
enforcement activities, with the remaining third allocated for
demand reduction (2). In 1984, the Crime Control Act increased
dramatically Federal mandatory minimum sentencing provisions for
drug- related crime, including the manufacture, distribution, or
possession of controlled substances. It also expanded the
criminal and civil asset forfeiture laws to penalize drug
traffickers and increased Federal criminal penalties for
drug-related offenses (3). This trend continued through the
remainder of the Reagan administration as well as that of
President Bush. </p>

<p> The 1980s saw significant shifts in patterns of cocaine use.
The negative effects of cocaine use, especially long-termuse, had
previously been masked, but middle-class users with drug-related
problems suddenly were more common. Concurrently, cocaine
smuggling escalated, resulting in increased availability, lower
prices, and higher quality. Low-income, minority communities
began experiencing major drug problems, first with powdered
cocaine, then in the mid- eighties especially with the new form
of cocaine--crack. Commonly called an epidemic, the spread of
this smokable cocaine inspired both President Reagan and antidrug
groups to heightened drug intervention efforts. Crack appeared to
be highly addictive, as well as affordable, and fear of its
consequences forced many lawmakers into action. The Anti- Drug
Abuse Act of 1986 authorized more funds than ever before for the
war on drugs, most of which was designated for international
interdiction activities (9), and the establishment of the Office
of Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP). The AIDS epidemic has also
affected patterns of drug use, since some intravenous (IV) drug
users may have switched to smoking crack in order to avoid
exposure to the AIDS virus. Other IV drug users, however, have
continued to inject, and comprise a large percentage of the
AIDS-infected population. </p>

<p> While the main focus of drug control policy in the 1980s was
interdiction of illicit drugs, significant policy initiatives
concerning alcohol were also implemented. For example, the goal
of the national minimum drinking age of 21 was stated in 1984 and
achieved by 1988. Warning labels were required on all retail
containers of alcoholic beverages beginning in 1989 (7). </p>

<p> When George Bush was elected President in 1988 the climate
within the country was highly intolerant to the use of illicit
drugs. President Bush echoed President Nixon when he declared
that the drug epidemic was &quot;public enemy number one&quot;
(16). The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 mandated the creation of
the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), to be headed
by a director, sometimes called the drug czar, who would
coordinate U.S. drug control and abuse policy, resources, and
operations (Public Law 100-690). The first director was William
Bennett, former Secretary for Education under President Reagan.
He was followed by Robert Martinez, former Governor of Florida.
The director, in conjunction with the President and Cabinet
Secretaries, sets Administration policy on drug control. However,
ONCDP lacks budgetary authority, and under President Bush the
director of ONDCP was not a Cabinet position. During the Bush
Administration, additional funds were authorized for the war on
drugs, including increased funds for treatment and prevention.
However, most of the funds were designated for law enforcement
activities. Spending for antidrug-related activities rose from
the high of $4.2 billion under President Reagan, to a proposed
$12.7 billion in the last year of President Bush's term. Again,
the monetary split was roughly two-thirds for law enforcement and
international interdiction activities and one-third for demand
reduction (2). </p>

<p> While &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; has remained part of the
political lexicon, President Clinton, after taking office in
1993, cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 146
positions to 25. He elevated the director of ONDCP to cabinet
status, and Lee P. Brown, former Police Commissioner of New York
City was appointed to this position. During his campaign for the
presidency, Clinton advocated drug treatment on demand, and the
addition of 100,000 new police officers to the streets. _ <br>

ABUSE AND ADDICTION </b></p>

<p><b>APPENDIX C: </b></p>

<p><b>PERSPECTIVES ON DEFINING SUBSTANCE ABUSE </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four broad arenas that encounter substance abuse-related
issues include, mass communications, criminal justice, medicine,
and public health. These entities often operate independently of
one another and use substantially different terms when describing
the use of illicit substances or the illegal use of licit
substances. </p>

<p>MASS COMMUNICATIONS </p>

<p>The traditional realm of mass communications includes
television, radio, and popular journals and newspapers. Within
these media, the term substance abuse has become a catch-all
phrase, with no clear boundaries. Much of the general public has
become familiar with the term substance abuse within this
ambiguous context. </p>

<p>CRIMINAL JUSTICE </p>

<p>While it is well-known that many crimes are committed by
persons with substance use disorders and that these disorders can
be major contributors to their crimes, there is no systematic
policy within the criminal justice system for the evaluation of
these disorders. In many jurisdictions, whether federal, state,
or local, the prevailing sentiment is that any use of an illicit
substance and/or use of a licit substance in an illegal manner,
is considered criminal abuse. A limited set of quantitative
analyses including blood, urine, and breath tests can be
performed to detect illegal levels of alcohol and/or the presence
of illicit substances. The Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) is
0.10 grams/deciliter for all States excluding Oregon, California,
Utah, Vermont, and Maine, where the level is 0.08
grams/deciliter. As of December 1992, 15 states had lower BAC
levels for youthful offenders charged with driving while
intoxicated. These levels range from 0.00-0.02 grams/deciliter,
which is considered &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; up to 0.04
grams/deciliter (6). The alcohol breath test, while a different
procedure from the BAC, converts the results into BAC units.
Thus, the levels of intoxication for BAC and breath test are
identical. </p>

<p>However, there are limitations to these analyses. In some
jurisdictions, these tests can be performed only with the written
consent of the person. In others, the urine test measures the
presence of only one or two drugs rather than looking for the
entire range of abusable substances. </p>

<p>Besides the limited amount of testing and evaluation, there is
little use of psychological screening examinations or structured
interviews to determine the level and severity of use, abuse, or
dependence. </p>

<p>PUBLIC HEALTH </p>

<p>The traditional public health model incorporates the host-
agent-environment relationship. Each of these factors has an
individual, as well as an interrelated role in the potential use
and/or harmful use of a substance. </p>

<p>Host factors may include possible genetic, psychological, and
biological susceptibility. Agent factors incorporate the
substance's abuse liability capacity, as well as how the
substance is marketed. Lastly, environmental factors encompass
not only the availability of the substance, but the social,
cultural, political, and economic climate as well (3,4). </p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, professionals within the field of
public health have attempted to deemphasize the strict medical
concept of substance abuse. Attention had previously focused
almost exclusively on individual drug use patterns, rather than
featuring the diverse problems of drug, alcohol, and tobacco use
as being intimately tied into communities and society as a whole.
</p>

<p>Even the term &quot;substance abuse&quot; has come under
scrutiny. While the word &quot;substance&quot; may at first
appear quite generic, in many fields, this term has come to
incorrectly infer illicit drug use--reinforcing the misperception
of many individuals that alcohol and tobacco are not drugs.
&quot;Abuse&quot; generally denotes the more severe forms of
addiction. In reality, there is a continuum that begins with
initial drug use and may progress to harmful use and addiction,
with various problems present along the spectrum. In lieu of the
term &quot;abuse,&quot; public health professionals prefer terms
such as &quot;alcohol and drug problems&quot; or the
&quot;harmful/hazardous use&quot; of a drug. </p>

<p>The focus of the public health perspective is to understand
the importance social norms, environment, and availability play
in the shaping of alcohol- and drug-related problems both on an
individual and societal level. </p>

<p>MEDICAL </p>

<p>Within the fields of medicine, the two most frequently cited
texts for the definitions of substance abuse and dependence are
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
issued by the American Psychiatric Association and the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) published by the
World Health Organization (WHO). Each successive version of the
DSM and ICD has been given a number signifying its order in the
overall sequence of manuals; DSM uses Roman numerals and ICD uses
ordinary numbers. The newest version of ICD, ICD-10, was
published in 1992. The current version of DSM is the Third
Edition- Revised (DSM-III-R), which will shortly be superseded by
DSM-IV. </p>

<p>ICD </p>

<p>While the current ICD and DSM definitions of substance
dependence are nearly identical, the two manuals differ sharply
on the concepts of abuse, which ICD classifies as harmful use. </p>

<p>The ICD manual is intended to be used on an international
basis, and the socially defined &quot;American&quot; criteria
present in the DSM manual for substance abuse cannot be
adequately transferred to a wide range of cultures. The current
ICD-10 category of harmful use, while applicable
cross-culturally, is limited to: &quot;A pattern of psychoactive
substance use that is causing damage to health. The damage may be
physical (as in cases of hepatitis from the self-administration
of injected drugs) or mental ( e.g.,episodes of depressive
disorder secondary to heavy consumption of alcohol).&quot; </p>

<p>DSM </p>

<p>In the early 1950s the first DSM manual grouped alcohol and
drug use disorders under the broad category of &quot;Sociopathic
Personality Disturbances.&quot; At that time, a substance use
disorder was considered a moral weakness or the manifestation of
a &quot;deeper&quot; psychological problem, rather than a
disorder in-and-of itself with social, psychological, and perhaps
even genetic determinants. </p>

<p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s clinical research identified
the need for separate categories for substance use disorders. The
DSM-III manual, in 1980, was the first manual in this series to
clearly identify substance abuse and dependence as pathological
conditions different from substance use alone. DSM-III also
alluded to the fact that social and cultural factors are
contributors to the onset and continuation of abuse and
dependence. The DSM-III definition of dependence emphasized
tolerance (needing to take much higher doses of the substance to
obtain the same effect) and withdrawal (having a distinct pattern
of physiological arousal upon abrupt discontinuation or reduction
in dosage), and required the presence of one or both of these
phenomena to make a dependence diagnosis. Substance abuse was
defined as problematic use with social or occupational
impairment, but with the absence of significant tolerance and/or
withdrawal. In both disorders, impairment in social and
occupational function was a prominent aspect of the definitions,
creating a significant overlap between the criteria for substance
abuse and dependence. In 1987, DSM-III was revised (DSM-III-R) to
give the behavioral aspects of substance use disorders equal
weight to the physiological components. </p>

<p>This shift away from the physiological to the behavioral
elements of dependence was strongly influenced by the work of
researchers Edwards and Gross, who had extensively studied
persons with alcohol problems. These researchers conceptualized
alcohol dependence as a syndrome of graded severity that involved
an interconnected complex of behavioral, psychological, and
physiological elements associated with loss of control over
alcohol consumption. </p>

<p>Contributing to the emphasis on behavioral aspects of
dependence was work by Brady, Thompson, and others who had shown
that animals can be taught to self-administer substances of
abuse. Once taught, it was observed that most animals will expend
tremendous amounts of energy to obtain additional doses and that
this &quot;drug-seeking behavior&quot; is very difficult to
extinguish. Efforts to repeat drug self- administration were
especially prominent if the experimental drug was one with a high
abuse liability such as morphine, methamphetamine, or
(especially) cocaine and was difficult to extinguish. </p>

<p>This body of work was among the first in a line of
investigation studying the behavioral aspects of drugs. This
field of research became known as &quot;behavioral
pharmacology&quot; and was strengthened by additional studies by
Olds and others. </p>

<p>Thus, both the work of Edwards and Gross, that of behavioral
pharmacologists, and of basic scientists pointed toward the
presence of a definable and independent syndrome that can result
after an organism has learned to self-administer abusable
substances. This syndrome was not dependent on the ability of the
drug to produce tolerance and withdrawal, but rather on its
positive reinforcing effects. These effects were evident by
observing the behavior of the organism, and could be measured by
quantifying the work that the organism would produce to obtain
the substance. </p>

<p>The development of the substance use disorders section for
DSM-IV began in 1988 and involved the most extensive process yet
undertaken for such a task. The major change in DSM-IV is in the
definition of substance abuse. Unlike DSM-III and DSM-III-R, DSM
-IV clearly separates the criteria for dependence from those of
abuse. Dependence in DSM-IV is a syndrome involving compulsive
use, with or without tolerance and withdrawal; abuse is
problematic use without compulsive use, significant tolerance, or
withdrawal. Preliminary data from the DSM-IV field trials
indicate that this change will probably increase the number of
persons diagnosed as having substance abuse, especially for those
using hallucinogens, inhalants, sedatives, and amphetamines. </p>

<p>Substance Use and the Transition to Abuse/Harmful Use or
Dependence </p>

<p>One problem in developing criteria for this second,
nondependent category, whether called abuse or harmful use, is
that though dependence has been well-studied, the progression
from use to abuse has not been adequately researched (except in
the case of alcohol); and depending on the perspective, may not
always be linear. For example, using the DSM-IV classifications,
it is possible that substances such as opiates may follow a path
that begins with use and progresses to dependence before
abuse-related problems are identified. Within the field of
alcohol research, the consensus of studies is that consuming
three to four standard-sized drinks/day by males (equal to 40 or
more grams of alcohol at 12 grams/drink) is associated with an
increased probability for the development of problems. As females
tend to absorb alcohol more quickly, studies have shown that
problems typically begin at about two to three drinks/day
(1,2,5). </p>

<p>Little work has been done on other substances. All persons who
end up with abuse, harmful use, or dependence begin with use. Use
of a substance, whether licit or illicit, does not constitute a
substance use disorder even though it may be unwise and strongly
disapproved of by family, friends, employers, religious groups,
or society at large. Use by itself is not considered a medical
disorder. For a disorder to be present, use must become something
else such as: occur more frequently; occur at higher doses; or
result in a magnitude of problems. Though there have been some
conceptual models developed for how one might approach a better
understanding of this transition, there are few data available to
clearly point out where the border lies. </p>

<p>DSM-IV AND ICD-10 DEFINITIONS </p>

<p>DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria: </p>

<p>Abuse </p>

<p>A. A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by
one or more of the following occurring over the same 12- month
period: </p>

<p>1. Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill
major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated
absences or poor work performance related to substance use;
substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from
school; neglect of children or household). </p>

<p>2. Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is
physically hazardous (e.g.,driving an automobile or operating a
machine when impaired by substance use). </p>

<p>3. Recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g.,arrests
for substance-related disorderly conduct). </p>

<p>4. Continued substance use despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated
by the effects of the substance (e.g.,arguments with spouse about
consequences of intoxication, physical fights). </p>

<p>B. Has never met the criteria for Substance Dependence for
this substance. </p>

<p>Dependence: </p>

<p>A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three or
more of the following occurring in the same 12- month period: </p>

<p>1. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: </p>

<p>a. need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to
achieve intoxication or desired effect </p>

<p>b. markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same
amount of the substance </p>

<p>2. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: </p>

<p>a. the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance </p>

<p>b. the same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve
or avoid withdrawal symptoms </p>

<p>3. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a
longer period than was intended </p>

<p>4. Any unsuccessful effort or a persistent desire to cut down
or control substance use </p>

<p>5. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to
obtain the substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving
long distances), use of the substance (e.g., chain- smoking), or
recover from its effects </p>

<p>6. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities
given up or reduced because of substance use </p>

<p>7. Continued substance use despite knowledge of having had a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is
likely to be caused or exacerbated by the substance (e.g.,
current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine- induced
depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that an
ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption) </p>

<p>Specify if: </p>

<p>o with physiological dependence: Evidence of tolerance or
withdrawal (i.e., either items (1) or (2) are present). </p>

<p>o without physiological dependence: No evidence of tolerance
or withdrawal i.e., neither items (1) nor (2) are present). </p>

<p>ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Clinical Use: </p>

<p>Harmful Use: </p>

<p>A pattern of psychoactive substance use that is causing damage
to health. The damage may be physical (as in cases of hepatitis
from the self-administration of injected drugs) or mental
(e.g.,episodes of depressive disorder secondary to heavy
consumption of alcohol). </p>

<p>The diagnosis requires that actual damage should have been
caused to the mental or physical health of the user. Harmful
patterns of use are often criticized by others and frequently
associated with adverse social consequences of various kinds. The
fact that a pattern of use or particular substance is disapproved
of by another person or by the culture, or may have led to
socially negative consequences such as arrest or marital
arguments is not in itself evidence of harmful use. </p>

<p>Acute intoxication or &quot;hangover&quot; is not in itself
sufficient evidence of the damage to health required for coding
harmful use. Harmful use should not be diagnosed if dependence
syndrome, a psychotic disorder, or another specific form of drug-
or alcohol-related disorder is present. </p>

<p>Dependence Syndrome </p>

<p>A definite diagnosis of dependence should usually be made only
if three or more of the following have been experienced or
exhibited at some time during the previous year: </p>

<p>1. A strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the
substance. </p>

<p>2. Difficulties in controlling substance-taking behavior in
terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use </p>

<p>3. A physiological withdrawal state when substance use has
ceased or been reduced, as evidenced by: the characteristic
withdrawal syndrome for the substance; or use of the same (or
closely related) substance with the intention of relieving or
avoiding withdrawal symptoms. </p>

<p>4. Evidence of tolerance such that increased doses of the
psychoactive substance are required in order to achieve effects
originally produced by lower doses (clear examples of this are
found in alcohol- and opiate-dependent individuals who may take
daily doses sufficient to incapacitate or kill nontolerant
users). </p>

<p>5. Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests
because of psychoactive substance use, increased amounts of time
necessary to obtain or take the substance or recover from its
effects. </p>

<p>6. Persisting with substance use despite clear evidence of
overtly harmful consequences, such as harm to the liver through
excessive drinking, depressive mood states consequent to periods
of heavy substance use, or drug- related impairment of cognitive
functioning; efforts should be made to determine that the user
was actually, or could be expected to be, aware of the nature and
extent of harm. </p>

<p>Narrowing of the personal repertoire of patterns of
psychoactive substance use has also been described as a
characteristic feature (e.g., a tendency to drink alcoholicdrinks
in the same way on weekdays and weekends, regardless of social
constraints that determine appropriate drinking behavior). </p>

<p>It is an essential characteristic of the dependence syndrome
that either psychoactive substance taking or a desire to take a
particular substance should be present; the subjective awareness
of compulsion to use drugs is most commonly seen during attempts
to stop or control substance use. This diagnostic requirement
would exclude, for instance, surgical patients given opioid drugs
for the relief of pain, who may show signs of an opioid
withdrawal state when drugs are not given but who have no desire
to continue taking drugs. </p>

<p>The dependence syndrome may be present for a specific
substance (e.g., tobacco or diazepam), for a class of substances
(e.g., opioid drugs), or for a wider ranger of different
substances (as for those individuals who feel a sense of
compulsion regularly to use whatever drugs are available and who
show distress, agitation, and/or physical signs of a withdrawal
state upon abstinence). </p>

<p>The diagnosis of the dependence syndrome may be further
specified by the following (the following roughly correspond to
the course modifiers and relapse section of DSM-IV): </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent. </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent, but in a protected environment (e.g.,
in hospital, in a therapeutic community, in prison, etc.). </p>

<p>o Currently on a clinically supervised maintenance or
replacement regime (controlled dependence, e.g., with methadone;
nicotine gum or nicotine patch). </p>

<p>o Currently abstinent, but receiving treatment with aversive
or blocking drugs (e.g., naltrexone or disulfiram). </p>

<p>o Currently using the substance (active dependence). </p>

<p>o Continuous use. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Episodic use. _ </li>
</ul>

Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Executive Summary<br>
</strong></font><font size="2"></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Redfern Legal Centre Drug Law Reform
Project began in mid 1994. Its objectives were to promote
informed public discussion about drug law reform, and to
contribute to bringing forward reform of the drug laws.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project's main achievements over the past
two years are:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Published discussion papers, fact sheets,
stickers and a poster promoting a range of initiatives to end the
current prohibition policy on currently illicit drugs and move
towards a model of controlled availability; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Convened a series of community forums in South
Sydney and Cabramatta on ways that drug laws impact on the work
of community and health organisations;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Held discussions with a number of NSW
Parliamentarians, including Ministers and their advisors;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Participated in several conferences and
seminars, including the International Conference on the Reduction
of Drug Related Harm Provided formal, detailed submissions to a
range of inquiries including the Wood Royal Commission into the
NSW Police Service and the Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory
Council (Pennington Committee).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This report includes two of the Project's most
significant publications:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Steps Towards Harm Reduction</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In addition, this report provides summaries of
comments on these publications from a diverse range of
organisations and individuals. The comments show that the Project
and its publications have made a significant contribution to the
debate about reform of the drug laws in NSW.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Future activities for the Redfern Drug Law
Reform Project are likely to include closer links to other
committees and organisations working on drug law reform in NSW
and other parts of Australia.<br>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">1 . History of Project</font><font size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Background</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">The Redfern Legal Centre Drug Law Reform
Project began in mid 1994. Its objectives were to promote
informed public discussion about drug law reform, and to
contribute to bringing forward reform of the drug laws.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre provided funding to pay
one part-time worker to coordinate the Project and to carry out
many of its tasks. The Project was oversighted by a small but
typically enthusiastic committee, which reported to the Centre's
Management Committee. The funding for the Project came (until
February 1996) from the Centre's own resources, primarily
litigation costs. From March until September 1996, the Project
was funded by a grant from the Law Foundation of NSW</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre undertook this Project for
several reasons:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. Drug prohibition fosters crime (because
prohibition artificially inflates prices for drugs on the black
market). Abandoning prohibition would be the simplest single way
to achieve a noticeable reduction in property crime, and to a
lesser but still important extent, violent crime.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Those affected by drug-inspired crime are
primarily the socially disadvantaged. Drug law reform is
desirable as a social equity measure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. Prohibition contributes to police
corruption. It is no accident that the clear majority of police
named adversely in evidence before the Wood Royal Commission into
police corruption are in some way connected to drugs - police
stealing drugs or money from drug suppliers, police selling
drugs, police planting drugs on suspects as false evidence.
Prohibition makes the drug trade so extravagantly profitable (it
is the second largest trade in the world) that it creates
enormous temptations for police and other officials. We cannot
hope to significantly reduce the opportunities for police
corruption while the drugs prohibition continues.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Prohibition has a significant negative
impact on the legal system. Dealing with people facing drug
charges, or charges of property crime generated by the drugs
black market, creates an enormous drain on the courts, and in
particular on public funds available to provide legal services
for the poor and disadvantaged. Reducing drug-related crime would
free up law enforcement resources for other activities, and would
improve the resource capacity of the Legal Aid Commission and
community legal services to pursue other matters, such as
consumer claims and antidiscrimination cases.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5. Public health outcomes are compromised by
laws which drive drug use underground. In particular, the drug
laws hamper efforts to contain the spread of HIV and Hepatitis B
and C.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6. Despite years of community debate and the
strength of the case for reform, prohibition has been fiercely
resilient . Reliance on the criminal law to control behaviour in
other areas of moral or personal choice gambling, sex work,
abortion, censorship - has generally receded in recent decades,
with the drug laws the notable exception. The demise of
prohibition is not as inevitable as it perhaps once appeared to
be.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We believe that meaningful reform of our drug
laws necessarily involves reconsidering the laws about supply as
well as possession and use of drugs, and laws about other drugs
as well as cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction is a pragmatic approach which
emphasises reducing the personal and social harms associated with
drug use, while accepting that eliminating drug use is
impossible. Harm reduction has been officially the central goal
of Australian drugs policy since the mid 1980s, although most
public resources devoted to the drug problem continue to promote
prohibition (eg, funds to police and customs services and
unrealistic, wholly negative drug education). We believe that
harm reduction (in any meaningful definition) is incompatible
with prohibition. The Project has attempted to develop coherent
harm reduction strategies, focusing on measures which would
reduce or eliminate the drugs black market. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Community Forums</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project convened a series of community
forums at which service providers in the health and community
sectors in particular were invited to identify, from their
perspective, the ways in which existing legal approaches to drugs
impacted on their work, and to identify which legal framework
could best support drug treatment and education programs. These
forums were held in both South Sydney, where the Legal Centre is
located, and in Cabramatta, Sydney's major heroin distribution
point. The discussion at these forums was invaluable in assisting
the Project to developing strategies and proposals for change.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Publications</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two discussion papers were written and
distributed in the course of the Project.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability, published in May 1995, attempted to tackle
concretely the question of what exactly drug law reform could
look like. Most previous proposals for law reform were either
inadequate (eg, the on-the spot fine model adopted in various
forms in South Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory), or
airy generalisations about the possibility of regulating or
deregulating the drugs market (with the idea of controlled
availability little more than a slogan). We considered it a
priority to do the work of systematically applying harm reduction
principles to all aspects of drug consumption, production and
distribution - in an open-minded but hopefully not fanciful way.
The Harm Reduction Model therefore represents a detailed
projection of what controlled availability might look like in
practice.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Harm Reduction Model was widely circulated
and was endorsed by a number of community organisations and
individuals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">An updated and expanded second edition of The
Harm Reduction Model was published in July 1996. Importantly, the
second edition included a set of Principles for Controlled Drug
Availability to complement the essentially practical proposals
illustrating some possible means of regulating drug supply and
consumption. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Project's other discussion paper was Steps
to Harm Reduction. A companion document to the Harm Reduction
Model, this paper addressed the present and short-term future. It
provided an analysis of the possible immediate steps which could
and should be taken in drugs policy and drug law reform. Again,
the value of the paper lay in its attempt to be detailed and
specific. The paper is a blueprint for reform, providing a list
of proposals to achieve a graduated replacement of prohibition
with harm reduction. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">These two papers form the major part of this
report.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project also produced:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two very popular bumper stickers (slogans End
Prohibition: Support Drug Law Reform and Break the Crime Cycle:
Support Drug Law Reform)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A full colour poster, a graphic presentation of
what the future of drugs policy might look like.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A series of Fact Sheets with statistics and
other information detailing the social impact of existing drug
laws. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Discussions with politicians</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Throughout the Project, we held discussions
with a number of NSW Parliamentarians, including Ministers and
their advisors. It must be said that the political climate proved
to be not conducive to change on drug policy, despite some early
encouraging if ambiguous statements from the incoming Carr
Government. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Issues discussed included many of the issues
dealt with in this report, including the desirability of
introducing a trial of legal safe injecting spaces, and a
possible Parliamentary motion on prioritising harm reduction in
drugs policy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Inquiries</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The Project also provided formal, detailed
submissions on proposals for law reform to the following
inquiries.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Wood Royal Commission into the NSW Police
Service</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory Council
(Pennington Committee)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commonwealth Access to Justice Inquiry.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Conference papers</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During the life of the Project, we participated
in a number of conferences and seminars. Perhaps the most
significant conference papers we presented were a paper in
September 1995 to the NSW Corrective Health Services Symposium on
Drug-Related Crime, and the two papers to the 7th International
Conference on the Reduction of Drug Related Harm, in Hobart in
March 1996. <br>

<p><font size="4">Beyond Prohibition</font><font size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">2. Steps To Harm Reduction<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Our existing drugs policy, grounded in
prohibition, is failing. Drug use continues at significant
levels, the drug trade continues to flourish, and the social
consequences of a thriving drugs black market - including
significant property crime and police corruption - continue to
cause concern.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We need to continue the process begun a decade
ago with the introduction of legal needle and syringe exchanges.
That is, we need to continue to shift the primary policy focus
from prohibition to harm reduction: to rely less on the criminal
law to discourage drug use and supply, and more on education,
treatment and research to make drug use as safe and responsible
as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Our current approach to drugs confuses legal
status with questions of safety. Both alcohol and marijuana are
widely used in social situations, both methadone and heroin are
highly addictive, both Prozac and ecstasy induce comparable
feelings of well-being. Yet the differing legal status of each of
these drugs skews social attitudes to their appropriate use, and
distorts accurate education messages about their effects and the
dangers of misuse.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There is a limit to the constructive harm
reduction measures which can be undertaken without changes to the
law. We have probably already reached the point at which the laws
criminalising drug use represent a real impediment to programmes
aimed at minimising the personal and social harm which can be
caused by drug use. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Reducing Drug-related Harm</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction means aiming at reducing the
harm that drugs can cause to users and to the broader community.
It involves accepting that drug use will never be eliminated,
even if we do not approve of it. Harm reduction should be the
standard against which we measure the success or failure of
existing drug laws, and proposals for change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre has proposed that in the
long term, we should implement a system of controlled
availability for most currently illicit drugs. The Centre's Harm
Reduction Model of Controlled Drug Availability sets out
principles for controlled availability which would produce the
greatest degree of harm reduction, and sketches some case studies
to illustrate what these principles might mean in practice.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In the immediate future, we should take some
less dramatic steps towards reducing drug related harm. Here we
outline some immediate steps we should take to implement harm
reduction principles in the short term.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Policy Objectives</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Although drugs policy could never be described
as uncontroversial, there is some common ground. Most would agree
that drugs policy should be framed in the context of health
objectives and social policy, not with the criminal law as the
starting point. Where drug use is problematic, it should be
addressed as a health issue, not a legal issue.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">What does this mean in concrete terms?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The changes we recommend here address what we
consider to be the most significant drug policy issues impacting
on public health. The particular objectives of the proposals made
here are </font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. To establish the legal environment for the
implementation of effective education and other health programs
to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce overdose deaths</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce the number of new Hepatitis C infections
associated with injecting drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">at least maintain (and if possible reduce)
existing low levels of new HIV infection through injecting drug
use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">improve the level of responsible disposal of
used needles</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Reduce socially harmful impact of criminal
justice system on users of currently illicit drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Taking the steps detailed below will not solve
all the problems associated with drug use. Change to the existing
legal framework must of necessity be made gradually. Once the
proposals for change outlined here are implemented and evaluated,
we can consider what further changes to drug law and policy are
necessary.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These measures would have only a small initial
impact on crime rates and police corruption. These social harms
result directly from the drug laws particularly laws about drug
supply. We need to move towards greater regulation of the drugs
market to enable us as a society to influence the size and
operation of the drugs market. Achieving the maximum public
health benefits will require regulatory control over matters such
as purity, weight, recommended dosages, and labelling.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The greatest source of social harm associated
with drugs is the black market. The black market, with its
extraordinary profits, fuels police corruption, and generates
property crime. And the black market is an unregulated market,
with no controls on drug quality, multiplying the dangers of drug
use. The enormous profits to be made will always draw a steady
stream of new entrepreneurs to the production and distribution of
drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The size of the black market is determined by
the laws we make about drug supply. While it is likely that we
will never be able to completely eliminate the drugs black
market, changes to the legal approach to drugs can reduce and
marginalise the negative social impact of a contracted illicit
market.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We must explore alternative strategies to
control the size of the black market, including considering
alternative changes to the law about supply. But we cannot
sensibly undertake that consideration without first resolving
legal and policy issues about use and possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Each of the measures outlined below would
represent an important step on the way to creating the legal
framework for a comprehensive harm reduction strategy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1 . Personal Use and Possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Penalising drug users for the activity of drug
use does little if anything to discourage drug-taking.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Criminalising drug using behaviour adds to the
social and personal burden on drug users without any
corresponding social benefit. The current laws force drug use
underground, compounding health problems and making it more
difficult to implement effective public health programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police drugs strategy states that police
resources should be directed towards drug traffickers and
large-scale suppliers, rather than drug users. However, the fact
is that 60% of drug matters prosecuted involve drug use or
possession offences.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because there is a distinct socioeconomic bias
in the manner in which different communities are policed, there
is a differential outcome in how these charges are laid. This
means that the drug laws impact unfairly on the poor, the
homeless, Aborigines and the young - disproportionately to their
actual patterns of usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Changing our approach to the legal treatment of
drug use would assist in HIV/Hepatitis C prevention by allowing
injecting drug users to access (and dispose of) new needles and
syringes without fear of police harassment. It would also remove
existing disincentives for drug users (such as marijuana smokers)
to openly discuss their use with doctors and other health
professionals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are a number of constructive alternatives
to the criminalisation of personal use and possession of drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The options are to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a. abolish the offences of use and possession;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">b. abolish the offence of self administration
only; and/or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We will briefly discuss the merits of these
alternative approaches.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The most straightforward solution is to remove
the offence of drug using and possession. That is, it would no
longer be a criminal offence to use an illicit drug, nor to
possess a small quantity for personal use (say 30 grams for
cannabis, 1 gram for heroin, amphetamine and other powders). In
order to minimise the number of cannabis users accessing the
black market, cultivation of up to five cannabis plants per
household should also be allowed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would remove the legal
obstacle to drug users seeking appropriate health care, including
the estimated 600,000 cannabis users in this State. It would
reduce fear of police harassment by injecting drug users
accessing needle and syringe exchanges and, especially,
contribute to responsible disposal of used needles. Because
possession of a used needle is evidence of the offence of drug
use, the law currently creates incentives to dispose of used
needles quickly rather than thoughtfully.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would be consistent
with existing police strategy which states that police resources
should be directed towards drug traffickers, not drug users.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because drug use (&quot;self
administration&quot;) and drug possession are separate offences
under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, it is possible to
remove the offence of use without any change to the law
prohibiting drug possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing the criminality of the act of using a
drug would improve the capacity of educators and researchers to
communicate in direct and plain terms with people about their
past and present levels of drug use, and use behaviours.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practical terms, it would mean that a person
who had recently consumed a drug but had no other drugs in their
possession, would be not subject to arrest or criminal charges.
This would encourage larger numbers of injecting drug users to
responsibly dispose of used needles and syringes, positively
contributing to reduction in new HIV and hepatitis infections,
and to community perceptions of public safety.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most self administration convictions result
from the person admitting having consumed a drug, without other
evidence (blood or urine tests are not undertaken to support
these charges). This law is selectively enforced against those
who are most vulnerable and least aware of their civil rights
(especially the right to silence).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the self administration provision is
withdrawn, there would remain ample legal power for the police to
control offensive or anti-social behaviour which might accompany
drug use. Appropriate community policing strategies would address
community concerns about unacceptable behaviour in public places
by people under the influence of illicit drugs, while also
achieving desirable public health and social equity results.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The alternative to legislative amendment is to
change how these laws are enforced. There are several ways in
which this might be done.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(i) Better directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The police have the discretion not to arrest or
lay a charge in a wide range of circumstances, subject to their
duty to protect the peace and to uphold the law. This exercise of
discretion applies in the enforcement of the drug laws. In
practice this means that many police officers choose, in many
circumstances, not to lay charges where they become aware of
minor drug offences. The anecdotal evidence is that the police
are increasingly exercising their discretion in this way, perhaps
especially with cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The exercise of police discretion in this way
is not only legitimate but desirable. It contributes positively
to public health outcomes, and reduces what would otherwise be a
literally intolerable burden on criminal justice resources if
every episode of drug use or possession which came to police
notice were prosecuted.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is desirable however that there be some
standardisation of this exercise of discretion, to achieve
greater uniformity of police practice (and therefore social
equity) and to better target particular public health objectives.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We propose that the Commissioner's Instructions
should be amended to give guidance to police on the exercise of
their discretion.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some suggestions are:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police guidelines should specifically
discourage arrest in overdose and similar medical emergency
situations, of either the overdose patient or their associates.
Knowing that there was no risk of arrest would encourage people
experiencing overdose, or their friends, to seek medical help as
early as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">People suffering overdose, or other physical or
psychological distress, should be able to access medical services
without fear of arrest. There are some 220 drug overdose
fatalities in NSW each year. Many of these deaths are
preventable. Studies show that one in three heroin users report
having had at least one overdose experience.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police should be encouraged not to harass
clients of methadone clinics, even if known drug users are likely
to congregate there. [This would be an extension of existing
guidelines which discourage police harassment of clients of
needle and syringe exchanges.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Existing Commissioner's Instructions
(Instruction 16.02), say that police should not interrupt
injection, nor deliberately break syringes. In fact, these
practices still occur. Relevant police instructions should be
made the subject of training and greater management direction.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The Police Service should undertake a
comprehensive examination of its practices and protocols as they
impact on drugs policy. The fact that there are existing
Commissioner's Instructions which are not being applied raises
questions about the capacity of the Police Service to respond
flexibly and appropriately in this area, in the absence of
legislative reform. If measures are taken to develop the
application of police discretion in drugs policy, it must be
closely monitored to assess the degree of compliance with
guidelines. If this approach does not significantly improve the
current negative impact of law enforcement on effective drugs
policy, the only alternative is to legislate change to laws.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The recent Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory
Council Report (the Pennington Report) recommended that the use
and possession of illicit drugs be dealt with through a system of
automatic formal police cautions for first offenders (with
voluntary referral to drug assessment and treatment services).
Mandatory good behaviour bonds would be imposed as a sentence for
second offenders. Third offenders would be dealt with by a court
in the normal way (ie, by decision of the magistrate to impose
fines, community service orders, or other appropriate penalty).</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">A mandatory caution/bond system for drug use
and possession offences would make police contact with drug users
less negative than it is now (except for repeat offenders), and
would allow law enforcement to be accompanied by referral to
treatment or counselling services in appropriate cases.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If introduced, this system should be closely
monitored for its effect on the number and type of cases brought
before the courts. (It should be noted that introducing a system
of police referral to drug treatment services may result in an
increased demand for those services, which are now significantly
under-researched.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some jurisdictions (South Australia, the
Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory) have
introduced a system of on-the-spot fines as a method of
&quot;decriminalising&quot; the personal use and possession of
marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Since this system was implemented in South
Australia in 1987, there has been a 450% increase in the number
of fine notices issued (although research shows that marijuana
usage has increased only slightly, in line with increases in
other States). Half of the 18,000 people issued with notices last
year did not pay their fine on time, exposing them to the risk of
arrest, prosecution and incurring a criminal record.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practice therefore, this initiative has
actually increased the cost of police and court time devoted to
marijuana law enforcement.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the ACT and NT, it is too early to say
whether there will be a similar escalation in the number of
notices issued. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are few apparent advantages in adopting
this measure. The other alternatives offer either more complete
and systematic solutions, or the opportunity for more flexible
policing practices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"> Remove prison as a sentencing option for
drug use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
not abolished, then at the least, imprisonment should be removed
as an available sentencing option.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prison sentences are a completely inappropriate
penalty for minor drug possession and use offences. Imprisonment
has never been evaluated for its effects on drug use or
possession recidivism, although anecdotal evidence suggests that
it does not deter ongoing drug use. Research into the question
should be encouraged.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">About 150 people are gaoled each year in NSW
for drug use or possession of small quantities of drugs. In 1995
(the most recent figures available), there were 62 people gaoled
for use or possession of marijuana, 61 were gaoled for use or
possession of heroin, and 44 were gaoled for use or possession of
other drugs. Although custodial sentences of up to eight months
were imposed, the period of imprisonment for most was less than
two months. In relative terms, these prison terms would be
considered short. However, considering the minor nature of the
offences and prevailing social attitudes, they are
extraordinarily harsh. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">3 . Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
removed, there is no need for separate treatment for those who
use cannabis for genuinely therapeutic purposes. However, if
those offences remain, an exception should exist for the medical
applications of cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis in smokable form is a valuable
alternative to other medical treatments for people living with
AIDS and for some cancer and glaucoma patients. It is useful for
nausea and pain relief, and to stimulate appetite. Smokable
cannabis is now used in the community for these purposes without
recognition, support or medical supervision.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Synthetic cannabis products in tablet form are
available on prescription, but they are not satisfactory. They
are expensive and reported to be less effective in achieving the
desired therapeutic results. Many patients who smoke marijuana to
control nausea are unable to swallow tablets. For some conditions
(eg, weight loss associated with AIDS), there are no effective
alternatives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As well, numerous people living with hepatitis
use cannabis as a social alternative to alcohol.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4 Allow possession of drug equipment as well as
needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Possession of equipment intended for use of
prohibited drugs is illegal - needles and syringes are the only
exception. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is anomalous to publicly fund the
distribution of needles and syringes, but not to allow the
possession of swabs, sterile water and tourniquets for the
purpose of using illegal drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Allowing the legal possession of all
intravenous drug using equipment would assist in HIV prevention.
It would also assist in preventing Hepatitis C infection, which
often results from sharing equipment other than needles and
syringes., and it would assist in holistic harm reduction (eg,
using sterile water to reduce the risk of injecting bacteria
which can cause a range of illnesses).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The sale and possession of bongs for the
smoking of cannabis is also illegal even though using a bong is
probably less harmful than smoking cannabis cigarettes. Further
research should be undertaken into the relative physical harms of
different methods of consuming cannabis (eg, in cigarettes,
through bongs, or in foods).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legalising the sale and possession of cannabis
smoking equipment would assist education strategies aimed at
encouraging cannabis users to use in relatively safe ways.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">5 . Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legal safe injecting spaces (or &quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) would considerably reduce the harm associated with
injecting drug use in public places like parks and laneways. Safe
injecting spaces could reduce drug overdose deaths, and should
also reduce the number of used syringes unsafely disposed of in
public places. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Publicly funded, safe injecting spaces should
be introduced on a trial basis in areas of existing high
intravenous drug use. The trial should be conducted over two
years, with an initial review after six months.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Potential benefits include:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Reduction in injecting drug use in public
places (such as parks and laneways), with the consequent public
health dangers posed by used needles being left in those places.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Improved access and personal safety for
ambulance officers and other health workers treating overdoses.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The difficulty with introducing such a trial is
that the authorities are wary of funding, even tolerating,
facilities at which people would break the law (ie by self
administration). We have made a number of suggestions above about
reform of the law, or at least law enforcement practices, around
drug use and possession. Introducing any of those proposals would
clear the way legally for the introduction of safe injecting
spaces.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal for safe injecting spaces is a
logical extension of existing needle and syringe exchange
programs. The legal framework to allow shooting rooms to operate
(in the absence of more far-reaching changes to the law), would
be similar to the arrangements for needle and syringe exchange
programs, namely: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">legislative amendment to make it not an offence
to inject a prohibited drug on site at an approved safe injecting
place (at least for the duration of a trial);</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">instructions to police to not harass the
clients of the facilities (just as existing instructions direct
police to not harass needle exchange clients)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">statutory amendment to protect workers in safe
injecting places from prosecution for aiding and abetting
offences. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Narcan is an anti-narcotic used to revive
people in the event of narcotic overdose. It has no pleasurable
effects, and no effect on someone who has not used heroin or
other narcotics. Wider availability of Narcan has been
recommended by researchers at the National Drug and Alcohol
Research Centre as an effective way to reduce fatal heroin
overdoses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If Narcan were to be made more readily
available, it should be accompanied by an appropriately targeted
education campaign to ensure that Narcan is understood to be a
first aid measure only. The person revived from the overdose by a
shot of Narcan requires further medical attention, involving
either calling an ambulance or attendance at a hospital.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">FUTURE CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The implementation of these proposals should be
followed by continuing attention to laws and programmes which
impact adversely on public health and other social programmes.
Relevant government agencies should undertake a comprehensive
review to identify which laws require amendment to further reduce
drug related harm. Key agencies to be involved in such a review
are the Departments of Health, Attorney-General's, Police, and
School Education.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the longer term, the nature and pace of
further changes to drug law and policy will need to be considered
and debated.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Implementing some or all of the above proposals
would significantly improve public health outcomes. Making these
changes would allow the community to decide whether and how to
take further steps.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We should begin now, in a measured way, to
explore and implement workable alternatives to the failure of
drugs prohibition. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">3. Comments on Steps to Harm Reduction</font><font
size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A version of the Steps towards Harm Reduction
section of this report was provided to people and organisations
with expertise or interest in the area of drugs policy and drugs
law, together with a questionnaire (see Appendix 2) seeking
comments on the paper.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were sought from 55 individuals and
organisations (see Appendix 1). Written responses were received
from 21 respondents and eight responses were obtained by
interview (29 responses in all). Given the low response rate and
the ways that respondents were selected, this survey is not
designed to provide research evidence about support for or
against changes to drug laws. However, the responses allow us to
see where support appears to be forming and what areas continue
to be the subject of intense debate.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were received from the following
individuals and organisations. Organisations are listed when they
provided an organisational response: otherwise the individuals
listed spoke only in a personal capacity and not on behalf of any

<p><font size="2">Major Brian Watters</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ken Marslew</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Angela and Tony Wood Dr Peter B Paisley</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(Total responses do not always add up to 29
because some respondents did not answer all questions and some
gave overall support or opposition, rather than provide details
on specific points.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Do you support some change in the legal current
approach to personal use and possession?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">All respondents agreed that some change was
necessary. The overwhelming majority favoured change in the
direction of some liberalisation of existing legal approaches.
One respondent supported change in the form of higher penalties
for use and possession offences. One supported additional
intervention (eg, education) as well as police intervention.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There is (and has been for decades)
overwhelming evidence that the current system not only does not
work but is cataclysmically harmful.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Supported] for cannabis use/possession
only. Population use of cannabis has reached the point where
prohibition does more harm than good.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Counterproductive and contrary to
principles of harm minimisation and National Drugs Strategy to
criminalise users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Should be less criminal records for these
offences, shorter time for expungement of criminal records.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It is important to note that almost all
respondents support some change, as one of the findings of this
process is that views are polarised on the points contained in
the Steps Towards Harm Reduction. While most respondents
supported the need for changes in all of the areas covered by the
document, several respondents opposed most such changes. Those
generally in favour of change included some church groups,
doctors, lecturers, researchers, drug educators, drug treatment
staff and community based organisations. Those generally opposed
included some church groups, doctors association, drug treatment
staff and some community members.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Several respondents chose to write letters in
support of their general position. These general comments
included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Issues of dependency could be more easily
addressed and the transmission of blood borne viruses could be
more efficiently reduced by taking the Steps Towards Harm
Reduction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Too much attention is focused on the
question of whether the present system of drug prohibition is
working. In my view, the answer is clearly that prohibition is
not working ... But accepting that prohibition has failed is not
enough. Whether we should get rid of it depends on what we can
come up with as a replacement. Criminal law is not the only means
of regulation nor is its central presence in drug control
strategy inevitable ... The real choice is about what type of
state control is to replace prohibition as the dominant
strategy.&quot; (original emphasis)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The case here tends to be overstated by
extrapolations and generalisations ... There cannot be a blanket
approach to encouraging safe and responsible drug use ... There
is no clear evidence that either more restrictive or more liberal
policies have achieved significant impact on the prevalence of
illicit drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The (United Nations) conventions do
reflect consensus and, with the problem of substance misuse,
there has to be a line drawn somewhere. I believe that drug law
reform, at its worst, acts to destroy all the lines and to leave
only confusion to those who desperately seek direction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents supported this change, six
were opposed, three were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a victimless crime. What you do to
yourself in the privacy of your own home is no-one's
business.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[The current law is] counterproductive
socially and economically.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It would equal approval - a message that
drug use is OK.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There needs to be community consultations
before progress can occur.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal to abolish the offence of self
administration only was not included in the questionnaire
completed by respondents. However, one response noted that the
most recent Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy meeting had
resolved to form a Working Party of the National Drug Strategy
Committee to examine the self administration laws in every
jurisdiction. This Working Party is chaired by Mr Neil Bridge of
the NSW Police Service.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices (i) Better
directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The version of the paper circulated for comment
did not include this section, so most respondents did not have
the opportunity to comment on the proposals. The proposals were
discussed with a small number of respondents, who indicated some
support. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal Police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents favoured this proposal,
three were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Among the supporters, two indicated broad
support for the concept, but disagreement with the details
proposed. Two supporters expressed the view that this proposal
was a poor alternative to the repeal of the offences. Another
advocated this approach before considering legislative amendment
at a later time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Police contact, if it is a deterrent,
would be just as effective with a caution or bond as with a
harsher penalty.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Diversion of users away from criminal
charges should be used wherever possible. Unfortunately [the
Department of] Health does not resource sufficient treatment or
counselling services. Magistrates cannot refer if there are no
services. Neither can police.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Less intrusive and punitive. Gives some
option for the individual&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It should remain a court matter, but with
no convictions recorded.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, with another one &quot;half in favour&quot; and 15
opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The respondent who was partially in favour
suggested that the South Australian experience was not a fair
test of the effectiveness of this approach because the law there
does not allow the police to demand identification. This
respondent suggested a variation on the proposal, with no fines
or other police attention for amount of less than 25 grams (for
cannabis), and fines for quantities in the range of 25 grams to,
say, 100 grams.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Although I favour legalisation, on the
spot fines may be a half way house&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Fines are overused as a sanction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They would just fill up the fines yards
and periodic detention centres.&quot; &quot;It is too difficult,
apparently, to prevent net-widening.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">V) Other suggestions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were invited to make other
suggestions for legal change concerning personal use and
possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Six respondents offered comments.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Policing priorities (I guess goes with
(b)) Licensing of IV users (?), pot smokers(?)&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some process for referral for assessment
for treatment/ rehabilitation. Need to look at withdrawing
driving licences, eg for methadone patients.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Let people grow what they like. Let the
market place sort it out. Supply good quality seed - kill the
black market. Keep it cheap. Get away from needles.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Referral options - jobs - safe
housing.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Legalise heroin and cannabis.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Continue education and encouragement of
non-use, and not starting to use: eg, experiment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Remove prison as a sentencing option for drug
use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents were in favour of this
proposal, and four were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two of those in favour of this change supported
the establishment of secure, custodial rehabilitation facilities
for some drug users as an alternative to prison.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What's the point of putting users in
gaol?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Yes] But it should be seldom if ever
used.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Minimise or modify prison sentence,
deviation/direction to rehabilitation or treatment agencies when
possible.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3 Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, three were opposed. One of those in favour supported
cannabis for medical purposes on prescription only.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Even if it is only a third rate drug -
why not allow some people to benefit?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannabis in smokable form is not the best
available treatment for patients suffering from any
illness.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;For some conditions (eg, AIDS related
weight loss), there is no good alternative.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Allow possession of drug equipment as well
as needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nineteen respondents favoured the proposal
(including one who supported legal change for bongs, but was
uncertain about injecting equipment), four were opposed. One of
those opposed to this proposal thought that a new offence should
be introduced for irresponsible disposal of used needles and
syringes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Don't want to encourage drug use.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a proven public health
success.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Present situation is patently
ludicrous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5 Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, five were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Definitely. Works towards increased safe
disposal (by centralising use), decrease in overdoses (monitored
use), takes away IV use from public facilities like public
toilets, provision of counselling, health monitoring. High
priority change.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Safe for whom? These could assist in
collection of used needles which a good thing. If illegal
supplies of drugs which are being trafficked, these may prove
unsafe for users.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Socially unworkable. The practicalities
of their location and operation are enormous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannot assume beneficial public health
effect especially if current prohibitions remain in place. Also
have to ensure that such places are truly 'safe' and clients are
free from identification and police harassment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What about non-metro towns? They may need
them more.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eleven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, four were against. Most others were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;This is well supported in research. There
are practical difficulties with its availability. Needs to be
worked on rather than talked about!&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't want to see kids die.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;100% for it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I'm not sure about this, but I suppose I
should logically support it.&quot;<br>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>4. Harm Reduction Model of Controlled
Drug Availability (Second Edition)</strong></font><font size="5"><strong>
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">This paper is in two Parts. Part A sets out
Principles which should apply to the social and legal management
of currently illicit drugs. Part B provides some examples of how
these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.
Individuals and organisations are invited to endorse the
Principles of Controlled Availability contained in this proposal.
(An earlier version of this paper was published in May 1995.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART A: PRINCIPLES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Preamble</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes enormous social damage
including: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Vastly increased drug-related property crime by
drug users to pay prices inflated by the black market</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Law enforcement costs to apprehend drug users
and sellers, and those who commit drug-related crime, and
increased costs and delays in the court system to process these
cases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Corruption flourishing at all levels and in
many forms: profits are so great that few police or other
officials are able to resist the enormous sums offered as bribes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Violent crime developing from supplier
competition </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thousands of Australians jailed for drug
related crimes, leading to increased costs for corrective
services and the need for more jails</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition contributes to the spread of HIV
and other blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis B and C in the
following ways:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle sharing among injectors of some
currently illicit drugs can spread these infections: many drug
users begin to inject to receive the greatest effect from the
smallest quantity of the expensive drug</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some users of illicit drugs are forced into
high-risk forms of sex to pay for drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle and syringe supply programs are
difficult to establish and operate under regular threat of
closure, despite significantly reducing the spread of HIV and
other blood-borne diseases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Unsafe disposal of used needles and syringes
increases because drug injectors believe that police will use
these articles as the basis for prosecution</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug injectors sent to prison continue to use
drugs but have virtually no means to protect themselves from
infection </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Laws prohibiting certain drugs have driven
users of currently illicit drugs from their social support
networks, making it hard to reach them with education messages
about protecting themselves and others from infection</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users (encouraged by
prohibition) has led most Australians to care little what happens
to drug users </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes damage to the health of drug
users (and consequently increases health costs to society) by:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Users paying black market prices for drugs,
leading to increasing malnutrition and other health deficits
related to poverty</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Adulterants and inconsistent drug type or dose
(caused by unregulated manufacturing due to prohibition) causing
health damage, overdose and death among users of currently
illicit drugs </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users leads to lower
self esteem and decreases motivation for self-care</font> </p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Goals of Rational Drug Policy</strong></font><font
size="4"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Drug policy should:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Have realistic goals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Take account of the different patterns and
types of harms caused by specific drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be shown to be effective or be changed</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Separate arguments about the consequences of
drug use from arguments about morals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be developed in the light of the costs of
control as well as the benefits</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ensure that the harms caused by the control
regimes themselves do not outweigh the harms prevented by them</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Recognise the existence of multiple goals, but
ensure that contradictory goals are minimised</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We believe that this proposal achieves each of
these policy objectives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The specific goals of this proposal are to
simultaneously reduce the size and profits of the illicit drug
market by the greatest amount; and provide the greatest level of
harm reduction for users of currently illicit drugs; and minimise
the number of users of these drugs who experience problems
related to their drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Defining Harm Reduction</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;harm reduction&quot; to
mean: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A policy or programme directed towards reducing
the adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug use
to the community and to the individual user, even though the user
may continue to use psychoactive drugs at this time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction policies and programmes must be
part of a public health approach to managing drug use. Protecting
the health of the community must include protecting the health of
drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles of Controlled Availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Applying these policy goals under the above
definition of harm reduction, we propose that a system of
controlled availability of currently illicit drugs be introduced.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Such a system should have the following
principles as its key elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. The use and possession of currently illicit
drugs should be made legal, in an environment of controlled
availability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. The regulated manufacture, supply and sale
of selected drugs should be allowed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. The drugs selected for controlled
availability should include cannabis, heroin, amphetamine,
ecstasy and anabolic steroids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. The drugs selected for should be made
available either:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Over the counter from licensed premises in
specified (generally low) dosages of known purity, clearly
labelled with ingredients shown; or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5. The age limit for the regulated supply of
currently illicit drugs should be the same as it is for alcohol.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">6. Advertising and marketing should be the
minimum necessary (eg, for brand identification) to ensure that
non-users are not attracted into drug use by marketing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">7. Prices of regulated drugs should be set so
that least harmful forms of the drug (usually lower dosages) are
substantially less costly than more harmful forms of the drug.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">8. Users must demonstrate adequate knowledge
about the effects of the drug they intend to purchase, and about
safe usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9. Profits earned from the commercial
production or supply of drugs should be taxed. Revenues obtained
from taxes and licence fees must be applied (in whole or in large
part) to education, and to treatment for those drug users who
want it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">10. Controlled availability should operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) education in which doctors and other health
professionals, licensed drug sellers and drug users all
participate in baseline and follow-up education based on valid
research; and</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) widespread, easily accessible treatment for
drug-related problems, with funding to be provided to a wide
variety of non-coercive options for positive change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11. The prescription system should have the
following characteristics:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Appropriate criteria for a drug to be
prescribed to an individual would be: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">i. regular frequent use (usually daily);</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. clear evidence of dependence;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. continued use having a severe effect on
lifestyle;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. the harms associated with non-prescribed
use being significantly greater than those associated with
prescription. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">b) A variety of forms for oral, smokable or
injectable use be made available, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose. Users must also have access to
appropriate drug using equipment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">C) Users of the prescription system be
registered. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">d) The prescription system would operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Harm reduction and full consumer
participation.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Entry assessment to ensure that the
individual wants to be maintained on the drug: this assessment
must be carried out by a trained, qualified drugs worker and must
include a full and frank discussion of the likely consequences of
a range of options including maintenance, detoxification,
selective detoxification, and controlled using.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. Options for dispensing which may include:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacy dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug clinic dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Home delivery or mobile van for long-term
illness, palliative care or isolated individuals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) in areas with a high concentration of drug
injectors, especially those who are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. Reasonable cost to the consumer. Services
to clients on low incomes would be delivered through the public
health system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART B: CASE STUDIES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this Part we propose some concrete examples
of how these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We do not suggest that the proposals in this
Part describe the only possible application of these principles.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Cannabis</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;cannabis&quot; to refer
to the complete range of cannabis products including marijuana,
hashish resin and oil, and other preparations, as well as
industrial hemp. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow up to 10 cannabis
plants for personal use. It would be legal to consume cannabis
products or to possess up to 50 grams (dry weight) of cannabis
for personal use. It would be legal to supply in small quantities
(up to 50 grams) to people aged 18 and over for no payment.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow larger quantities of
cannabis under licence to a State Government Office of Drug
Revenue (ODR). Officially sanctioned cannabis growers would be
allowed to sell their products to cannabis shops or Kafes, or to
manufacturers of other cannabis products such as biscuits and
cakes, rope, paper, textiles, etc. A regulation system would
ensure that grades of cannabis (principally by THC content) are
adhered to, providing quality assurance for end users. A
differential tax could operate with different grades being
subject to different tax.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A system of cannabis Kafes would be established
for retail sales of cannabis, both for consumption on the
premises and for take-away consumption to people aged 18 and
over. A range of cannabis products from rolled cigarettes to
biscuits might be available, together with smoking implements
designed to reduce the level of harm associated with smoking
cannabis products (eg bongs).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other retailers (eg tobacconists) would be
licensed to sell take away cannabis products. Cannabis seeds, and
information about home cultivation, would also be available.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial cannabis suppliers would be required
to label their products with consumer information concerning
weight, THC content, recommended dosage, and approved health
warnings. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of cannabis would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prices for cannabis products should be
comparable with prices of alcoholic spirits. Prices should be set
to encourage users to eat cannabis products rather than smoke.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Sales to people under 18 and unlicensed (ie
untaxed) sales would be illegal.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Advertising and marketing of cannabis products
would be restricted to the minimum necessary (eg for brand
identification). It might include a statement outside and inside
Kafes that &quot;cannabis products are sold here&quot;, or
perhaps a discrete symbol indicating availability of cannabis
products.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis smoking would be banned in places
where tobacco smoking is banned.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A realistic education campaign about the
hazards of using cannabis, concentrating on safe cannabis use,
&quot;dope-driving&quot;, the effects of both shortterm and
chronic use, and the use of cannabis and alcohol together, would
be carried out at regular intervals. The cost of this campaign
and ongoing campaigns directed at school students, homeless and
working youth and visitors to the State would be paid for by tax
revenues from cannabis sales. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Revenues from taxes and licence fees would be
used to administer the regulatory system and to provide education
and treatment services through services funded by the Health
Department. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of cannabis, unless further research proves that
cannabis does not impair driving ability. Research should be
conducted to determine what (if any) level of cannabis
intoxication would not adversely affects drivers' ability.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
cannabis. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Heroin &amp; other opioids</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this section, we refer to heroin and other
currently illicit opioids such as opium, as well as currently
restricted drugs such as methadone.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use heroin and all
currently illicit opioid products, and to possess small
quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to supply, manufacture
or traffic in currently illicit opioid drugs except as follows:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Opiated teas, tinctures, tonics and other
products, clearly showing the percentage of opioid per volume
would be manufactured under licence to a State Government Office
of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold through pharmacies to people over
the age of 18. All ingredients of these products would be listed
on their packaging. Taxes raise from the sale of these products
would be used to fund treatment and education programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Smokable opium and heroin would be manufactured
under licence to the ODR and sold in pharmacies to people over
the age of 18, together with smoking implements designed to
reduce the level of harm associated with opium and heroin smoking
(ie. smoke cooling equipment such as hookahs and long pipes).
Prices of these products would be set so that they would:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(a) encourage opium use over heroin use, but
which</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(b) encourage opioid smoking over opioid
injecting. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sales of these products would be in small
quantities only (enough for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes
raised from sales would be used to fund treatment and education
programs, and to subsidise the prescription system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription (see below).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of opiated products, opium
and heroin would be regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the
police. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of heroin and other opioids would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
opioid products except for the minimum necessary for brand
identification. Realistic education materials would be available
in a range of formats to opioid product buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of opiate-related problems, assessment of
these problems, and referral for assistance via prescribed
opioids, drug treatment or other help as negotiated with the
consumer. Part of this training would be in obtaining information
from new buyers about their level of knowledge of opioid use, and
ensuring that new buyers especially have access to appropriate
education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of heroin or other opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Prescription</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">The prescribing system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or believe
that they are dependent on a drug). Such a prescription system
would have the following as its essential elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should have as its core values harm
reduction and full consumer participation. The system should have
an entry assessment to ensure that the individual wants to be
maintained on an opioid drug. Assessment must be carried out by a
trained, qualified drugs worker. A full and frank assessment of
the likely consequences of a range of options including
maintenance, detoxification, selective detoxification, controlled
using, etc should be negotiated with the individual.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should make available a
choice of the five most popular opioid drugs in a variety of
forms for oral or injectable use, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose when they so desire.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To avoid &quot;double&quot; prescribing, a
computerised register would be kept of the dependent person's
name, address, preferred drug(s) and maximum dose(s).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Options for dispensing should also be
negotiated. They may include: Pharmacy dispensing Drug clinic
dispensing Home delivery for long-term illness or palliative
care. Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting rooms&quot;) in areas
with a high concentration of drug injectors, especially those who
are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should be costed at a reasonable fee
to the consumer. Services to clients on low incomes should be
delivered through the public health system. Operating costs will
be supplemented by some of the revenues from the ODR.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
heroin and opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Amphetamine</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume amphetamine and to
possess small quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to manufacture, supply
or traffic in currently amphetamine except as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amphetamine would be manufactured under licence
to a State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold in
pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Prices of these products
would be set so that they are much higher than cannabis products.
Sales of amphetamine would be in small quantities only (enough
for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes on sales would be used
to fund treatment and education programs and to subsidise that
prescription program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of amphetamine would be
regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the police.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of amphetamine would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Realistic education materials would be
available in a range of formats to amphetamine buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
amphetamine except for strictly limited brand identification.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
amphetamine. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of amphetamine.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of amphetamine-related problems,
assessment of these problems, and referral for assistance via
prescribed amphetamine, drug treatment or other help as
negotiated with the consumer. Part of this training would be in
obtaining information from new buyers about their level of
knowledge of stimulant use, and ensuring that new buyers
especially have access to appropriate education materials.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or who
believe they are dependent on a drug). Such a system should have
the same essential elements as the opioid prescribing system
described above.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Ecstasy</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume ecstasy and to
possess up to 2 grams or 10 tablets.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ecstasy may be manufactured and sold under
licence in pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Licences to
manufacturers, distributors and pharmacists would be issued by a
State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacists licensed to sell ecstasy would be
required to complete suitable training in the pharmacological
effects of MDMA. Part of this training would in obtaining
information from new buyers about their level of knowledge of
ecstasy use, and ensuring that new buyers especially have access
to appropriate education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings. Ecstasy should
be manufactured for sale in standardised doses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of ecstasy would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Rave parties would be allowed subject to
promoters obtaining a licence. To qualify for a licence,
promoters must demonstrate that arrangements have been made to
provide adequate supplies of free water, chill out rooms, and
other appropriate health measures. [If a significant black market
persists, it may be necessary to have a pharmacologist on-site to
analyse tablets and powders on the request of patrons.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Health information should be made available in
appropriate formats at places where ecstasy use is predictable
(eg raves). This information would include advice to drink
adequate water and to rest and cool down regularly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Anabolic Steroids</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Steroids represent a separate and different
phenomenon of drug use to traditional psychoactive drugs. The
relationship between effect desired and effect obtained is
specific, and has less to do with the social and environmental
context of drug use. A harm reduction approach to steroid use
would include medical supervision of training and diet, as well
as psychological and physical monitoring (such as testing for
liver and kidney function). </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use or possess small
quantities of anabolic steroids, provided the user holds a
current prescription from a medical practitioner authorising
their use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prescriptions may be issued for a maximum
single period of one month. Prescriptions could be renewed only
after consultation with the prescriber.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training in the physical and psychological
effects of steroid use would be provided to those medical
practitioners who wish to be steroid prescribers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Education campaigns should be undertaken aimed
at encouraging steroid users to moderate the quantities and
dosages used, and to use steroids only under medical supervision.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Research should continue into the physical and
psychological effects of use of anabolic steroids, especially
long term use. The results of this research should be promoted
widely among steroid users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sporting organisations would be able to
continue to ban steroid users from competition, and to test
competitors for steroid use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
anabolic steroids.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>5 Comments on the Harm Reduction Model</strong></font><font
size="5"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were asked to comment in broad
terms about the desirability of controlled availability, and
about the Principles for Controlled Availability outlined in the
paper. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were received from the same group
under the same conditions outlined in Chapter 3.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>General remarks</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">General comments on the Model included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I would argue that we need to examine
specific regulatory options in terms of their potential for harm
minimisation and, in particular, to assess the relationship
between drug-related harm and particular forms of markets and
systems of distribution. As Nicholas Dorn and Nigel South have
recently suggested in the UK context, we need to ask: 'What sort
of markets do we least dislike, and how can we adjust the control
mix so as to push markets in the least undesired (harmful)
direction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some of the specific goals proposed for
rational drug policy have still to be tested. The means of
implementing controls on age, advertising and marketing, and
adequate knowledge about safe use are unknown. There should
certainly be a framework of treatment for drug related problems.
The prescription system is untested, as is the assessment
process.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I wish to endorse (the Model's) contents,
especially the point that prohibition has had no positive
results. I am not competent to suggest any amendments except to
add that I was a registered nurse for about thirty-five
years.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, the (Model) goes much
further than the harm minimisation principles of the National
Drug Strategy, to the point of having few controls on
availability at all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;In general, harm reduction strategies
presuppose the impossibility of addressing the undesirable
behaviour and hence direct attention to the consequences. What is
not clear, in my mind, is how we define the I undesirable
behaviour' with which we are dealing. In other words, is drug use
a cause or result of other social or behavioural problems?&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Controlled availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Should we adopt a &quot;controlled
availability&quot; approach in the long term as the best policy
direction for currently illicit drugs?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Fourteen were in favour of the concept of
controlled availability as outlined in the paper, six were
against.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, because it's sensible.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;(Controlled availability) is needed as
the next step in harm minimisation.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We need education about drug effects, and
research too. Controlled availability provides a means both of
generating data and of informing users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Sends the wrong message to young
people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, provided that: it is
researched for each drug group research is open and rigorous only
move to next group if research is favourable&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Controlled availability as defined seems
more like 'uncontrolled availability' when over-the-counter
options are included. All drugs with a medical purpose that can
help people with an addiction problem should be available on
prescription, but not over-the-counter.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Can't answer for all drugs at this stage.
Support idea for cannabis.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I am unconvinced as to the merits of a
'blanket' approach to controlled availability. More convinced as
to the merits of controlled availability of cannabis, perhaps
ecstasy, and favour prescribing system for heroin.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Internal consistency</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Is the Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability internally coherent? For example, are the principles
consistent with the stated goals?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seventeen said yes, four said no.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Good effort in putting all this together
... the way you've done it contains a lot of common sense.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't think the mechanisms of
controlled availability have been spelt out in enough detail to
make a judgment about harm minimisation for all drugs.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They're the best considered proposals
I've yet seen coming from an Australian source ... May these
proposals enjoy wide readership.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Raises all the right questions which need
to be addressed. The current system needs to be challenged.&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The document could be strengthened by
describing the pros and cons of each method of delivery (Eg,
prescription and over the counter).&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Do you broadly support the Principles of
Controlled Availability set out in the Harm Reduction Model of
rug Availability? </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen were in favour, five were opposed.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The closest to the mark we've seen so
far.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It is this kind of extremism that offers
opponents of harm minimisation strategies a platform from which
to jump.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You should be congratulated for doing the
exercise. By being specific about details, you give everybody a
chance to tear it apart. But that is positive.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We congratulate the Drug Law Reform
Project on the production of such a positive and practical Model,
one that if fully and successfully implemented by governments and
other decision makers, would most certainly contribute to a
substantial reduction of hepatitis C transmission. We look
forward to hearing of progress on its implementation.&quot;</font>

size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Future -activities for the Redfern Drug Law
Reform Project are -likely to include closer links to other
committees and organisations working on drug law reform in New
South Wales. These groups are growing in number and diversity and
include in their members the parents, siblings and friends of
people who have died from overdose, AIDS or other drug-related
causes, doctors, lawyers, professors and emeritus professors of
medicine and pharmacology, drug users, health care workers,
clerks, needle exchange workers, historians and artists.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In turn, these NSW groups are working closely
with groups in other States and with the Australian Drug Law
Reform Foundation to address issues of drug policy and related
law reform in every jurisdiction in Australia. The documents
contained in this report will be examined again next year to see
whether further changes and refinements are needed. Another
report of people's comments on the documents will also be
released at some point in 1997. </font></p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY</h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We first became interested in the opium traffic during a visit
to the Far East in 1916. Like most Americans, we had vaguely
heard of this trade, and had still vaguer recollections of a war
between Great Britain and China, which took place about
seventy-five years ago, known as the Opium War. From time to time
we had heard of the opium trade as still flourishing in China,
and then later came reports and assurances that it was all over,
accompanied by newspaper pictures of bonfires of opium and opium
pipes. Except for these occasional and incidental memories, we
had neither knowledge of, nor interest in the subject. On our way
out to Japan, in the July of 1916, we met a young Hindu on the
boat, who was outspoken and indignant over the British policy of
establishing the opium trade in India, as one of the departments
of the Indian Government. Of all phases of British rule in India,
it was this policy which excited him most, and which caused him
most ardently to wish that India had some form of
self-government, some voice in the control and management of her
own affairs, so that the country could protect itself from this
evil. Without this, he declared, his country was powerless to put
a stop to this traffic imposed on it by a foreign government, and
he greatly deplored the slow, but steady demoralization of the
nation which was in consequence taking place. As he produced his
facts and figures, showing what this meant to his people-this
gradual undermining of their moral fiber and economic efficiency
we grew more and more interested. That such conditions existed
were to us unheard of, and unbelievable. It seemed incredible
that in this age, with the consensus of public opinion sternly
opposed to the sale and distribution of habit-forming drugs, and
with legislation to curb and restrict such practices incorporated
in the laws of all ethical and civilized governments, that here,
on the other side of the world, we should come upon opium traffic
conducted as a government monopoly. Not only that, but conducted
by one of the greatest and most highly civilized nations of the
world, a nation which we have always looked up to as being in the
very forefront of advanced, progressive and humane ideals. So
shocked were we by what this young Hindu told us, that we flatly
refused to believe him. We listened to what he had to say on the
subject, but thinking that however earnest he might be, however
sincere in his sense of outrage at such a policy, that he must of
necessity be mistaken. We decided not to take his word for it,
but to look into the matter for ourselves. </p>

<p>We did look into the matter. During a stay in the Far East of
nearly a year, in which time we visited Japan, China, Hong Kong,
French IndoChina, Siam and Singapore, we looked into the matter
in every country we visited. Wherever possible we obtained
government reports, and searched them carefully for those
passages giving' statistics concerning the opium trade-the amount
of opium consumed, the number of shops where it was sold, and the
number of divans where it was smoked. We found these shops
established under government auspices, the dealers obtaining
their supplies of opium from the government, and then obtaining
licenses from the government to retail it. In many countries, we
visited these shops and divans in person, and bought opium in
them freely, just as one goes to a shop to buy cigarettes. We
found a thorough and complete establishment of the opium traffic,
run by the government, as a monopoly. Revenue was derived through
the sale of opium, through excise taxes upon opium, and through
license fees paid by the keepers of opium shops and divans* -A
complete, systematic arrangement, by which the foreign government
profited at the expense of the subject peoples under its rule. In
European countries and in America, we find the governments making
every effort to repress the sale of habit-forming drugs. Here, in
the Far East, a contrary attitude prevails. The government makes
every effort to encourage and extend it. </p>

<p>Two notable exceptions presented themselves. </p>

<p>One was Japan. There are no opium shops in Japan, and the
Japanese Government is as careful to protect its people from the
evils and dangers of opium as any European country could be. It
must be remembered, however, that Japan is a free and independent
country. It has never been conquered by a European country, and
perhaps one explanation as to why the Japanese are a powerful,
virile people, is because Japan is the one Oriental nation that
has never been dominated by a European power, and in consequence,
never drugged. </p>

<p>The other exception is our own possession of the Philippines,
which although a subject country, has never had the opium traffic
established as part of the machinery of an alien government. </p>

<p>On our return to America, we were greatly exercised over these
facts which we had unearthed. We continued our researches as to
the opium traffic in the New York Public Library, and in the
Library of Congress, in Washington, in both of which places there
is a rich and abundant literature on the subject. We obtained
ready access to official blue books and government reports,
issued by the British Government, and it is from these sources
that the material in this book is largely drawn. We were somewhat
hampered in our investigations by the fact that because of the
war, these blue books have not always been of recent date, some
of them being two or three years old. For this reason, it has not
always been possible to give the most recent figures as to opium
consumption and distribution in the various countries. However,
we feel that we have obtained enough information to uphold our
case, and in any event, there is no doubt that the opium traffic,
as fostered by the British Government, still continues. In
looking over the list of British colonies where it is
established, we may find here and there a diminution in the
amount of opium consumed, but this is probably due to the
exigencies of war, to the lack of shipping and transportation,
rather than to any conscientious scruples or moral turnover;
because the revenue derived from the opium trade is precious. In
some instances, as in the case of the Straits Settlements, the
local British Government derives from forty to fifty percent of
its revenue from this source. Yet, taken in relation to the
whole, it is not large. However valuable it may be, however large
the percentage in the case of any particular colony, it can
surely never be large enough to compensate for the stigma
attached.- It is a blot upon the honor of a great nation to think
that she deliberately runs her colonies on opium: No revenue,
whether large or small, can be justified when coming from such a
source as this. </p>

<p>In all these blue books and official reports, the question of
the Opium Monopoly, as it is called, is dealt with freely. There
is no attempt to hide or suppress the facts. The subject is
reported frankly and fully. It is all there, for any one to read
who chooses. How then, does it happen that we in America know
nothing about Great Britain's Opium Monopoly? That the facts are
new to us and come to us as a shock? One is because of our
admiration for Great Britain. Those who know and there are a
few-hesitate to state them. Those who know, feel that it is a
policy unworthy of her. We hesitate to call attention to the
shortcomings of a friend. There are other reasons also for this
conspiracy of silence-fear of international complications, fear
of endangering the good feeling between the two countries,
England and America. Consequently England has been able to rely
upon those who know the facts to keep silent, either through
admiration or through fear. Also the complete ignorance of the
rest of us has been an additional safeguard. Therefore, for
nearly a century, she has been running her Opium Monopoly
undisturbed. It began as a private industry, about the time of
the East India Company, but later on passed out of the hands of
private individuals into the department of Opium Administration,
one of the branches of the colonial government&quot; But, loyal
as we have been all these years, we can remain silent no longer.
The time is now rapidly approaching when the two countries,
England and America, are to become closely united. How can we
become truly united, however, when on such a great moral question
as this we stand diametrically opposed? </p>

<p>There is still another reason why we should break silence. The
welfare of our own country is now at stake. The menace of opium
is now threatening America, and our first duty is to ourselves.
Little by little, surreptitiously, this drug has been creeping in
over our borders, and to-day many thousands of our young men and
young women are drug addicts, habituated to the use of one of the
opium derivatives, morphia or heroin. The recent campaign against
drug users, conducted by the New York Department of Health, has
uncovered these addicts in great numbers; has brought them before
us, made us see, in spite of ourselves, that thousands of them
exist and that new ones are being created daily. The question
arises, how do they obtain the drug? It was the fortune of the
writer to be present during the first week of the opening of the
Health Department Clinic for Drug Addicts, and her work consisted
in taking the histories of these pitiful, abject wrecks of men
and women who swarmed to the clinic in hundreds, seeking supplies
of the drug which they could not obtain elsewhere. The history of
these patients was almost invariably the same-there was a
monotony in their tragic, pathetic recital as to how they became
victims, how they first became acquainted with the drug. As a
rule, they began in extreme youth, generally between fifteen and
twenty years of age, one boy having begun at the age of thirteen.
In nearly every case they had tried it as a lark, as an
experiment. At &quot;parties,' they said, when some one of the
company would pass round a box full of heroin, inviting them to
snuff it. To snuff it, these children, very much as a small boy
goes behind the barn to try his first cigarette. In many
instances those who produced the box were peddlers, offering it
as a gift at first, knowing that after a dose or two the fatal
habit would be formed and another customer created. These
peddlers doubtless obtained their supplies from smugglers. But
that takes us back to our argument, namely, the part played by
that great nation which grows and distributes opium to the world.
For that nation produces an oversupply of opium, far more than is
needed by the medical profession for the relief of pain. Opium is
not profitable in its legitimate use. It is only profitable
because of the demands of addicts, men and women deliberately
debauched, either through the legalized machinery of colonial
governments, or through the illegal activities of smugglers. A
moral sentiment that will balk at this immense over-production,
the sole object of which is to create drug victims, is the only
weapon to fight it. In giving this book to the public, we are
calling upon that moral sentiment. We feel that we shall number
among our staunchest supporters that great body of men and women
in England who have for years been vainly fighting the opium
traffic. No more bitter opponents of this policy are to be found
than amongst the English people themselves. From time to time, in
Parliament, sharp debates have arisen as to the advisability of
continuing it, and some of the greatest men in England have been
steadfastly opposed. The great Gladstone has described it as
&quot;morally indefensible.&quot; The time has now come for us,
people of both countries, to unite to stop it.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>I - GREAT BRITAIN'S OPIUM MONOPOLY</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>In a book shop in Shanghai, we came upon a small book with an
arresting title, &quot;Drugging a Nation,&quot; by Samuel Merwin.
It was published in 1908, eight years before we chanced upon it,
shabby and shop worn, its pages still uncut. The people of
Shanghai, the great International Settlement of this largest city
and most important seaport of China, did not have to read it.
They knew, doubtless, all that its pages could disclose. We,
however, found it most enlightening. In it there is this
description of the British Opium Monopoly: </p>

<p>&quot;In speaking of it as a 'monopoly' I am not employing a
cant word for effect. I am not making a case. That is what it is
officially styled in a certain blue book on my table which bears
the title, 'Statement Exhibiting the Moral and Material Progress
of India during the year 1905-'6,' and which was ordered by the
House of Commons to be printed, May 10, 1907. . . . Now to get
down to cases, just what this Government Opium Monopoly is, and
just how Goes it work? An excerpt from the rather ponderous blue
book will tell us. It may be dry but it is official and
unassailable. It is also short. </p>

<p>&quot;'The opium revenue'-thus the blue book-'is partly raised
by a monopoly of the production of the drug in Bengal and the
United provinces, and partly by the levy of a duty on all opium
imported from native states. . . . In these two provinces, the
crop is grown under the control of a government department, which
arranges the total area which is to be placed under the crop,
with a view to the amount of opium required.' </p>

<p>&quot;So much for the broader outline. Now for a few of the
details: 'The cultivator of opium in these monopoly districts
receives a license, and is granted advances to enable him to
prepare the land for the crop, and he is required to deliver the
whole of the product at a fixed price to opium agents, by whom it
is dispatched to the government factories at Patna and Ghazipur.'
</p>

<p>&quot;The money advanced to the cultivator bears no interest.
The British Indian government lends money without interest in no
other cases. Producers of crops other than opium are obliged to
get along without free money. </p>

<p>&quot;When it has been manufactured, the opium must be
disposed of in one way and another; accordingly: 'The supply of
prepared opium required for consumption in India is made over to
the Excise Department . . . the chests of &quot; provision &quot;
opium, for export, are sold at monthly sales, which take place at
Calcutta.' For the meaning of the curious term, 'provision opium'
we have only to read on a little further. 'The opium is received
and prepared at the government factories, where the out-turn of
the year included 8,774 chests of opium for the Excise
Department, about three hundred pounds of various opium
alkaloids, thirty maunds of medical opium; and 51,770 chests of
provision opium for the Chinese market.' There are about <b>i4o </b>pounds
in a chest. . . . Last year the government had under poppy
cultivation 654,928 acres. And the revenue to the treasury,
including returns from auction sales, duties and license fees,
and deducting all 'opium expenditures' was nearly <font size="1">$22,000,000.
</font></p>

<p>As the blue book states, this opium is auctioned off once a
month. At that point, the British Government, as a government,
washes its hands of the business. Who buys the opium at these
government auctions, and what afterwards becomes of it? &quot;The
men who buy in the opium at these monthly auctions and afterwards
dispose of it are a curious crowd of Parsees, Mohammedans,
Hindoos and Asiatic Jews. Few British names appear in the opium
trade to-day. British dignity prefers not to stoop beneath the
taking in of profits; it leaves the details of a dirty business
to dirty hands. This is as it has been from the first. The
directors of the East India Company, years and years before that
splendid corporation relinquished the actual government of India,
forbade the selling of its specially-prepared opium direct to
China, and advised a trading station on the coast whence the drug
might find its way 'without the company being exposed to the
disgrace of being engaged in illicit commerce.&quot;' </p>

<p>&quot;So clean hands and dirty hands went into partnership.
They are in partnership still, save that the most nearly
Christian of governments has officially succeeded the company as
party of the first part.&quot; </p>

<p>You will say, if the British Government chooses to deal in
opium, that is not our concern. It is most emphatically our
concern. Once a month, at these great auction sales, the British
Government distributes thousands of pounds of opium, which are
thus turned loose upon the world, to bring destruction and ruin
to the human race. The buyers of this opium are not agents of the
British Government. They are merely the distributors, through
whom this drug is directed into the channels of trade.' The
British Government derives a certain portion of its revenue from
the sale of opium, therefore depends upon these dealers to find a
market for it. ' They are therefore, as distributors, the
unofficial agents of the British Government, through whom it is
sold legitimately, or smuggled around the world. In seeking to
eradicate the drug evil, we must face the facts, and recognize
clearly that the source of supply is the British Government,
through whose agents, official and unofficial, it is distributed.
</p>

<p>America, so they tell us, is now menaced by the drug evil. Now
that prohibition is coming into effect, we are told that we are
now confronted by a vice more terrible, far more deteriorating
and dangerous. If that is true, then we must recognize our danger
and guard against it. Some of the opium and morphia which reaches
this country is smuggled in; the rest is imported by the big
wholesale drug houses. There is an unlimited supply of it. As we
have seen, the British Government encourages poppy production,
even to the extent of lending money <i>without interest </i>to
all those who are willing to raise this most profitable crop. The
monopoly opium is sold once a month to the highest bidders, and
some of these highest bidders are unscrupulous men who must find
their markets how and where they can. That fact, of course, is of
no moment to the British Government. It is of deepest concern to
Americans, however. To the north of us we have the Dominion of
Canada. To the south, the No-Man's Land of Mexico. At the present
moment, the whole country is alarmed at the growing menace of the
drug habit, which is assuming threatening proportions.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>II -- THE INDIAN OPIUM MONOPOLY </h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><font size="1">LET </font>us quote from another dry official
record, of unimpeachable veracity-the Statesman's YearBook, for
1916. On page 140<b>, </b>under the heading of The British
Empire: India and Dependencies, we read: &quot;Opium. In British
territory the cultivation of the poppy for the production of
opium is mainly restricted to the United Provinces, and the
manufacture of the opium from this region is a State monopoly. A
limited amount is also grown in the Punjab for local consumption
and to produce poppy seeds. In the monopoly districts the
cultivator receives advances from Government to enable him to
prepare the land for the crop, and he is bound to sell the whole
of the produce at a fixed price to Government agents, by whom it
is despatched to the Government factory at Ghazipur to be
prepared for the market. The chests of manufactured opium are
sold by auction in Calcutta at monthly sales. A reserve is kept
in hand to supply the deficiencies of bad seasons, and a
considerable quantity is distributed by the Indian excise
departments. Opium is also grown in many of the Native States of
Rajaputana and Central India. These Native States have agreed to
conform to the British system. No <font size="1">6 </font>opium
may pass from them into British territory for consumption without
payment of duty. </p>

<p>&quot;The bulk of the exports of opium from India has been to
China. By arrangements with that country, the first one being in
I907, the exports from India have been limited, and provision
made for the cessation of the export to China when the native
Chinese production of opium shall be suppressed. The trade with
China is now practically suspended.&quot; </p>

<p>The important things to notice in the above statement are
these: The growing of poppies, the manufacture of opium, and the
monthly auction sales continue. Also, the opium trade with China
is practically at an end. The history of the opium traffic in
China is a story complete in itself and will be dealt with in
another chapter. At present, we must notice that the trade with
China is practically suspended, but that the British Government
is still auctioning off, once a month at Calcutta, great
quantities of opium. Where does this opium go--who are the
consumers? If not to China, then where? </p>

<p>The same reliable authority, the Statesman's Year-Book for
1918<b>, </b>has this to say on the subject. On page 130 we read:
&quot; Opium: In British territory the cultivation of the poppy
for the production of opium is practically confined to the United
Provinces, and the manufacture of opium from this region is a
State monopoly. The bulk of the exported opium is at<b> </b>present
either sent to the United Kingdom, or supplied direct to the
Governments of consuming countries in the Far East; a certain
quantity is also sold by auction in Calcutta at monthly sales.
Opium is also grown in many of the Native States of Rajputana and
Central India, which have agreed to conform to the British
system.&quot; The following tables, taken from most reliable
authority, give some idea of the exports to the &quot;consuming
countries of the Far East.&quot; Note that Japan began buying
opium in 1911-12<font size="1">2. </font>We shall have something
to say about the Japanese smuggling later. Also note that it was
in 1907<b> </b>that Great Britain and China entered into
agreement, the outcome to be the suppression of the opium trade
in China. But see the increasing imports into the treaty ports;
up till almost the very last moment British opium being poured
into China. In the second table, observe the increasing
importation into England, (United Kingdom), synchronous with the
increased exports to Japan, which will be discussed later.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<p>III -- JAPAN AS AN OPIUM DISTRIBUTOR </p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><font size="1">IN </font>an article which appeared in the <i>New
York Times, </i>under date of February 14, 1919<b>, </b>we read:
&quot;A charge that the Japanese Government secretly fosters the
morphia traffic in China and other countries in the Far East is
made by a correspondent in the <i>North China Herald </i>in its
issue of December 21st<b> </b>last. The correspondent asserts
that the traffic has the financial support of the Bank of Japan,
and that the Japanese postal service in China aids, although
'Japan is a signatory to the agreement which forbids the import
into China of morphia or of any appliances used in its
manufacture or application.' </p>

<p>&quot;Morphia no longer can be purchased in Europe, the
correspondent writes. The seat of industry has been transferred
to Japan, and morphia is now manufactured by the Japanese
themselves. Literally, tens of millions of yen are transferred
annually from China to Japan for the payment of Japanese morphia.
. . . </p>

<p>&quot;In South China, morphia is sold by Chinese peddlers,
each of whom carries a passport certifying that he is a native of
Formosa, and therefore entitled to Japanese protection. Japanese
drug stores throughout China carry large stocks of morphia.
Japanese medicine vendors look to morphia for their largest
profits. Wherever Japanese are predominant, there the trade
flourishes. Through Dairen, morphia circulates throughout
Manchuria and the province adjoining; through Tsingtao, morphia
is distributed over Shantung province, Anhui, and Kiangsu, while
from Formosa morphia is carried with opium and other contraband
by motor-driven fishing boats to some point on the mainland, from
which it is distributed throughout the province of Fukien and the
north of Kuangtung. Everywhere it is sold by Japanese under
extra-territorial protection.&quot; </p>

<p>The article is rather long, and proves beyond doubt the
existence of a well-organized and tremendous smuggling business,
by means of which China is being deluged with morphia. In the
body of the article we find this paragraph: </p>

<p>&quot;While the morphia traffic is large, there is every
reason to believe that the opium traffic upon which Japan is
embarking with enthusiasm, is likely to prove even more
lucrative. In <i>the Calcutta opium sales, Japan has become one
of the considerable purchasers of Indian </i>opium. . . . <i>Sold
by the Government of India, this opium is exported under permits
applied for by the Japanese Government, </i>is shipped to Kobe,
and from Kobe is transshipped to Tsingtao. Large profits are made
in this trade, in which are interested some of the leading firms
of Japan.&quot; </p>

<p>This article appears to be largely anti-Japanese. In fact,
more anti-Japanese than anti-opium. Anti Japanese sentiment in
America is played upon by showing up the Japanese as smugglers of
opium. The part the British Government plays in this traffic is
not emphasized. &quot;In the Calcutta opium sales, Japan has
become one of the considerable purchasers of Indian opium . . .
sold by the Government of India.&quot; We are asked to condemn
the Japanese, who purchase their stocks of opium as individuals,
and who distribute it in the capacity of smugglers. We are not
asked to censure the British Government which produces,
manufactures and sells this opium as a State monopoly. We are
asked to denounce the Japanese and their nefarious smuggling and
shameful traffic, but the source of supply, which depends upon
these smugglers as customers at the monthly auctions, is above
reproach. A delicate ethical distinction. </p>

<p>However, there is no doubt that the Japanese are ardent
smugglers. In an article in the March, 1919<b>, </b>number of
&quot;Asia&quot; by Putnam Weale, we find the following bit: *
&quot;At all ports where Japanese commissioners of Maritime
Customs (in China) hold office, it is undeniable that centres of
contraband trade have been established, opium and its derivatives
being so openly smuggled that the annual net import of Japanese
morphia (although this trade is forbidden by International
Convention) is now said to be something like 20<b> </b>tons a
year-sufficient to poison a whole nation.&quot; </p>

<p><font size="1">* &quot; A Fair Chance for Asia,&quot; by
Putnam Weale, page 227.</font> </p>

<p>Mr. Weale is an Englishman, therefore more anti-Japanese than
anti-opium. We do not recall any of his writings in which he
protests against the opium trade as conducted by his Government,
nor the part his Government plays in fostering and encouraging
it. </p>

<p>However, there are other Englishmen who see the situation in a
more impartial light, and who are equally critical of both Great
Britain and Japan. In his book, Trade Politics and Christianity
in Africa and the East,&quot; by A. J. Macdonald, M. A., formerly
of Trinity College, Cambridge, we find the facts presented with
more balance. Thus, on page 229: &quot;. . . In the north of
China another evil is springing up. The eradication of the opium
habit is being followed by the development of the morphia
traffic. . . . The morphia habit in northern China, especially
Manchuria, is already widespread. The Chinese Government is alert
to the evil, but their efforts to repress it are hampered by the
action of traders, mainly Japanese, who elude the restrictions
imposed by the Chinese and Japanese Governments. . . . China is
being drenched with morphia. It is incredible that anything
approaching the amount could possibly be devoted to legitimate
purposes. It is said that in certain areas coolies are to be seen
covered all over with needle punctures.' An injection of the drug
can be obtained for three or four cents. In Newchang 2,000<b> </b>Victims
of the morphia habit died in the winter of 1914-15. Morphia
carries off its victims far more rapidly than opium. . . .
Morphia is not yet manufactured in any appreciable quantities in
the East, and certainly even Japan cannot yet manufacture the
hypodermic injectors by means of which the drug is received. The
bulk of the manufacture takes place in England, Germany and
Austria. . . . In this traffic, two firms in Edinburgh and one in
London are engaged. The trade is carried on through Japanese
agents. The Board of Trade returns show that the export of
morphia from Great Britain to the East has risen enormously
during the last few years. </p>

<p>1911 - 5.5 tons </p>

<p>1912 - 7.5 tons </p>

<p>1913 - 11.25 </p>

<p>1914 -- 14 </p>

<p>The freedom which allows three British firms to supply China
with morphia for illicit purposes is a condemnation of English
Christianity. </p>

<p>This book of Mr. Macdonald's was published in 1916<b>. </b>Mr.
Weale's article was published in 1919<b>, </b>in which he speaks
of an importation of about twenty tons of morphia. Apparently the
three British firms which manufacture morphia, two in Edinburgh
and one in London are still going strong. Japan, however, appears
to be growing impatient with all this opprobrium cast upon her as
the distributor of drugs, especially since much of the outcry
against this comes from America. Our own country seems to be
assisting in this traffic in a most extensive manner. The Japan
Society Bulletin No. 60 calls attention to this:<br>
</p>

<p>NEW TURN IN MORPHIA TRAFFIC </p>

<p>The morphia traffic in China has taken a new turn, according
to the <i>Japan Advertiser. </i>It quotes Putnam Weale to the
effect that whilst in recent years the main distributors have
been Japanese, the main manufacturers have been British. The
morphia has been exported in large quantities from Edinburgh to
Japan, but as the result of licensing the exports of this drug
from Great Britain, the shipments to Japan dropped from <font
size="1">6oo,229 </font>ounces in 1917 to one-fourth that amount
in 1918<b>. </b><i>The Japan Chronicle, </i>speaking from
&quot;absolutely authentic information,&quot; states that 113,000
ounces of morphia arrived in Kobe from the United States in the
first five months of 1919<b>. </b>These figures are not given as
the total shipments received in Kobe, but merely as the quantity
of which <i>The Chronicle </i>has actual knowledge. It states
further that this morphia is being transhipped in Kobe harbor to
vessels bound for China. Dr. Paul S. Reinsch, who has resigned
his post as Minister to China, has stated that he will use every
resource in his power to stop the shipment from America of
morphia intended for distribution in China, in defiance of the
international convention which prohibits the sale of the drug in
that country. </p>

<p>If sufficient publicity is cast upon the distributors,
Japanese, English and American, public sentiment may in time take
cognizance of the source of all this mischief, namely, the
producer.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>IV -- SINGAPORE</h2>

<hr>

<p>In January, 1917, we found ourselves at Singapore, a British
dependency, situated at the end of the Malay Peninsula, and one
of the greatest seaports of the Orient. We were stopping at the
Hotel de l' Europe, a large and first class hotel. The first
morning at breakfast, the waiter stood beside us, waiting for our
order. He was a handsome young Malay, dressed in white linen
clothes, and wearing a green jade bracelet on one wrist. We gave
him our order and he did not move off. He continued to stand
quietly beside our chairs, as in a trance. We repeated the
order-one tea, one coffee, two papayas. He continued to stand
still beside us, stupidly. Finally he went away. We waited for a
long time and nothing happened. At last, after a long wait, he
returned and set before us a teapot filled with hot water.
Nothing else. We repeated again-tea, coffee, papayas. We said it
two or three times. Then he went away and came back with some
tea. We repeated again, coffee and fruit. Eventually he brought
us some coffee. Finally, after many endeavors, we got the fruit.
It all took a long time. We then began to realize that something
was the matter with him. He could understand English well enough
to know what orders we were giving him, but he seemed to forget
as soon as he left our sight. We then realized that he was
probably drugged. It was the same thing every day. In the morning
he was stupid and dull, and could not remember what we told him.
By evening his brain was clearer, and at dinner he could remember
well enough. The effects of whatever he had been taking had
apparently worn off during the day. </p>

<p>We learned that the opium trade was freely indulged in, at
Singapore, fostered by the Government. Singapore is a large city
of about 300,000 inhabitants, a great number of which are
Chinese. It has wide, beautiful streets, fine government
buildings, magnificent quays and docks-a splendid European city
at the outposts of the Orient. We found that a large part of its
revenue is derived from the opium traffic-from the sale of opium,
and from license fees derived from shops where opium may be
purchased, or from divans where it may be smoked. The customers
are mainly Chinese. </p>

<p>I wanted to visit these Government-licensed opium shops and
opium dens. A friend lent me two servants, as guides. We three
got into rickshaws and went down to the Chinese quarter, where
there are several hundred of these places, all doing a
flourishing business. It was early in the afternoon, but even
then, trade was brisk. The divans were rooms with wide wooden
benches running round the sides, on which benches, in pairs,
sharing a lamp between them, lay the smokers. They purchased
their opium on entering, and then lay down to smoke it. The
packages are little, triangular packets, each containing enough
for about six smokes. Each packet bears a label, red letters on a
white ground, &quot;Monopoly opium.&quot; </p>

<p>In one den there was an old man-but you can't tell whether a
drug addict is old or not, he looked as they all do, gray and
emaciated-but as he caught my eye, he laid down the needle on
which he was about to cook his pill, and glanced away. I stood
before him, waiting for him to continue the process, but he did
not move. </p>

<p>&quot;Why doesn't he go on?&quot; I asked my guide. &quot;He
is ashamed to have you see him,&quot; came the reply. </p>

<p>&quot;But why should he be ashamed?&quot; I asked, &quot;The
British Government is not ashamed to sell to him, to encourage
him to drug himself, to ruin himself. Why should he be
ashamed?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nevertheless, he is,&quot; replied the guide. &quot;You
see what he looks like-what he has become. He is not quite so far
gone as the others-he is a more recent victim. He still feels
that he has become degraded. Most of them do not feel that way
after a while.&quot; </p>

<p>So we went on and on, down the long street. There was a
dreadful monotony about it all. </p>

<p>House after house of feeble, emaciated, ill wrecks, all
smoking Monopoly Opium, all contributing, by their shame and
degradation, to the revenues of the mighty British Empire. </p>

<p>That evening after dinner, I sat on the wide verandah of the
hotel, looking over a copy of the &quot;Straits Times.&quot; One
paragraph, a dispatch from London, caught my eye. &quot; Chinese
in Liverpool. Reuter's Telegram. London, January 17, 1917
Thirty-one Chinese were arrested during police raids last night
on opium dens in Liverpool. Much opium was seized. The police in
one place were attacked by a big retriever and by a number of
Chinese, who threw boots and other articles from the
house-top.&quot; </p>

<p>Coming fresh from a tour of the opium-dens of Singapore, I
must say that item caused some mental confusion. It must also be
confusing to the Chinese. It must be very perplexing to a Chinese
sailor, who arrives in Liverpool on a ship from Singapore, to
find such a variation in customs. To come from a part of the
British Empire where opium smoking is freely encouraged, to Great
Britain itself where such practices are not tolerated. He must
ask himself, why it is that the white race is so sedulously
protected from such vices, while the subject races are so eagerly
encouraged. It may occur to him that the white race is valuable
and must be preserved, and that subject races are not worth
protecting. This double standard of international justice he must
find disturbing. It would seem, at first glance, as if subject
races were fair game-if there is money in it. Subject races,
dependents, who have no vote, no share in the government and who
are powerless to protect themselves-fair game for exploitation. </p>

<p>Is this double-dealing what we mean when we speak of &quot;our
responsibility to backward nations, 1) or of &quot;the sacred
trust of civilization&quot; or still again when we refer to
&quot;the White Man's burden &quot; ? </p>

<p>Pondering over these things as I sat on the hotel verandah, I
finally reached the conclusion that to print such a dispatch as
that in the &quot; Straits Times&quot; was, to say the least,
most tactless. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>V -- THE STRAITS SETTLEMENTS OPIUM COMMISSION<br>
</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>FROM time to time, certain people in England apparently have
qualms as to Great Britain's opium traffic, and from time to time
questions are raised as to whether or not such traffic is morally
defensible. In February, 1909, apparently in answer to such
scruples and questionings on the part of a few, a very
interesting report was published, &quot;Proceedings of the
Commission appointed to Enquire into Matters Relating to the Use
of Opium in the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay
States. Presented to both Houses of Parliament by Command of His
Majesty.&quot; This document may be found in the New York Public
Library and is well worth careful perusal. </p>

<p>This Commission consisted of about a dozen men, some English,
some natives of the Straits Settlements. They apparently made an
intensive and exhaustive study of the subject, carefully
examining it from every angle. Countless witnesses appeared
before them, giving testimony as to the effects of opium upon the
individual. This testimony is interesting, in that it is of a
contradictory nature, some witnesses saying that moderate opium
indulgence is nothing worse than indulgence in alcoholic
beverages, and like alcohol, only pernicious if taken to excess.
Other witnesses seemed to think that it was most harmful. The
Commission made careful reports as to the manner of licensing
houses for smoking, the system of licensing opium farms, etc.,
and other technical details connected with this extensive
Government traffic. Finally, the question of revenue was
considered, and while the harmfulness of opium smoking was a
matter of divided opinion, when it came to revenue there was no
division of opinion at all. As a means of raising revenue, the
traffic was certainly justifiable. It was proven that about fifty
per cent of the revenues of the Straits Settlements and the
Federated Malay States came from the opium trade, and, as was
naively pointed out, to hazard the prosperity of the Colony by
lopping off half its revenues, was an unthinkable proceeding. </p>

<p>The figures given are as follows. </p>

<p>1898. Revenue derived from 0pium....45.9 percent </p>

<p>1899 44.8 </p>

<p>1900 43.3 </p>

<p>1901 53.2 </p>

<p>1902 48.3 </p>

<p>1903 47.1 </p>

<p>1904 59.1 </p>

<p>1905 46. </p>

<p>1906 53.3 </p>

<p>There was one dissenting voice as to the conclusions reached
by this Opium Commission, that of a Bishop who presented a
minority report. But what are moral scruples against cold facts
that there's money in the opium trade? </p>

<p>This Commission made its report in 1909. But the opium
business is apparently still flourishing in the Straits
Settlements. Thus we read in the official Blue Book for 1917,
&quot;Colony of the Straits Settlements &quot; that of the total
revenue for the year, $18,672,104, that $9,182,000 came from
opium. What per cent is that?<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VI --OPIUM IN SIAM</h2>

<hr>

<p>BANGKOK, Siam, January, 1917- Siam, an independent kingdom. As
a matter of fact, &quot;protected&quot; very sternly and
thoroughly by Great Britain and France, so that its
&quot;independence&quot; would about cover an oyster cracker.
However, it is doubtless protected &quot;benevolently&quot; for
what protectorate is anything but benevolent? The more rigorous
the protectorate, the more benevolent its character. The Peace
Conference seems to have given us a new word in
&quot;mandatory.&quot; We do not know as yet what adjective will
be found to qualify mandatory, but it will doubtless be fitting
and indicative of idealism-of sorts. Therefore, all will be well.
Our suspicions will be lulled. It is high time that a substitute
was found for &quot;benevolent protectorate.&quot; </p>

<p>The particular form of benevolence noted in Siam was the total
inability of the Siamese to exclude British opium. They are
allowed, by the benevolent powers, to impose an import duty on
all commodities imported except opium. That is free. The treaty
between Siam and Great Britain in 1856 says so. We rather fancy
that Great Britain had more to say about this in 1856 than Siam
but maybe not. Anyway poor old Siam, an independent kingdom, is
bound to receive as much opium as may be imported, and is quite
powerless, by the terms of this treaty, to enact laws to exclude
it. In the last year or two, the Government of Siam has been
obliged to put the opium traffic under government control, in
order to minimize the worst evils in connection with it, although
to restrict and regulate an evil is a poor substitute for the
ability to abolish it. </p>

<p>All this, you will see, is rather tough on the Siamese, but
good business for the British Empire. </p>

<p>However, opium is not bad for one. There are plenty of people
to testify to that. We Americans have a curious notion to the
contrary, but then, we Americans are so hysterical and gullible.
An Englishman whom we met in Bangkok told me that opium was not
only harmless, but actually beneficial. He said once that he was
traveling through the jungle, into the interior somewhere. He had
quite a train of coolies with him, carrying himself and his
baggage through the dense forests. By nightfall, he found his
coolies terribly exhausted with the long march. But he was in a
hurry to press on, so, as he expressed it, he gave each of them a
&quot;shot&quot; of morphia, whereupon all traces of fatigue
vanished. They forgot the pain of their weary arms and legs and
were thus enabled to walk all night. He said that morphia
certainly knocked a lot of work out of men-you might say, doubled
their capacity for endurance. </p>

<p>The night we left Bangkok, we got aboard the boat at about
nine in the evening. The hatch was open, and we looked into the
hold upon a crowd of coolies who had been loading sacks of rice
aboard the ship. There they lay upon the rice sacks, two or three
dozen of them, all smoking opium. Two coolies to a lamp. I rather
wondered that a lamp did not upset and set the boat on fire, but
they are made of heavy glass, with wide bottoms, so that the
chances of overturning them are slight. So we leaned over the
open hatch, looking down at these little fellows, resting and
recuperating themselves after their work, refreshing themselves
for the labor of the morrow. </p>

<p>Opium is wonderful, come to think of it. But why, since it is
so beneficial and so profitable, confine it to the downtrodden
races of the world? Why limit it to the despised races, who have
not sense enough to govern themselves anyway? </p>

<p>The following figures are taken from the Statistical Year
Books for the Kingdom of Siam: </p>

<p>Foreign trade and navigation of the port of Bangkok, imports
of opium: </p>

<p>1911-12 1,270 chests of opium </p>

<p>1912-13 1,775 </p>

<p>1913-14 1,186 </p>

<p>1 914-15 2,000 Imported from India and Singapore. </p>

<p>1915-16 2,000 </p>

<p>1916-17 1,100 </p>

<p>1917-18 1,850 </p>

<p>Also, from the same source, we find the number of retail opium
shops: </p>

<p>1912-13 2,985 </p>

<p>1913-14 3,075 </p>

<p>1914-15 3,132 </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VII -- HONGKONG</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crown Colony of Hongkong was ceded by China to Great
Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the treaty
of Nanking in August, 1842; and the charter bears date April 5,
1843. Hongkong is the great center for British commerce with
China and Japan, and a military and naval station of first-class
importance.&quot; </p>

<p>Thus the Statesman's Year Book. This authority, however, omits
to mention just exactly how this important piece of Chinese
territory came to be ceded to Great Britain. It was the reward
that Great Britain took unto herself as an &quot;indemnity&quot;
following the successful prosecution of what is sometimes spoken
of as the first opium war-a war of protest on the part of China
against Great Britain's insistence on her right to deluge China
with opium. China's resistance was in vain-her efforts to stem
the tide of opium were fruitless-the might, majesty, dominion and
power of the British Empire triumphed, and China was beaten. The
island on which Hongkong is situated was at that time a blank
piece of land; but strategically well placed-ninety miles south
of the great Chinese city of Canton, the market for British
opium. </p>

<p>The opposite peninsula of Kowloon, on the mainland, was ceded
to Great Britain by treaty in 1861, and now forms part of
Hongkong. By a convention signed at Peking in June, 1898, there
was also leased to Great Britain for 99 years a portion of
Chinese territory mainly agricultural, together with the waters
of Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, and the island of Lan-tao. Its area is
356 square miles, with about 81,000 inhabitants, exclusively
Chinese. Area of Old Kowloon is 3 square miles. Total area of
colony, 391 square miles. </p>

<p>The population of Hongkong, excluding the Military and Naval
establishments, and that portion of the new territory outside New
Kowloon, was according to the 1911 census, 366,145 inhabitants.
Of this number the Chinese numbered 354,187. </p>

<p>This colony is, of course, governed by Great Britain, and is
not subject to Chinese control. Here is situated a Government
opium factory, and the imports of Indian opium into Hongkong for
the past several years are as follows: </p>

<p>1903-4 3,576,431 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1904-5 4,036,436 </p>

<p>1905-6 3,775,82.6 </p>

<p>1906-7 3,771,409 </p>

<p>1907-8 3,145,403 </p>

<p>1908-9 2,230,755 </p>

<p>1909-10 3,377,222 </p>

<p>1910-11 3,963,264 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911-12 3,018,858 </p>

<p>1912-13 2,406,084 </p>

<p>1913-14 1,084,093 </p>

<p>1914--15 110,712 </p>

<p>These figures are taken from &quot;Statistical Abstract
Relating to British India, 1905-6 to 1915,&quot; and &quot;
Statistical Abstract Relating to British India, 1903-4 to
1912-13.&quot; The falling off in imports of opium noticed in
1914-15 may be due to the war, lack of shipping, etc., or to the
fact that the China market was due to close on April 1, 1917. The
closing of the China market 400,000,000 of people destined no
longer to have opium supplied to them (except illegally, by
smuggling, etc.) is naturally a big blow to the British opium
interests. That is where the menace to the rest of the world
comes in. Opium has been proved such a profitable commodity, that
if one market is shut off, others must be found as substitutes.
The idea of closing the trade altogether naturally does not
appeal to those who profit by it. Therefore, what we should hail
at first sight as a welcome indication of a changed moral
sentiment, is in reality but the pause which proceeds the casting
about for new markets, for finding new peoples to drug. </p>

<p>The Colonial Report No. 972, Hongkong Report for 1917, gives
the imports and exports of opium: Page 7- </p>

<p>&quot;The imports and exports of certified opium during the
year as follows: </p>

<p>Imports......... 7 chests </p>

<p>Export.......... 224 chests </p>

<p>Of these, however, the imports all come from Shanghai, and of
the total export Of 224 chests, 186 went to Shanghai.&quot; </p>

<p>Opium received from other sources than Shanghai makes a better
showing. &quot; Seven hundred and forty chests of Persian opium
imported during the year, and seven hundred and forty-five
exported to Formosa. Nine hundred and ten chests of uncertified
Indian opium were imported: Four hundred and ten chests by the
Government Monopoly, and the remaining five hundred for the Macao
opium farmer.&quot; </p>

<p>Macao is a small island off the coast of China, near Canton-a
Portuguese settlement, owned by Portugal for several centuries,
where the opium trade is in full blast. But somehow, one does not
expect so much of Portugal. The most significant feature of the
above paragraph, however, lies in the reference to the
importation of Persian opium. &quot; Seven hundred and forty
chests of Persian opium imported.&quot; Query, who owns Persia? </p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of this poor showing, in spite of the
decrease in opium importation as compared with the balmy days,
all is not lost. The Crown Colony of Hongkong still continues to
do an active trade. In the Colonial Office List for 1917, on page
218, we read: &quot;Hongkong. Revenue: About one-third of the
revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly.&quot;<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VIII -- SARAWAK<br>
</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>NEAR British North Borneo. Area, 42,000 square miles, many
rivers navigable. The government of part of the present territory
was obtained in 1842 by Sir James Brooke from the Sultan of
Brunei. Various accessions were made between 1861, 1885, and
188o. The Rajah, H. H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G. C.M.G.,
nephew to the late Rajah, born June 3, 1829, succeeded in 1868.
Population estimated at 500,000, Malays, Dyaks, Kayans, Kenyahs,
and Muruts, with Chinese and other settlers. </p>

<p>Thus the Statesman's Year Book, to which we would add a
paragraph from an article in the National Geographic Magazine for
February, 1919. Under the title: &quot;Sarawak: The Land of the
White Rajahs&quot; we read: &quot;With the recent death of Sir
Charles Brooke, G. C. M. G., the second of the white rajahs of
Sarawak, there came to an end one of the most useful and unusual
careers among the many that have done credit to British rule in
the Far East. For nearly 49 years he governed, as absolute
sovereign, a mixed population of Chinese, Malays, and numerous
pagan tribes scattered through the villages and dense jungles of
an extensive territory on the northwest coast of Borneo. </p>

<p>&quot; Constant solicitude for the welfare of his people won
the sympathy and devotion which enabled this white man, supported
by an insignificant army and police, to establish the peaceful
occupations of civilization in place of barbarous tyranny and
oppression.&quot; </p>

<p>How thoroughly this &quot;civilizing&quot; process was
accomplished may be judged somewhat by turning to the Colonial
Office List for 19I7, where on page 436 we read: &quot;Sarawak:
The principal sources of revenue are the opium, gambling, pawn
shops, and arrack, producing: </p>

<p>1908 $483,019 </p>

<p>1909 460,416 </p>

<p>1910 385,070 </p>

<p>1911 420,151 </p>

<p>1912 426,867 </p>

<p>1913 492,455 </p>

<p>In the Statesman's Year Book for 1916 we find the total
revenue for this well-governed little colony as follows, given
however in pounds sterling, instead of dollars, as in the above
table. Thus: </p>

<p>Revenue-1910 221,284 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911I 159,456 </p>

<p>1912 175,967 </p>

<p>1913 210,342 </p>

<p>1914 208,823 </p>

<p>It would seem as if forty-nine years of constant solicitude
for the welfare of a people, establishing the peaceful
occupations of civilization, might have resulted in something
better than a revenue derived from opium, gambling, pawn shops
and arrack. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>IX -- SHANGHAI<br>
</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>IN the New York Library there is an interesting little book,
about a quarter of an inch thick, and easy reading. It is
entitled: &quot;Municipal Ethics: Some Facts and Figures from the
Municipal Gazette, 1907-1914. An Examination of the Opium License
policy of the Shanghai Municipality. In an Open Letter to the
Chairman of the Council, by Arnold Foster, Wuchang. For 42 years
Missionary to the Chinese.&quot; </p>

<p>Shanghai, being a Treaty Port, is of two parts. The native or
Shanghai city, under the control and administration of the
Chinese. And the foreign concessions, that part of the city under
the control and administration of foreigners. This is generally
known as the International Settlement (also called the model
settlement), and the Shanghai Municipal Council is the
administrative body. Over this part the Chinese have no control.
In 1907, when China began her latest fight against the opium
evil, she enacted and enforced drastic laws prohibiting opium
smoking and opium selling on Chinese soil, but was powerless to
enforce these laws on &quot;foreign&quot; soil. In the foreign
concessions, the Chinese were able to buy as much opium as they
pleased, merely by stepping over an imaginary line, into a
portion of the town where the rigid anti-opium laws of China did
not apply. </p>

<p>Says Mr. Arnold, in his Open Letter: &quot;It will be seen
that the title of the pamphlet, Municipal Ethics, describes a
situation which is a complex one. It concerns first the actual
attitude of the Shanghai Municipal Council towards the Chinese
national movement for the suppression of the use of opium. This,
we are assured by successive Chairmen of the Council, has been
one of &quot;sincere sympathy...... the greatest sympathy,&quot;
and more to the same effect. Certainly no one would have guessed
this from the facts and figures reproduced in this pamphlet from
the columns of the &quot; Municipal Gazette.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The second element in the ethical situation is the
actual attitude of the Council not only towards the Chinese
national movement, but also towards its own official assurances,
protestations and promises. </p>

<p>&quot;It is on this second branch of the subject before us
that I specially desire to focus attention, and for the facts
here stated that I would bespeak the most searching examination.
The protestations of the Council as to its own virtuous attitude
in regard to opium reform in China are made the more emphatic,
and also the more open to criticism, by being coupled with some
very severe insinuations made at the time, as to the insincerity
and unreliability of the Chinese authorities in what they were
professing, and in what they were planning to do in the same
matter of opium reform. It so happens, as the event proves, that
these sneers and insinuations were not only quite uncalled for,
but were absolutely and utterly unjust. When a comparison is
instituted between (a) 'official pronouncements' made two years
ago by the Chinese authorities as to what they then intended to
do for the suppression of the opium habit, and (b) the 'actual
administrative results' that in the meanwhile have been
accomplished, the Chinese have no cause to be ashamed of the
verdict of impartial judges. What they have done may not always
have been wise, it may sometimes have been very stern, but the
outcome has been to awaken the astonishment and admiration of the
whole civilized world! When, on the other hand, a comparison is
instituted between (a) the fine professions and assurances of the
Shanghai Municipal Council made six or seven years ago as to its
own attitude towards the 'eradication of the opium evil' and (b)
the 'actual administrative results' of the Council's own
proceedings, the feelings awakened are of very different order.
Here, not to mention any other consideration, two hard facts
stare one in the face: First, in October, 1907, there were
eighty-seven licensed opium shops in the International
Settlement. In May, 1914, there were six hundred and sixty-three.
In 1907 the average monthly revenue from opium licenses, dens and
shops combined, was Taels 5,450- In May, 1914, the revenue from
licenses and opium shops alone was Taels 10,995. The Council will
not dispute these figures.&quot; </p>

<p>At the beginning of the anti-opium campaign in 1907, there
were 700 dens (for smoking) in the Native City, and 1600 in the
International Settlement. The Chinese closed their dens and shops
at once. In the Settlement, the dens were not all closed until
two years later, and the number of shops in the Settlement
increased by leaps and bounds. Table I shows an outline of the
Municipal opium-shop profits concurrent with the closing of the
opium houses-and subsequently: </p>

<p>Year Month Dens Shops Monthly revenue, shops only </p>

<p>1908 Jan. 1436 87 Taels, 338 </p>

<p>Oct. 1005 131 623 </p>

<p>1909 Jan. 599 166 1,887 </p>

<p>Oct. 297 231 2,276 </p>

<p>1910 Oct. Closed 306 5,071 </p>

<p>1911 Oct. 348 5,415 </p>

<p>1912 Nov. 402 5,881 </p>

<p>1913 Dec. 560 8,953 </p>

<p>1914 March 628 10,111 </p>

<p>April 654 10,772 </p>

<p>Mr. Arnold quotes part of a speech made by the Chairman of the
Municipal Council, in March, 1908. The Chairman says in part:
&quot;The advice which we have received from the British
Government is, in brief, that we should do more than keep pace
with the native authorities, we should be in advance of them, and
where possible, encourage them to follow us.&quot; It must have
been most disheartening to the native authorities, suppressing
the opium traffic with the utmost rigor, to see their efforts
defied and nullified by the increased opportunities for obtaining
opium in that part of Shanghai over which the Chinese have no
control. A letter from a Chinese to a London paper, gives the
Chinese point of view: &quot;China . . . is obliged to submit to
the ruthless and heartless manner in which British merchants,
under the protection of the Shanghai 'Model Settlement' are
exploiting her to the fullest extent of their ability.&quot; </p>

<p>There is lots of money in opium, however. The following tables
compiled by Mr. Arnold show the comparison between the amount
derived from opium licenses as compared with the amount derived
from other sorts of licenses. </p>

<p>1913. Wheelbarrows Taels, 38,670 </p>

<p>Carts 22,944 </p>

<p>Motor cars 12,376 </p>

<p>Cargo boats.... . . .. 5,471 </p>

<p>Chinese boats 4,798 </p>

<p>Steam launches.... . 2,221 </p>

<p>Total, 86,480 </p>

<p>Opium shops 86,386 Opium, 86,3 86 </p>

<p>Another table shows the licensed institutions in Shanghai
representing normal social life (chiefly of the Chinese) as
compared with revenue from opium shops: </p>

<p>1913. Tavern Taels, 16,573 </p>

<p>Foreign liquor seller.. 19,483 </p>

<p>Chinese wine shop.... 28,583 </p>

<p>&quot;&quot; tea shop.... 9,484 </p>

<p>&quot;&quot; theater. . . . . 8,74 </p>

<p>&quot;&quot; club 3,146 </p>

<p>Total.. 85,983 </p>

<p>Opium shops 86,386 </p>

<p>Treaty Ports are those cities in China, in which the foreign
powers have extra-territorial holdings, not subject to Chinese
jurisdiction. Shanghai is one of them, the largest and most
important. The Statistical Abstract Relating to British India for
I903-4 to I912-I3 shows the exports of British opium into these
Treaty Ports. </p>

<p>1903-4 1,610,296 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1904-5 1,504,604 </p>

<p>1905-6 1,130,372 </p>

<p>1906-7 1,031,065 </p>

<p>1907-8 1,215,142 </p>

<p>1908-9 2,703,871 </p>

<p>1909-10 1,234,432 </p>

<p>1910-11 2,203,670 </p>

<p>1911-12 3,64,887 </p>

<p>1912-13 3,242,902 </p>

<p>It was in 1907 that China began her great fight against the
opium evil, and enacted stringent laws for its prohibition on
Chinese soil. On page 15 of his little book, Mr. Arnold quotes
from Commissioner Carl, of Canton: &quot;The 1912 figure (for the
importation of foreign opium) is the largest on record since
1895. The great influx of Chinese into the foreign concessions,
where the antiopium smoking regulations cannot be enforced by the
Chinese authorities, and where smoking can be indulged in without
fear of punishment, no doubt accounts for the unusual increase
under foreign opium.&quot; <br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>X -- INDIA </h2>

<hr>

<p>INDIA is the source and fount of the British opium trade, and
it is from Indian opium that the drug is chiefly supplied to the
world. As we have said before, it is a government monopoly.
Cultivators, who wish to plant poppies, may borrow money from the
Government free of interest, the sole condition being that the
crop be sold back to the Government again. It is manufactured
into opium at the Government factory at Ghazipur, and once a
month, the Government holds auctions at Calcutta, by means of
which the drug finds its way into the trade channels of the
world-illicit and otherwise.* </p>

<p>*This description of the Opium Department is to be found in
Statistics of British India, Financial Statistics, Vol. 11, 8th
Issue, page 159: </p>

<p>OPIUM. The region in which the poppy was cultivated in 1916-17
for the manufacture of &quot;Bengal opium&quot; comprises 32
districts of the United Provinces of Agra and Ouhd. The whole
Department has, with effect from the 29th September, 1910, been
under the control of one Opium Agent, with headquarters at
Ghazipur. At Ghazipur there is a Government factory where the
crude opium is manufactured into the form in which it passes into
consumption. The cultivation of the poppy and the manufacture of
opium are regulated by Act XIII of 1857, as amended by Act I of
1911, and are under the general control of the Lieutenant
Governor and the Board of Revenue of the United Provinces, and
the immediate supervision of the Opium Agent at Ghazipur. The
possession, transport, import and export of opium are regulated
by rules framed under the Indian Opium Act. Cultivation is
permitted only under licenses granted under the authority of the
Opium Agent. The area to be cultivated is fixed by the license,
and the cultivator is bound to sell the whole of his production
to the Opium Department at the rate fixed by Government..........
Advances, on which no interest is charged, are given to licensed
cultivators at the time of executing the agreement and from time
to time (though ordinarily no more than two advances are given)
until final delivery. In March, April and May the opium is made
over to the officers of the Department, and weighed and tested,
and as soon as possible afterwards each cultivator's accounts are
adjusted, and the balance due is paid him. After weighment the
opium is forwarded to the Government factory at Ghazipur, where
it is manufactured in 3 forms-(a) opium intended for export to
foreign countries, departmentally known as &quot;provision
opium&quot;(b) opium intended for consumption in India and Burma,
departmentally known as &quot;excise opium&quot; and (c) medical
opium for export to London. Provision opium is made up in the
form of balls or cakes, each weighing 3.5 lbs., and is packed in
chests, each chest containing forty cakes, weighing 140 1/7 lbs.
It is generally of 71' efficiency. Excise opium is made up in
cubical packets, each weighing one seer, 60 of which are packed
in a case. It is of higher consistency than the &quot;provision
opium.&quot; Medical opium is made up into cakes weighing 2 lbs.
Provision opium is sold by public auction in Calcutta. A
notification is published annually, generally about the month of
June, stating the number of chests which will be put up for sale
in each month of the next calendar year, and the quantities so
notified are not altered without three months notice. Sales are
conducted month by month by the Bengal Government; 7,000 chests
were notified for sale in 1917 for shipment to non-China markets.
The number of chests actually sold was 4,615. In addition to
this, 4,500 chests were sold to the Government of the Straits
Settlements, 2,200 to the Government of Netherland Indies, and 00
to the Government of Hongkong. The duty levied by Government on
each chest may be taken to be the difference between the average
price realized and the average cost. </p>

<p>The following facts are taken from &quot; Statistics of
British India. Financial Statistics, Volume II,Eighth
Issue,&quot; to be found at the New York Public Library: </p>

<p>AREA UNDER POPPY CULTIVATION </p>

<p>Acreage: </p>

<p>1910-11 362,868 </p>

<p>1911-12 200,672 </p>

<p>1912-13 178,263 </p>

<p>1913-14 144,561 </p>

<p>1914-15 164,911 </p>

<p>1915-16 167,155 </p>

<p>1916-17 204,186 </p>

<p>In the hey-day of the China trade, 613,996 acres were under
cultivation in the years 1905-6, consequently this is a drop in
the extent of acreage. But, as we have said before, the closing
of the China market simply means that other outlets must be
found, and apparently they are being found, since from I914
onwards, the acreage devoted to poppy planting is slowly
increasing again. </p>

<p>The opium manufactured in the Government factory is of three
kinds-provision opium for export; excise opium, for consumption
in India, and medical opium, for export to London. It is this
latter form of opium which, according to Mr. MacDonald, in his
&quot;Trade Politics and Christianity in Africa and the
East&quot; is being manufactured into morphia by three British
firms, two in Edinburgh and one in London, which morphia the
Japanese are buying and smuggling into North China. </p>

<p>The &quot;Statistics of British India&quot; shows the
countries into which Indian opium has been exported: we will take
the figures for the last five years, which show the number of
chests sent out. </p>

<p><img src="img00003.gif" align="bottom" width="195"
height="543"> <br>
</p>

<p>In some countries we see a falling off, as in China.
Cochin-China, the French colony, shows a considerable
increase--the little Annarnites, Tonquinese, Cambodgians and
other inhabitants of this colony of the French Republic being
shown what's what. Mauretius, a British Colony five hundred miles
off the coast of Madagascar, in the Indian ocean, seems to be
coming on. The falling off in shipments to the United Kingdom may
possibly have been due to the war and the scarcity of ships.
&quot;Other countries&quot; seem to be holding their own. With
the end of the war, the increase in ships, and general trade
revival, we may yet see compensation for the loss of China. With
the increase of drug addicts in the United States, it may be that
in time America will no longer be classed under &quot;other
countries&quot; but will have a column all to itself. </p>

<p>In another table we find a comparison as to the number of
chests of provision or export opium and of excise opium, or that
intended for consumption in India. Thus: <br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00004.gif" align="bottom" width="350"
height="144"> </p>

<p>Each chest contains roughly about one hundred and forty
pounds. <br>
</p>

<p>REVENUE </p>

<p>The revenue of India is derived from various sources, and is
classified under eight heads. Thus: for 1916-17-<br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00005.gif" align="bottom" width="349"
height="383"> </p>

<p>Out of these eight classifications, opium comes fourth on the
list. </p>

<p>But in addition to the direct opium revenue, we must add
another item, Excise, which is found under the third heading,
taxation. In the &quot;India Office List for i9i8&quot; we find
&quot;Excise&quot; explained as follows: Page 383: &quot;Excise
and Customs: Excise duties in India are levied with the two fold
object of raising revenue and restricting the use of intoxicants
and narcotics.&quot; In the same book, on page 385, we also read:
&quot;Excise and Customs Revenues: The total of the excise and
customs revenues on liquors and drugs in i 9 i 5-i 6 was in round
figures ten million pounds. This total gives an average of rather
more than ninepence a head on the whole population of British
India as the revenue charge on drink and drugs during the
year.&quot; </p>

<p>These excise duties are collected on spirits, beer, opium and
intoxicating drugs, such as ganja, charas, and bhang, all forms
or preparations of Indian hemp (Cannabis Indica), known in some
countries as hashish. In 1917-18 there were 17,369 drug shops
throughout India. The excise duties collected from these sources
was pretty evenly distributed. Excise revenue for a period of
years is as follows:<br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00006.gif" align="bottom" width="334"
height="194"> </p>

<p>The &quot;Statistics of British India for 1918&quot; has this
to say on the subject of Excise (page 218): &quot;Revenue: During
the ten years ending with 1916-17 the net receipts from Excise
duties increased . . . at the rate of 47 per cent. The receipts
from opium (consumed in India, not exported) being at the rate of
44 per cent. The net receipts from liquors and from drugs other
than opium . . . the increase at the rate Of 48 per cent. This
large increase is due not merely to the expansion of consumption,
but also to the imposition of progressively higher rates of duty
and the increasingly extensive control of the excise
administration. The revenue from drugs, (excluding opium) has
risen in ten years . . . the increase being at the rate of 67 per
cent.&quot; </p>

<p>A national psychology that can review these figures with
complacency, satisfaction and pride is not akin to American
psychology. A nation that can subjugate 300,000,000 helpless
people, and then turn them into drug addicts-for the sake of
revenue is a nation which commits a cold blooded atrocity
unparalleled by any atrocities committed in the rage and heat of
war. The Blue Book shows no horror at these figures. Complacent
approval greets the increase of 44 per cent of opium consumption,
and the increase of 67 per cent in the use of other habit-forming
drugs. Approval, and a shrewd appreciation of the possibilities
for more revenue from &quot;progressively higher rates of
duty,&quot; knowing well that drug addicts will sell soul and
body in order to procure their daily supply.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XI -- TURKEY AND PERSIA </h2>

<hr>

<p>NEXT to India, the greatest two opium-producing countries in
the world are Turkey and Persia. The Statesman's Year Book for
1918 has this to say about it. On page 1334: &quot;The principal
exports from Turkey into the United Kingdom..... in two years
were:<br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00007.gif" align="bottom" width="333"
height="115"> </p>

<p>These are the only articles mentioned in this list of chief
exports. There are others, doubtless, but the Statesman's Year
Book is a condensed and compact little volume, dealing only with
the principal things exported. In i9i5 we therefore notice that
the opium export was second on the list, being exceeded by but
one other, dried fruit. In i9i6, the third year of the war, the
opium export is decidedly less, as are all the other articles
exported, except dried fruit and wool-which were articles
probably more vital to the United Kingdom at that time even than
opium. </p>

<p>PERSIA </p>

<p>THE same authority, the Statesman's Year Book for 1918, gives
a table on page 1162, showing the value of the chief exports from
Persia. The values are given in thousands of kran, sixty kran
equaling one pound sterling. <br>
<img src="img00008.gif" align="bottom" width="333" height="46"> </p>

<p>Since the war, both Turkey and Persia are more or less under
control of the British Empire, which gives Great Britain virtual
control of the world's output of opium. With this monopoly of the
opium-producing countries, and with a million or so square miles
added to her immense colonial Empire, one wonders what use Great
Britain will make of the mandatory powers she has assumed over
the lives and welfare of all these subject peoples! Will she find
these helpless millions ready for her opium trade? Will she
establish opium shops, and opium divans, and reap half the costs
of upkeep of these newly acquired states by means of this
shameful traffic?<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<p><b>XII - MAURETIUS</b> </p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>ANOTHER British colony is Mauretius, acquired by conquest in
1810, and formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris
in 1814. This island is in the Indian Ocean, 500 miles east of
Madagascar, with an area of about 720 square miles. The
population is about 377,000, of which number 258,000 are Indian,
and 3,000 Chinese. Opium appears to be sold in the colony, since
the Blue Book mentions that licenses are required for opium
sellers. As far as we can discover, by perusal of these
Government Reports, the sale of opium is not conducted by the
Government itself, as in India, the Straits Settlements,
Hongkong, etc., but is carried on by private dealers who obtain
licenses before they can open opium shops. A part of the revenue,
however, is derived from opium; thus, according to the Blue Book
for the Colony of Mauretius for 1915, page V 73, we read that the
imports of opium for the year amounted to 1,353 kilos, with a
duty collected of 54,126 rupees. The Blue Book for 1916 shows a
gratifying increase. Thus, the import of crude opium from India
amounted to 5,690 kilos, with a duty collected of 227,628 rupees.
(See page V 64-) </p>

<p>Statistics for British India, Eighth Issue, gives these
figures: </p>

<p>OPIUM EXPORTED TO MAURETIUS </p>

<p>1912-13 -- 10 chests </p>

<p>1913-14 -- 19 </p>

<p>1914-15 -- 23 </p>

<p>1915-16 -- 65 </p>

<p>1916-17. -- 120 </p>

<p>This is a poor little colony, but has its possibilities. The
consumption of opium appears to be increasing steadily in a most
satisfactory manner. Congratulations all round. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XIII - BRITISH NORTH BORNEO</h2>

<hr>

<p>BRITISH North Borneo occupies the northern part of the island
of Borneo. Area, about 31,000 square miles, with a coast line of
over 800 miles. Population (1911 census), 208,000, consisting
mainly of Mohammedan settlers on the coast and aboriginal tribes
inland. The Europeans numbered 355; Chinese 26,000; Malays,
1,612; East Indians about 5,000 and Filipinos 5,700. The number
of natives cannot be more than approximately estimated, but is
placed at about 170,000. The territory is under the jurisdiction
of the British North Borneo Company, being held under grants from
the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu (Royal Charter in 1881). </p>

<p>Like many other British colonies, opium is depended upon for
part of the revenue. The Statesman's Year Book for 1916 observes
on page 107: &quot;Sources of revenue: Opium, birds' nests, court
fees, stamp duty, licenses, import and export duties, royalties,
land sales, etc. No public debt.&quot; </p>

<p>In this frank manner, our attention is called to opium, which
appears first on the list of sources o revenue. </p>

<p>Going over the files of the Government reports, we will begin
with the &quot;Supplement to the Official Gazette for British
North Borneo. Administration Report for the Year 1910.&quot;
Published June 1, 1911. On page 3 we read: Customs and Trade: The
import and export trade of the state shows a healthy expansion. .
. . It is interesting to note that imports show an increase at
every station. Out of the 47 headings of Tariff, there are only 7
which show decreases. . . . The largest increases appear under
cloth, $147,106; opium, $132,692, and iron ware, $218,620. . . .
The general all round increases . . . are of course due to the
demand for supplies of all kinds in connection with the opening
of rubber estates.&quot; </p>

<p>The Supplement to the Official Gazette, Report for 1912
(published in December, 1913) is also a report of general
prosperity. Page 4: &quot;Trade: The volume of trade for the year
1912 was $11,139,122, giving an increase over 1911 of 18 per
cent. . . . Imports: As in 1911, all stations show an increase of
imports. Out Of 47 headings, 33 show increases, 12 show
decreases, and 2 remain stationary. Increases: There was an
increase under rice, flour and grain . . . the increase under
other headings include sundries, opium, machinery, etc.&quot; </p>

<p>The next Government Report is not so happy. Opium imports show
no &quot;healthy expansion.&quot; Thus, the Supplement to the
Official Gazette, Report for 1913 (published 1 February, 1915)
says on page 4: &quot;Other decreases in imports were opium,
$108,18o. The decrease in opium was due to the abolition of the
Opium Farm, which also held the Labuan Farm, and opium was
therefore no longer imported from Labuan for use in the West
Coast and the Interior.&quot; </p>

<p>Still more bad news as to opium, in the report for 1914,
(published 1 February, 1916). All imports drop. Page 4 records
&quot;Decrease in imports. . . . Railway and telegraph material,
rice, flour, grain and opium.&quot; In this year the opium
imports only amount to $58,464. This general falling off in all
imports may have been due to the war. But the opium situation was
apparently growing serious. On page 17 of this same report we
read that &quot;Thirty-two ordinances were passed by the Council
and became laws during the year. Among them the Opium and
Chandu.&quot; </p>

<p>The brevity and meagerness of these official reports often
leave one puzzled as to their meaning. The Supplement to the
Official Gazette for 1915 (published October, 1916), shows still
more discouraging news as to opium. Imports that year amounted to
only $31,299. But, in spite of this discouragement, hope still
remains. The same report shows optimism under the head of Excise.
&quot;Excise: $627,225, against $467,078, an increase in the net
revenue of $160,147, due to Government taking over the sole
control of the sale of chandu (smoking opium) and the collection
of other Excise duties, formerly farmed.&quot; </p>

<p>This explains the Ordinance passed by the Council the
preceding year, regarding Opium and Chandu. Since the Government
has taken over 44 sole control of the sale of chandu &quot; and
will collect the excise duties systematically and thoroughly, we
may still hope for some future report which will show once more a
&quot;healthy expansion&quot; in the opium revenue. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XIV - BRITISH GUIANA</h2>

<hr>

<p>SITUATED in South America. Area, 89,480 square miles.
Population at census of 1911, excluding aborigines in the
unfrequented parts of the colony, 296,000. The Statesman's Year
Book, which gives us these brief facts, has very little to say
about this British colony in our Western Hemisphere, and gives no
dates or information as to how and when it was acquired. The
Government reports are also meager and unsatisfactory, and there
is no wealth of detail as to exports and imports. The country,
however, is rich in gold, mining having commenced in i886.
Diamonds have also been discovered. </p>

<p>The chief sources of revenue, however, are customs, excise and
licenses. With the word &quot;excise&quot; we have come to have
unpleasant associations. From &quot;The Statistical Abstract for
British Self-Governing Dominions, Colonies, Possessions and
Protectorates&quot; we find a table showing the imports of opium
into the various countries under British rule. The opium imports
into British Guiana are as follows: </p>

<p>1910 1,251 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911 1,270 </p>

<p>1912 2,474 </p>

<p>1913 4,452 </p>

<p>1914 5,455 </p>

<p>1915 4,481 </p>

<p>These figures would seem to indicate that even on the Western
Hemisphere the taste for opium may be cultivated. It need not
necessarily be confined to the Oriental peoples. The population
of much of South America is a mixed lot, the result of mixed
breeding between Spanish settlers, Indians, native tribes of all
sorts. All this jumble, including the aborigines referred to,
might, with a little teaching become profitable customers of the
Opium Monopoly. Time and a little effort, given this fertile
field, ought to produce a &quot;healthy expansion&quot; in the
opium trade. </p>

<p>And that this insidious habit is indeed taking hold, in at
least one more country in South America, one may infer from the
following paragraph which appeared in the New York Times, 4
October, 1919: </p>

<p>DRUG EVIL IN ARGENTINA </p>

<p>Buenos Aires Opens Fight on Use of Narcotics </p>

<p>The city government of Buenos Aires, Argentina, has begun a
determined fight to wipe out the drug evil by the enactment of
stringent laws governing the sale of narcotics. This step was
taken after an investigation by the authorities had disclosed
that not only was the narcotic habit strong among the poor, but
that it was spreading throughout virtually every class in the
city. </p>

<p>Until the passage of the laws druggists were permitted to sell
cocaine, morphine and opium to any purchaser. The new laws forbid
the sale of these drugs except in filling prescriptions prepared
by registered physicians. The city also has established
dispensaries for the treatment of drug addicts.<br>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XV -- HISTORY OF THE OPIUM TRADE IN CHINA</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>IN a vague way, we are familiar with the &quot;opium
evil&quot; in China, and some of us have hazy ideas as to how it
came about. The China Year Book for 1916 has this to say on the
subject: &quot;The poppy has been known in China for 12
centuries, and its medicinal use for 9 centuries. . . . It was
not until the middle of the 17th century that the practice of
mixing opium with tobacco for smoking purposes was introduced
into China. This habit was indulged in by the Dutch in Java, and
by them taken to Formosa, whence it spread to Amoy and the
mainland generally. There is no record to show when opium was
first smoked by itself, but it is thought to have originated
about the end of the 18th century. Foreign opium was first
introduced by the Portuguese from Goa at the beginning of the
18th century. In 1729, when the foreign import was 200 chests,
the Emperor Yung Ching issued the first anti-opium edict,
enacting severe penalties on the sale of opium and the opening of
opium-smoking divans. The importation, however, continued to
increase, and by 1790 it amounted to over 4,000 chests annually.
In 1796 opium smoking was again prohibited, and in 1800 the
importation of foreign opium was again declared illegal. Opium
was now contraband, but the fact had no effect on the quantity
introduced into the country, which rose to 5,000 chests in 1820;
16,000 chests in 1830; 20,000 chests in 1838, and 70,000 chests
in 1858.&quot; </p>

<p>The China Year Book makes no mention of the traders who
carried these chests of opium into China. The opium came from
India, however, and the increase in importation corresponds with
the British occupation of India, and the golden days of the East
India Company. &quot;Opium was now contraband, but that fact had
no effect on the quantity introduced into the country,&quot;
smuggled in wholesale by the enterprising British traders. </p>

<p>China was powerless to protect herself from this menace,
either by protests or prohibition. And as more and more of the
drug was smuggled in, and more and more of the people became
victims of the habit, the Chinese finally had a tea-party, very
much like our Boston Tea Party, but less successful in outcome.
In 1839, in spite of the fact that opium smoking is an easy habit
to acquire and had been extensively encouraged, the British
traders found themselves with 20,000 chests of unsold opium on
their store-ships, just below Canton. The Chinese had repeatedly
appealed to the British Government to stop these imports, but the
British Government had turned a persistently deaf ear. Therefore
the Emperor determined to deal with the matter on his own
account. He sent a powerful official named Lin to attend to it,
and Lin had a sort of Boston Tea Party, as we have said, and
destroyed some twenty thousand chests of opium in a very drastic
way. Mr. H. Wells Williams describes it thus: &quot;The opium was
destroyed in the most thorough manner, by mixing it in parcels Of
200 chests, in trenches, with lime and salt water, and then
drawing off the contents into an adjacent creek at low
tide.&quot; </p>

<p>After this atrocity, followed the first Opium War, when
British ships sailed up the river, seized port after port, and
bombarded and took Canton. Her ships sailed up the Yangtsze, and
captured the tribute junks going up the Grand Canal with revenue
to Peking, thus stopping a great part of China's income. Peace
was concluded in 1843, and Great Britain came out well. She
recompensed herself by taking the island of Hongkong; an
indemnity Of 21 million dollars, and Canton, Amoy, Foochow,
Ningpo and Shanghai were opened up as &quot;treaty
ports&quot;-for the importation of opium and the
&quot;open-door&quot; in general. </p>

<p>Mr. Wells, in his &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; describes the
origin of this first war with England: &quot;This war was
extraordinary in its origin as growing chiefly out of a
commercial misunderstanding; remarkable in its course as being
waged between strength and weakness, conscious superiority and
ignorant pride; melancholy in its end as forcing the weaker to
pay for opium within its borders against all its laws, thus
paralyzing the little moral power its feeble government could
exert to protect its subjects. . . . It was a turning point in
the national life of the Chinese race, but the compulsory payment
of six million dollars for the opium destroyed has left a stigma
upon the English name.&quot; </p>

<p>He also says, &quot;The conflict was now fairly begun; its
issue between the parties so unequally matched --one having
almost nothing but the right on its side, the other assisted by
every material and physical advantage-could easily be
foreseen&quot; and again, after speaking of it as being unjust
and immoral, he concludes &quot;Great Britain, the first
Christian power, really waged this war against the pagan monarch
who had only endeavored to put down a vice harmful to his people.
The war was looked upon in this light by the Chinese; it will
always be so looked upon by the candid historian, and known as
the Opium War.&quot; </p>

<p>Within fifteen years after this first war, there was another
one, and again Great Britain came off victorious. China had to
pay another indemnity, three million dollars, and five more
treaty ports were opened up. By the terms of the Treaty of
Tientsin, the sale of opium in China was legalized in 1858. </p>

<p>From a small pamphlet, &quot;Opium: England's Coercive Policy
and Its Disastrous Results in China and India&quot; by the Rev.
John Liggins, we find the following: &quot;As a specimen of how
both wars were carried on, we quote the following from an English
writer on the bombardment of Canton: 'Field pieces loaded with
grape were planted at the end of long, narrow streets crowded
with innocent men, women and children, to mow them down like
grass till the gutters flowed with their blood.' In one scene of
carnage, the Times correspondent recorded that half an army of
10,ooo men were in ten minutes destroyed by the sword, or forced
into the broad river. &quot; The Morning Herald &quot; asserted
that &quot;a more horrible or revolting crime than this
bombardment of Canton has never been committed in the worst ages
of barbaric darkness.&quot; </p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, after the termination of these two wars,
China gave up the struggle. She had fought valiantly to protect
her people from opium, but the resources of a Christian nation
were too much for her. Seeing therefore that the opium trade was
to be forced upon her, and that her people were doomed to
degradation, she decided to plant poppies herself. There should
be competition at least, and the money should not all be drained
out of the country. Thus it came about that after 1858 extensive
tracts of land were given over to poppy production. Whole
provinces or parts of provinces, ceased to grow grain and other
necessities, and diverted their rich river bottoms to the raising
of opium. Chinese opium, however, never supplanted Indian opium,
being inferior to that raised in the rich valley of the Ganges.
The country merely had double quantities of the drug, used
straight or blended, to suit the purse or taste of the consumer. </p>

<p>Then, in 1906, the incredible happened. After over a hundred
years of steady demoralization, with half her population opium
addicts, or worse still, making enormous profits out of the
trade, China determined to give up opium. In all history, no
nation has ever set itself such a gigantic task, with such a
gigantic handicap. China, a country of immense distances, with
scant means of communication; with no common language, a land
where only the scholars can read and write, suddenly decided to
free herself from this vice. The Emperor issued an edict saying
that in ten years' time all opium traffic must cease, and an
arrangement was made with Great Britain whereby this might be
accomplished. To the honor of America be it said that we assisted
China in this resolution. We agreed to see her through. </p>

<p>A bargain was then made between China and Great Britain, in
1907, China agreeing to diminish poppy cultivation year by year
for a period of ten years, and Great Britain agreeing to a
proportional decrease in the imports of Indian opium. A three
years' test was first agreed to, a trial of China's sincerity and
ability, for Great Britain feared that this was but a ruse to cut
off Indian opium, while leaving China's opium alone in the field.
At the end of three years, however, China had proved her ability
to cope with the situation. Thus, for a period of ten years, both
countries have lived up to their bargain, the amount of native
and foreign opium declining steadily in a decreasing scale. April
1, 1917, saw the end of the accomplishment. </p>

<p>China's part was most difficult. In the remote, interior
provinces, poppies were grown surreptitiously, connived at by
corrupt officials who made money from the crops. However, drastic
laws were enacted and severe penalties imposed upon those who
broke them. If poppy cultivation could not be stopped, England
would not hold to her end of the bargain. Not only was there a
nation of addicts to deal with, but these could obtain copious
supplies of opium from the foreign concessions, over which the
Chinese had no control. We shall show, in another article, to
what extent this was carried on. Yet somehow, in some manner, the
impossible happened. Year by year, little by little, one province
after another was freed from poppy cultivation, until in 1917,
China was practically free from the native-grown drug, and
foreign importation had practically ended. </p>

<p>In this manner, first by large smuggling, then by two opium
wars, was China drugged with opium. And in this manner, and to
this extent, has she succeeded in freeing herself from the curse.
But in one way, she is not free. She has no control over the
extra-territorial holdings of European powers, for in each treaty
port are the foreign concessions already mentioned-German,
Austrian, British, French, Russian. And in these concessions,
opium may be procured. Simply by crossing an imaginary line, in
such cities as Shanghai and Hongkong, can the Chinese buy as much
opium as they choose. China will never be rid of this menace till
she is rid of these extraterritorial holdings. Opium shops,
licensed by foreign governments, are always ready to supply her
people with the forbidden drug. </p>

<p>We say that the China market is closed. So it is, in one way.
But the British Opium Monopoly is not ended. The year 1917 saw a
tremendous blow dealt to the British opium dealers, but other
markets will be found. There are other countries than China whose
inhabitants can be taught this vice. The object of this
discussion is to consider these other countries, and to see to
what extent the world is menaced by this possibility. </p>

<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XVI -- CONCLUSION</h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>THERE are many people who advocate the use of opium, and who
defend the policy of the Opium Monopoly. They argue that it is
not harmful-if taken in moderation. They even assert that it is
no more objectionable than alcohol or tobacco. Leaving out of
account, therefore, the consensus of opinion of the medical
profession as to the evils of habit-forming drugs, and accepting
the theory that opium is harmless, we should then like to ask why
the use of opium is so carefully restricted to the peoples of
subject states, who have no voice in their own affairs? Why
should the benefits of opium be confined to Oriental races, and
why should not the white race be given the same opportunities for
indulgence? Is there any reason for this discrimination? As a
source of revenue, it certainly has advantages. Yet curiously
enough, those European countries which derive much profit through
the sale of opium to their subject races, seem to have an
aversion to introducing it to their people at home. And there is
a further coincidence in the fact that none of the self-governing
colonies of European countries-Australia, New Zealand and
Canada-permit this traffic. It appears to be only the subject
peoples, whose well-being has become the White Man's Burden, who
receive the blessings of this peculiar form of altruism. Is it
because the white race is worth preserving, worth protecting, and
because subject nations are fair game for exploitation of any
kind? </p>

<p>Another argument advanced by advocates of Government opium is
that the Oriental peoples are &quot;different&quot;-that opium
does them no harm. Every writer on the subject of opium in China,
produces evidence to show the shocking results upon that country,
during the hey-dey of the deluge. The complete moral degradation,
and economic ruin of thousands of helpless individuals. Nor do we
think the medical profession would agree with this assumption
that opium is harmless to Orientals, because they are
&quot;different.&quot; Their only real difference lies in their
helplessness to protect themselves from foreign aggression. </p>

<p>Another argument advanced by the upholders of the Monopoly is
that the Orientals have always been users of opium, that they
like it, it suits them, it would be unfair to deprive them of it.
We have seen to what extent the Chinese liked it, and how it was
forced upon them by two wars. Not until they were completely
crushed, and had to accept the terms of the conquerer, did they
submit. It can hardly, therefore, be called a vice indigenous to
the Chinese. Japan is another Oriental nation that disproves this
argument. As we have said before, there are no opium shops in
Japan, and the sale of opium is not conducted by the Japanese
Government. On the contrary, the Japanese have the same fear of
this drug that a European nation has, and exercises the same
precautions to protect its people. But, as we have said before,
Japan is the only Oriental nation that has not been subjugated by
a European nation, and therefore has never had opium thrust upon
her. She is the only country in the Far East that has managed to
preserve her sovereignty, and has never been subject to certain
blighting influences of European culture. </p>

<p>Another exception to this assumption that the Orientals cannot
do without opium lies in the Philippines. When America acquired
those islands some twenty years ago, our first act was to
eliminate the opium traffic, which had been established there by
our predecessors. It had been in existence for decades, but we
immediately set about to abolish it. Root and branch we did away
with it, and shed no crocodile tears as to the &quot; hardship
&quot; this would be to the people who had come under our
protection. We wished no revenue coming from such a source as
this. Yet we might have cut in half the cost of our Philippine
budget had we followed the example set by other nations. We have
seen that certain British colonies, Hongkong and the Straits
Settlements, for example, derive from one-third to one-half of
their upkeep expenses from this traffic. But we refrained from
treating our Filipinos in this manner. We are called
sentimentalists out in the East-at such times as we are not
called money-getters. To-day, the Philippines are very nearly
ready for self government. Would they have been so nearly ready
had we continued to drug them as they had been drugged before we
took possession? Drugged peoples are usually docile and
submissive-perhaps that is the secret of much of the successful
colonizing, about which we hear so much. </p>

<p>But let us leave aside the question of the Orientals, and
whether or no opium is good for them. We recognize quite clearly
that it is not good for ourselves, for Americans. We recognize
that fact quite as clearly as England realizes that it is not
good for the inhabitants of the British Isles. Quite as clearly
as France, while setting up opium shops in her colony of
Indo-China, refuses to establish them in Paris or Marseilles.
America is unique in the fact that although we have colonial
possessions, we do not have a double standard of morality. We
attempt to throw around our colonies the same safeguards that we
throw around ourselves at home. But the question arises, how
successful are we in protecting ourselves at home? Not
particularly so, according to the daily press. </p>

<p>How great the danger to ourselves was recognized some
thirty-seven years ago by an Episcopal missionary to China, the
Rev. John Liggins. In 1882 he published a small book, already
referred to, entitled: &quot;England's Coercive Opium Policy and
Its Disastrous Results in China and India.&quot; The preface to
this unheeded warning runs thus. &quot;Our aim in this sketch is
to present, as briefly as possible, the most important facts and
testimonies concerning a traffic which is as disgraceful to
England as it is ruinous to China and hurtful to India. . . . It
is also of the highest importance that the people throughout our
wide domain should be aroused concerning the new, fascinating and
deadly foe which has entered our country through the Golden Gate,
and which already numbers its victims by the thousands, and will
soon do so by the tens of thousands.&quot; </p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Liggins saw it coming-that danger which is almost
ready to overwhelm us to-day. He recognized clearly that the
Opium Monopoly of that great nation which rules nearly one-third
of the world-the British Empire would in time reach further and
further afield for new victims. It is too lucrative a trade to be
confined to only a few countries. Markets must not only be
created and legalized in subject states, but new ones added in
outside countries, through smuggling. All too fatally easy of
accomplishment, and so profitable, financially, as to be worth
any risk and effort. The prediction as to our own danger, made in
i882, seems to be abundantly realized. </p>

<p>The number of drug addicts in America to-day are fairly
startling. The number is variously estimated in New York City
alone as from ten thousand to one hundred thousand. It is said
that there may be a million in the country. Yet these figures are
the merest guesswork, by no means substantiated. Certain it is
that the campaign of the New York Health Department has uncovered
thousands of them, and any other city that chose to do so, could
produce facts equally startling. </p>

<p>The laws on our statute books concerning the prescription of
narcotic drugs are powerless to deal with the situation. It is
shooting into the air to try to &quot;regulate&quot; this
condition. It is as thoroughly well &quot;regulated&quot; as it
can ever be by the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, a Federal Law
whose enforcement is in the hands of the Internal Revenue
Department. By the provisions of this Act, every pound of opium
or its derivatives that comes into this country, legitimately, is
accounted for, and its distribution, both wholesale and retail,
made a matter of record. Thus, the Board of Trade returns show
the amount imported by the big wholesale drug houses. These must
account for their sales to the retail drug stores, and the
amounts must tally. The drug stores can only sell narcotic drugs
on a physician's prescription, and the prescriptions are kept on
file, and the quantity sold must correspond to the quantity
called for by these prescriptions, as well as to the amount
obtained from the wholesale drug house. In prescribing narcotics,
the physician is obliged to write his prescription in
triplicate--one copy for his own protection, one copy for the
local druggist, and one copy to be filed with the health
department. Nor is he allowed to prescribe narcotics for an
addict without decreasing the dosage. His prescription cannot
call for thirty grains of morphia day after day, it must show, in
a chronic case of this kind, a daily diminution of the amount
prescribed, thus indicating a desire to get the patient off the
drug, eventually. All these records are kept on file, open to
inspection whenever an accounting is demanded, consequently any
leak can be instantly accounted for. This Harrison Act is as
comprehensive and as nearly perfect as possible, yet it does not
cover the situation. By this means, violations can be detected,
whether on the part of an unscrupulous physician or druggist, or
even the wholesale house, but these violations are only
occasional. The root of the evil remains untouched. </p>

<p>At one time, it was believed that carelessness on the part of
the physician was chiefly responsible for creating drug addicts,
but the recent campaign against violators of the Harrison Act
seems to have completely exonerated him of this charge. For one
patient who becomes a drug addict while under a doctor's care,
through the accidental misuse of morphia, there are a hundred who
form the habit through other ways. It is not the occasional,
accidental victim, given morphia for the relief of pain, which is
creating our thousands of drug users. It is not the occasional
unscrupulous physician who is responsible. If this was all, we
could easily cope with these unwitting abuses, or even deliberate
instances of misuse. But the question goes deeper than this. </p>

<p>The Opium Monopoly was not established for any humane or
altruistic purpose. It was not established to provide the medical
profession with a drug for the relief of pain, to ease the agony
of the injured and wounded, or to calm the last days of those
dying with an incurable disease. This, which may be called the
legitimate use of opium, is not the object of the Opium Monopoly.
Used only in this manner, there would be no money in it. It is
only when opium is produced in quantities far in excess of the
legitimate needs of the world that it becomes worth while-to the
Opium Monopoly. That Monopoly was established not to relieve pain
and suffering, but with the deliberate intention of creating pain
and suffering, by creating drug victims by the thousand. It is
these hundreds of thousands of customers that are profitable. The
menace to America lies in the large amounts of opium which are
smuggled into the country for this purpose. Boys and girls o
sixteen and seventeen first acquire this habit through curiosity,
through association with what they call &quot;bad company,&quot;
peddlers who first offer it free, as a gift, well knowing that
after a few doses the fatal habit will be formed. Where do these
vendors obtain their supplies? </p>

<p>The daily papers often contain suggestive paragraphs. Thus the
&quot; New York Times,&quot; under date of February 28, 1919:
&quot; Seize Opium in Schenectady. Opium, valued by Federal
officials at $10,000 was seized in Schenectady, and four Chinamen
were arrested in a raid on Chinese places of business on Centre
street today. The Federal officials expressed the belief that
opium had been smuggled, and that Schenectady is the distributing
point for this part of the State.&quot; </p>

<p>An item in the &quot;Seattle Union Record,&quot; of June 24,
1919, gives us cause for further consideration. </p>

<p>BRITISH DRUG SHIP HELD BY UNITED STATES </p>

<p>FINE OF $49,265 ASSESSED FOR BRINGING &quot;DOPE&quot; TO
AMERICA </p>

<p>LINER ALLOWED TO MOVE UNDER BOND </p>

<p>NO ARRESTS MADE, THOUGH BOOZE IS FOUND ABOARD </p>

<p>No arrests were made up to Tuesday noon in connection with the
enormous seizure of opium, cocaine and liquor on the Blue Funnel
liner Cyclops, although the investigation is being continued by
federal officials. </p>

<p>The ship has been seized and a fine of $49,265 has been
assessed against her for having drugs not listed in the ship's
manifest. </p>

<p>United States District Attorney Robert C. Saunders filed a
libel Monday night against the Cyclops, the boat being seized
later by the customs service. Bond was fixed at $100,00, or twice
the fine. The Fidelity Surety Company filed the bond Monday. The
ship was released Tuesday morning. </p>

<p>A civil libel suit may be filed against Capt. W. Duncan,
holding him responsible for the liquor found on the ship. Captain
Duncan, questioned Monday by customs officials, claimed to know
nothing about the contraband. </p>

<p>The result of Monday's checking of the opium and cocaine
showed that the seizure amounted to 778 tins of opium, 670 ounces
of cocaine and 16 ounces of morphine. </p>

<p>A small paragraph in a New York paper, dated June 12, 1919,
reads thus: &quot;Two New Yorkers jailed for smuggling opium.
Pleas of guilty to charges of opium smuggling were entered in the
Federal Court today by Albertus Schneitzer and Maxwell Auerbach,
of New York. They were fined $500 each, and sent to Atlanta
penitentiary, the former for two years, and the latter for one
year. The men were arrested in connection with the seizure of
opium on the Canadian border.&quot; </p>

<p>We cannot grapple with our problem unless we face the facts;
if we ignore the source of supply and distribution, and the
reasons for this immense overproduction of opium on the part of
the British Opium Monopoly. The anti-narcotic laws on our statute
books are powerless to protect us. With Canada, a British
province, to the north, and all Mexico on the south, what chance
have we against such exposure? Of what use to send two smugglers
to the penitentiary, when at the Calcutta opium sales, once a
month opium is auctioned off under the auspices of the British
Government, to be disposed of as the buyers may see fit? Much of
it, as we have seen, goes to those helpless states and colonies
which have no control over their own affairs, where the opium
traffic is conducted under the administration of the alien
government. Much of the rest of it goes out for smuggling
purposes, to be distributed in devious, roundabout, underhand
channels throughout the world. We are coming in for our share in
this distribution. </p>

<p>We feel that our country is in grave peril. Our politicians
and our diplomats have been too careful all these years, to speak
of this business, through fear of offending a powerful nation.
But we feel that the time has now come to speak. England has been
relying upon our silence to &quot;get away with it.&quot; Upon
our ignorance, and upon that silence which gives consent. But in
this new, changed world, reborn out of the blood and agony of the
great war, is it not time to practice some of the decencies which
we have proclaimed so loudly? </p>

<p>As we have said before, no stronger opponents of this policy
are to be found than among a section of the people of England
itself. We look to them to join us, in this great issue, and we
feel that we shall not look in vain. </p>

firmly believe that any honest comparison of their evidence (such
as they have presented - not much) and arguments (generally weak,
emotional, and illogical) will lead any intelligent, reasonable
person to the truth. Therefore, I am including links to all the
other sites on the web which seem to be opposed to mine. Read and
compare yourself. I recommend to all my opponents that they do
the same, in order to make it easier for all interested parties
to get to the truth. However, I expect that none of them will.
The truth is that our opponents aren't much interested in the
truth. </p>

<p><b>Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization</b> </p>

<p><b>or How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</b> </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p><strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p>What follows in these pages is the Drug Enforcement
Administrations's booklet &quot;How to Hold Your Own In a Drug
Legalization Debate&quot; which outlines the top ten reasons why
they think &quot;legalization&quot; is such a bad idea. I will
examine their statements, sentence by sentence, and present
comments. Readers should note that, while the DEA has written a
book on how to survive when defending the War on (Some) Drugs,
the DEA has no interest in coming forward to actually engage in
such a debate. An open and honest public debate is the last the
thing the DEA wants. </p>

<h4>LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>Dear Reader: </p>

<p>You and I are frequently faced with the need to address many
of the positions which are advocated by those calling for the
legalization of drugs. More and more, the debate on legalization
is being given public airing in the media. Average citizens, fed
up with crime and drugs, are being told that legalization is a
reasonable alternative to the crime problem that so many
communities are struggling against. </p>

<p>You and I know that legalization is not an alternative, <b>but
</b>rather a surrender which will further reduce our quality of
life. Ninety percent of the American people agree that
legalization of drugs would complicate an already devastating
situation. Health and social costs associated with the increased
availability of drugs would break our economy. Crime would not
decrease. The moral fiber of our country would be torn apart. </p>

<p>Those who advocate legalization have many motives. But they
frequently do not have answers to a lot of the questions we are
asking. Legalization is an abstract to many of them. But I can
tell you firsthand, from my thirtyfour years' experience as a
lawenforcement officer at the state level, the damage caused by
drugs is real and lasting. It's not drug laws, or the enforcement
of the drugs laws of our nation that are causing harm--it's the
drugs themselves. </p>

<p>Because we're often called on to speak to the issues, I asked
a number of professionals from the law enforcement, health, and
academic communities to come together for two days to discuss how
we can best address the arguments against legalization. I am well
aware that local law enforcement officials are on the front line
in the battle against drug abuse. For that reason I asked several
police chiefs to participate in the Quantico Conference to give
their expertise and guidance as we formulated our response to
these issues. This guide represents most of the issues and
arguments raised during that time. This booklet is intended as a
resource for you as you are faced with the questions and issues
associated with the debate on the legalization of drugs. While
many professionals participated in the session, the views
represented in this document are the position of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. They represent the consensus of the
assembled group and without necessarily attributing each and
every position to the personal views of each participant. </p>

<p>Please feel free to use the guide in whatever way you feel it
is appropriate. The debate on the legalization of drugs cannot be
won if we remain silent. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p><strong>Thomas A. Constantine</strong> </p>

<p>Administrator </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<h3>The Reply to the DEA's Statement</h3>

<hr>

<h4>REPLY TO THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>The DEA really has no business spending taxpayer dollars to
promote their own political agenda. The DEA acts as lobbyist and
public relations firm for themselves and other special interest
groups which benefit from the drug war and it should be stopped. </p>

<p>In the course of this public advocacy the DEA distorts the
truth on many occasions, lies shamefully at times and draws
invalid conclusions from what is true. The purpose of this
booklet was to try to stop the damage being done when the drug
warriors were caught in public spouting the old mythology of the
drug war, but we will demonstrate clear examples of the lies and
distortions here in their book. </p>

<p>We agree that the debate on the legalization of drugs cannot
be won by anyone who remains silent. That is why we challenge the
DEA to bring forth their best against our best in an open public
environment where these issues can be discussed at length. We
have asked for an open debate on this issue since February 23,
1993 when the Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy
was first signed. It is only the DEA who is afraid to debate this
issue in public. </p>

<p>We challenge the DEA to show the strength and truth of their
arguments by supporting our call for an objective Federal
Commission where all of the issues and evidence can be fully
examined. If they are right, the evidence will show it. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer <br>

<p>THE DEA POSITION </p>

<font size="2">           <b>DEA Statement</b>                         <b>The Facts</b>               

DEA is unequivocally opposed to     As the DEA itself points out later   
the legalization of illicit drugs.  in their book, there is no clear     
                                    definition of &quot;legalization&quot; but,    
                                    whatever it is, they are against     
                                    it.                                  
                                                                         
                                    Actually, &quot;legalization&quot; is not the  
                                    issue, because we really don't know  
                                    if we will ever do it.  The issue    
                                    is really whether we need serious    
                                    reform of the current policy, no     
                                    matter what that reform may be       
                                    called.  It would be more accurate   
                                    to state that the DEA is             
                                    unequivocally opposed to any reform  
                                    at all.                              

Legalization in any form would      Whether a drug is perceived as       
likely:                             having risks and costs is not a      
                                    product of the law, but of public    
(1) reduce the perception of the    education.  Even if the law was a

                                    this still would not be a good       
                                    justification to throw individual    
                                    drug users in prison.                

(2) increase availability of and    It should first be pointed out that  
access to harmful drugs;            the DEA itself admits that it has    
(3) increase demand, use, abuse     never had a major impact on          
and addiction; and                  availability of drugs in the United  
                                    States and there is no hope that it  
                                    ever will.  In point of fact, this   
                                    policy often makes the illegal       
                                    drugs more available to              
                                    schoolchildren than alcohol is.      
                                    The availability of alcohol to       
                                    children was one of the major        
                                    reasons that alcohol Prohibition     
                                    was repealed.                        
                                                                         
                                    Whether availability, demand, use,   
                                    abuse and addiction would increase   
                                    depends upon what you mean by        
                                    &quot;legalization&quot;.  If you mean that    
                                    there would be cocaine vending       
                                    machines alongside the tobacco       
                                    vending machines, and convenience    
                                    store clerks would wink as they      
                                    sold heroin to children in the same  
                                    way that they wink when they sell    
                                    tobacco, then drug use might         
                                    increase.   If the drug laws are     
                                    somewhat more sensible, there is     
                                    good evidence to believe that drug   
                                    use would drop.                      

(4) remove the social sanction      There are many ways to have social   
against drug abuse that is          sanctions reinforced in legislation  
reinforced in legislation.          and everyone would agree that some   
                                    laws are necessary to achieve best   
                                    results with the drug problem.  The  
                                    question is whether it does any      
                                    good to enforce those social         
                                    sanctions with prison.  All the      
                                    evidence says that prison does more  
                                    harm than good.                      

The present social problems in the  The Drug War benefits only two       
United States, including crime,     groups of people -- The drug         
health problems and poverty, are    barons, and the drug enforcement

drugs become legal. The arguments   drug war guarantees high profits

                                    to the situation.                    

Any proposal with the potential to  The DEA has set up a straw man of

questions of those proposing

discussed. Instead simplistic                                            
rhetoric is used to deflect                                              
serious consideration of the many

the ramifications of their                                               
proposals. This is the great                                             
weakness of the prolegalization                                          
position. Participants in the                                            
Forum suggested that the following                                       
questions be asked consistently in                                       
order to illustrate the                                                  
shallowness of the legalization                                          
concept.                                                                 

Should all drugs be legalized ?     The question is not whether any      
                                    drugs should be &quot;legalized&quot; because  
                                    the DEA itself states further down   
                                    in this book that there is no real   
                                    definition of &quot;legalization.&quot;  Is    
                                    alcohol legal?  In some senses it    
                                    is, and in others it is not.  The    
                                    same is true of many other drugs.    
                                    If the DEA is right, we will never   
                                    &quot;legalize&quot; any of these drugs, so    
                                    they miss the point to focus on      
                                    &quot;legalization.&quot;                      
                                                                         
                                    The real question is prison.  Right  
                                    now we are embarked on a course      
                                    which will incarcerate millions of   
                                    people who, in the view of many of   
                                    the prison wardens in this country,  
                                    don't need to be in prison.  We are  
                                    turning loose violent felons so we   
                                    can incarcerate more drug users.     
                                    With these laws, we have the         
                                    opportunity to imprison literally    
                                    millions of people.  We must decide  
                                    how many millions of people we are   
                                    going to put in prison to make this  
                                    policy work.                         
                                                                         
                                    As a personal matter, I don't much   
                                    like cigars.  I think they are       
                                    addictive, dangerous, smelly, and    
                                    disgusting. I cannot understand why  
                                    anyone would want to walk around     
                                    with one of those things stuck in    
                                    their face,  and I make my feelings  
                                    known to anyone who lights one up    
                                    in my presence.  At the same time,   
                                    I don't want to put George Burns in  
                                    prison.                              
                                                                         
                                    No matter what policy we may         
                                    devise, or what name we may call     
                                    it, it is an undeniable truth that   
                                    putting people in prison does no     
                                    good at all.                         

Who will determine which segments   Who determines the access to drugs   
of the population will have access  now?                                 
to legalized drugs?                 Under &quot;legalization&quot; it would be     
                                    the same people who do it for        
                                    alcohol and tobacco.                 

Will they be limited only to        Are they limited to people over      
people over eighteen ?              eighteen now?                        
                                                                         
                                    Every major proposal for reform      
                                    assumes that minors should not have  
                                    access to drugs.  This is one of     
                                    the major reasons that many people   
                                    would like to see reform, because a  
                                    more sensible policy would do a      
                                    better job of keeping drugs away     
                                    from children.                       

Will cocaine, heroin, LSD and PCP   Are they available now?  As the DEA  
be made available if people         itself admits, their efforts have    
request them?                       never had any major effect on        
                                    availability of drugs and it is      
                                    unlikely that they ever will affect  
                                    the drug market.                     

Who will sell drugs? The            Who sells them now?                  
Government? Private companies ?     You can't think of anyone who could  
                                    do a better job than the current     
                                    sellers?                             

And who is liable for damages       The rules for liability should be    
caused by drug use and the          consistent for all drugs.  If you    
activities of those taking drugs?   get hit by a drunk or stoned         
                                    driver, it doesn't matter to you     
                                    which chemical caused the problem.   
                                    The damage is done in either case,   
                                    and should be addressed the same     
                                    under law.                           

Who will collect the revenues       Who collects them now?               
generated by the drug sales?        We have funded the richest criminal  
                                    organizations in the history of the  
                                    world with this policy. It is time   
                                    to take the money out of their       
                                    hands with a more sensible policy.   

How will a black market for         The same way it is controlled for    
cheaper drugs be controlled ?       alcohol and tobacco.                 

Who will bear the costs to society  Under the current system the         
of increased drug use?              taxpayers bear the entire cost, and  
                                    this system uses the single most     
                                    expensive, least cost-effective      
                                    approach to the problem -- prison.   
                                    For the same money it takes to       
                                    catch, try, and convict one drug     
                                    offender and to hold them in prison  
                                    for five years, we can provide       
                                    treatment or education for more      
                                    than one hundred people.  Which do

                                    cost-effective than prison.  Prison  
                                    does not do anything to address      
                                    these problems.

antibiotics, if drugs are           fundamental problems of our current  
legalized ?                         drug policy.  Antibiotics are an     
                                    entirely different class of drug     
                                    with an entirely different set of    
                                    uses and associated problems.        
                                    Therefore, it would be appropriate   
                                    to have a different policy for       
                                    them.                                

Will legal drugs require            That depends on what you mean by     
prescriptions?                      &quot;legal&quot;.  For example, both alcohol  
                                    and penicillin are &quot;legal&quot; but have  
                                    different requirements for           
                                    purchasing them.                     

Can anyone, regardless of physical  Who can purchase them now?

drugs?                              Can anyone, regardless of physical   
                                    or medical conditions purchase       
                                    alcohol or tobacco?  Alcohol and     
                                    tobacco are the big killers by a     
                                    wide margin. If we can manage to     
                                    find a workable policy for alcohol   
                                    and tobacco, then the other drugs    
                                    will be easy.                        

How can we deal with the influx of  We won't have to.  The rest of the

<h1>How to Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization Debate </h1>

<h1>THE TEN CLAIMS </h1>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The three groups discussing legalization at Quantico touched
on a number of significant issues. It was evident to the
participants that the prolegalization arguments have remained
fairly consistent over the years and that there are ten major
claims that can be made in opposition of legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The participants have missed the point again. The arguments
have changed over the last few years in particular, which is what
brought them to Quantico in the first place. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>We have attempted to provide the ten simple, compelling claims
to help you frame your arguments against legalization. The claims
are backed up by facts, quotes and statistics. Periodically,
these will need to be updated to ensure that the most current
information is being used to craft arguments against
legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>In this booklet, the DEA puts its arguments on the line. When
these ten claims are gone, it will have no more argument for
continuing this drug war. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM I: CRIME, VIOLENCE AND DRUG USE GO HAND IN HAND </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>In this claim, the DEA does the first of its major distortions
- the lumping together of all drugs into the same group.
Different drugs have different effects and, for some drugs, there
is clearly very little association with violence. Marijuana and
tobacco are two examples of drugs with little reason to believe
that they are connected to violence. The DEA does not mention
hemp (marijuana) in this Claim so we must assume that they agree
that this argument would not apply to hemp (marijuana) in any
case. </p>

<p>Even if we accepted the DEA's arguments that drugs, and not
prohibition, causes violence, the best way to reduce the crime
and violence would be to reduce the drug use. There is no
evidence that throwing people in prison is the most effective way
to reduce drug use. All the evidence shows that treatment and
education are more cost-effective. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization contend that if drugs were
legalized, crime and violence would decrease. They believe that
it is the illegal nature of drug production, trafficking and use
that fuels crime and violence. They state that turf wars, gang
activity and drugrelated crimes are the result of the illegal
nature of the drug trade. Proponents state that users commit
crimes to pay for drugs now because they cannot easily obtain
them. If drugs were legal, they say, the enormous profits
associated with drugs because of their illegal status would
evaporate and, once gone, the black market and criminal activity
associated with drugs would also be eliminated. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>If this was really the number one concern of the DEA then they
should be advocating tough prison sentences against alcohol. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. . .
        . </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../govpubs/psycviol.htm">Psychoactive Substances and
Violence</a>, published by the Department of Justice, Series:
Research in Brief, February 1994 </p>

<p>The image of the insanely violent drug user has been a common
argument for drug prohibition since the earliest days of the laws
when the New York Times published front page articles about
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends, New Southern Menace&quot;, and quoted
a sheriff saying, &quot;Those cocaine niggers sure are hard to
kill.&quot; (NY Times, February 17, 1914) It is an image which
has been used to justify the cruelest kinds of responses to
social problems, as shown by the sheriff's own words. It never
did have any basis in fact. </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own research clearly shows that
the only real connection between illegal drugs and violence is
the violence created by the fact that it is illegal. This is the
same kind of violence that we saw with respect to alcohol
Prohibition with the wars between rival alcohol distributors. It
was during this period that the Thompson submachine gun became a
symbol of gangs and Prohibition. All of that ended when
Prohibition ended. Violent crime dropped 65 percent in the year
Prohibition was repealed and it continued to drop every year
thereafter until World War II. (Need citation from Ethan N. on
this one.) We could expect similar results from the repeal of
drug Prohibition. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum, who are experts in
crime and violence, disagreed strongly with the notion that crime
and violence would be reduced if drugs were legalized. It is
widely claimed by those advancing the case for legalization that
crime is largely committed by drug traffickers protecting their
turf. Sadly, it is the experience of many local police officers
that crime is committed not only because people want to buy
drugs, but more often because people use drugs. There is no
denying the fact that drug use changes behavior and exacerbates
criminal activity. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own studies of the issue disagree.
See the information presented above. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts also believe that legalization will lead to
increased availability of drugs, which will, in turn, lead to
increased use. The use of drugs, especially cocaine, crack,
methamphetamine, and PCP is often associated with violent
criminal behavior. There is ample evidence which demonstrates the
links between drugs, violence and crime, and the links between a
currently legal substance--alcohol--and crime is well documented.
Police can attest to the fact that alcohol plays a significant
role in domestic violence cases. Drug use would only swell the
statistics regarding crime, even if the drugs were legally
purchased. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Department of Justice's own studies of the issue disagree.
</p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents ignore the fact that the people
committing violent crimes are career criminals who will not stop
their illegal activities once drugs are legalized; they will
instead seek new sources of illicit revenue. Criminal activity
would not be reduced as a result of drug legalization any more
than gangster activity disappeared after the Repeal of
Prohibition. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the argument that if we &quot;legalized&quot; drugs
then the criminals would just find another line of work. There is
nothing else which offers the opportunity to get rich so easily.
By comparison, all the other crimes are hard work. </p>

<p>The DEA says that criminal activity would not be
&quot;reduced&quot; because gangster activity did not
&quot;disappear&quot; after the repeal of Prohibition. Of course,
anyone who has seen &quot;The Untouchables&quot; should know that
gangster activity was significantly &quot;reduced&quot; after the
repeal of Prohibition, even if it did not &quot;disappear&quot;.
Therefore, we could expect similar results again. </p>

<p>This is an interesting argument. We must keep drugs illegal
because it gives work to criminals who might be doing something
more dangerous if we did not. That is, having these people sell
drugs is a good thing because it keeps them out of bigger
trouble. Relatively speaking then, selling drugs is not so bad as
other potential crimes so we should make sure they keep doing it.
</p>

<p>Of course, then the question becomes: What would happen if we
actually did stop the flow of drugs? Would we have to start
manufacturing drugs and distributing them through these same
criminals just to keep them from doing something worse in
society? </p>

<p>According to this argument, we are better off if the drug war
never does succeed. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group discussed the fallacy that legalizing drugs would
eliminate the black market environment which seems to fuel the
drug trade and its attendant violence. The existence of a black
market is heavily dependent on the parameters set by the
legalizers: which drugs would be legal, the potency level of
drugs and the age at which legal drugs could be purchased. If
drugs were legal for persons over 18, for example, drug
traffickers would still target those 17 and younger; if only
marijuana were legalized, drug traffickers would continue to
traffic in heroin and cocaine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Who do the drug traffickers target now? What drugs do they
traffic in now? </p>

<p>No sensible person pretends that any drug policy is going to
solve all the problems related to drugs. That is clearly
unrealistic. At the same time, there is no reason to undertake
policies, such as we have now, which only make the situation
worse. </p>

<p>Let's face it. The DEA never has had any effective control
over the drug markets and they never will. By taking this
approach the DEA has insured that only the outlaws will have
control of drug sales and distribution. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> A report in the Journal of the American Medical Association
(7/6/94) reports that cocaine use is linked to high rates of
homicide in New York City and that &quot;homicide victims may
have provoked violence through irritability, paranoid thinking or
verbal and physical aggression which are known to be
pharmacologic effects of cocaine.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DOJ's own studies, mentioned above, tell a different
story. </p>

<p>What the DEA is alluding to here in the last part of this
paragraph is the fact that people are more likely to be victims
or homicide than to be perpetrators of homicide while under the
influence of cocaine. The same statistic is true of alcohol. What
it means is that people who get stoned on anything sometimes do
stupid things, such as getting themselves killed. This is even
more true of alcohol, but does not make a good reason to throw
people in prison for drinking wine or beer. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> An April, 1994 report titled &quot;Violent Drug Related
Crime&quot; compiled by Drug and Crime Data Center and
Clearinghouse indicates that drugs are used by many offenders
committing crimes. In 1991, the following percentages of State
prison inmates involved in violent offenses reported that they
had used drugs at the time the offense was committed. </p>

<p>Violent Offenses: 28% </p>

<p>Homicide: 28% </p>

<p>Sexual Assault: 20% </p>

<p>Robbery: 38% </p>

<p>Assault 23% </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Drug and Crime Data Center and Clearinghouse reports that
they have no publication with this title. The Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics of 1992 lists the breakdown of drug
use during commission of violent offenses. The figures shows
that, with the exception of robbery, about 75 to 90 percent of
all the reported drug use was use of alcohol, not illegal drugs.
For robbery, the figures are roughly equal. </p>

<p>People who commit violent crimes are likely to have a lot of
problems in their lives, including use of illegal drugs as well
as higher rates of use of alcohol and tobacco. That doesn't
necessarily mean that one problem is causally related to another.
</p>

<p>Even if we assumed, as the DEA implies, that all of this was
due to illegal drugs, they don't mention comparison data for the
number of people who took whatever drug and did not commit a
violent crime. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed the DEA is right, there is no evidence that
the best way to control the problem is to put people in prison. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice (US Department
of Justice) Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program underscore the
crimedrugs link. Of a sample of males arrested in 24 US cities in
1991, the percent testing positive for at least one drug in the
DUF survey ranged from 36% in Omaha to 75% in San Diego. Among
female arrestees, the percent testing positive for any drug
ranged from 45% in San Antonio to 79% in Cleveland </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The data of the Drug Use Forecasting program is interesting
but it does not underscore the crime-drugs link. The data are
simply measures of the number of people arrested who had drugs in
their system. There is no similar comparative data on people who
were not arrested, or did not commit crimes. </p>

<p>It is also a long way from showing any causal relationship
between drugs and crime except, perhaps, for the fact that people
who are stupid enough to get severely drunk or stoned are prone
to do stupid things. That would not make it a good idea to have
drug prohibition any more than the fact that we arrest people who
are drunk and disorderly makes it a good idea to have alcohol
prohibition. </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h1>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> A May 1993 Bureau of Justice Statistics report states that
&quot;Drug use was common among inmates serving time for
burglary, robbery or drug offenses. Among inmates serving a
sentence for burglary or robbery, about 6 in 10 inmates had used
drugs in the month before the arrest for the current offense, and
about 4 in 10 were under the influence at the time of the
offense.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of inmates who used drugs in the month before the
arrest is as irrelevant as the number who drank a beer during the
month before the arrest. </p>

<p>It should be noted that being under the influence of drugs is
a convenient excuse which seems to suit everybody involved in a
criminal prosecution. The defendant can plead that he wasn't
himself because he was out of his mind on drugs and thereby play
on the court's sympathies for leniency. The prosecutors can point
to another horrendous drug problem, which suits their interests
as well. </p>

<p>The same study indicates that female inmates were more likely
than male inmates to have used drugs in the month before the
offense (54% versus 50%) and to have been under the influence at
the time of the offense (36% versus 31 %). </p>

<p>Another finding of the study indicated that among 18-49 year
old males, those who had used alcohol, cannabis and cocaine at
some point during the past year were ten times more likely to
commit a violent act (26.1 percent versus 2.7 percent) than those
who used none of the above. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA conveniently ignores the fact that alcohol has the
highest association with violence and that cannabis (hemp) has
none. </p>

<p>The DEA contends that, because someone had a beer up to a year
ago, they are potentially violent today. </p>

<p>There is no evidence of a causal relationship here at all.
Even if there was, there is no evidence that prison would be the
best way to control drug use. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D., president of a major New York
City drug treatment center, Phoenix House, and chairman of the
New York State Advisory Council on Substance Abuse, notes that
one of the basic contentions of advocates of legalization is that
drug users are essentially normal people. Actually, Dr. Rosenthal
said in a speech in 1993, drugs undo the bounds that keep many
seemingly normal people on an even keel. &quot;The treatment
community does not contend that society is at risk from the
behavior of all drug abusers or even the great majority of
them,&quot; he said. &quot;The case for prohibition rests on the
substantial number of abusers who cross the line from permissible
self-destruction to become 'driven' people, who are 'out of
control' and put others in danger of their risk taking, violence,
abuse or HIV infection.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA argues that drug users are not &quot;essentially
normal people&quot;, even while they state that at least
two-thirds of them are gainfully employed taxpayers. </p>

<p>As for undoing &quot;the bounds that keep many seemingly
normal people on an even keel&quot; and all the other problems
mentioned, these problems are equally true of alcohol. Yet they
do not recommend that we bring back Prohibition of alcohol. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together, as if they
all had the same effects. General statements about
&quot;all&quot; drugs are intentionally misleading. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The International Association of Chiefs of Police published
a report in 1993 titled &quot;Violent Crime in America.&quot; It
states &quot;Drug abuse and crime, both violent and nonviolent,
are linked. National Crime Victimization surveys in 1989 and 1990
revealed over 2,000,000 crimes committed by offenders under the
influence of drugs or alcohol...this represented 36% and 34% of
total violent crime recorded by the surveys.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The important phrase here is &quot;drugs or alcohol&quot;. The
table below shows that alcohol's association with violent crime
is far greater than the association of all illegal drugs
combined. The biggest problem is alcohol, and yet no one is
suggesting that we have a war on booze. </p>

<p>Again, the DEA attempts to lump all drugs together as if they
were all equally responsible for the problems. It is
irresponsible and misleading to lump all drugs together,
particularly in view of the large role that alcohol plays in the
figures. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Bureau of Justice Statistics surveys indicate that
&quot;25% of convicted inmates in jails, 33% of state prisoners,
and 40% of youths in stateoperated facilities admit being under
the influence of an illegal drug at the time of their
offense.&quot; (BJS, Drug and Crime Facts, 1992) </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>One reason is that a large number of them are in jail for
selling illegal drugs. </p>

<p>Again, it is misleading to lump all drugs together as if they
were all equally responsible and to imply a causal relationship. </p>

<p>The more complete figures, in the table below, show a somewhat
different picture. </p>

<h3>Some Effects of Illegal Drugs </h3>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA's table of the effects of illegal drugs is a notable
example of their failure to consider the whole picture. The table
does not include any information on the effects of either alcohol
or tobacco for comparison, even though these drugs are clearly
the bigger problems in our society. </p>

<p>Some of the information in the table the DEA presented is, of
course, patently wrong but, in the interest of brevity, we will
forgo the detailed rebuttal of the information in this table. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM II: WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING DRUG
USE IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO ABANDON OUR EFFORTS. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No one has suggested that we should &quot;abandon&quot; our
efforts to reduce the problems associated with drugs. What we
have suggested is that we should make those efforts more
cost-effective. Prison is not cost effective. </p>

<p>Even if we accepted this claim as true, there is no evidence
that the progress in reducing drug use was at all due to the
number of people put in prison. In fact, the evidence clearly
shows that the number of people put in prison could not have had
enough of an impact on the average white, middle-class drug user
to make any difference at all in drug use. If there was any
actual reduction in drug use (and not just in
&quot;reported&quot; drug use) then it seems clear that it must
have been due to other factors. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that the fight against drugs has
not been won, and is, in fact, unwinnable. They frequently state
that people still take drugs, drugs are widely available, and
that the changing that fact is a lost cause. Legalization is the
alternative. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It should be clear to anyone that the war on drugs has not
been won. There is no credible evidence anywhere which would
suggest that the war could be won by the current methods, and the
DEA has presented no such evidence here. The alternative is to
look for a better approach, whatever we might choose to call it. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The conference participants disagreed with the notion that we
should wave the white flag of surrender because people still take
drugs. The experts contended that there have been many positive
developments over the past fifteen years in reducing drug use,
and stated that the good news is often given short shrift. Our
drug problem did not happen overnight, and it will take a number
of years to eliminate the problem. Legalization is not an
alternative to combating the drug problem. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As happened with Vietnam, there comes a point when must
recognize that we never should have taken this course in the
first place. It is not surrender to end the war on drugs, it is a
recognition of what we should have recognized years ago. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The United States faces a number of problems today which, like
our drug problem, are not susceptible to easy solutions,
including illegal immigration, declining education quality and
public health problems. Should we just post signs on our borders
that we've given up and invite a tide of immigrants in? Should we
declare that our education system has been a failure and give
children a permanent vacation from school? Should we throw up our
hands in frustration about AIDS and stop searching for a cure? Of
course not. Americans are a people committed to solving problems,
not running from them. Why should our commitment to stopping
drugs be any different from our approach to other national
interests? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no doubt that there are many difficult problems. Of
all the problems mentioned, the DEA does not propose to solve any
of them by throwing people in prison. </p>

<p>The final question here asks for a commitment to
&quot;stopping drugs&quot; which, the DEA itself admits, is
clearly impossible. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Furthermore, ask proponents of legalization just what they are
proposing be legalized. Just marijuana? Marijuana and heroin? All
drugs? </p>

<p>And for what age group? Will children be able to buy drugs? </p>

<p>Will prescriptions be necessary? </p>

<p>And what will they tolerate as the price of legalization? A
permanent underclass of drug users? </p>

<p>Will a 10% increase in the number of traffic fatalities be
accepted? What about 50%? </p>

<p>Would they be relieved to know that their child care provider
had been smoking legally-purchased marijuana? How many
borderbabies is too many? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The question really is: for what drugs are we willing to throw
people in prison? </p>

<p>Can children buy drugs now? Obviously, they can because only
the outlaws control distribution of drugs. The questions try to
insinuate that people in favor of reform want to distribute drugs
to children. Nothing could be further from the truth. The
question also conveniently ignores the fact that the number one
drug killer, tobacco, is still freely available to children
through vending machines. </p>

<p>There are any number of possible policies, besides the current
one. The question of whether prescriptions would be necessary
should not stop us from recognizing that prison is unnecessary. </p>

<p>We already have a permanent underclass of drug users. </p>

<p>There is no evidence that the number of traffic fatalities
would change. About half of all traffic fatalities are now caused
by alcohol, but the DEA does not propose that arresting all the
people who drink beer or wine is a sensible solution. </p>

<p>The laws and social rules for things such as caring for
children would not change regardless of the legal status of any
drug. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> The 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, released
in July, 1994, demonstrates unequivocally that drug use declined
significantly between 1979 and 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The same figures show it is going back up again, particularly
among children. Those figures show large increases in the last
year alone -- and the laws have not changed. </p>

<p>It must also be recognized that the data gathering methods of
this survey are open to question. The survey is conducted by
calling people at random on the telephone and asking if anyone in
the household has committed a felony (used drugs) in the past few
weeks or months. Instead of an accurate measure of the amount of
drug use, it may just be a measure of the number of people who
are stupid enough to answer such a question from a stranger on
the phone. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In 1993, an estimated 11.7 million Americans were current
illicit drug users, meaning they had used an illicit drug in the
month prior to the interview. This represents no change from 1992
when the estimate was 11.4 million. The number of illicit drug
users had been declining since its peak in 1979 at 24 million. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA needs to take elementary math again. The figures shown
represent a rise of 300,000 drug users. </p>

<p>The figures show one thing above all else-- there is no way we
can throw that many people in prison, and our jails are full
already. How many of these millions does the DEA propose that we
throw in prison? </p>

<p>The DEA's own figures also clearly show that all of the
supposed decline in drug use has been among casual drug users.
Their own figures show that this policy has had no effect on the
number of hard core drug users, where the problem really lies. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The number of current cocaine users remained at 1.3 million
users in 1993, the same as 1992. This is down from a peak of 5.3
million in 1985. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does the DEA suggest that we throw all 1.3 million cocaine
users in prison? </p>

<p>Since 1979, rates of current illicit drug use have dropped for
12 17 year olds, 1825 year olds, and 2634 year olds, but not for
the age group 35 and older. </p>

<p>The latest figures show that drug use among these groups has
risen dramatically again, and yet the laws are just as harsh as
they always were. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Teenage drug consumption, despite recent upturns, is down
in the long term. There is an obvious concern in the United
States about the consumption of drugs by teenagers--the adults of
tomorrow. Recent upturns demonstrate to us the clear need to
continue doing what we've done for more than the past decade:
combine law enforcement, education, and international efforts to
address all aspects of the drug situation. The Monitoring the
Future Study, conducted annually by University of Michigan
research scientists for the US Department of Health and Human
Services, has been tracking the drug consumption of American high
school seniors since the 1970s. In the past few years, the study
has been broadened to embrace drug use by 10th grade and 8th
grade students as well. </p>

<p><a name="DDE_LINK10"><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif"
align="bottom" width="562" height="19"></a> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is obviously wrong. See the latest figures cited above. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>When the first Monitoring the Future Study was published, 27.1
% of the members of the Class of 1975 (eighth and 10th graders
were not surveyed then) reported having used marijuana or hashish
in the previous month. The figure for the Class of 1980 was
33.7%--which puts that 2.4% figure 13 years later into
perspective. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>If the study is looking at the drug use of eighth to tenth
graders then it would seem obvious enough that the campaign to
put people in prison would not have had much real effect on this
group. This is evidence that any drop in use was not due to
tougher criminal enforcement. </p>

<h2>CLAIM III: LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS WILL LEAD TO INCREASED USE
AND INCREASED ADDICTION LEVELS </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A cornerstone of the legalization proponents' position is the
claim that making illegal drugs legal would not cause more of
these substances to be consumed, nor would addiction increase.
They claim that many people can use drugs in moderation and that
many would choose not to use drugs, just as many forego alcohol
and tobacco now. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy agreed that there is no
evidence that drug use would increase with more sensible
policies. In fact, they found that drug use would probably
decrease with more sensible policies. </p>

<p>They also found that, even if drug use did increase,
decriminalization would still be a better approach simply because
of all the harm caused by the current policy. See the list of the
Biggest Studies of Drug Policy, also on these web pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum felt strongly that
when drugs are more widely available--as they certainly would be
if they were legalized--rates of use and addiction would
increase. </p>

<p>Legalizing drugs sends a message that drug use (like tobacco
and alcohol) is acceptable, and encourages drug use among people
who currently do not use drugs. </p>

<p>When the social taboos about premarital sex were removed, the
nation's illegitimate birthrate soared. And we are paying dearly
for it. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>All of the arguments here depend upon what you mean by
&quot;legalized&quot;. </p>

<p>No, it does not send any such message, and our society's
campaigns against tobacco are perhaps the best example. And of
course, the real question is: How many millions of people do we
have to put in prison to show the right amount of disapproval? </p>

<p>This is a &quot;TV-talk-show&quot; argument, which blithely
ignores the fact that the illegitimate birth rate is due to
problems much more complex than the taboo on premarital sex. </p>

<p>Does this mean that, as a solution, the DEA is proposing that
we throw people in prison for premarital sex? There are lots of
ways to discourage something without throwing people in prison. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Look to our history. For years, the United States legally
refined morphine from opium, and hailed it as a miracle drug.
Many soldiers on both sides of the Civil War who were given
morphine for their wounds became addicted to it. Are we ready for
more morphine addicts? Crack addicts? Heroin addicts? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Morphine was first refined when many battle wounds were
treated with simple amputation without anesthesia and a doctor
was considered a good surgeon if he could do the amputation
quickly to minimize the pain. In the medical context of that type
of &quot;surgery&quot; and the fact that there were no
antibiotics to control infections, morphine was a real miracle
drug because it relieved a great deal of suffering. </p>

<p>The figures differ on the number of Civil War veterans who
became addicts, partly because of the difficulty in defining what
an addict is. There was widespread use of these drugs simply
because there were no regulations at all during this period and
they were included in many common patent medicines, including
remedies for baby colic. There is no evidence that the Civil War
veterans who became addicts were any more of a problem to society
than a modern tobacco addict. The 1905 Pure Food and Drug Act was
the first law to require manufacturers to state the contents of
their mixtures on the label. This was clearly a good law because
it helped consumers make an informed decision. Drug use declined
steadily between the time the law was passed and 1914, when the
Harrison Narcotics Act was passed. See any of the major studies
listed elsewhere in this book for a more complete history of the
subject. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Early in the 20th Century, drugs were plentiful, cheap, and
legal in the United States. Some could even be bought from the
Sears Catalogue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But Americans realized that these legalized drugs were harmful
to individuals and society, and drug laws were written. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is not true. The reasons were more complex than this and
were largely based on racism and ignorance. No evidence was
presented to Congress to show that prohibition was either
necessary or desirable. No evidence was even presented to show
that these drugs were even medically harmful. In the case of
cocaine and the opiates, it is doubtful if Congress realized it
was passing what would be regarded as a general prohibition on
these drugs because it was phrased as a tax act. In the case of
marijuana (hemp) it is clear that most members of Congress did
not realize that they were passing a law to prohibit the most
common crop in America. These laws were a hoax from the very
begining. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>CocaCola took the coca out of its popular soft drink and
substituted caffeine. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is true. The original name of Coca-Cola was &quot;French
Wine of Coca -- Invigorating Tonic&quot;. It is also true that
there was a campaign to outlaw caffeine for the same reasons that
cocaine was outlawed. That campaign died when it was realized
that caffeine was contained in too many common foods, such as
coffee, tea, and chocolate. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization proponents would have them put it back, and make
opium as available as chewing gum. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is a flat-out lie and a cheap, deliberate attempt to
distort the arguments. It shows that the DEA has set up
&quot;legalization&quot; as a straw man, defined in their own
extreme terms. We do not agree with this extreme policy, or the
DEA's extreme definition of &quot;legalization&quot;. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>More recently Alaska decriminalized the personal use of small
amounts of marijuana in the home. The experiment did not turn out
the way legalization proponents had predicted. Although the legal
age for using marijuana was 19, adolescents as young as 12 years
old were using the drug. Alaskans eventually came to the
realization that decriminalization did not work, and voted to
overturn the law. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Twelve-year-olds using marijuana (hemp) is nothing new. I
observed pre-teens using marijuana (hemp) more than twenty-five
years ago, and it appeared to me that it was fairly common among
children of that age. Decriminalization in any area has never
been shown to have any real effect on the use patterns of
marijuana. </p>

<p>The law was overturned because of a massive campaign headed by
then-Drug-Czar William Bennett as one of the cornerstones of his
campaigns against the evils of drugs. Bennett, at the time, was a
tobacco addict. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts believe that legalization of drugs would decrease
the perception of risk currently associated with drug use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Let's assume that the DEA experts are right. How many millions
of people do we have to put in prison to create the proper
perception of risk? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The group strongly endorsed the notion that the Government
should help protect people from substances and activities that
are harmful to themselves the community and society at large. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>So why aren't we throwing people in prison for alcohol or
tobacco? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Dr. Herbert Kleber, prominent psychiatrist from Yale
University, former Demand Reduction Deputy Director at the Office
of National Drug Control Policy and currently with the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, states in a
1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine that clinical
data support the premise that drug use would increase with
legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not define what he means by
&quot;legalization.&quot; There are any number of different
policies which could be defined as &quot;legalization,&quot; each
of which could have widely varying effects. Therefore, all the
rest of his statements on the subject are essentially
meaningless. Even if he did define what he means by
&quot;legalization&quot;, it is not the only option we have for
drug policy. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>He says: &quot;There are over 50 million nicotine addicts, 18
million alcoholics or problem drinkers, and fewer than 2 million
cocaine addicts in the United States. Cocaine is a much more
addictive drug than alcohol. If cocaine were legally available,
as alcohol and nicotine are now, the number of cocaine abusers
would probably rise to a point somewhere between the number of
users of the other two agents, perhaps 20 to 25 million...the
number of compulsive users might be nine times higher...than the
current number. When drugs have been widely available--as...
cocaine was at the turn of the century--both use and addiction
have risen &quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>See the table below for the latest ratings on the relative
addictive qualities of drugs. </p>

<p>Dr. Kleber does not suggest that the most productive approach
to the 50 million nicotine addicts, or the 18 million alcoholics,
is to put alcohol or tobacco users in prison. Why not? </p>

<p>Drug use was widespread at the turn of the century. This
statement ignores the fact that drug use and addiction fell
steadily after manufacturers were required to list the
ingredients in their products. </p>

<p> England's experience with widely available heroin shows
that use and addiction increase. Great Britain allowed doctors to
prescribe heroin to addicts. There was an explosion of heroin use
and by the mid-1980s known addiction rates were increasing by
about 30% a year. According to the Lancet, the wellrespected
medical journal (Lancet, January 9, 1982), 2,657 heroin addicts
were registered in 1970 compared with 5,107 in 1980. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>By the mid-1980's Great Britain was fully into the American
style drug war so it is apparent that, if there is any connection
between the drug war and addiction, the drug war must have made
the problem worse. </p>

<p>It is also worthwhile to note that the figures show that the
number of heroin addicts doubled in ten years, but the numbers
were still trivial in comparison to the number of addicts in any
comparable segment of the United States. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>This was a program in which heroin users needed a doctor's
authorization to get their drug. What would happen if anyone
wanting to try heroin could simply buy it at the government
store? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<p>The vast majority of them would throw up after using it and
find they really didn't like the effects. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alaska tried the legalization experiment and abandoned it.
Legalization was given a lengthy try closer to home when the
Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that the state could not
interfere with a person's possession of marijuana in his home for
personal use. Enforcement was permitted only when the quantity
possessed exceeded four ounces--this in a state that, because of
the long, sunny days of its brief growing season, produces extra
potent marijuana. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Alaska's ruling applied to personal possession of hemp
(marijuana) and use within the confines of one's own home. This
is a far cry from the &quot;legalization&quot; the DEA talks
about elsewhere. The court decided that the right of privacy
protected the citizen's rights within their own home. </p>

<p>All states are capable of producing extra potent marijuana.
Alaska is nothing special in this regard. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The court's ruling was interpreted by many Alaskans as a
signal to light up, and so they did, especially the young ones,
even though the ruling was limited to persons 19 and over.
According to a 1988 University of Alaska study, the state's 12 to
17yearolds used marijuana at more than twice the national average
for their age group. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is ludicrous to state that an Alaskan Supreme Court
decision would be interpreted by anyone as a &quot;signal to
light up.&quot; It is highly doubtful if teenagers govern their
behavior based on Supreme Court decisions. Anyone who wants to
use a drug is going to do so regardless of what the Supreme Court
may have said about it. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;The frequency with which marijuana was used within the
current sample,&quot; the report on the study said,
&quot;suggests that it is not an experimental event for many
students, but that it seems to have become well incorporated into
the lifestyle of many adolescents.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And the DEA suggests that the best way to improve these
students lives is to hunt them down and put them in jail to cure
them of their lifestyle. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Although they historically cling to their personal liberties,
Alaska residents voted in 1990 to recriminalize possession of
marijuana, demonstrating their belief that increased use was too
high a price to pay for increased personal liberties. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>A referendum was passed in 1990 by Alaska voters which
attempted to overturn the Alaska Supreme Court decision. The
referendum was the result of an intensive, well-funded campaign
by then-Drug Czar William Bennett and other drug wars to remove a
major embarrassment to their cause -- the fact that Alaska had
protected private use of marijuana and Alaskan society had not
fallen apart as a result. The courts later threw out the vote
because the issue had been decided on a matter of basic
constitutional protections of privacy, which cannot be voted away
under Alaskan law. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Will the public support an aggressive marketing approach?
While &quot;government drugs&quot; could conceivably be priced
low enough, perhaps by having taxpayers subsidize them to
discourage a black market, the combination of low price and ready
availability would bring more consumption, more addiction. We
would have won the battle and lost the war. If they see this as
the probable outcome, the American people can hardly be expected
to endorse a &quot;sell at all costs&quot; policy. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Why should there be an aggressive marketing approach? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Robert L. DuPont, M.D., former director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, considered the impact legalization would
have on use and addiction rates in a paper published in 1994. </p>

<p>&quot;Would legalization increase the number of drug users and
the social harm produced by the use of drugs?&quot; Dr. DuPont
asked. &quot;The answer to those two questions is simply, 'Yes,
it would.&quot;' </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The answer to this question is simply: What
&quot;legalization&quot; are you talking about? Until you define
what you mean by &quot;legalization&quot; you can't define what
the likely effect on the number of drug users and social harm. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The current global experience with alcohol and tobacco reveals
the downside of legalization clearly, Dr. DuPont said. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is certainly true, keeping in mind the fact these drugs
are only legal under certain conditions. Despite this, Dr. DuPont
is not suggesting that we outlaw alcohol and tobacco as the most
appropriate response. Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization of any drugs leads to large increases in
the use of the legalized drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;Because most
of the social costs of drugs are not the costs of prohibition but
the costs created by the drug use itself (a point proved beyond
dispute by the dismal global experience with alcohol and
tobacco), legalization raises the net social costs of drug use. </p>

<p><a name="DDE_LINK12"><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif"
align="bottom" width="562" height="19"></a><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Even if we assumed this to be true, every major study of drug
policy has said that the cost of the current policy far outweighs
the other potential costs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Legalization is an old, siren call which promises to
reduce the high costs of drug use, but which abundant evidence
shows would inevitably raise the costs society pays for drug use,
not reduce them. We do not need new experiments to make <br>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM IV: ANY REVENUES GENERATED BY TAXING LEGALIZED DRUGS
WOULD QUICKLY EVAPORATE IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED SOCIAL COSTS
ASSOCIATED WITH LEGALIZING DRUGS. </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>A favorite argument in support of legalization is that
education, health care, road building and a wide array of other
worthwhile causes would benefit from the taxes that could be
raised by legalizing drugs and then taxing them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>On the whole, it certainly seems better than sending all that
money to Colombia. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The conference participants were extremely skeptical about the
claim of a large tax windfall, and challenged advocates to prove
that the amounts of revenue potentially generated by legalization
would counterbalance the increased social costs that would result
from making drugs legal. When asked for specifics, they have no
answers. </p>

<p>Are they taking into account the erosion of the tax base as
more and more citizens are unable to work because of drug
addiction? Add to this loss the cost of health and welfare
benefits for the unemployed. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no tax windfall, large or small, right now. The only
revenue generated is the revenue generated from money and
property seizures, which is fraught with its own problems. </p>

<p>The DEA has asked the American taxpayers to support an
open-ended program of building more prisons. When they are asked
for specifics, such as how many prisons they propose to build,
they have no answers. </p>

<p>Does the DEA take into account the erosion of the tax bases by
the fact that -- by their own estimates -- two-thirds of the
people they propose to throw in prison are gainfully employed
taxpayers? Does the DEA take into account the fact that, once
these people have a prison record, they may be permanently
unemployed because no one wants to hire an ex-convict? Putting
people in prison doesn't do anything to reduce unemployment
problems, except for prison guards. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would increase.
The panel predicted that drug treatment costs, hospitalization
for longterm drug related disease, and treatment of the
consequences of family violence would further burden our already
strapped health care system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy disagreed with this point.
See the list elsewhere on these pages. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There is also real reason to believe that liability suits
would be brought against manufacturers and distributors of drugs
as damages to individuals increased, thereby increasing the cost
of products. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As opposed to the current situation, where there is no one to
bring a liability suit against. </p>

<p>Liability suits have not yet put the alcohol and tobacco
industries out of business, or made their products too expensive.
If this was a real concern, alcohol and tobacco would still be
the major concerns. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask legalization proponents if the alleged profits from drug
legalization would be enough to pay for the increased fetal
defects, loss of workforce productivity, increased traffic
fatalities and industrial accidents, increased domestic violence
and the myriad other problems that would not only be high income
items, but extremely expensive in terms of social decay. How much
are they willing to pay? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The number of fetal defects caused by alcohol are far greater
than the number for illegal drugs so this argument is a red
herring. If the DEA was really concerned about fetal defects,
they would concentrate on alcohol first. </p>

<p>The DEA acts like these problems are not here already, and
that the best method of preventing them is to throw people in
prison. In every case, these problems are already here, and
throwing people in prison is not the best approach to the
problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>Dr. William Olson, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for International Narcotics Matters, outlines the magnitude of
the social costs borne now by U.S. taxpayers because of drugs. In
his 1994 essay, &quot;Drug Legalization: Getting to No,&quot; he
provides the following: </p>

<p> 2560 percent of the homeless are addicts, whose
homelessness is in large part the result of addiction and their
inability to manage money or make rational, reasonable decisions.
They are increasingly supported at public expense. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is the result of the current policy which is, in itself,
a good argument against what we are doing. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 7580 percent of the 1.2 1.5 million teenage runaways are
substance abusers, and not because prohibition made them use
drugs or run away. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, and prohibition didn't keep them from using drugs either.
Runaways are usually children who have severe problems at home
which cause them to engage in all sorts of deviant behavior. The
drug laws do not do anything to address the underlying problem.
The law only makes the runaways' problems worse if they are
caught using drugs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 3050 percent of mental patients are chemical abusers, 5060
percent of these crack and cocaine. They are largely on public
support. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The only thing this would show is that people with severe
mental problems are likely to try to self-medicate themselves. It
does not show any causal connection between drug use and
insanity, except perhaps that insanity causes greater drug use.
It says even less about what would a sensible public policy for
addressing the problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> As many as 11 percent of young mothers use drugs during
pregnancy. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is what is happening under the current system. A more
sensible approach might reduce the number. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 2.5 percent of all live births, some 100,000 babies are
born addicted to cocaine. They have lifelong learning
disabilities and emotional problems. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no support for this claim at all and the DEA knows
it. The DEA is lying. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> $50 billion is devoted annually to dealing with the health
care costs of drug addiction and its collateral costs. These will
not disappear with legalization. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Those costs haven't disappeared with prohibition either. In
fact, every major study of the subject says that prohibition only
makes those costs greater. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There are approximately 500,000 heroin and 2 million other
substance abusers. Their care is increasingly a demand on
society. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>According to the DEA's own figures, shown above, the current
policies have had no effect on this problem at all. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> There is no way to predict how much revenue would be
generated by the United States Government taxing legalized drugs.
Such a scenario depends entirely upon the parameters of
legalization, and what the policy means vis a vis sources of
drugs. If U.S. farmers were given subsidies to produce drugs (as
they are given subsidies for tobacco) the U.S. taxpayers would be
responsible for paying for these subsidies. If foreign sources of
drugs (opium or coca) were allowed to supply the raw material for
these products, an elaborate system of tariffs and trade
preferences would need to be established. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is true that there is no way to predict tax revenues until
one makes some assumptions about &quot;legalization&quot;. One of
the reasons is that the DEA doesn't have a clue how big the
market for drugs really is. This should not stop us from
recognizing that prison is a net revenue loser. </p>

<p>These are curious arguments. They bring up the question of
whether we should have subsidies for tobacco in the first place,
especially in view of the fact that it kills 100 times as many
people as all the illegal drugs combined. Why does our government
give subsidies to tobacco farmers while it throws marijuana
(hemp) farmers in prison? Our drug laws plainly make no sense at
all. </p>

<p>Trade and tariffs would be handled as they would for any other
commodity and the fact that tariffs might be complicated is not a
good argument for throwing American citizens in prison. </p>

<p>We also have to ask, who controls the trade and tariffs now?
And what are the trade and tariff rules now? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Taxes would likely push the cost of the product up. Taxing
the drugs would make them more expensive at the checkout counter.
The drug cartels do not provide a share of their receipts to
their respective governments. They are all business. Anyone going
into competition with them, including the U.S. Government, would
have to be all business too, prepared to cut prices, if
necessary, to stay in the game. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Prohibition pushes the cost of the product up. The main
difference would be that the revenues would not be used to fund
other crime. </p>

<p>The same arguments were equally true of alcohol during alcohol
Prohibition. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Legalized gambling has not put illegal gambling out of
business. In fact, legalized gambling has produced a whole new
group of people who cannot control their need to gamble. Many
states have gone into the gambling business to raise funds for
public purposes, with some success, although as more
jurisdictions get into it the profits decline. Meanwhile, bookies
ply their trade as they always have. The reason is the payoff
they offer is better than the legal gambling schemes. For every
million dollars wagered, that is, they return a higher percentage
to the winners. Again, it' s a matter of overhead. The bookies
are not trying to build schools, so they don't have to earmark a
percentage of the profits for such endeavors. So long as that is
so, they will always have a market that is loyal to them. The
same situation could logically occur if drugs were legal. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And prohibition has not put the drug dealers out of business,
it has only made them richer. </p>

<p>In places where gambling is legal, illegal bookies do not have
higher payoffs than the legal gambling schemes, except in the
case of state lotteries which have notoriously poor payoff
percentages. </p>

<p>No one contends that any scheme will entirely eliminate the
black market in drugs, and the current policy is the best
example. However, a better policy could greatly reduce many of
the problems associated with the black market, as happened with
the repeal of alcohol Prohibition. <br>

<p>It is quite easy to refute this argument for both drugs. </p>

<p>Medically speaking, heroin is simply a stronger form of
morphine. Therefore, if there is a legitimate medical use for
morphine, then there is a legitimate medical use for heroin.
Heroin was once used medically in a manner similar to morphine
and was even used for pain relief during childbirth. Doctors
state that heroin is a good drug for medical use because it is
safe, powerful, and short acting. Recent research indicates that
pain-killers can be important healing agents after patients
undergo major surgery, because these drugs reduce the stress on
the central nervous system. In some cases, the amount of time
required to heal can be cut in half. Some research shows that the
best doses of morphine are perhaps ten times what they were
considered to be just a decade ago. </p>

<p>In the case of marijuana (hemp), there is already an approved
prescription drug, Marinol, which is derived from the primary
active ingredient in marijuana and used for the conditions for
which marijuana (hemp) is recommended. Marijuana (hemp) itself
would not be approved as a prescription drug because of FDA rules
which state that a medicine must consist of only the active
ingredients and a filler. Therefore, the rules themselves
prohibit the approval of any natural substances such as a plant,
even though the active ingredients in the plant and the
prescription drug are precisely the same. </p>

<p>The question then becomes, why should a sick person pay sixty
dollars a pill when they can grow the same medicine in their own
backyard for free? </p>

<p>Some patients report that the homegrown version of the
medicine is far superior to the prescription version for a couple
of reasons. One reason is that marijuana (hemp) is often used to
treat nausea and it is often hard to keep pills in their stomach
when they have nausea. Some of them have complained that it is
awfully depressing to vomit up a sixty dollar pill. Therefore, it
is better if the medicine is smoked because it bypasses the
stomach and gets the medicine into the body much more quickly.
Another reason that some sick people prefer marijuana (hemp) over
Marinol is that Marinol makes them &quot;higher than a
kite&quot;, and they don't want to be high, they just want their
medical symptoms relieved. By smoking marijuana (hemp), they can
limit the amount of &quot;high&quot; they get. </p>

<p>Marijuana (hemp) has traditionally been used in medicines for
thousands of years. Prior to 1937, it was the most common
agricultural crop in America and was used for literally thousands
of purposes, including rope, cloth, paper, fuel, and medicine. It
was prescribed for a wide variety of ailments and was included in
up to two-thirds of all over the counter preparations. Prior to
1937, cannabis (hemp) was completely unregulated and it would
have been impossible to regulate cannabis (hemp) because it was a
major agricultural crop grown nearly everywhere. Cannabis (hemp)
derivatives were included in a wide variety of items consumed by
the general public. Despite this widespread, unregulated
consumption, there were no reported problems. The American
Medical Association was opposed to the marijuana (hemp) laws in
1937 for these reasons. The promoters of these laws openly lied
about the AMA's attitude toward the law in order to get it
passed. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>It is often suggested that, even if currently controlled
substances are not made available to the general public, some of
them, particularly marijuana and heroin, could be used to relieve
suffering. </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum acknowledged that
arguments urging the medical use of marijuana are often used as
an entree into the legalization debate. Medical use arguments can
garner public support because they seem harmless enough to the
uninformed audience. The experts agreed that these issues are
peripheral to the real issue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA has no business making decisions or statements about
the proper medical use of anything. The fact that they do is only
one more example of what is wrong with our current drug policy. </p>

<p>There should be no argument at all that it is up to the
medical profession and its patients to define what is, or is not,
a proper medical treatment. The police do not have the required
professional knowledge to determine proper medical uses, they do
not know what difficulties individual patients may face in their
treatment or what benefits patients might receive, and they care
even less. It is absurd to pretend that complex medical decisions
can be made for every patient in the United States by an
organization such as the DEA. </p>

<p>The problem goes beyond the illegal drugs such as marijuana
and heroin. The problem extends to pain killers of all types in
general. The severity of this problem was seen in the recent case
of Florida versus Martinez. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez was a lay AIDS counselor who ran a drug buyers
club for AIDS patients. A drug buyers club purchases medical
drugs which are available in other countries but not in the
United States and distributes them to sick people here. Mr.
Martinez was charged with distributing morphine without medical
training or a license. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez did not deny the fact that he distributed
morphine to people and that he was in violation of the drug laws.
His only defense was that his actions were a medical necessity,
because of the barbaric policies of the DEA against people who
were in pain. The defense brought forth experts who testified how
the DEA had prosecuted and imprisoned doctors for prescribing
Tylenol 3 -- Tylenol with codeine -- a drug which is not even a
prescription drug except in the United States and South Africa,
and the US is the only control in the world which has ever sent a
doctor to prison for prescribing it. They testified about AIDS
patients who suffer from a nerve degeneration all over their body
which makes them scream in pain every time they are even touched.
For many of them, a simple bath can be painful beyond belief, and
yet they cannot get pain medication because their doctors are
often afraid to prescribe it because they fear what the DEA could
do to them. </p>

<p>After the jury heard the evidence on the government's drug
policy, they voted unanimously for acquittal. This trial was
shown on Court TV and has been repeated many times because it is
one of the most interesting trials they have ever shown. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The medical pros and cons of prescribing marijuana and heroin
to sick people are best debated by medical professionals. It
should be kept in mind, however, that marijuana has been rejected
as medicine by the American Medical Society, the American
Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the
International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, and the
American Cancer Society. </p>

<p>HHS report </p>

<p>Not one American health association accepts marijuana as
medicine. Statements issued by these organizations express
concern over the harmful effects of the drugs and over the lack
of solid research demonstrating that they might do more good than
harm. </p>

<p>The International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies,
for instance, said in a statement issued by its Therapeutic
Claims Committee in 1992: &quot;Further studies are required to
determine whether marijuana has a clinically useful effect on
multiple sclerosis. In view of the possible toxic effects of
longterm use, its use cannot be recommended. In the opinion of
the committee, there appears to be no generally accepted
scientific basis for use of this therapy. It has never been
tested in a properly controlled trial. Longterm use may be
associated with significant serious side effects.&quot; </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Under the federal statute known as the Controlled
Substances Act, regulated drugs are divided into categories known
as schedules. In Schedule I, for instance, are drugs with a high
potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States. At the other end of the spectrum
is Schedule V, which is for drugs that have a low potential for
abuse and have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States. The Act provides a mechanism for substances to
be controlled (added to a schedule), decontrolled (removed from
control), or rescheduled (transferred from one schedule to
another). </p>

<p>Heroin and marijuana are in Schedule I; cocaine, which is
sometimes used as a local anesthetic, is in Schedule II. Much of
the debate about medical uses for currently illegal drugs
concerns substituting heroin for morphine and supplying marijuana
to AIDS and glaucoma patients or using it to treat side effects
of chemotherapy. </p>

<p> A petition to put marijuana in a less restrictive schedule
of the CSA was rejected by then DEA Administrator John C. Lawn,
after public hearings, on December 29, 1989. The United States
Court of Appeals ordered further proceedings, however, to clear
up what it felt were some ambiguities in the record.
Administrator Robert C. Bonner, who succeeded Lawn, complied and
issued a new ruling on March 26, 1992. &quot;By any modern
scientific standard, marijuana is no medicine, &quot; Bonner
said. The three judge appeals court upheld the ruling unanimously
on February 18, 1994. &quot;Our review of the record convinces us
that the Administrator's findings are supported by substantial
evidence,&quot; the court said, noting the &quot;testimony of
numerous experts that marijuana' s medicinal value has never been
proven in sound scientific studies.&quot; <br>

<h2>CLAIM VI: LEGALIZATION AND DECRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS HAVE
BEEN A DISMAL FAILURE IN OTHER NATIONS. </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> <br>
</h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The experiences of a number of foreign countries including
Great Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland are often cited to
demonstrate that other nations have successfully controlled drug
use by offering access and areas where drug takers can obtain and
use drugs. Recently, an MTV documentary on the drug issue
highlighted coffeehouses in Amsterdam as a model for controlled,
successful environment in which young Europeans can enjoy
marijuana. </p>

<p>There was also a 60 Minutes segment on the drug clinics in
Liverpool, England, a special on the Arts &amp; Entertainment
Channel, and a special on ABC which explored the situation in
Europe. </p>

<p>Legalization proponents cannot find encouragement in the fact
that when drugs were once legal, cheap and available in the
United States, the impact on society was such that laws were
enacted to make drugs illegal. They ignore our own history and
point to Great Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland as free
and open societies where drug use is allowed with no adverse
effects. The Quantico experts believed it is important to shed
light on the foreign experience with increased drug access and
liberalized use policies, and explain that this experience has
been negative </p>

<p>The statement of our own history is plainly false. Interested
readers should any of the major studies of drug policy listed in
this book. </p>

<p>England tried prescribing heroin but gave it up. Until the
mid1960s, British physicians were allowed to prescribe heroin to
certain classes of addicts. After this experiment, according to
James Q. Wilson in his 1990 article &quot;Against the
Legalization of Drugs&quot;, &quot;a youthful drug culture
emerged with a demand for drugs far different from that of the
older addicts.&quot; </p>

<p>The British system didn't work. Addiction levels rose,
especially among teenagers, and many addicts chose to boycott the
program and continued to get their heroin from pushers. </p>

<p>In 1983, England began switching over to methadone and stopped
dispensing heroin from the clinics, and that caused even more
addicts to depart in favor of the real thing. According to the
late John Kaplan of Stanford University, the number of addicts
increased fivefold. James Q. Wilson states that the British
Government's experiment with controlled heroin distribution
resulted in, at a minimum, a 30fold increase in the number of
addicts in ten years. </p>

<p>The Netherlands, despite its controlled program, is having
troubles. Under the socalled &quot;expediency principle&quot;
Dutch law protects individuals from prosecution for acts that are
technically illegal, including the retaillevel sales and purchase
of marijuana and hashish. Dutch police are also instructed to
ignore streetlevel sales of all types of drugs. </p>

<p>The Amsterdam Municipal Health Service showed a rise in
hardcore addicts in 1992, attributable to a significant rise in
the local heroin supply which led to a price drop of as much as
75%. </p>

<p>Switzerland has become a magnet for drug users the world over.
One thing small European nations have learned is a little
tolerance about drugs brings a lot of unwelcome visitors. In
1987, Zurich permitted drug use and sales in a part of the city
called the &quot;Platzspitz&quot;, dubbed &quot;Needle
Park.&quot; Five years later the experiment was curtailed after
an influx of addicts and increased violence and deaths. In 1992,
Zurich Municipal spokesman Andres Ohler told the New York Times
that the number of regular drug users at the park had swelled
from a few hundred in 1987 to 20,000 by 1992. After the
Platzspitz closed, the price of heroin reportedly doubled. </p>

<p>RESOLUTION </p>

<p>EUROPEAN CITIES </p>

<p>AGAINST DRUGS </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>A number of European cities have taken the initiative of
organizing a Conference </p>

<p>for Cities Against the Legalization of Drugs. One of the aims
of the conference is </p>

<p>to adopt a resolution to enable towns that have not
participated in the conference to </p>

<p>support its work. </p>

<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The tide of the
drug policy debate began to turn against the DEA with the advent
of the Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy
(sometimes referred to as the Hoover Resolution). A copy of this
Resolution and a list of some of the major signers is included in
this book. </p>

<p>The purpose of the conference is to increase cooperation
between cities, to provide </p>

<p>inspiration and hope for areas with particularly difficult
drug problems. The signatories to the resolution will affirm
their decision to fight against the spread of drugs. </p>

<p>The DEA apparently thought the Resolution for a Federal
Commission on Drug Policy was so important that they figured they
had to trump up something to counter it. The result is this
really phony and poorly worded resolution against drugs. It is
notable that the DEA did not name any of the people who signed
this resolution on behalf of their entire city. </p>

<p>STOCKHOLM  28TH APRIL 1994 </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In April, 1994, a number of European cities signed a
resolution titled &quot;European Cities Against Drugs,&quot;
commonly known as the Stockholm resolution. It states: &quot;The
demands to legalize illicit drugs should be seen against the
background of current problems, which have led to a feeling of
helplessness. For many, the only way to cope is to try to
administer the current situation. But the answer does not lie in
making harmful drugs more accessible, cheaper and socially
acceptable. Attempts to do this have not proved successful. We
believe that legalizing drugs will, in the long term, increase
our problems. By making them legal, society will signal that it
has resigned to the acceptance of drug abuse. The signatories to
this resolution therefore want to make their position clear by
rejecting the proposals to legalize illicit drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>It is interesting to note the differences between the
Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy and this
resolution. The biggest difference is that the Resolution for a
Federal Commission on Drug Policy does not say anything about
&quot;legalization&quot; but simply asks for an objective review
of the evidence. The DEA's resolution does not call for any
objective review of the evidence and, in fact, rejecting even the
idea of a discussion of alternatives. </p>

<p>Pointing to the appropriate international treaties which
require nations to &quot;protect children from the illicit use of
narcotic drugs,&quot; the signatories state that they
&quot;reject all demands for legalizing illicit drugs... We
request that our Governments respect and with determination apply
those conventions and agreements regarding drugs which they have
signed.&quot; </p>

<p>Again, the DEA's resolution calls for a blind rejection of any
ideas but there own, without consideration of any evidence. </p>

<p>The cities signing this resolution include: Berlin, Stockholm,
Budapest, Dublin, Gdansk (Poland), Gothenburg (Sweden), Helsinki,
Paris, Lugano (Switzerland), Madrid, Malmo (Sweden), Moscow,
Oslo, Prague, London, Reykjavik (Iceland), Riga (Latvia), St.
Petersburg (Russia), Tallinn (Estonia), Valletta (Malta) and
Warsaw. </p>

<p>It is notable that the DEA does not mention who in these
cities signed on behalf of the entire city. It is also notable
that many of the cities are former Soviet Union cities with
little experience in these areas. </p>

<p> A study by the Rotterdam Municipal Council shows that the
number of cocaine users there has risen substantially. About 3.3%
of all Rotterdam residents over 15 years of age or approximately
12,000 people now use cocaine. </p>

<p>Violent crime is also a major problem in the Netherlands. A
1992 study of crime victims in twenty (mostly European) countries
ranks the Netherlands as the number one country in Europe for
assaults and threats. </p>

<p>The Dutch Criminal Intelligence Service reported 104
gunrelated deaths in the Netherlands in 1992, compared to 73 in
1991. Almost all involved drug disputes. Robberies have also
increased in each of the four years since 1988. </p>

<p>The Netherlands, smaller than West Virginia, has more than 50
clinics supplying methadone to heroin addicts, and drug violators
make up a large percentage of prisoners in the Dutch prison
system. </p>

<p> Zurich authorities moved many addicts to a new site, a
nearby abandoned railway station, a few blocks north of Needle
Park. Here, addicts receive clean needles and are allowed to
inject heroin and consume other drugs. Writing in Drug Abuse
Update in 1994, Sue Rusche, executive director of National
Families in Action, gave this description of what passersby can
see if they look down from the Kornhaus Bridge: </p>

<p>&quot;Most people think shots are bloodless events. A nurse
inserts a needle, injects a medicine and you're on your way. But
here, bright red blood streams down arms, necks, legs, feet and
groins as addicts inject themselves. Festering red and purple
sores filled with pus, old blood and filthy scabs stretch from
wrist to elbow, ankle to knee.&quot; <br>

<h2>CLAIM VII: ALCOHOL HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT HEALTH, SOCIAL AND
CRIME PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND LEGALIZED DRUGS WOULD ONLY
MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Many legalization advocates are fond of comparing the use of
alcohol with the use of drugs, yet draw faulty conclusions from
the comparison. People often consume small amounts of wine or
beer as a beverage and do not necessarily drink to the point of
mental impairment. This is not true of drug use, where the whole
point of use is intoxication. A more accurate analogy would be to
compare drug use to drunkenness. Yet even that analogy is weak,
because drugs are far more addictive than alcohol, and have no
cultural or social value. Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal points out, for
example, that only 10 percent of drinkers become alcoholics,
while up to 75 percent of regular illicit drug users become
addicted. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The point of use of alcohol is intoxication, just as it is for
the illegal drugs. Even small amounts of alcohol will relax a
person or change their mood. This is intoxication, it is just a
mild intoxication. If you don't want the intoxication, there is
very little reason to drink alcoholic wine or beer instead of
their non-alcoholic versions. The alcoholic versions are the
major sellers so it is a fair assumption that most alcohol
drinkers want the mild intoxication which comes from a couple of
beers. </p>

<p>Most users of most drugs want a relatively mild intoxication
from their drug of choice. That is one of the main reasons that
wine and beer outsell the harder beverages, and why most illegal
drug use is the use of marijuana. </p>

<p>This argument is a distortion in itself because it lumps all
illicit drugs together, as if they had the same capacity to
addict. Clearly, there are major differences between drugs such
as heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, and Dr. Rosenthal is
irresponsible not to point them out. </p>

<p>Dr. Rosenthal's figures could not possibly be true, based on
the DEA's own evidence shown above in their chart showing the
supposed drop in drug use. The DEA's own figures shows the number
of regular drug users is far higher than the number of addicts
and always has been. By the DEA's own figures at least 85 percent
are not addicted, and at least 70 percent are gainfully employed.
</p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization note--correctly--that alcohol kills
many more Americans than do illegal drugs and currently exact
social and financial costs that are higher as well. Advocates
claim that many people do not use alcohol, and that many
Americans may also choose to forego drugs. Like treatment
programs available for alcohol addicted people, treatment for
drug addicts should be more widely available. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA admits that alcohol causes far more damage than the
illegal drugs but they don't seem to propose that we bring back
alcohol Prohibition. </p>

<p>What the DEA does not say is the degree to which alcohol and
tobacco cause more damage than illegal drugs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts assembled at the AntiLegalization Forum pointed to
already overburdened health care and social systems that are
unable to address all the problems associated with alcohol use.
Instead of compounding these problems, and acknowledging the
crime problems made worse by alcohol use, the group stated that
legalizing drugs would create undue burdens on the criminal,
health and social service systems. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The group points out that the &quot;already overburdened
health care and social systems . . . are unable to address all
the problems associated with alcohol use&quot;, yet no one
proposes that we bring back alcohol Prohibition as the best
approach to the problem. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Alcohol use in this country has taken a tremendous physical
toll on Americans, not to mention the social problems that have
resulted from its use. Legalization proponents would have us
compound our problems by creating a new class of drug addicted
Americans. Again, how much are we willing to tolerate? To pay
for? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Should we bring back alcohol Prohibition as a means of dealing
with alcohol problems? Clearly not. The message of Prohibition is
clear: Alcohol is bad, but Prohibition is worse. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Look at the problems that alcohol abuse has wrought. In the
1920s those advocating the repeal of Prohibition argued that
crime and other social ills would be alleviated if alcohol were
legal. Has that happened? We now have approximately 11 million
alcoholics or problem drinkers in this country whose behavior has
contributed to lost productivity in the workplace, fetal defects,
traffic fatalities, domestic violence and other crime. If drugs
were made legal, the numbers and the problems would swell. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Is the DEA arguing that the best approach to the alcohol
problems is to bring back Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The simple fact is that if drugs are made legal, more people
will use drugs. There will be higher health and social costs;
there will be more crime. Some facts which help to confirm the
observations of the forum participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Wickersham Commission, which was originally formed to
improve alcohol Prohibition, found that alcohol use fell in the
first year of Prohibition but rose every year thereafter. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In a May, 1993 report titled &quot;Survey of State Prison
Inmates,&quot; the Bureau of Justice Statistics states that 32%
of inmates committed their offense under the influence of
alcohol. Slightly more than twofifths of inmates convicted of
homicide or assault committed their current offense under the
influence of alcohol or of alcohol with drugs. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is another curious argument. It is clear that the biggest
problem here is alcohol, as the DEA itself states. If the DEA was
really consistent in their position, they would advocate the
return of alcohol prohibition. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> According to the 1993 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, about 11 million Americans were heavy drinkers in 1993
(drinking five or more drinks per occasion on five or more days
in the past 30 days). Heavy alcohol use has changed little since
1985, when there were 12 million heavy drinkers. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Assuming the figures are accurate, it would obviously not be a
sensible approach to the problem to attempt throw all these
people in prison. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The same report indicates that &quot;of the 11 million heavy
drinkers in 1993, 26 percent (3 million) were also current
illicit drug users.&quot; The report goes on to say that
&quot;Current smokers are more likely to be heavy drinkers and
illicit drug users. Among smokers in 1993, 11 percent were heavy
drinkers and 12 percent were illicit drug users.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA seems to be trying to make the discredited argument
about &quot;gateway drugs&quot;. That is, they used to contend
that some drugs, by some as-yet-unexplained process, naturally
created a craving for totally unrelated drugs in people who had
never used drugs before. This was a holdover from their earlier,
plainer and even more easily discredited argument that marijuana
leads to heroin. (Which, by the way, was in direct contradiction
to Harry Anslinger's testimony before Congress when marijuana was
outlawed.) </p>

<p>People who engage in one form of risky behavior often engage
in other risky behaviors. That is the only thing that these kinds
of statistics could show. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> In a 1993 report by Brandeis University, it was estimated
that the United States spent $10.5 billion on health care related
to alcohol use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Then why shouldn't we bring back Prohibition as the best way
to deal with the problem? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alcohol is blamed for between $140 and $210 billion per
year in lost productivity. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Then why shouldn't we bring back Prohibition as the best way
to deal with the problem? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> 17,461 people were killed in alcohol related traffic
incidents in 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>That is almost as many people as the American Medical
Association estimates were killed by all illegal drugs from all
causes combined. Clearly, if the DEA wanted to do something about
the real drug problem, it would be of more benefit to concentrate
their enforcement efforts on alcohol. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Michigan's Director of the Office of Drug Control Policy,
Robert Peterson, states that &quot;It is estimated that alcohol
abuse costs the nation $100 billion per year and over 300 lives
per day, an amount that the $18 billion in state and federal
excise tax revenue does not begin to cover.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And yet no one contends that throwing wine and beer drinkers
in prison is a sensible approach to this problem. <br>

<h2>CLAIM VIII: DRUG CONTROL SPENDING IS A MINOR PORTION OF THE
U.S. BUDGET, AND COMPARED TO THE COSTS OF DRUG ABUSE, SPENDING IS
MINUSCULE. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that this nation has spent
billions of dollars to control drug production, trafficking and
use with few, if any, positive results. They contend that the
money spent on drug control should be shifted to other, more
productive endeavors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This whole claim is another curious argument. It seems that
the DEA is saying, &quot;We don't take very much money in the
bigger scheme of things, so leave us alone.&quot; From my own
perspective, I still regard several billion dollars as a lot of
money. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that a lot of money is spent on drug
enforcement and there is no doubt that even the DEA has never
claimed that it ever had any significant effect on reducing the
supply of drugs. If a program to spend several billion dollars is
as useless as this one, it behooves us to look for a better
approach. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The truth is, we have made great progress in reducing drug use
during the past 15 years. If the relatively modest outlays of
Federal dollars had not been made, drug abuse and attendant
social costs would have been far greater. The good news is that
drug use has declined significantly between 1979 and 1993. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Whether drug use has been significantly reduced is open to
question, particularly in view of the survey methods used to
arrive at such conclusions. </p>

<p>Even if we assumed that this statement is true, it would still
leave open the question of whether any other approach might have
produced better results. That is a question the DEA does not even
want to consider. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The experts participating in the Anti-Legalization forum
disputed the claim that money allegedly saved from giving up on
the drug problem could be better spent on education and social
problems. When compared to the amount of funding that is spent on
other national priorities, drug control spending is minimal.
There has been progress in reducing drug use, and the money spent
has been effective and worthwhile. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This argument is illogical. The participants state that the
money could not be better spent on education and social problems
because &quot;drug control spending is minimal.&quot; Whether the
spending is minimal (by their terms) has no bearing on whether
the spending is wise. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>On the surface, legalization proponents present an appealing,
simple argument that by legalizing drugs we can move vast sums of
money from drug law enforcement into solving society's ills. They
leave unanswered questions about the cost of collecting revenues
associated with drug sales, or the cost of regulating drugs. </p>

<p>They ignore questions concerning the purity, potency and
quality of legal drugs, the costs of insuring a safe product, and
costs associated with increased liability litigation. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No revenue is collected from drug sales now, except by outlaw
drug dealers. Any collection of tax revenues would be an
improvement. </p>

<p>There are no standards for purity, potency, or quality now
except those established by outlaw drug dealers, and there is no
one to sue for an unsafe product. Any legal standards would be an
improvement in this area. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Ask proponents of legalization for specifics. Would the raw
material for these drugs be purchased from traditional sources,
or would the United States produce its own marijuana, coca and
opium? Would the government pay farmers subsidies to produce or
not produce these crops? Although all of these questions could be
resolved, none comes without a price tag. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The United States could easily produce all of its own
marijuana, as the DEA should know from the fact that it was
America's largest commercial crop before it was outlawed. </p>

<p>The Federal Government should not be in the position of paying
farmers subsidies to produce any dangerous, addictive drug,
including tobacco. The rules for subsidies should be consistent
across the board. </p>

<p>However difficult these questions may be to agree on, it still
does not present any evidence that throwing people in prison for
drugs is a good idea. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Proponents also conveniently fail to mention that unless drugs
are made available to little children, law enforcement will still
be needed to deal with the sale of drugs to minors. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is one of the phoniest arguments to come down the pike.
No one except the DEA has suggested that drugs should be
&quot;made available to little children&quot;. </p>

<p>We have laws now to prevent the sale of alcohol to minors and
the rules for other drugs should be no different. Law enforcement
is needed to deal with the sale of alcohol to minors but it is by
no means an overwhelming problem. </p>

<p>If the DEA was really concerned about little children, they
would recommend stronger action against convenience store clerks
who sell tobacco to children. An American is about 100 times as
likely to die from tobacco as from any illegal drug, and
childhood is when most of them become addicted. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>But more importantly, in their simplistic arguments, they omit
mention of the atrocious social costs that would be incurred with
a larger class of drug users. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>No, we freely admit that drugs are going to impose a
tremendous social cost whatever we do. That is still not a good
reason to undertake actions which are counterproductive, such as
prison. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization would also result in lost workforce productivity
and a resultant increase in the cost of goods. A new class of
unemployables would be created who were unfit to hire because of
their drug dependence. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>There is no evidence for this at all. The DEA proposes that
prison is the best way to keep drug users productive. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Health and societal costs of drug legalization would also
increase, the panel predicted. Drug treatment costs,
hospitalization for longterm drugrelated disease, and treatment
of family violence consequences would further burden our already
strapped healthcare system. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The panel came together for the purpose of fighting
&quot;legalization&quot; so it is no surprise that they would
predict it would be a disaster. It is important to note that they
did no research to back up their prediction and every major study
of drug policy in the last fifty years disagreed with them. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>There was also no guarantee, according to the group, that
criminal justice costs would decline if drugs were legalized. It
is possible that law enforcement would be additionally burdened
with addressing violations of traffic and family violence laws if
more people had access to drugs. Law enforcement is already
challenged by significant alcoholrelated crimes. More users mean
more crimes committed, and incarceration costs would increase. </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In 1995, over $13 billion is being spent by the federal
government on drug control, including treatment, education, law
enforcement and international activities. </p>

<p> Drug abuse costs the United States between $60 and $100
billion in lost productivity each year. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Most of this cost is caused by alcohol, which the DEA does not
address at all. Even if all this cost was the result of illegal
drugs, there is still no evidence that throwing people in prison
is the best way to reduce those costs. Does the DEA honestly
propose that the best way to make sure that people are productive
is to throw them in prison? </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> The Federal Government spends billions of dollars each year
on other national priorities. In Fiscal Year 1995, the Federal
Government is spending </p>

<p>$ 243.4 billion on Defense </p>

<p>$ 350 billion on Social Security </p>

<p>$ 61.6 billion on Agriculture </p>

<p>$ 22 billion on Welfare </p>

<p>$ 13.5 billion on Foreign Assistance </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>And? Not one word here is any kind of an argument in favor of
throwing people in prison for drugs. <br>

<h2>CLAIM IX: DRUG PROHIBITION IS WORKING </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Legalization advocates claim that drug prohibition is akin to
alcohol prohibition earlier this century. Their main premise is
that it is impossible to prohibit people from using substances
that they want to use. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It seems obvious that it is impossible, by the DEA's own
evidence. But there are other reasons as well. Even if it was
possible, we should not undertake actions which do more harm than
good. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization forum felt that
legalization opponents should point to the successes of
Prohibition and to continuously stress the positive progress that
has been made between 1979 and 1994 in reducing levels of drug
abuse. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does the DEA feel that the &quot;successes of
Prohibition&quot; were so great that we should bring back
Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>When the Volstead Act was repealed, arrests for alcohol
traffickers disappeared, but arrests of alcohol related incidents
rose, indicating that the prohibition against alcohol had kept
people from using it. The same will happen if drugs are
legalized. Once drug use is sanctioned by the government, more
people will use drugs. </p>

<p>It is also important to remember that after Prohibition was
repealed, organized crime branched out into other areas, and
there is every expectation that current drug organizations would
also continue and diversify. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>After Prohibition was repealed, organized crime lost its
single biggest source of funding. This is the same argument the
DEA made before, that we must keep drug prohibition to keep the
drug dealers employed so they will not do something else. Again,
we have to asked what would happen if the DEA really did succeed
in stamping out drugs. Would we have to start selling them again
to keep the criminals from doing something else? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> Dr. Mark Moore, in a 1992 article titled &quot;Actually,
Prohibition Was a Success&quot; points out that alcohol
consumption declined during the Prohibition years by as much as
3050%. Mental hospital admissions from alcoholinduced psychosis
declined 50%. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The Wickersham Commission, which was formed to study and
improve Prohibition, found that alcohol use fell in the first
year of Prohibition and rose every year thereafter. </p>

<p>Assuming this was true, does that mean that the DEA is
advocating the return of alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Robert Peterson, Director of the Michigan Office of Drug
Control Policy, states that &quot;Since the repeal of
Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Does this mean that the DEA is advocating the return of
alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p> Alcohol, unlike currently illegal drugs, has a long history
of social acceptance and has an important role in many cultures.
Alcohol can also be selfadministered in small doses with little
damaging effects. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA is saying that some drugs can be sold in the local
store, while others merit a term in prison if you possess them.
The difference, it seems, is based on their popularity. By this
argument, when these drugs reach a certain level of popularity
then it will be appropriate to sell them as we do alcohol and
tobacco. </p>

<p>Other drugs also have a long history of social acceptance
which the DEA would like to deny. Marijuana (hemp), for example,
was once this nation's largest crop and was even grown by our
founding fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. </p>

<p>Most drugs can be self-administered in small doses with little
damaging effects and, in most examples of their use, they are. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>We are making progress in reducing the number of illicit drug
users. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Even if one believes the DEA's figures on this score (and
there is good reason to doubt them), the DEA's own figures show
that there has been no effect on hard core drug use. Further,
there is no evidence that the current policy is the best way to
reduce the number of drug users of any type. <br>

<h2>CLAIM X: DRUG LEGALIZATION WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON
LOWINCOME COMMUNITIES </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some proponents of legalization claim that current strict drug
control policies have a disproportionately adverse effect on poor
communities. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This much is obvious from even the most cursory examination of
the statistics. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The drug laws of the United States, and efforts to stop drug
trafficking and abuse, are designed to protect all people from
the harm and denigration that illegal drugs cause. If one
economic group or another is disproportionately affected by the
implementation of current laws, that problem should be dealt with
in its proper context--not by legalizing drugs. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the laws were based largely on racism and
the fears of such things as Chinese men luring white women to
their ruin in opium dens, and the mythical &quot;Negro Cocaine
Fiend.&quot; Harry Anslinger specifically stated that the primary
reason to outlaw marijuana (hemp) was &quot;its effect on the
degenerate races.&quot; </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The participants at the Forum, many of them city police
chiefs, disagreed with the notion that legalization would improve
the lot of the poor. </p>

<p>Legalization proponents argue that fewer people would be
arrested for drug trafficking crime and the violence associated
with turf protection would be reduced if drugs were legalized.
That argument assumes that drugrelated violence is limited to
rival drug gangs disputing turf, when in fact, most drug violence
is committed by people under the influence of drugs. </p>

<p>The incidence of dysfunctional families, unemployability,
family violence, and ruined lives would increase in lowincome
communities, just as they would in every other community. All
communities would see increased aberrant behavior because of
increased drug use; increased occurrences of child neglect;
increased family disintegration; increased fetal damage caused by
mothers' drug use; increased social welfare costs; loss of
workforce productivity; increased auto accidents because drivers
are driving under the influence of drugs; increased industrial
accidents caused by impaired workers; increased absenteeism; and
increases in emergency room visits and overdose deaths. In short,
all Americans would see a moral decline of society. </p>

<p>Drug use in the inner city is a manifestation of other
problems in the inner city; these problems would not go away if
more drugs were available. If proponents truly believe that
legalization would have a positive affect on communities, we
challenge them to set up a trial program in their own community. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is an empty challenge. If anyone tried it, the DEA would
have them in jail before the first results could be evaluated.
This kind of trial program is the last thing the DEA wants to
see, as they have already stated by their opposition to an
objective Federal Commission to examine the evidence. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p> In his 1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Herbert Kleber addresses the drug situation: &quot;Our
current drug situation follows a pattern of earlier drug
epidemics. As the use of drugs drops from epidemic to endemic
levels, disadvantaged groups are more likely than others to
continue using drugs because of their greater availability and
fewer alternative opportunities. That is why minority communities
want not only treatment facilities but also fair laws, justly
applied to reduce the horrendous toll of drug related crime in
their neighborhoods. The illegal, open air drug bazaars that
flourish in southeastern Washington DC and the South Bronx would
not be tolerated in Georgetown or Scarsdale.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Try as I might, I can't find anything in that statement which
says that throwing massive numbers of people in prison for drug
offenses is a good idea. <br>

<h1>What's Next? </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is my view of what is the current most important step in
promoting drug policy reform. This includes some suggestions on
how you can help. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><a name="DDE_LINK2"><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif"
align="BOTTOM"></a>WHAT IS THE MAIN PRIORITY AT THIS POINT? </h2>

<p> A few people have asked the basic question, What's next? What
is the main priority at this point? </p>

<p> A good question. In order to answer it correctly we have to
back up and review the current state of affairs. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHERE ARE
WE WITH RESPECT TO THE GOALS? </h2>

<p> First, it is necessary to establish where we are with respect
to our goals. Atlanta has come and gone. I don't think the drug
warriors got as much publicity as perhaps they wanted, and it
looks like a flash in the pan. No doubt they will try to use
their resolution as proof of something </p>

<p> when they are pressed in the debate. In their rather
simplistic view of the issue they have confused the main point
and will continue to lose debates as time goes on. As Drug Czar
Lee Brown has recently stated, their strategy will be to pretend
that the issue doesn't exist. They just don't want to hear about
it. </p>

<p> The bottom line is that Atlanta won't do much to change the
long term trend in public thinking, particularly if we are
intelligent about what we do. The trend is going our way and will
continue to go our way. Little by little, we are working our way
to a majority. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">THE HOOVER
RESOLUTION? </h2>

<p> Alan asks if the main priority at this point should be to
push the Hoover Resolution. In a sense, that should be the main
priority, but we have to recognize the underlying issues
involved. </p>

<p> The Hoover Resolution was built upon the recognition of the
single biggest flaw behind the drug war -- ignorance. No one
could support these kinds of policies if they had even read the
evidence, so I knew that every drug warrior could be defeated if
you could just get to the evidence. A good knowledge of the
evidence is enough to publicly destroy any of them. </p>

<p> The Hoover Resolution has already been successful to a
certain extent. The last Crime Bill provided for a commission
which is due to start work in 1996. They are now selecting people
to sit on the commission, but I have no idea of their progress on
selecting any members. There is still some question about whether
it will come off or, if it does, who will be on it or how deeply
it will delve into the issues. </p>

<p> Regardless of the commission, we should be prepared with the
information the commission should read, or that anyone should
read on this issue. We should have such complete evidence and
research on the issue that anyone who wants information on the
issue will have to come to us. </p>

<h3>IS IT PROPER TO REFER TO IT AS THE HOOVER RESOLUTION? </h3>

<p> No, but I often do it anyway. </p>

<h3>SHOULD WE POST THE HOOVER RESOLUTION ON A FORM? </h3>

<p> Sure. As long as we follow all of the original rules of the
Hoover Resolution -- that is, it must be very clear what the
people are agreeing to -- only what the Resolution states.
Signatures must include name, title, mailing address, and the
form should ask them if they would like to join any of the
various national organizations. </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">MEMBERSHIP
SUBSCRIPTION PAGES </h3>

<p> We should have an independent membership page for each of the
organizations covered under our group. People should be allowed
to subscribe on-line. We don't have to hassle the problems with
credit cards or anything yet, just let them enter their name and
address and the organization can send them an envelope. </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHY WILL
THE DRUG WAR FALL? </h2>

<p> The drug war will eventually fall for the same reason that
communism fell. That is, they are both repressive systems which
depend upon hiding or ignoring knowledge iin pursuit of an
ideological goal. As such they are wildly impractical, and that
impracticality becomes more apparent as more knowledge becomes
available. The Soviet Union fell because, in order to enforce
their restrictions on knowledge, they had to put photocopy
machines under lock and key and require forms to be filled out
every time someone wanted to make a copy. You can imagine the
effect that would have on a modern competitive business. The
invention of the personal computer was their complete downfall.
It became apparent that they could not have a modern economy if
they did not have person computers, fax machines, and the like.
But, of course, that meant that everyone was a publisher. If
everyone is a publisher, sooner or later the truth is going to
get out. </p>

<p> Computers and the Internet will be the key elements which
bring down the drug war. Political systems based on ignorance
will come down because of the information which can be made
available to anyone through computers. That is also the
fundamental idea behind the CD ROM -- widespread public education
of the facts. We will win our struggle as soon as the public
knows the facts. We have taken the first steps with the formal
establishment of our org. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">#1
PRIORITY -- GET THE KNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLED </h2>

<p> Our Number One Priority at this point should be to locate all
of the information on drug policy that we can find, convert it to
computer format, and post it in a commonly accessed place on the
web. We should set up an interlinked network of web pages
accessible from a single web page which serves as a directory.
Behind these web pages should be all of the information we can
get. Remember all the times that people on the net have asked
questions or argued about some aspect of the drug issue? No more.
Any time anyone has a question, we should be able to point
directly to documents on-line which provide an immediate answer. </p>

<h3>WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION? </h3>

<p> Anything relevant to the subject. We have nothing at all to
fear from the truth and you will notice that, on my web pages, I
will include materials which are propaganda of the opposition.
Ultimately, we gain the most from the broadest range of
information. We should scan, retrieve, enter by hand, or do
whatever we can to build the best library anyone has ever seen on
the subject. We have to make our web sites an absolute must-see
for any member of the media who wants to do anything on the
subject. (Please note that, even while the public as a whole may
not be on the net yet, the media is far more likely to be
connected to the net. This is an issue on which we can, in
effect, force their behavior. If our web pages have enough
information, they will be forced to come to us.) </p>

<p> Think of it this way. In the course of these conversations we
have passed back and forth a lot of good solid information to
each other, such as the information put forth on hemp, or the
backgrounds of Voth and Nahas. That kind of information should be
posted so it is available to anyone who wants it, any time they
need it. The only real difference is that we should use a less
conversational style. That is, when we post the information to
the library, it should be in &quot;encyclopedia style&quot; </p>

<h3>A CENTRAL ENTRY POINT - The World's Best Library on Drug
Policy. </h3>

<p> Right now, if we want to tell the media about our growing
library of on-line information, we would have to give them the
names of a multitude of web sites and tell them to go poke around
on their own. We need one main menu page to give them for the
library. </p>

<p> We should establish a central entry point to all the web
sites of interest. This one home page would list all of the other
web pages which have factual information of interest on the
subject. This will make it easy for us to give the media a single
access point where they can find all of the information. That is
important in uniformly advertising it to the media around the
world. </p>

<p> That central point should have an index (updated once a month
perhaps) which will point to each of the web sites and provide
some sort of explanation as to what kind of materials are behind
it. </p>

<h3>MAKE SURE THE MEDIA KNOWS WHERE TO GO FOR INFO </h3>

<p> Then we will have to make sure that ALL the media knows that
they have to go to our page if they are going to discuss the drug
issue. That will require a dedicated campaign to publish the
location of our unified home page to all media sources. Our next
priority will be to make sure that everyone in the media knows
where to look. We will each have to contact our local news
sources and make sure they know. It should be mentioned as a
standard reference in every letter to the editor, for example. We
should mention our unified home page everywhere we go. Print it
on your letterhead and business cards. </p>

<p> <img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3>TASKS TO BE DONE </h3>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">Top Items
to be Put on the Web </h4>

<p> This is a list, somewhat incomplete as yet, of the top items
we intend to put on the web pages as soon as we can. We ask
everyone to help us by contributing this information in
electronic form. If you have it, you can e-mail it to
schaffer@smartlink.net. And thanks! </p>

<p> If all you have is a paper copy, we would appreciate that
too. You can send stuff to Dave Borden at Drug Policy Foundation,
4455 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite B-500, Washington, DC
20008-2302. </p>

<p> You can snail-mail stuff to me at: <b>Cliff Schaffer, P.O.
Box 1430, Canyon Country, CA 91386-1430</b> </p>

<p> 1. Information for Dave Bordens &quot;Tour of the War on
Drugs&quot;. Use your imagination here, but if you were going to
give someone a tour of the War on Drugs, what would you include?
It should have lots of interesting facts, graphics, documents,
etc. </p>

<p> 2. A video file which contains a good quality copy of
&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot;. We would like to put in online
where it can be distributed to the world. If you already have a
computer and a VCR, the cost of the video capture board is
currently running around $500 to $700. Or maybe you know someone
who has one . . . </p>

<p> 3. The full text of any of the reference sources listed in
the <a href="../LIBRARY/studlist.html">Biggest Studies of Drug
Policy</a>. We much prefer the electronic format but if all you
have is a good paper copy, we will try to work with it. </p>

<p> 4. The full text of the Congressional Record for the portions
relevant to both the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 and the
Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. </p>

<p> 5. Charts, pictures, etc., which show the current statistics
for all of the issues related to drug policy. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">SCANNING </h4>

<p> We have a huge task ahead of us. We must convert tens of
thousands of pages of information to computer format. Most of the
information, such as the major studies of drug policy, never was
in computer format and some of the documents are quite large. The
task will probably take man years of scanning effort to be
properly accomplished. The only way we will get it done (with our
limited financial resources) is if everyone does a little bit. I
strongly recommend that you get a scanner as soon as possible.
You don't need much, a simple gray scale scanner with OCR will do
the trick. Shop around and you can install a minimum page-feed
scanner in an existing computer system, with OCR for about $250.
A good quality flat-bed color scanner with a page feed option
currently runs about $1,000. I have found from my own experience
that the handheld scanners are not adequate to the task. </p>

<p> Does anyone know where we can get scanners cheaply (free) to
distribute to volunteers who will commit to using them? </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">GETTING
THE WORD OUT TO THE MEDIA </h4>

<p> We will need volunteers who will help us get the word out to
the lawmakers and the media when we are ready to launch. Anyone
can help here, if they have a telephone, a stamp, or an e-mail
address. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">FORMATTING
AND ORGANIZING </h4>

<p> We will also need people to specialize in the librarian
function. That is, we must have people who are willing to spend
the time to: </p>

<p> Organize the data so it has a logical structure and is easy
to find. </p>

<p> Establish links from references in one document to the actual
text of the cited documents. </p>

<p> Format good looking web pages according to a standard format </p>

<p> We will need standards for how the web pages will be
constructed and their overall look. (Please understand, it is not
that I want to limit your creativity with web pages, it is just
that we want to present to the public the look of a uniform,
organized library.) I recommend that anyone who is interested in
working on this end of the task should buy a copy of Teach
Yourself Web Publishing With HTML In A Week, by Laura Lemay from
Sams Publishing. I just got a copy and found it quite helpful. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">READING
AND SUMMARIZING </h4>

<p> There will be a lot of information on line. We will need
people to read through volumes of information and prepare
accurate summaries on a chapter by chapter basis. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">PROGRAMMING
</h4>

<p> Someone will have to program the membership forms and other
stuff required by this little venture. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WHERE TO
GO TO GET THE DATA </h4>

<p> 1. Information from other on-line services. We must
accumulate all of the information in a place we control and
organize. </p>

<p> 2. Government sources. A lot of the government agencies are
now publishing information in computer format, including CD-ROM.
We should make it a point to get all of this information we can
and bring it together in a logical organization which makes it
easy for people to find. </p>

<p> 3. Historical records. A good project for anyone would be to
go to the library and browse through the newspapers of anywhere
from 1860 to the present and get copies of all the articles they
can find relating to drugs. </p>

<p> 4. Private collections of documents. I have already contacted
a number of prominent people to ask them if we can get their
personal records which relate to drug policy. We want to develop
a depth of information which cannot be challenged and the private
records of individuals involved in the drug war is a good way to
do it. </p>

<p> 5. NIDA research. The National Instiute on Drug Abuse has
published volumes of data on all sorts of issues. We should start
with the most interesting stuff. </p>

<p> 6. The Congressional Record. We need to get on-line the
entire text of the Congressional Record relating to all of our
current drug laws. Most important-- we must get the text of the
original proceedings behind these laws. Harry Anslinger's words
should be posted in a place where all the world can read them. </p>

<p> 7. Current Media. Scan and/or summarize articles from your
local newspaper. Include the full citations of the name of the
newspaper, the headline of the article and the date it was
published. Also include a summary, length as appropriate, of the
major points made in the article. If we can get permission to
reprint, we should do so. If not, we will publish a summary of
the points made in the article, but retain the scanned text in a
private library for backup. </p>

<p> 8. Videos and movies. We should convert things such as Hemp
for Victory to computer format. This can be done with a computer,
a VCR, and a video capture board (now down to as low as $179.00) </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">WEB PAGE
STANDARDS </h4>

<p> I suggest the following as a preliminary suggestion for web
page standards. More complete standards, including a template,
should be developed by a committee working on the formatting and
organizing team. </p>

<p> 1. All web pages should include both the name of the current
page plus the name of the central home page. This will make sure
that anyone who prints out the information will know where it
came from. The name of the central home page should also be
included as a header in all text files on the net. </p>

<p> 2. All menus should contain links back to your own home page
as well as the central home page. </p>

<p> 3. All menu pages should include the title of the document,
and a description of the author and the contents of the work. </p>

<p> 4. All web pages under your own home page should have a
consistent layout. The layout should be simple and without
excessive graphics, so it doesn't take a month to download them. </p>

<h4><img src="../GRAPHICS/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">COPYRIGHTS
</h4>

<p> Under current copyright law we cannot post anything which is
copyrighted without the permission of the copyright owner. Here
is how to get around this restriction and still have a complete
on-line library. </p>

<p> 1) Any material produced by any government agency, or the
texts of official statements by public officials is in the public
domain and may be posted without any problems. </p>

<p> 2) The current copyright law is that copyrights are effective
for the life of the creator plus fifty years. The old law was
that copyrights were valid for 28 years with a renewal of 28
years. What this means is (with some exceptions) materials
published before about 1940 have probably fallen into the public
domain. </p>

<ol>
    <li>I have a feeling that, if some people or organizations
        were asked, they would grant us permission to post their
        materials, or at least excerpts from the materials. If we
        cannot get permission, we will post our own written
        summaries of the materials -- reviews of the essential
        points made by the document. </li>
</ol>

go from here? </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The tide has turned in the war against the War on Drugs. It
is a tough fight, but those who support drug policy reform have
begun to carry the day. There have been three major television
specials on the issue in less than a year and the DEA openly
admitted their arguments were in trouble when they called a
special conference last August to try to find ways to argue
against reform. They have been getting pretty well shellacked in
every single debate over the last few years and the media has
begun to seriously question the wisdom of the drug war. The drug
warriors are in retreat and they know it. </p>

<p> The big question for those who support reform is: Where do we
go from here? Activists from around the world have been
discussing this on the Internet, and here are some of the
answers. </p>

<h2>The Internet </h2>

<p> Rapid communication is critical to this movement. Activists
from around the world have joined together on the Internet to
discuss ideas and provide support for each other in a wide
variety of ways. There are plans for a bigger and better presence
on the Internet where news, research, and ideas will be available
to anyone with a computer, and where people from around the world
can work together. We need more people on the Internet. We also
need someone in every city who is plugged in to the network and
can distribute the news on a timely basis to those who are not
yet on the Internet. </p>

<h2>Unity </h2>

<p> The Internet has also brought unity. The biggest single
thrust of the DEA in their public relations campaign is that we
lack unity. The DEA tells the public that those who support
reform don't even agree among themselves on what they want and,
therefore, they could never build a credible public policy. For
many years it was true. We have a number of organizations and
groups around the country who have always agreed on their
opposition to the drug war but have usually worked alone to
pursue their goals. As a result, we looked like a mob, rather
than a team. </p>

<p> Through the internet, we have held lengthy on-line
&quot;meetings&quot; where many of the leading activists and
organizations have discussed where we agreed and disagreed, and
how we could work together toward the goals we all shared. As the
result of those meetings, we have formulated a basic statement of
our objective and the principles which should be the basis for a
better drug policy. They are: </p>

<h2>Our Objective </h2>

<p> Our objective is to bring drugs within the law. </p>

<h2>Principles for a Solution. </h2>

<p> We believe that a better drug policy should be based on three
basic principles: </p>

<p> 1) Decisions on the medical use of drugs should be the sole
province of the medical profession in consultation with its
patients. </p>

<p> 2) Punishment should not be used to control private drug use.
</p>

<p> 3) We must have a consistent policy for all drugs of
potential abuse. </p>

<p> We ask all interested people and groups around the nation to
join us in a recognition of our common goals and present a united
front to the world. We all agree that we need reform now. The
first step toward reform is to press for open and honest
discussion of the issue. </p>

<h2>Better Public Relations </h2>

<p> When it comes to funding for media, we are clearly outgunned
by the drug warriors. But, over the last few years we have just
as clearly beaten them with a better, more sensible message. We
need a grass roots effort to educate the media at all levels.
Keep track of your local newspaper, television, and radio
stations and make sure that the old hysterical lies and
half-truths of the drug war do not go unchallenged. We have
proven that the media will come our way if they know the facts. </p>

<h2>Recruitment </h2>

<p> We all know people who are not members of the DPF but should
be. Many of them are not members simply because no one has asked
them to join, or they don't know the DPF is there. No one has
told them that their support is important. We should all make a
commitment to recruit at least one new member in the coming
month. It's easy. All you need to do is ask them. When you leave
the house tomorrow morning, carry a membership application and a
stamped envelope addressed to the DPF. I will bet you find a new
ally before noon. </p>

<h2>The Next Step </h2>

<p> We have already demonstrated that when the evidence is
examined the drug warriors don't have a leg to stand on. They
have lost every debate in the last few years because of the
evidence, so the last thing they want now is a public discussion
of the evidence. Their &quot;anti-legalization&quot; resolution
even says so, in so many words. Even the mere discussion of
possible alternatives, they say, will cause a massive increase in
drug addiction. </p>

<p> We want to talk about alternatives. We want to review the
evidence. We want openness, honesty, and objectivity in a public
review of all we know about drug policy. We want to lay the cards
on the table and let the chips fall where they may. The drug
warriors do not. Therein lies the difference between us. </p>

<p> Our mission is to draw the drug warriors into a public
debate. We must ask the media to ask them: &quot;What's wrong
with the truth? Why don't you want to read the evidence? Why
won't you discuss it? If you are right, the evidence will surely
show it.&quot; We have nothing to fear from the truth. <br>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">Political
Strategies </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is a first crack at the kinds of political strategies we
must use to end the drug war. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
win by knockout. </h2>

<p> I believe that we must pick issues where we can by knockout.
The odds are so stacked against us that, unless we win by
knockout, we will not win at all. </p>

<p> While I agree with the economics and civil liberties
arguments for decriminalization, I do not favor the use of these
issues as a primary focus. The primary reason that I do not like
the arguments on economics or civil liberties is because they are
highly intellectual arguments which could be debated all day with
no clear resolution. They make people think too much, and that
slows down decision-making. We want issues which will change
people's minds forever -- and do it today. I believe that these
arguments may be useful to convince other people like us, but it
will not convince large masses of Americans. </p>

<p> There are two primary issues where I believe we can win by
knockout right now. They are the treatment of medical patients,
and the issue of African-American men. In both cases we have
clear, overwhelming arguments which would get the immediate
agreement of large masses of Americans. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
build a coalition of constituencies. </h2>

<p> We must bring people of different persuasions together to
support our cause. In our Resolution, we have already chosen a
broadly based statement which does not use the &quot;D&quot; word
and which could be supported by people of all persuasions. That
is step one. </p>

<p> Next we, need to formally identify our constituencies and the
specific arguments which will be most relevant to those groups. </p>

<p> Some constituencies are: </p>

<p> Doctors - The relevant issues here are the persecution of
doctors and the treatment of medical patients. </p>

<p> Medical Patient Groups - The relevant issue is the treatment
of medical patients. </p>

<p> African-Americans - The relevant issue is the incarceration
and economic destruction of African-American men. </p>

<p> I believe that doctors and African-Americans are absolutely
vital to our success and that every one of us should take
immediate steps to recruit them to our cause. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
form &quot;intervention groups&quot; and target specific
individuals that we need on our side. </h2>

<p> We have used an approach which someone likened to an Alcohols
Anonymous intervention group. We assembled a group of people that
we knew an important person would find persuasive. Then we all
went together to that person and explained our concerns in terms
that were important to that person. Then we asked for support,
not for the &quot;D&quot; word, but for general drug policy
reform. </p>

<p> This technique is highly effective and will enable us to
change the thinking of many important people, or at least start
them down the slippery slope to the &quot;D&quot; word. I believe
that we should all commit to participating in at least one of
these intervention groups to change the mind of at least one
important person. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
seek action. </h2>

<p> We have already asked for public hearings. As many of you
have already stated, public hearings may not come about and, even
if they do, they may not change anything. Therefore, we must seek
other means which will also bring about clear public
confrontations on the issue. When those confrontations occur, we
must all respond unanimously. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
provide support for people who speak out for drug policy reform. </h2>

<p> We all know that many people are reluctant to speak out for
reform because of the McCarthy-like tactics of our opposition. We
must come to the defense of anyone who is criticized or vilified
because of their support for a change in drug policy. Point out
that people are not vilified because they are Republican,
Democrat, or Libertarian, but people are vilified if they even
want to discuss a different drug policy. This is McCarthyism. <br>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM">Local
Action strategies </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">1. Contact
your local media. Tell them about these web pages and the
information on them.<br>
</h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">2. Read
the newspapers and respond. </h2>

<p> Make it a point to read the largest newspapers in your area
and be alert for drug-policy related news stories. Write short,
punchy letters to the editor to make your views heard. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">3. Contact
the talk shows in your area. </h2>

<p> Most TV and radio talk shows need a steady stream of
controversial subjects to make the shows interesting. Sooner or
later, they will all do a show on drug policy. Go through your TV
listings and locate all talk and news shows. Call the stations
and ask for the producers of the show. In most cases, it will
surprise you how easy it is to get through. Tell them about the
resolution and the people supporting it. Let them know that there
are prominent people now willing to come forward and debate this
idea publicly. Producers are probably extremely busy, so keep it
short, punchy, and sweet. Have some juicy &quot;sound bites&quot;
planned to stimulate interest. Follow up with a letter and
printed material such as the things I have enclosed. Keep in
touch with them every ninety days or so, just to make sure that
they don't forget you. </p>

<p> If you get a spot on a good TV show and then don't know what
to do -- call me. We'll work something out. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">4. Develop
a constituency. </h2>

<p> Contact groups and members of groups to put on a presentation
and persuade them to support the resolution. There are all kinds
of groups which may support this resolution, each for their own
individual reasons. They include African-Americans, ministers,
doctors, medical patients, law enforcement officials, AIDS
groups, and many others. Pick groups that you think you can
persuade and then develop the issues which are most important to
them. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">5. Pick
one influential person at a time and persuade them. </h2>

<p> When you have persuaded them that it is time for a change,
and that we should at least look at other drug policy options,
get them to commit to going with you to persuade at least two
more influential people. Use this technique to &quot;move up the
ladder&quot; to more and more influential people. </p>

<p> Use the &quot;intervention group&quot; approach. Assemble a
small group of people whom your target will view as influential
and persuasive. Arrange a meeting where all can attend and have
all those people ask the person to reconsider their point of
view. Don't ask them to support legalization or
decriminalization, because it is unlikely that you could persuade
them in one meeting anyway. Just get them to admit that there is
enough of a question about the issue that it is time to
re-examine the evidence and commit to the investigation of the
possibility of change. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">6. Enlist
your friends to create a steady &quot;rain&quot; of resolutions
on the White House. </h2>

<p> Get everyone to commit to sending a resolution a week. Keep
it up until we get the commission. Let Clinton know that this
resolution is not going to go away. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">7. Develop
phone networks to get people to respond when we need them to
respond. </h2>

<p> The National Rifle Association is powerful because, at any
given time, it can bombard the President and Congress with
millions of letters and phone calls. We need the same type of
response. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">8. Put on
debates and seminars at colleges. </h2>

<p> Colleges and universities often have philosophy, public
administration, law enforcement, or political science professors
who might like to put on a public forum or debate on drug policy.
Call the local colleges and ask for the heads of these
departments, or anyone else you think might be interested.
Suggest the idea to them. </p>

<p> I have enclosed a sample speech from one of the debates I was
in. You can edit it as appropriate to your needs. I have never
had anyone make an intelligent comeback to that speech. </p>

<p> The enclosed charts can be blown up to 18 inch by 24 inch
size by places such as Kinko's Copies for about $2.50 to $5.00
each, depending upon whether you get them on ordinary paper or on
card stock. For large audiences, consider taking 35mm slide
pictures of the graphs. If you are out in the middle of the woods
and can't do either of those things, write to me and, if you pay
for it, I will have it done for you. </p>

<p> The biggest problem you may have with this tactic is that the
local gendarmes and prosecutors are becoming increasingly
reluctant to come out in public and defend the drug war. They
have been getting their butts kicked far too much lately and even
the most fervent drug warriors are now having a hard time with
their beliefs. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">9. Contact
local civic organizations. </h2>

<p> In most towns, there are various local civic organizations
that might want to have presentations on the drug war for any of
a variety of reasons. Some of them will do it just for the
entertainment value. Go through the phone book and locate the
Rotarians, the Elks, etc. and ask them if they would be
interested. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">10. Write
to and call your local Congressman. </h2>

<p> Most members of Congress are chowder-heads, but there are
some out there who are intelligent enough to read the facts and
stand up for the truth. We won't know who they are until people
like you can find them. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">11.
Produce Local Access Cable Shows. </h2>

<p> You can become a producer for local access cable channels
with as little as five hours of mostly free classes. Call your
local cable company for information. Once you become a producer
you can use their facilities to tape shows, or you can broadcast
tapes which were prepared by others. We have already done this a
few times and have a number of shows which can be made available
to anyone who is hooked in to their local access cable channels. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">12. Don't
get discouraged. </h2>

<p> It may take time to build your persuasive skills and even the
best of us don't persuade everybody the first time around. Keep
it up, despite the setbacks, and you will eventually prevail. <br>

<h1>Persuasive Strategies</h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Dos </h2>

<h3>The issue is prison. </h3>

<p> The issue is not legalization or decriminalization because we
really do not know if we will ever do those things, or anything
like them. The issue is prison. The issue is how many millions of
people will have to go to prison before this policy is
successful. </p>

<p> You cannot successfully defend decriminalization or
legalization to most people at this point, because it is not here
and they cannot see it. Turn the issue around on them, and make
them defend what we are doing now. The drug war has not worked
and there is not a drug law enforcement official in the United
States who pretends that it can work. Once they are on the
defensive, it is easy to get them to admit that it is time to
look for another approach -- whatever that approach might be. </p>

<h3>Do your homework. </h3>

<p> There is enough information in the references I have listed
to sink anyone who supports the use of jails for drugs. That's
why the reports were written. </p>

<h3>Be reasonable. </h3>

<p> If you can present a sound and reasonable approach to solving
the drug problem, and maintain that stance, you will
short-circuit most of the negative emotions and hostility which
may be raised against you. Notice that I have said a reasonable
&quot;approach&quot; to solving the drug problem, not a
reasonable &quot;solution&quot; to the drug problem. By approach,
I mean a method of finding a solution. Do not try to present a
solution because, as discussed later, that only gets you into
trouble. Instead, promote a fair and reasonable method of finding
a solution -- such as the objective commission called for by the
Hoover Resolution. </p>

<p> At the same time, this reasonable stance forces our opponents
to either be reasonable and follow us toward reform, or adopt
ever more extreme positions on drugs. One of my favorite
questions for them is: &quot;What do you have against an open and
honest review of the evidence?&quot; </p>

<p> If they do not agree to an open and honest review of the
evidence then they clearly demonstrate that they are too extreme
to even consider the facts. If they do agree to the review, then
I have them every time because I have already read the evidence
and I know what it says. </p>

<h3>Judo is better than boxing. </h3>

<p> You can beat someone with boxing, in which case you knock
them down with your weight. Or, you can beat someone with judo,
in which case you knock them down with their own weight. Judo is
always better than boxing when you have to persuade someone. Use
the arguments your audience finds persuasive, not the arguments
you find persuasive. </p>

<p> For example, if you encounter a fundamentalist Christian,
nothing you will say to them will have any meaning to them at all
unless they believe that Jesus Christ would support what you are
saying. So far most of them have believe that drug users should
be thrown in prison because drug use is immoral -- that is, Jesus
would not approve of drug use. I have found that the best
approach to these people is to help them to understand it in
their own terms. What I say is: </p>

<p> &quot;You are certainly a better Christian than I am so you
tell me. If Jesus came down here today and we gave the drug
problem to him, what do you think he would do? Would he build
bigger prisons? Or would he build hospitals and schools?&quot; </p>

<p> When the issue is stated in these simple terms, most of them
will come around right away. They will immediately see the good
sense in an approach that heals, rather than punishes. </p>

<h3>Avoid complex arguments </h3>

<p> The supporters of the drug war have, in keeping with their
general intellectual level, made the simplest propaganda
possible. The eggs in the frying pan commercial is a good
example. In order to compete with them, it is necessary to make
arguments which are as simple and as easily understood as
possible. There are a lot of ways to get really complicated in a
drug argument but two of the favorites are arguments based on
civil liberties and economics. Please keep in mind that I agree
with the arguments based on civil liberties and economics, I just
don't find them persuasive to others. </p>

<p> Arguments based on such topics as civil liberties or
economics are not likely to be persuasive for three reasons: </p>

<p> 1) They are complicated issues which take a lot of thought.
Even if you come up with a reasonable sounding argument today,
someone will just confuse them tomorrow with an equally good
sounding argument. </p>

<p> 2) Surveys consistently show that a large portion of the
American public would readily sacrifice their civil liberties to
try to solve some mythical problem. </p>

<p> 3) The people who are likely to be persuaded are already
persuaded. </p>

<p> There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but, in
general, most people will not be persuaded by philosophical
arguments about civil liberties, or arcane arguments about
economics. It may be sad, but it is true. </p>

<p> One of the major exceptions to this is property owners.
Property owners in California have become very sensitive to the
fact that their property can be seized even though they knew
nothing at all about criminal activity on the property. Property
owners can be a pretty vocal group so they should not be
overlooked as allies. </p>

<p> Economic arguments, when used, should be simplified to avoid
long-winded discussions which do not resolve anything. For
example: With $500,000 of tax money we can put one drug user in
prison, or we can provide treatment or education for more than
100 people. Which do you think is the better deal? </p>

<h3>Build agreement. </h3>

<p> Sales people know that a person is more likely to agree with
you if they have already agreed with you. That is, if you can get
them to agree that it is a nice day, for example, they will be
more likely to agree with whatever else you may say. You get them
in the habit of saying &quot;Yes&quot; and they will keep saying
&quot;Yes.&quot; </p>

<p> There are certain issues on which nearly everyone will
readily agree. The first is that people who are sick should get
whatever medicine they need. If they understand that marijuana
can help save the lives of people with AIDS and cancer, and that
heroin can help relieve extreme chronic pain, and may even speed
healing after surgery or injury, they will usually agree that --
for medical purposes at least -- we should allow the use of these
drugs. Then point out: </p>

<p> Sick people are suffering and dying because they need these
medicines to live. If that was the only reason to re-examine our
drug policy it would be reason enough. But, as you know, it is
not the only reason to re-examine what we are doing. Isn't it
time to examine all these problems and see what really is the
right thing to do? </p>

<h3>Attack the very foundations of the drug laws. </h3>

<p> The drug laws were the product of racism and ignorance. They
never did have anything to do with public health and safety. It
is important that people understand this point. Most people
wrongly assume that the drug laws were passed because it was
necessary to protect people against dangerous drugs. Most people
do not know that, at the time the laws were passed, there was no
medical evidence to show that these drugs were dangerous, and
that major newspapers like the New York Times published articles
with titles like &quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends, New Southern
Menace.&quot; Once people begin to understand that there never
was a good reason for the laws in the first place, then it is
perfectly legitimate to ask what is the reason for these laws
now. </p>

<p> This can lead to a discussion of how the drug laws came to be
(your opponent loses by default); or the fact that half of all
our prison inmates are black, most of them there on drug charges;
or the fact that in places like Washington, DC, ninety percent of
all the black men have already been to jail, most of them on drug
charges (your opponent loses by embarrassment). </p>

<h3>One standard response </h3>

<p> The following sentence works for nearly anything your
opponent may say: </p>

<p> <b>&quot;There is no evidence to support that assertion.
Every major study of drug policy agreed that, even if it was
true, decriminalization would still be a better solution.&quot;</b>
</p>

<p> For example, they may say that, if drugs are legalized that
everyone will become drug addicts. You say: </p>

<p> &quot;There is no evidence to support that assertion. Every
major study of drug policy agreed that, even if drug use did
increase, decriminalization would still be a better
solution.&quot; </p>

<h3>Preface your sentences </h3>

<p> Put a prefix in front of your sentences. The prefix is <b>&quot;Every
major study agreed . . .&quot;</b> Without this phrase, the
things you say will be interpreted as your own opinion. If you
use this phrase, your opinions are seen more clearly as the
overwhelming weight of the evidence. Also, this phrase will force
your opponent to debate on the basis of fact, where they are the
weakest, and will quickly flatten their best arguments. </p>

<h3>Attack, Attack, Attack. </h3>

<p> It is the only way you will win. Even if people believed that
legalization was right, they would still support the current set
of laws because they aren't certain about legalization and
believe the criminal laws do no harm. They must be made to see
that the current laws are worse than no laws at all. You must put
your opponents on the extreme defensive and keep them there. Make
them justify all of the awful facts. The subject is not
legalization or decriminalization. The subject is prison. </p>

<h3>Keep it short and punchy. </h3>

<p> Know what you are going to say and trim every excess word. If
you are really lucky you will get a full fifteen minutes of media
air time to explain everything there is to know about drugs. Hit
the major facts as rapidly as you can. </p>

<h3>Memorize what you want to say </h3>

<p> Salesmen memorize their sales pitch because, once they have
it down by rote, they can say it without even thinking, thus
freeing their tactical brain to get an edge on their prospect.
With tricky subjects like drug policy reform it is very easy to
make verbal missteps which will weaken your case, or send your
audience into extreme cognitive dissonance (a mental shutdown)
where they will not hear another thing you say. Be extremely
careful about the phrasing you use and stick with the phrasing
which will keep you out of trouble. Memorize the names of the
studies so you can spit them out without thinking. </p>

<h3>Stick to the issue. </h3>

<p> Don't let the discussion stray into related social issues.
Drug policy is one of those issues which is closely intertwined
with other issues such as morality, education, health care,
welfare, and many others. Don't get sidetracked into arguments
over welfare reform or some other complicated issue You don't
have time for it and most Americans don't have the brain capacity
to understand the complexities anyway. The issue is whether
building massive prisons will solve the drug problem. </p>

<h3>Get the facts out. </h3>

<p> Most people do not know the actual statistics on things like
drug deaths, the number of people in prison, the percentage of
black men who will go to prison and the plight of medical
patients who cannot get these medicines. When they hear the
facts, they really begin to wonder about the current policy. </p>

<h3>Win by inches. </h3>

<p> Don't try to bring people too far in their thinking. The
concept of legalization or decriminalization is a big
intellectual and emotional stretch for a lot of people and you
could easily spend years getting them to fully believe it. It is
simply not practical, or necessary, to try to bring people over
to the legalization side all at once. People will naturally come
to the legalization point of view if you can simply convince them
that our current policy is a disaster which could never work (and
that is really easy!). Once they agree that the current policy is
not working, and cannot work, then they will ask themselves -- if
prisons don't work, what should we do? When they confront this
question, they have started down the slippery slope to
decriminalization. </p>

<p> Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein said, &quot;Unthinking
acceptance of the current drug policy is unreasonable.&quot; If
we can just get people to admit that there is a real problem with
what we are doing now, and that we must look for a better
solution, they will eventually agree with you. </p>

<p> An interesting thing happened to Judge James P. Gray. A man
wrote Judge Gray a letter in which he started out by telling
Judge Gray how wrong Judge Gray was about legalization. The guy
tried to tell Judge Gray why he was so wrong and, in the space of
three written pages, wound up realizing that Judge Gray was
right. He convinced himself once he just sat down and thought
about it. </p>

<h3>Take the moral high ground </h3>

<p> Our opponents like to take the stance that anyone who does
not believe in huge prisons full of drug dealers is less than
moral, beneath contempt, and is probably selling drugs to
grade-school children in their spare time. It is time to tear
down this moral charade. </p>

<p> There is nothing moral about incarcerating most of the black
men in America. There is nothing moral about denying legitimate
medicines to people who are suffering and dying. There is nothing
moral about a drug policy which seeks to destroy people, not heal
them. The damage being done by this policy is too great to allow
anyone to maintain the pretense that this drug war is something
holy and moral. </p>

<h1>Don'ts </h1>

<h3>Don't use the &quot;L&quot; word, the &quot;D&quot; word, or
the &quot;M&quot; word. </h3>

<p> Don't use &quot;legalization,&quot;
&quot;decriminalization,&quot; or &quot;medicalization&quot;.
These words tend to set some people's heads on fire. In the first
place, these words will cause many people to go into an immediate
complete mental shut-down and they will not hear another thing
you say. In the second place, it is wrong to reduce what must
necessarily be a complex policy under any circumstances, to a
single word. It only serves to further distort the issue.
Besides, you don't have to use the words to win. </p>

<p> Some people have mentioned that the word
&quot;legalization&quot; must be used sooner or later in the
public debate simply because a recognition that prison is wrong
will lead people to consider the alternatives, which will
ultimately lead to prison. This is certainly true. However, I
would recommend that you let your opponent use it first, and that
you do not promote it as a cause. </p>

<h3>Don't defend the use of drugs. </h3>

<p> Don't tell people that everyone has a God-given right to put
whatever they want to in to their body. You may be right, and I
happen to agree, but it won't play in Peoria. Many people just
view this as an excuse to get loaded (and, in many cases, they
are right). </p>

<h3>Don't advance your own plan for selling drugs. </h3>

<p> Do not discuss your personal plan for how legalization would
work The reasons are: </p>

<p> a) You can only sell one product at a time. First convince
them <u>whether</u> we should change the laws. We will have
plenty of time for <u>how</u> later. </p>

<p> b) When you suggest how it should be done then your
individual ideas become the focus. If your plan fails for any
reason, then your whole argument will fail, and; </p>

<p> c) The real secret is that there is no right answer to drug
policy. Every idea you will suggest is only the lesser of
multiple evils and leaves you open to violent emotional attack. </p>

<h3>Don't get tied up in debates over the health risks. </h3>

<p> First let me state that the evidence is quite clear that, by
any standard of comparison, alcohol and tobacco are far more
dangerous than almost any of the illegal drugs. However, the
relative health risks are not really the issue. </p>

<p> Just because something is dangerous does not automatically
mean that the best approach to those dangers is to throw millions
of people in prison. We all know that tobacco, and alcohol, and
AIDS are hazardous to your health. But we all would agree that
prison is not the best public policy for those hazards. Prison,
in fact, would be a terrible mistake. </p>

<p> It is the same principle with illegal drugs. We can assume
that drugs are dangerous. That is not the question. The question
is: What is the best public policy for those dangers? On this
question, every major study of drug policy has agreed that,
whatever the dangers may be, prison is the wrong approach. Every
major study recommended decriminalization <u>because</u> of those
dangers, and because prison is the worst approach. Bigger prisons
do not equal better public health policy. </p>

<h3>Don't get stuck on questions which cannot be answered. </h3>

<p> Congressman Charles Rangel likes to ask the question,
&quot;How do you propose that we go about legalizing drugs?
Should we have crack stores next to liquor stores?&quot; The
trick is that there really is no perfect answer, and any answer
you give leaves you open to attack. It turns the issue into one
of your personal social ideas rather than the objective truth
that all studies agree that decriminalization, under almost any
scenario, is a better approach. </p>

<h3>Don't Overdose </h3>

<p> I generally avoid mention of overdoses because the word
itself distorts the issue in a very emotional sense. The drug
which produces the most overdoses is alcohol. No one thinks of a
drunk high school kid puking into a toilet as a drug overdose,
even when you point it out to them. Consumers Union found that
there are very few real drug overdoses and none at all for
marijuana. Most of the so-called &quot;overdoses&quot; were
clearly attributable to other causes, such as impurities in the
drugs. </p>

<h3>Don't get the issues stuck between you </h3>

<p> People are more likely to believe you and be persuaded by
what you say if they feel that you share their same basic
concerns, that is, if they feel you are &quot;on their
side.&quot; Always explain you answers in terms of their thoughts
and goals. Your goals are probably the same as theirs anyway --
reducing the harm done by drugs, keeping drugs away from kids,
controlling the social costs of drugs, etc. </p>

<h3>Don't let them have anything. </h3>

<p> There are many, many myths about drugs and drug use. Like for
instance, the old myth that pushers spike marijuana with heroin
and cocaine to get unsuspecting kids hooked. It doesn't happen. <u>Licit
and Illicit Drugs</u> effectively explodes most of these myths.
If your opponent mentions such a myth, jump down his throat and
point out that there is no evidence at all to support what he is
saying. Make them prove it. You can prove what you say, they
can't. </p>

<h3>Don't get stuck on Constitutional issues. </h3>

<p> Issues based on the US Constitution will generally not be
persuasive for a number of reasons: </p>

<ol>
    <li>They are complicated. They require a lot of knowledge of
        history, law, and other subjects which most people,
        including you, are not likely to have. Like any other
        complicated issue, anyone can make long-winded
        discussions go on forever with no clear resolution.
        Complicated arguments are best avoided because they just
        don't win. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>The people who are likely to agree with you probably
        already agree with you. Many Americans, including some
        intelligent ones, do not understand the protections
        afforded by the Constitution and why they are so
        important. Many people tend to feel that the protections
        of the Constitution were only meant to be given to the
        law-abiding citizens like them and, besides, if innocent
        people are hurt because the police have violated their
        rights, then that is just the price we have to pay for
        law and order. It is pointless to argue with these people
        on this point because, for the most part, you are not
        going to change their basic attitude about it. </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>Even if you win, you don't win anything. Even if you get
        your opponent to agree that Fourth Amendment rights (or
        some other rights) are being violated by the police, it
        can be dismissed as simple bad management. That is, they
        will argue that we should manage it a little better, but
        we still ought to continue the war on drugs.
        Constitutional arguments in general do not effectively
        address the point that the drug war is morally and
        practically wrong at its very foundations. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="q1">1. Why were the laws against drugs passed in the
first place? </a></h2>

<p>The first American anti-drug law was an 1875 San Francisco
ordinance which outlawed the smoking of opium in opium dens. It
was passed because of the fear that Chinese men were luring white
women to their &quot;ruin&quot; in opium dens. &quot;Ruin&quot;
was defined as associating with Chinese men. It was followed by
other similar laws, including Federal laws in which trafficking
in opium was forbidden to anyone of Chinese origin, and
restrictions on the importation of smoking opium. The laws did
not have anything really to do with the importation of opium as a
drug, because the importation and use of opium in other forms --
such as in the common medication laudunum -- were not affected.
The laws were directed at smoking opium because it was perceived
that the smoking of opium was a peculiarly Chinese custom. In
short, it was a way of legally targeting the Chinese. </p>

<p>Cocaine was outlawed because of fears that superhuman
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiends&quot; or &quot;Cocainized
Niggers&quot; (actual terms used by newspapers in the early
1900's) take large amounts of cocaine which would make them go on
a violent sexual rampage and rape white women. There is little
evidence that any black men actually did this, if only because it
would have been certain death. The United States set a record in
1905 with 105 recorded lynchings of black men. At the same time,
police nationwide switched from .32 caliber pistols to .38
caliber pistols because it was believed that the superhuman
&quot;Negro Cocaine Fiend&quot; could not be killed with the
smaller gun. </p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton Wright is sometimes referred to as the
&quot;Father of American Drug Laws&quot;. Dr. Wright was the
Opium Commissioner at the time and had previously become famous
because he had &quot;scientifically proved&quot; that beri-beri
was a communicable disease. Beri-beri is a vitamin deficiency. </p>

<p>The Harrison Act which &quot;outlawed&quot; these drugs was,
on its face, a simple licensing law which simply required sellers
to get a license if they were going to handle the opiates and
cocaine. As the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs
has said, it is doubtful that very many members of Congress would
have thought that they were passing what would later be regarded
as a general drug prohibition. The law even contained a provision
that nothing in the law would prohibit doctors from prescribing
these drugs in the legitimate practice of medicine. </p>

<p>In fact, even the people who wrote the Harrison Act and the
Marijuana Tax Act in 1937 agreed that a general prohibition on
what people could put into their own bodies was plainly an
unconstitutional infringement on personal liberties. For
comparison, see the history of the constitutional amendment which
was required to prohibit alcohol. There is no fundamental reason
why a constitutional amendment should be required to prohibit one
chemical and not another. </p>

<p>The trick was that the bureaucrats who were authorized to
issue licenses never did so, and there was a heavy penalty for
not having the license. This heavy penalty required that the
enforcing bureaucrats needed more staff and, therefore, more
power, which, in turn required tougher laws. Over the years,
through a series of court rulings, they gradually got the courts
to change what had been well-established constitutional law.
Specifically, they got the courts to accept the notion that it
really was a tax violation when people got arrested for drugs,
and that the fact that the government would not issue any
licenses was not a defense. They also got the courts to bypass
the old issue of whether the Federal Government had the right to
control what an individual puts into their own bodies by creating
the fiction that whatever the person puts into their bodies must
have come as a result of some form of interstate commerce, which
is regulated by the Federal Government in the form of taxes and
licenses and, therefore, since the Federal Government is allowed
to levy a tax it is -- by rather indirect logic -- allowed to
regulate what anyone may put into their own bodies. </p>

<p>Marijuana was outlawed in 1937 as a repressive measure against
Mexican workers who crossed the border seeking jobs during the
Depression. The specific reason given for the outlawing of the
hemp plant was its supposed violent &quot;effect on the
degenerate races.&quot; (Testimony of Bureau of Narcotics
Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger, in testimony before Congress in
hearings on the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937). The American Medical
Association specifically testified that they were opposed to the
law. When the supporters of the law were asked about the AMA's
view on the law on the floor of Congress, they lied and said that
the AMA was in favor of the law because they knew the law would
never pass without the AMA's endorsement. The law passed, and the
AMA later protested, but the law was never repealed. </p>

<p>In both cases, newspapers across the country carried lurid
stories of the awful things that these drugs did to racial
minorities, and of the horrors that people of racial minorities
inflicted on innocent white people while they were under the
influence of these drugs. Later research has shown that not a
single one of the stories used to promote these laws could be
substantiated. </p>

<p>There never was any scholarly evidence that the laws were
necessary, or even beneficial, to public health and safety and
none was presented when the laws were passed. </p>

<h2><a name="q2">2. How many people use drugs in the United
States?</a> </h2>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer with any certainty. </p>

<p>The Federal Government's Household Survey on Drug Abuse,
conducted annually, is the most commonly cited set of statistics
on the prevalence of drug use. According to the latest surveys,
cited by the DEA themselves, there are about 12.7 million people
who have used some illegal drug in the last month and perhaps 30
to 40 million who have used some illegal drug within the last
year. Of the 12.7 million who used illegal drugs in the last
month, about 10 million are presumed to be casual drug users, and
about 2.7 million are addicts. </p>

<p>But there are a number of problems with these figures. The
survey is conducted by calling people on the telephone at random
and asking them about their use of illegal drugs. Some of the
problems with this technique are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>It only reaches people who have a telephone. If the
        effects of drugs are as bad as some people claim, it
        seems only reasonable that a lot of addicts would no
        longer have a telephone. </li>
    <li>It only reaches people who answered the telephone. There
        are many groups of people who would not necessarily
        answer the phone, including addicts who are out looking
        for drugs, as well as business people out for a
        two-martini lunch. </li>
    <li>The survey crew calls people they don't know and asks
        them if anyone in their household has committed a felony
        (used drugs) recently. In a time of increasing penalties
        for drug use, and increasing publicity about those
        penalties, it seems only logical that most people would
        not answer this question entirely honestly, particularly
        if they were currently using drugs and, therefore, were
        acutely aware of the penalties. Rather than a measure of
        the number of people who use drugs, the Household Survey
        may be a better measure of the number of people stupid
        enough to answer the question. </li>
</ol>

<p>Other surveys put the number of drug users at levels that are
perhaps twice as high as the figures produced by the Household
Survey on Drug Abuse. The very disparity of the estimates of
various surveys points to one of the problems caused by a general
drug prohibition. Because these drugs are illegal, it is
difficult to get accurate information about their use. </p>

<p>The source for the number of drug users comes from, among
other sources, the Household Survey on Drug Abuse, a Federal
survey, available through any of the sources listed here. The
costs to imprison them are based upon figures published by the
Department of Justice, available through the sources mentioned
here. </p>

<h2><a name="q3">3. How many people are actually killed by drugs?</a>
</h2>

<p>The number of drug deaths in the US in a typical year is as
follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Tobacco kills about 390,000. </li>

<h2><a name="q4">4. Which drug causes the greatest burden on our
medical facilities? </a></h2>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco are the clear leaders. Some authorities
have estimated that up to forty percent of all hospital care in
the United States is for conditions related to alcohol. </p>

<p>As a medical hazard, few drugs can compete with alcohol or
tobacco on any scale. A study at Rockefeller University in 1967
concluded that &quot;Tobacco is unquestionably more hazardous to
the health than heroin.&quot; </p>

<h2><a name="q5">5. Which drugs are the most addictive? </a></h2>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer because it depends upon
a lot of factors in both the drug and the person who uses it. In
an attempt to define clearly what is meant by addiction, and
which drugs are the most addictive, Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of
the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of
the University of California at San Francisco ranked six
psychoactive substances on five criteria. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Withdrawal -- The severity of withdrawal symptoms
        produced by stopping the use of the drug. </li>
    <li>Reinforcement -- The drug's tendency to induce users to
        take it again and again. </li>
    <li>Tolerance -- The user's need to have ever-increasing
        doses to get the same effect. </li>
    <li>Dependence -- The difficulty in quitting, or staying off
        the drug, the number of users who eventually become
        dependent </li>
    <li>Intoxication -- The degree of intoxication produced by
        the drug in typical use. </li>
</ul>

<p>The tables listed below show the rankings given for each of
the drugs. Overall, their evaluations for the drugs are very
consistent. It is notable that marijuana ranks below caffeine in
most addictive criteria, while alcohol and tobacco are near the
top of the scale in many areas. </p>

<p>The rating scale is from 1 to 6. 1 denotes the drug with the
strongest addictive tendencies, while 6 denotes the drug with the
least addictive tendencies. </p>

<h2><a name="q6">6. Do illegal drugs cause violent crime? </a></h2>

<ul>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. After large doses of amphetamines, cocaine,
        LSD, and PCP, certain individuals may experience violent
        outbursts, probably because of preexisting psychosis.
        Research is needed on the pharmacological effects of
        crack, which enters the brain more directly than cocaine
        used in other forms. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. . . . </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../GOVPUBS/psycviol.htm">Psychoactive Substances and
Violence</a><i>, by Jeffrey A. Roth, Department of Justice
Series: Research in Brief, Published: February 1994</i> </p>

<p>All major authorities agree that the vast majority of
drug-related violent crime is caused by the prohibition against
drugs, rather than the drugs themselves. This was the same
situation which was true during alcohol Prohibition. Alcohol
Prohibition gave rise to a violent criminal organization. Violent
crime dropped 65 percent in the year Prohibition was repealed. </p>

<p>There are about 25,000 homicides in the United States each
year. A study of 414 homicides in New York City at the height of
the crack epidemic showed that only three murders, less than one
percent, could be attributed to the behavioral effects of cocaine
or crack. Of these, two were victim-precipitated. For example,
one homicide victim tried to rape someone who was high on crack
and got killed in the process. </p>

<h2><a name="q7">7. Can we win the war on drugs this way? </a></h2>

<p>We could win the war on drugs if we could be successful in at
least one of three areas: </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/subbutto.gif" align="bottom" width="18"
height="15">We could stop drug production in other countries. </h3>

<p>On December 28, 1992 ABC Television aired a major special on
the drug war in Bolivia which, according to the Bush
Administration, is our &quot;best hope&quot; for winning the drug
war in South America. They concluded decisively that there was no
hope and that the war on drug production has already been lost. </p>

<p>By the US Federal Government's own estimates, the entire
United States consumption of illegal drugs could be supplied by
approximately one percent of the worldwide drug crop. In their
best year, US Drug Enforcement Agents working together with
foreign governments seized about one percent of the worldwide
drug crop, leaving 99 percent free to supply the US. The US
Government also states that, in the unlikely event that drug
production was stopped in South America, several countries would
suffer a major economic collapse. </p>

<p>There is no credible evidence anywhere to suggest that there
is any possibility that drug production can be eliminated in
other countries. </p>

Bolivia,&quot; ABC News, December 28, 1993 </p>

<p>US Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics
Matters, <u>International Narcotics Control Strategy Report</u>
(INCSR) (Washington: US Department of State, April, 1993 </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/subbutto.gif" align="bottom" width="18"
height="15">We could stop drugs at the border. </h3>

<p>No. Any examination of the statistics regarding border
interdiction shows quite clearly that border interdiction is an
expensive failure. In 1990, the General Accounting Office
completed a major study on border interdiction. They reported
that border interdiction was a waste of money and that no
conceivable increase in funding or effort would make it any
better. </p>

<p>In 1988, Stirling Johson, the Federal prosecutor for New York,
stated that the police would have to increase drug seizures by at
least 1,400 percent to have any impact at all on the drug market,
assuming there were no corresponding increases in production.
That was before the police busted twenty tons of cocaine in a
single location and had to revise all their estimates of the
cocaine market upward. </p>

<p>The best Federal Government evidence has concluded that there
is no way to stop, or even greatly reduce, either production of
drugs in foreign countries or the smuggling of drugs into the US.
</p>

<p>There is no credible evidence anywhere that we could stop, or
even greatly reduce, the flow of drugs across our borders. In
fact, all of the Federal Government's own evidence shows that
this is impossible and it is a waste of money to try. </p>

Corporation, Santa Monica, CA, 1988 </p>

Accounting Office, September 19, 1991 </p>

<h3><img src="../GRAPHICS/subbutto.gif" align="bottom" width="18"
height="15">We could stop the sale of drugs within the United
States, </h3>

<p>The first question to address is how many drug dealers are
there? Under the law, all drug users are drug dealers because the
laws in most states state that any distribution of illegal drugs
is considered a sale, regardless of whether there is a profit or
monetary interest involved. Therefore, under the law, anyone who
ever passed a joint to the next person at a rock concert is a
&quot;drug dealer&quot;. If we use the strict legal definition of
a &quot;dealer&quot; then there are somewhere between 12 and 40
million drug dealers in the United States. </p>

<p>We might use a more restricted definition and assume that we
will imprison only the drug dealers who distribute drugs on a
regular basis. Research has long established that most drug sales
are between friends who have known each other for a long time.
Still, under this tighter definition, most drug users would be
classed as &quot;drug dealers&quot; and we are left with the same
problem of potentially incarcerating tens of millions of
Americans. </p>

<p>No. Most of the prisons and jails in the United States are
already far in excess of their planned capacity and correctional
institutions in 24 states are under Federal court order to
release prisoners. Arresting all of the drug dealers would
require construction of at least five new prison beds for every
one which now exists, assuming that no new drug dealers came
along to fill the gap. </p>

<p>In September, 1992 Sheriff Sherman Block announced that he
would release 4,000 prisoners, about twenty percent of the total
Los Angeles County jail population, because there was no room to
keep them and no more tax dollars to build more jails. For every
person who goes to jail from now on, another one will be
released. Tough drug laws have done all they can do and they have
not solved the problem. The &quot;get-tough&quot; policy is over.
</p>

<p>There is no credible evidence anywhere that we could stop, or
even greatly reduce, the sale of drugs within the United States.
In fact, all of the Federal Government's own evidence shows that
this is impossible and not only is it a waste of money to try,
but it actually does more harm than if we did nothing at all. </p>

Johnson, Federal Prosecutor for the District of New York, in
testimony before the House Select Committee on Narcotics and Drug
Abuse, September, 1988. </p>

<p><img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<h2><a name="q8">8. How many millions of people will have to go
to prison?</a> </h2>

<p>There are currently about 1.5 million people in state and
Federal prisons and jails throughout the United States. At the
current time, at least 24 states are under Federal court orders
to relieve prison overcrowding. </p>

<p>The following chart shows the growth of the US prison
population since 1960. The US prison population was relatively
stable from about 1926, when figures were first compiled, through
1970. After this point, the effects of Nixon's war against drugs,
and later the Reagan and Bush war against drugs, produced a
dramatic increase in the number of prisoners. </p>

<p><img src="prisnrs.gif" align="bottom" width="640" height="480">
</p>

<p>There are an estimated thirty to forty million people who have
used illegal drugs in the last year. If we imprisoned all of
them, we would have to build a prison large enough to hold the
combined populations of California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The
total cost to imprison them for five years, including the costs
of arrest and prosecution would be roughly ten to fifteen
trillion dollars, or about ten times the total Federal annual
budget. This does not include the related costs to society which
would be caused by the imprisonment of millions of gainfully
employed, tax-paying citizens. </p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any clear answer to this question. I
have asked public officials of all kinds, including law
enforcement officers, elected officials and all three of the US
Federal Drug Czars. To date, the only person who has ever replied
with an actual numerical estimate is Michael Levine, one of the
DEA's former top agents. He estimated that the optimum number of
drug offenders to put in prison would be about 2.7 million -- in
addition to the people who are currently in prison. His
assumption, he said, was that we would put all of the addicts in
prison, and he estimated the number of addicts at about 2.7
million, based on other government figures. Mr. Levine's plan
would require that, for every prison cell which now exists, we
would have to build three more just like it. He did not say what
he would do about the fact that even this plan would leave tens
of millions of recreational drug users free to continue their
drug use with little fear of prosecution. </p>

height="19"> </p>

<h2><a name="q9">9. What does it cost to put a single drug dealer
in jail? </a></h2>

<p>The cost to put a single drug dealer in jail is about
$450,000, composed of the following: </p>

<p>The cost for arrest and conviction is about $150,000. </p>

<p>The cost for an additional prison bed is about $50,000 to
$150,000, depending upon the jurisdiction. </p>

<p>It costs about $30,000 per year to house a prisoner. With an
average sentence of 5 years, that adds up to another $150,000. </p>

<p>The same $450,000 can provide treatment or education for about
200 people. In addition, putting a person in prison produces
about fifteen dollars in related welfare costs, for every dollar
spent on incarceration. Every dollar spent on treatment and
education saves about five dollars in related welfare costs. </p>

<h2><a name="q10">10. What does this drug policy do to the black
community? </a></h2>

<p>At the present time, one-fourth of all of the young black men
in America are either in prison or on parole. Most of them were
arrested on non-violent drug charges. </p>

<p>In Washington, DC, the Bush administration's
&quot;demonstration&quot; city, half of all of the black men in
the city are currently in jail or on parole. More than ninety
percent have arrest records. The same is true of inner city black
men in Baltimore, New York, New Jersey, and Florida. </p>

<p>Two-thirds of all of today's black male high school students
will be dead, disabled, or in prison before their thirtieth
birthday. The majority will go to prison because of non-violent
drug charges. For every black man who goes to college, three will
go to prison. </p>

<p>By the year 2000, about half of all black men in America will
have gone to prison. Most of them will go to prison for
non-violent drug charges. Most of those who go to prison will be
released into society again. Because they are black men with a
prison record, they will be permanently unemployable. </p>

<h2><a name="q11">11. How does our policy compare with the
policies of other countries?</a> </h2>

<p>Europe is beginning to form uniform drug laws as a result of
European unification. Europe is decriminalizing drugs along the
lines of the programs used in England and the Netherlands. Most
of the countries have already approved the Frankfort Accord,
which adopts decriminalization as the primary approach to drugs. </p>

<p>Let's compare the results of two roughly comparable major
cities which both have a drug problem. The cities are New York,
and Liverpool, England. </p>

<ul>
    <li>In New York, heroin and cocaine addicts suffer from
        tremendous medical problems. In Liverpool, England, most
        heroin and cocaine addicts suffer few medical problems. </li>
    <li>In New York, most drug addicts are unemployed criminals.
        In Liverpool, most drug addicts are gainfully employed
        taxpayers. </li>
    <li>In New York, crime committed by drug addicts is a major
        problem. In Liverpool, it is a very minor problem. </li>
    <li>In New York, drug addicts often have their children taken
        away and live under miserable conditions. In Liverpool,
        most addicts live with their families in stable homes and
        manage to raise healthy, well-adjusted children. </li>
    <li>In New York, thousands of babies are permanently damaged
        every year by their mother's drug use. In Liverpool,
        health authorities report no cases of harm to infants as
        a result of their mother's drug use. </li>
    <li>In New York, sixty percent of all intravenous drug users
        are infected with AIDS, and they are a major cause of the
        spread of AIDS. In Liverpool, only one percent of the
        intravenous drug users are infected with AIDS and they
        are a very minor source of infection for the rest of the
        population. </li>
    <li>In the United States, drug use is illegal and the police
        hunt down drug users to throw them in prison. Four
        thousand people died from illegal drugs in the US last
        year and we now have more than 600,000 people in prison
        on drug charges. </li>
    <li>In Liverpool, England, the police do not arrest drug
        users any more. Instead, health care workers seek them
        out and encourage them to come in for counseling and
        medical treatment. Both counseling and medical treatment
        are provided on demand. The medical treatment often
        includes maintenance doses of narcotics under the
        management of a physician. </li>
</ul>

<p>Liverpool, England, has adopted the same approach as the
Netherlands and has had substantially the same results. They both
chose decriminalizatiion. </p>

<h2><a name="q12">12. Do the illegal drugs have any legitimate
uses?</a> </h2>

<p>Heroin is a powerful pain-killer and could be used to control
extreme chronic pain or the pain of severe diseases, such as
cancer. The medical literature shows that heroin is significantly
less hazardous than most of the drugs which are given in its
place. </p>

<p>Cocaine is used as a topical anesthetic in medicine. </p>

<p>There are about 50,000 products which can be made from the
marijuana (hemp) plant. It has been used since the dawn of
history for the widest variety of uses. These uses include
fibers, fuels, materials, and medicine. The first American laws
regarding marijuana were passed in the 1700's and required
farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) because of its tremendous
commercial value for dozens of uses. It was grown throughout the
United States as a commercial product well into the 1940's. It
was made illegal in 1937 largely as a result of pressure from oil
and chemical companies who feared the competition from marijuana.
Despite the laws, during World War II marijuana was considered so
vital to the national interest that the US Government exempted
farmers from military duty if they grew marijuana. Local 4-H
clubs were encouraged to have their members grow marijuana and
the US Government produced a film called &quot;Hemp for
Victory&quot;' </p>

<p>Marijuana produces fibers which are ideal for ropes, cloth,
paper, and dozens of other products. The fiber is unusually
strong, soft, absorbent and cheap to produce. If we grew
marijuana solely for paper production, we could completely
eliminate cutting forests for paper. Marijuana produces eighty
times as much usable fiber per acre as a comparable stand of
forest. </p>

<p>Marijuana can produce several different kinds of fuel. In the
1800's and 1900's hempseed oil was the primary source of fuel in
the United States and was commonly used for lamps and other oil
energy needs. The diesel engine was originally designed to run on
marijuana oil because Rudolf Diesel assumed that it would be the
most common fuel. Mairjuana is also the most efficient plant for
the production of methanol. It is estimated that, in one form or
another, marijuana grown in the United States could provide up to
ninety percent of the nation's entire energy needs. </p>

<p>Marijuana is useful for a wide variety of medical problems
and, according the the Drug Enforcement Administration's Chief
Administrative Law Judge, &quot;marijuana is probably the safest
therapeutically active substance known to man,&quot; and &quot;it
is safer than many of the foods we commonly eat.&quot; Marijuana
is often the most effective treatment for chronic pain, glaucoma,
nausea from chemotherapy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other
medical conditions. </p>

<p>Marijuana can also be used to restore the life of depleted
farmland. It grows quite readily under even extreme conditions
and actually replenishes and extends the life of the soil in
which it is grown. Depleted soil is now becoming a major problem
in some of our most productive agricultural farmlands, such as
the Central Valley of California. For much of this farmland,
marijuana could be the cheapest and most effective remedy. </p>

<p><img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<h2><a name="q14">13. Does marijuana lead to harder drugs?</a> </h2>

<p>There is no evidence that smoking marijuana leads to the use
of harder drugs. In the first place, it is chemically illogical
that the consumption of any drug could give someone the craving
for another drug they have never had. </p>

<p>When the Marihuana Tax Act was first passed in 1937, Harry
Anslinger, then head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics testified
before Congress and was asked specifically if there was any
association between the use of marijuana and the use of harder
drugs. He replied specifically that there was no such connection
and that the users of the different types of drugs commonly did
not associate with each other. </p>

<p>This myth arose in the 1950's when it became apparent that the
old motives for the law against marijuana would no longer be
viable. It was then that Anslinger contradicted his earlier
testimony and started saying that marijuana led to harder drugs.
This change occurred most prominently in the hearings for the
Boggs Act of 1951, after a series of doctors had just destroyed
everything Harry Anslinger had said about marijuana in 1937. </p>

<h2>14. What should we do about drugs? </h2>

<h2><a name="q15">15.</a> How dangerous is marijuana, really? </h2>

<p>Not very. The DEA's own Chief Administrative Law Judge, after
listening to the evidence for two years concluded that marijuana
in its natural form is safer than many of the foods we commonly
eat. More detailed information can be found in the following

<h2><a name="q16">16.</a> Would &quot;legalization&quot; cost
more than it saves? </h2>

<p><img src="../GRAPHICS/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p>No. The best analysis done to date by any Federal official
shows that &quot;legalization&quot; of the now illegal drugs
would result in a net $37 Billion annual savings. This estimate
is considered conservative. That is, it is likely that the
savings would be more. </p>

<p><a href="savings.htm">Federal Financial Analysis of
Legalization of Drugs</a> </p>

<p>This Federal financial analysis of legalization comes from
Theodore R. Vallance, Former chief of the Planning Branch of the
National Institutes of Mental Health. His main professional
effort for many years was directed at just this sort of analysis.
The analysis was published in the 7-10-95 issue of National
Review. </p>

<h1>How to Approach the Black Community </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> There have been many people who have rightly criticized the
fact that the drug policy reform movement has not made major
allies in the black community - despite the fact that the black
community is clearly the most severely impacted by the drug war.
Instead, the reaction in the black community is often one of even
greater calls for law enforcement presence and even greater
support for the drug war. </p>

<p> While this is largely true, it is simply a matter that most
black people (like most white people) don't realize how we got to
where we are today with the drug problem. As soon as it is
explained in terms that are relevant and understandable to them,
they readily understand and agree with the need for reform -
specifically, not putting nearly so many people in prison. </p>

<p> I have always found it relatively easy to get black people,
particularly black leaders, to support drug policy reform. They
will not support &quot;legalization&quot;, but they will support
specific steps of reform which both they and the
&quot;legalizers&quot; agree are necessary. They already have a
problem with too many liquor stores in their communities, so they
will not support ideas which look like you are going to open up a
legal chain of crack houses. They can be expected to argue for
the point that we simply need to stop and look at what we are
doing, and seriously question the whole program. They will also
support and argue for constructive, rather than destructive
approaches to the problem. </p>

<p> Ultimately, many black leaders will tell you privately that
they support &quot;legalization&quot;, if they are just given the
facts as a basis for their view. However, they will still have a
significant problem with the public presentation. One church
leader told us that his church had once issued a health kit which
included various first aid items, educational materials, phone
numbers to call, a lot of other things, and a condom. He said
there was a storm of controversy about nothing but the condom and
they eventually had to take it out of the package because they
were spending all their time explaining it and defending it to
people, so they couldn't get anything else done. They ultimately
figured that it would be better to distribute the same package
with everything but the condom. It is sad, but it is a functional
reality of the community they live in. It is one task to persuade
them of the need for reform. It is another task to help them find
ways that they can address the issue with their own community. </p>

<h2>How to Find Them, Approach Them, and Win Them Over </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Do your homework. Be up to date on the latest stats,
        issues, and arguments as they relate to the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Look in the phone book for any churches or other social
        organizations located in, or allied to, the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Call the head of the organization and arrange an
        appointment. Most of them, particularly churches, will
        give you one if you just ask. </li>
    <li>Be prepared with charts, graphs, statistics, historical
        information, and reference sources, so you have an
        interesting and persuasive presentation. </li>
    <li>Cover the racial origins of the laws, with appropriate
        citations and quotes. </li>
    <li>Cover the current situation with black men, <u>including
        the lifetime risk of prison for black men</u> - and how
        the probability of a drug conviction relates to that
        total risk. </li>
    <li>Don't expect them to trust white people. After the last
        200 years, they are justified in being a little
        suspicious at times. Ask them to trust themselves and
        check everything you say. Then give them the reference
        sources to do it. </li>
    <li>Don't use the &quot;L&quot; word, the &quot;D&quot; word,
        or the &quot;M&quot; word. Use the &quot;R&quot; word -
        Reform - in terms that are specific to the concerns of
        the black community. Talk about constructive (treatment
        and education) rather than destructive (prison)
        approaches to the drug problem. </li>
    <li>They know that you (like most of those goody-good white
        people who come down to meddle in their community) are
        going to be gone tomorrow and not living with the
        consequences of whatever takes place in their community.
        Your arguments must, at all times, be expressed in terms
        which are meaningful and relevant to them. </li>
    <li>Understand their position. They CANNOT be seen as
        promoting or condoning drug use in any way at all. If you
        tell them you support the right of everyone to get
        loaded, you will find yourself in the parking lot in a
        matter of seconds. </li>
    <li>Remember that the Christian belief is very strong in the
        black community (though they do tend to have a somewhat
        more vigorous approach to their religion than those
        stuffy white people). The argument about what Jesus would
        do - build bigger prisons, or build hospitals and schools
        - will strike a resonant chord with many of them.
        Contrast love, compassion, and healing, with punishment,
        prison, and destruction. </li>
    <li>Help them to find a way to talk about it publicly. The
        issue of the disparity in the sentencing, and the sheer
        numbers of black men going to prison alone means that we
        should <b>AT LEAST </b>back up and take an honest look at
        what we are doing in the drug war. We must build, not
        destroy. And we must examine the entire drug war, not
        just the crack laws. </li>
    <li>Get them involved in our alliance. Get them connected to
        the Internet, if possible, (usually not possible), or get
        them on the mailing lists of the relevant organizations.
        Find someone from their group who will take the
        initiative in maintaining and responding to
        communications. </li>
    <li>Tell them about the online library and the fact that it
        has large amounts of information about the racial roots
        of the drug war, as well as other information. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Questions </h2>

<p> I have listed below, a number of the common questions which
will come up in such an interview, whether they are explicitly
stated or not. </p>

<h3>What is their biggest concern? </h3>

<p> Their biggest single concern at this point is the ongoing
massive destruction of black men. Black men are being rendered
&quot;economically dead&quot; by the massive imposition of prison
sentences. Their point of view may be somewhat skewed, in that
they may view this as a result of the drugs, not the laws, and it
may not have occurred to them that, as bad as drugs are, criminal
punishment is not the way to address the problem. </p>

<h3>Why did this white boy come all the way over here to tell
this to me? </h3>

<p> Because I am concerned about the drug war for my own reasons,
and I have the good sense to recognize that there are other
people who would also have concerns, for their own reasons. We
will both achieve better results if we work together toward
common goals. And, just as a matter of common sense and common
decency, I think it is pretty stupid to lock up half of all the
black men in America. There has to be a better way. </p>

<h3>Why should I trust you? </h3>

<p> Don't trust me. Trust yourself. I will simply give you a
point of view and the evidence which I think firmly supports it.
I think the evidence will shock you, but I don't ask you to
believe it. I will give you the reference sources where I got it,
and I encourage you to do your own research and let me know of
any facts or issues that I have missed. My strongest allies have
always come from the people who went to the library and verified
what I said. </p>

<h3>Why should black people support drug policy reform? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Because the drug problem is tearing up the black
        community and we need to find a better approach -
        whatever it may be. </li>
    <li>Because the drug laws were based on racism from their
        inception, so there is no reason to expect them to be
        balanced and productive laws today. </li>
    <li>Because every major study of drug policy said that this
        policy only caused more harm than good, particularly for
        poor communities. </li>
    <li>Because it is what Jesus would do. </li>
    <li>Because we want to rebuild black men and make them
        productive citizens, not destroy them. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Are you asking me to support legalization? </h3>

<p> Not at all. I am asking you to recognize the simple
proposition that prison has become a bigger threat to black men
than the drugs themselves. Black men can, and do, recover from
drug problems and go on to live productive lives. They have a
much harder time recovering from a long stretch in prison. We
need to discourage drug use but we do not need to destroy their
lives in order to save them. </p>

<h3>But some of these guys are dangerous and need to be locked
up! </h3>

<p> I fully admit that there are a good number of black men out
there who are dangerous and should be locked up for the good of
society. But we have now reached the point where about half of
all the young black men in America will have spent at least one
stretch in prison before they are thirty. I find it hard to
believe that we have to lock up half of all the young black men
in America for the good of society. Whenever the numbers get that
large, we must stop and ask ourselves if this is really the best
course of action. </p>

<h3>Don't we need some jails? </h3>

<p> Certainly we do. But we learned long ago that, as bad as
alcohol is, Prohibition only caused more problems than it solved.
In the current situation, we can use our money to put one more
black man in prison, or we can use the same amount of money to
provide education or treatment to more than one hundred black
men. Suppose that someone gave us the decision on where we should
spend the next million dollars of tax money on this problem -
what should we do? Should we provide education and treatment for
up to two hundred people, or should we put two more drug dealers
in jail? </p>

<h3>How can I speak about this publicly? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Talk about the terrible damage being done by not only the
        crack laws, but the drug laws in general. The crack laws
        are the worst example, but they are only one small part
        of a bigger system that is severely impacting black men. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for education and treatment, not
        prison. Talk about the need for responses to the problem
        which build people rather than destroy them. </li>
    <li>Talk about the racial roots of the drug laws - how these
        laws were built on racism from their very inception, and
        how the image of the Negro Cocaine Fiend in 1914 is
        repeated in the image of the crack-fiend today. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for an open and honest investigation
        of this entire drug problem - not just the mandatory
        minimums for crack. It is the entire drug policy which is
        wrong and it is the entire drug policy which must be
        fairly, openly, and honestly investigated. </li>
</ol>

<H1>Answers to Specific Arguments on Drug Legalization</H1>

<P>
by Clifford A. Schaffer
<H1><IMG SRC="../graphics/blueline.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </H1>

<H3>If we legalize/decriminalize drugs then everyone will become
drug addicts. </H3>

<P>
Every major study of drug policy agreed that there is no evidence
to support this belief and, even if drug use did increase, decriminalization
would still be a better approach. In Europe, several countries
have decriminalized drugs and actually seen a significant drop
in drug use.
<H3>We need a combined approach of education, treatment, prevention,
and stiff law enforcement. </H3>

<P>
This is a smoke screen, designed to cloud the issue and make your
opponent seem like they are taking the most rational, balanced
approach while you are the one who is suggesting the extremist
measures. Don't let them get away with it. You can kick all of
their extraneous arguments out of the way and refocus the issue

<P>
We agree one hundred percent on education, treatment, and prevention.
The only place where we part company is on prisons. My opponent
wants to build prisons larger than the Nazi concentration camps
of World War II. I don't think that is necessarily a good idea.
<H3>We have to keep these drugs illegal to protect our children.
</H3>

<P>
I agree. That's why I am looking for a better solution -- because
what we are doing now is obviously not working. In fact, the current
policy is one of the main reasons that drug users find it profitable
to get kids involved in drugs and distribute drugs free on school
campuses. I believe that we can find a better approach which would
stop this.
<H3>My son/daughter was turned into a psycho by drugs so we have
to stamp out this evil menace. </H3>

<P>
(Keep in mind that the person who says this kind of thing is probably
under tremendous emotional stress so it would not be polite or
productive to suggest that their kid was probably a psycho all
along. Keep a gentle, sympathetic demeanor.)
<P>
We have made these drugs as illegal as they can be and these kinds
of tragedies still happen. The fact that your son/daughter became
a victim of these drugs shows, in itself, that the current policy
did not work for you and your family. All it really does is to
make it harder to provide treatment for the people who need it.
I believe that there may be a better way to handle the problem,
that just might have saved your son/daughter. Don't you think
that we should at least explore the possibility of a better way
to handle the problem?
<P>
Or:
<P>
What happened to your child is certainly a tragedy. But tell me,
would your child have been better off if they spent twenty years
in prison? 
<H3>I used to be a junkie until I was saved from the life of evil
and I know that drugs should not be legalized! </H3>

<P>
1) It is illegal now and that didn't stop you. All it really does
is keep most people from getting help sooner because we are spending
all of our money on prisons and we cannot provide adequate treatment.
<P>
2) Would you be better off if you had spent twenty years in prison?
If we really did it the way you are suggesting, you would still
be in prison and would not be here to talk to me.
<H3>You just want to legalize it -- you commie scum! </H3>

<P>
Of course, I have my own ideas about what might be a good solution
to the problem, but that is not the point. The point is that we
need to bring all of our best minds together to consider your
ideas for a better solution, as well as mine. The only way that
we will ever find a better approach is by an open and honest discussion
of the evidence and all of the possible approaches to the problem.

<H3>They tried this in Europe with Needle Park and it didn't work
so they are going back to throwing people in prison. </H3>

<P>
Absolutely not true. Europe, in general, is committed to decriminalization
and we invite anyone to talk to the law enforcement officials
in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, or Liverpool, and see for themselves.
There have been some policies which the European officials admit
did not work as well as others, such as Needle Park, but they
are still committed to a non-criminal approach to drugs. In addition,
England, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, and Colombia have
all taken steps toward the legalization or decriminalization of
drugs. In addition, both the head of Interpol and the British
Association of Chiefs of Police have called for an end to drug
prohibition.
<H3>What do <U>you</U> think we should do about drugs? </H3>

<P>
I have my own ideas about what might be a good solution to the
problem, but that is not the point, because I don't have all the
answers and nobody else does either. The point is that we need
to bring all of our best minds together to consider your ideas
for a better solution, as well as mine. The only way that we will
ever find a better approach is by an open and honest discussion
of the evidence and all of the possible approaches to the problem.

<P>
For starters, we might just take the recommendations of any major
study of drug policy that you like and start from there. (Then
hand them a list of the studies of drug policy.)
<H3>Well, why don't we legalize murder, and robbery, and all the
other crimes, and then we won't have a crime problem. </H3>

<P>
Drug use and murder are not the same in any sense so this is a
silly comparison to begin with. But let's consider this arguments
on its merits. There are about 25,000 homicides in the United
States each year, and there are about thirty million people who
use illegal drugs.
<P>
If we had thirty million murderers or robbers, we would have to
find another way to deal with the problem, simply because the
criminal justice system could not handle the load. This is the
case with the drug problem. It doesn't matter whether we want
to put all the drug users or dealers in prison, it simply is not
possible to do it by any stretch of the imagination.
<P>
But that avoids the real issue. The real issue is what is the
most effective way to deal with the problem. Even if we all agree
that drugs are bad, all of the evidence states that prison only
makes the problem worse.
<H3>We should make all the drug users get treatment and put all
the drug dealers in jail. </H3>

<P>
Let's suppose I agree with you one hundred percent and I will
run out right now and place the order for the new prison cells
we will need. Now, please tell me, exactly how many prison cells
will we need to build to carry out your plan?
<P>
If they say:
<P>
I don't know.
<P>
That is precisely the problem. No one has ever thought it through
as to what it will take to succeed with prison.
<H3>Aren't you really promoting drug use? </H3>

<P>
Not at all, and let me give you example. I personally think that
cigars are one of the most disgusting things I have ever encountered.
They are addictive, dangerous to the health of the smoker and
the people around them, and they smell awful. I will do everything
I reasonably can to keep people from smoking them in my presence,
and to encourage them to quit. However, at the same time, I have
the good sense to recognize that it would not accomplish anything
to throw George Burns in jail.
<H3>We can't legalize drugs because it would send the wrong message
to our children. </H3>

<P>
How many millions of people should we put in prison to send just
the right message? 
<P>
Is this really the best way you can think of to send a message
to children? If you can't do any better than that, perhaps we
should be spending our money on some simple courses in basic communication
or child-rearing.
<H3>We have so many problems with alcohol and tobacco already.
Why do you want to add to that? </H3>

<P>
Maybe you missed something. These drugs are already here. Even
the DEA admits that it has never had a significant impact on the
drug markets at any time. It is a not a question of adding to
anything. It is a question of finding the most effective way to
deal with a problem we already have.

<h2>Pot (Drugs) are Dangerous - How to Deal with the Argument </h2>

<p> <strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p> You have heard the argument before: </p>

<p> <strong>Pot is dangerous. It causes cancer, auto accidents,
grows hair on your palms, and makes you go blind.</strong> </p>

<p> This is a guide on how to deal with this argument in all
sorts of easy ways. Some of these arguments were developed during
debates with doctors, so some of them assume that the opponent is
a doctor. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">General
Discussion </h3>

<p> First, it is generally pointless to get tied up in debating
the details of health issues or, in general, any supposed danger
of drugs. The reason is that you get so wound up in trading
scientific references that you never get to the real bottom line
-- prison. Dr. So-and-So (who the audience doesn't know anyway)
says X, Dr. Whositt, says Y -- so what? </p>

<p> Net result -- you convince nobody. Once you have won your
main point, and established that criminal punishment is not an
effective approach to the problem -- no matter what you have
assumed about the dangers -- then you can go back and, at your
leisure, knock down their health evidence as well. </p>

<p> My approach -- conceding all their evidence up front -- does
a complete end run. They expect me to argue that pot doesn't
cause cancer, etc. When I don't, and jump to the bottom line
policy issue (prison), they are completely disarmed. They really
don't know what to do. They never thought about their logical
non-sequitir (Because XXXXX is dangerous, therefore prison is the
solution) and are completely unprepared to deal with arguments
which address the logical disconnect. Once they are sitting there
with a stunned expression on their face -- knowing they have been
completely cut off -- then I come back with the mop up campaign
of addressing the health risks and comparing them with other
health risks for which we do not put people in jail. By that
time, they will be doing little but nodding their head and
agreeing. </p>

<p> I remember one debate in which my opponent showed up with a
whole stack of medical references on the harmful effects of
drugs. A few minutes into the debate he closed his folder and
never opened it again. Of course, as always, he conceded and
agreed with me. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">The
Specific Responses </h3>

<p> Now for the specific responses: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Ok, you convinced me. Let's assume everything you say is
        true and it grows hair on your palms besides. How many
        millions of people do you suppose we ought to throw in
        prison for best results? </li>
    <li>Let's assume all the evidence you presented is 100
        percent accurate. The evidence you presented shows that
        pot is perhaps three times as carcinogenic as cigarettes.
        What does this mean in terms of policy? Does it mean that
        the penalties for pot should be three times the penalties
        for cigarettes? Then, of course, there should be even
        higher penalties for cigars and chewing tobacco, right? </li>
    <li>So the argument is XXXXXX causes cancer. Therefore, the
        law is really based on trying to prevent people from
        doing things which might give them cancer, right? Should
        we have laws against staying out in the sun too long,
        eating cheeseburgers, or smoking tobacco? </li>
    <li>The reasons you have stated never did have anything to do
        with why the laws were passed in the first place. Please
        answer two questions: Why were the drug laws passed in
        the first place? When did the concerns over cancer become
        the reason behind the laws? </li>
    <li>If your concern is really the carcinogens, then we can
        just require that the active ingredient be distributed in
        its pure form. Or what if someone only uses it by
        distilling the active ingredient (a simple process) and
        thereby takes no carcinogens? Shouldn't they be free from
        penalties? </li>
    <li>Gosh, you convinced me. Let's solve the problem right
        away. We will elect you King so you can do _anything_ you
        want. And ... every pot smoker in America is lined up
        outside your door with a bag of dope in one hand and a
        signed confession in the other. Now what? </li>
    <li>Every major study of drug policy agreed that prohibition
        only multiplied the bad effects which already exist with
        drugs. For example, overdoses become more likely because
        users don't know what they are getting; there are no
        standards for drug purity so there is greater harm from
        contaminants, addicts are less likely to receive
        effective treatment, etc. The more you assume about the
        harmful effects of drugs, the more imperative it becomes
        to address them in a non-criminal manner. </li>
    <li>Your evidence states that pot may be a problem while
        driving. Let's assume (for the sake of argument) that
        this is true. Do we attempt to solve the problem of drunk
        driving by throwing wine and beer drinkers in jail? Why
        not? (Can you say &quot;misapplication of
        resources&quot;?) </li>
    <li>The argument that pot was found in the bloodstreams of
        any group of people who died from any cause is not
        indicative of anything other than that they might have
        used pot some time within the last two months before they
        died. It does not say anything about all the people who
        may have pot in their bloodstreams and still be alive and
        well. It doesn't even say anything about _why_ they died.
        For comparison purposes, as any competent doctor knows,
        we need control groups. </li>
    <li>We must be wary of false comparisons (as any competent
        doctor should know). For example, we had one previous
        example in which large numbers of people were dying with
        pot in their bloodstreams. It was called Vietnam. Pot
        smokers had a high death rate, but it had nothing to do
        with pot. </li>
    <li>Pot causes cancer. Therefore, the best approach to the
        problem is to put millions of people in prison. This is
        the basic argument. Can you say &quot;non-sequitir&quot;?
        Where did you get the idea that if something is a health
        hazard, we ought to throw people in prison? </li>
    <li>Name all the other health problems for which prison is
        the recommended treatment. </li>
    <li>Please make a list of the comparable health problems
        caused by say, alcohol, and then match the health
        problems with the appropriate criminal penalties. </li>
    <li>Then maybe you can tell me why every major study of drug
        policy in the last fifty years recommended
        decriminalization. (See the list of Biggest Studies of
        Drug Policy on my web page.) </li>
    <li>You know, we can dispense with all the details and cut to
        the bottom line. Rather than argue the details of what it
        <strong>_might_</strong> cause, we can take a look at the
        actual stats on what it <strong>_does_</strong> cause.
        When we look at the official stats, such as deaths from
        any pot-related cause, the numbers are trivial in
        comparison with the damage done by alcohol and tobacco.
        We are spending 99 percent of our budget on one percent
        of the real drug problems. </li>
</ol>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">If Your
Opponent is a Doctor </h3>

<p> 16) Hey, Doc! What is the first rule of addressing a health
problem? First, do no harm. Right? Putting people in prison does
significant harm long before they are likely to get cancer. </p>

<p> If my opponent is a doctor I will hammer him on points just
like the one above. If he is really concerned about pot as a
health issue then, by God, he ought to be ready to address that
part of the problem as he would any other health issue. Would he
put people in prison for non-marital sex in order to prevent
venereal disease? Obviously he wouldn't. Hit him with his own
values and evidence. </p>

<p> And, if he is a doctor, I would hammer him repeatedly on the
fact that he really didn't know anything about the subject. Like:
</p>

<p> So tell me why the Consumers Union Report on Licit and
Illicit Drugs said that prohibition was the worst thing we could
do for drug-related health problems. You haven't read it have
you? The big problem here is ignorance, Doctor. It is one thing
to read some medical literature about the harm these things can
do and it is quite another to make the leap to an effective
public policy. Your problem, Doctor, is that you have read some
of the medical evidence but haven't read the evidence on drug
policy. Ignorance is a shameful thing in someone with as much
education as you have. </p>

<p> In short, if I am in a debate with a doctor, he will fall
before I am done -- because he is a doctor. I will goad him into
reading the CU Report by taunting him, calling him ignorant,
cajoling him, or anything else I have to do. I will force him to
either read what I have read or look like a public fool. Once
they read it, they always concede. For example, see my much
earlier post &quot;Cliff Converts Doc&quot;. It was written by a
doctor who fought me tooth and nail and then wound up telling
everyone that I was right. Excerpts of my debate with him are
posted on my web page. <br>

Stopper Questions for Your Opponent </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> These are the questions that drug warriors are simply unable
to answer. They stop them cold every time. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Please keep in mind with all of these questions that your
opponents will try their best to squirm out of an answer. If you
are talking to a politician, they will typically try to put out a
ten-minute smoke screen and hope no one recognizes that they
never did answer the question. If they try the smoke screen, try
the approach listed under <b>Smokescreen</b>: </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">How many
millions of people do you think we ought to put prison for drugs
to have the best results? </h3>

<p> I have asked many people this question over the years. It is
at that point that they usually fall out of the debate. No one
can answer this question with anything that makes any sense,
except zero. The first, and most obvious thing they do, is to try
to talk their way around it. This is not an essay question. </p>

<p> According to various estimates there are at least twelve
million regular users of illegal drugs, and possibly as many as
forty million. We now have about 1.5 million people in prisons
and jails across the country, and all the jail cells are already
full. It is immediately obvious to everyone that we cannot afford
to put forty million people in prison, even if it was a good
idea. In fact, we cannot afford to put twelve million people in
jail, either. </p>

<p> Most people, when asked this question, will immediately back
off of the idea that we should put drug users in prison, simply
because it is obvious that there is no way we could jail enough
of them to make a dent in the problem. &quot;Just send the drug
dealers to prison.&quot; they will say. </p>

<p> &quot;OK,&quot; I ask. &quot;How many do you suppose there
are?&quot; </p>

<p> They usually don't know, so you have to lead them a little
bit. Under the law, all drug users are technically dealers
because anyone who ever passed a joint to another person at a
rock concert is considered a &quot;drug distributor&quot;. Under
most state laws, it matters little what the context was, or
whether the person received any profit from passing the joint to
the next person. So, potentially, that would mean we would
imprison up to forty million people -- obviously impossible. </p>

<p> Therefore, we determine that we can't go by the current legal
definition of a drug dealer, but we would have to make a
requirement that we only go after those who are really in the
regular business of selling drugs, either on a part-time, or
full-time basis. If we assume that about ten percent of the users
are &quot;dealers&quot; by this definition (a fair estimate),
that would mean that there are somewhere between 1.2 million and
4 million drug dealers. In order to succeed then, we would have
to build up to four prisons and jails for every one which now
exists -- and hope that solved the problem. </p>

<p> One person, ex-DEA agent Michael Levine suggested that we
just jail the hard core drug users, a number he estimated at
about 2.7 million. I asked him if he really thought it was a good
idea to build two or three prisons for every one which now
exists, jail almost three million more people, and hope that
would solve the problem. It seemed to me obvious that it
wouldn't, since it would leave between ten and forty million
casual drug users to go about their business. </p>

<p> A few won't back off and will insist that we should jail all
forty million people, if we have to. Some have even insisted that
we should also jail another hundred million who indulge in
tobacco or alcohol. These people will look like fools in front of
the vast majority of audiences, and just cause most people to
come over to the side of reform. </p>

<h4>Their Answer </h4>

<p> Any answer to this question is bound to be wrong. If they
mention a low number, point out that we already have hundreds of
thousands of people in prison for illegal drugs and millions have
been arrested and prosecuted. That obviously did not stamp out
drugs, so a small increase in the prisoners will not have any
good effect. </p>

<p> <b>A general line of BS.</b> </p>

<p> Drug warriors will do anything they can to get out of
answering the simplest question about our drug policy. Don't let
them get away with evading a direct question. Come back to the
point until they either give you an answer or admit they don't
have a clue. We are embarked on a campaign which is based on the
belief that we can put enough people in prison to effectively
control the drug problem. The question is simple: How many
prisoners is the current plan going to take? </p>

<p> They have asked us, the taxpayers to write a blank check for
prisons. As the people writing the check for these taxes, it is
only fair for us to ask for the amount that is going to go on the
check. Just tell us how many prison cells are going to be
required. </p>

<p> <b>No one knows the answer to that question.</b> </p>

<p> Bull. It is perfectly easy to calculate the number of prison
cells needed to address criminal problems. For example, there are
approximately 25,000 homicides in the US each year which means
that we need a maximum of about 25,000 prison beds to hold the
perpetrators. A similar estimate could be drawn for the number of
robbers, rapists, etc. In all of these cases, the number of
prison cells required to hold the perpetrators is something our
country can manage. This is not the case with the drug laws. </p>

<p> <b>Your question assumes that we will imprison forty million
people.</b> </p>

<p> No, the question doesn't assume anything. I want you to tell
me how many people you think we ought to put in jail, and then
tell me your assumptions. </p>

<p> <b>As many as we have already.</b> </p>

<p> Does that mean you would be willing to end all further drug
arrests beyond the amount we have now? Once the police reach this
quota, should they stop arresting drug offenders because we know
we only have room for so many? </p>

<p> <b>Any number of million.</b> </p>

<p> If they mention five, ten, or twenty million, multiply the
number they mention by $500,000 and tell them the cost of that
approach. For example, the cost to incarcerate 1 million people
is five hundred billion dollars; 2 million is one trillion
Dollars, 10 million is five trillion dollars, and so forth. Then
crucify them for wanting to build prisons larger than the Nazi
concentration camps. </p>

<p> <b>I don't know.</b> </p>

<p> If they say they don't know, then say, &quot;That is
precisely the problem. No one, including you, has ever sat down
to figure it out. If you did, you would find out soon enough that
it is just plain impossible to solve the problem this way.&quot; </p>

<h4>Smokescreen </h4>

<p> Excuse me for interrupting, but that was not an essay
question. The question can be answered with just a simple number.
What will it take, 5 million, 10 million, 20 million? How many
millions of people will have to go to prison to solve the drug
problem this way? </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">For Drug
Enforcement Officers: What would you do if you got your fondest
wish? What would do if, tomorrow morning, you woke up and every
drug user in America was lined up outside your door with a bag of
dope in one hand and a signed confession in the other? </h3>

<p> Their Answer </p>

<p> Their immediate response is usually, &quot;I would arrest
them, of course!&quot; </p>

<p> That is a perfect opportunity to ask &quot;OK, how many do
you suppose there would be? I am just asking because I want to
help you get whatever you need to do the job right.&quot; </p>

<p> That will lead into the general discussion shown in the
previous question. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">For Devout
Christians: What would Jesus do if we gave this problem to Him?
Would He build bigger prisons? Or would He build hospitals and
schools? </h3>

<p> I usually preface this question by saying, &quot;You are a
better Christian than I am, and you probably know more about
Jesus than I do. So you tell me . . .&quot; Give them credit for
the strength and correctness of their belief. </p>

<p> Their Answer </p>

<p> Most Christians will be stunned by the simplicity and power
of this argument. Most of them will be able to immediately see
the sense behind what we are saying. Some of the immediate
reactions I have gotten from Christians, including ministers,
are: </p>

<p> &quot;When you put it that way, the answer is obvious.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;That's pretty cut and dried, isn't it?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Schools and hospitals, obviously.&quot; </p>

<p> Most of the answers will be in that vein. </p>

<p> A few Christians are exceptionally bigoted people and will
insist on hell-fire and damnation for anyone who dares to
transgress their ideas of sin. They are in the definite minority
and the vast majority of people will see their reactions as
extreme. </p>

<p> On one occasion, a prominent minister told me that he thought
perhaps Jesus might build bigger prisons because of the story of
Sodom and Gomorrah. &quot;Correct me if I am wrong,&quot; I said,
&quot;but I believe the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is in the Old
Testament, not the New Testament.&quot; He got the point that the
ministry of Jesus was all about love and healing. </p>

<p> One minister told me that he thought Jesus would build a
certain number of prisons in order to keep the dangerous people
from harming others. &quot;That's probably true,&quot; I said,
&quot;but what about the prisoners -- up to two-thirds of them --
who are there purely for non-violent drug offenses?&quot; </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">I have
here a list of every major study of drug policy in the last fifty
years. Every one of them recommended decriminalization. Do you
agree that the overwhelming weight of the scholarly evidence on
drug policy supports decriminalization? </h3>

<p> Before you answer, let me remind you that there are only
three possible answers to this question. </p>

<p> The first possible answer is yes, you agree. </p>

<p> The second possible answer is no, you do not agree, in which
case you should be able to provide a list of studies of drug
policy comparable in quality and quantity to the list I have
provided. </p>

<p> The third possible answer is that you don't have a clue what
the scholarly evidence says because you have never read the most
basic research on the subject. </p>

<h4>Their Answer </h4>

<p> The answers that I have gotten to this question include: </p>

<p> <b>The scholarly evidence is not important.</b> (From Bob
Martinez, former Drug Czar) </p>

<p> Is the scholarly evidence not important in science, medicine,
and every other field of law? Or is it not important only when it
comes to drug policy? </p>

<p> <b>I don't think anyone really knows the answer.</b> </p>

<p> Can you name any major study of drug policy which supported
what we are currently doing? (They probably can't.) So we have
ten major studies, including the largest studies ever conducted
by the governments of the United States, Britain, and Canada,
which supported decriminalization and none that supported the
current policy. Wouldn't you say that is the overwhelming weight
of the evidence? </p>

<p> <b>Everyone has their list of studies which they can make up
to show anything they want.</b> </p>

<p> OK, so show me any comparable list of studies that you have
in support of the drug war. (So far, in more than six years of
debates, no opponent has ever mentioned a single major study of
drug policy which supports the current drug war.) </p>

<p> <b>I don't have a clue.</b> </p>

<p> That is precisely the problem. You want to tell us what drug
policy should be when you have not even bothered to read the most
basic research on the subject. </p>

<p> <b>Here is a list of studies . . . .</b> </p>

<p> A few people have tried to bluff their way through by citing
studies about organized crime, alcohol, or something else. They
may also cite magazine articles, books by particular authors,
editorials or other opinion pieces, etc. Examine each one
carefully. Is it really a comprehensive study of the history and
facts relating to these drug laws, or is it just one person's
view? Did it consider all evidence and all views? Was it
comprehensive, or was it a simple magazine article of a few
pages? Did the author have an axe to grind or something to gain
from the opinion expressed? Does the work contain a complete
discussion of the history of the laws? Does it consider the laws
in the context of similar facts about tobacco and alcohol? </p>

<p> People have mentioned a lot of different things in response
to this question, but none of them have met the criteria of a
serious study of drug policy. </p>

<h4>Smokescreen </h4>

<p> Excuse me for interrupting, but that was not an essay
question. That was multiple choice. What is your answer; yes, no,
or don't have a clue? </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">It costs
about half a million dollars to put a single drug user in prison,
which includes $150,000 for arrest and prosecution, about
$150,000 for a new prison cell, and about $30,000 per year times
at least five years. For the same cost we can provide treatment
or education for more than one hundred people. Which do you think
is the better deal? </h3>

<p> <b>Their Answer:</b> </p>

<p> Almost no one will attempt to argue that prison for one
person is better than education or treatment for several hundred.
Most often they will say, &quot;It's not that simple, you can't
just say that because you are not going to put one person in
prison that you automatically have the money for treatment or
education.&quot; </p>

<p> You answer: </p>

<p> It IS that simple. Right now, California and several other
states are closing schools, libraries, and medical facilities in
order to build more prisons. The money is being taken from
education and treatment to fund more prisons. <br>

<h1>Fullerton Community College Speech </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <b>This is one of my typical speeches</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> First, I would like to inform everyone that the real subject
here today is not drug decriminalization, or legalization, or
re-legalization, or anything like that, because we still don't
know if we will ever do any of those things. What is certain is
that, at the current rates of incarceration, we will build the
largest prisons in the world. The issue is prison. It is not up
to us to justify decriminalization. It is up to those who support
the current policy to justify putting millions of people in
prison behind a drug policy which everyone admits cannot work. </p>

<p> One of the reasons that I am here is because of my mother. I
have heard many people say that the crusade against drugs is a
moral issue. William Bennett, our first national Drug Czar, said
that it is important to stamp out drugs because it is the moral
thing to do. I will show you that there is nothing moral about
it. </p>

<p> On April 20, 1992, my mother told me she wanted to die. She
called me that evening and asked me if I would understand if she
committed suicide. My mother is sixty-five years old and she
looks and acts at least ten years younger than her age. She still
works because she enjoys her job. Why then does she want to die? </p>

<p> A few years ago she had a minor operation on her ribs and,
during the operation, some nerves were damaged. It wasn't
anyone's fault, it is just one of the ordinary risks of surgery.
It could happen to anyone. Now the nerves fire constantly, at
near-maximum intensity. She says it feels as if someone is
holding a blowtorch to her ribs -- twenty-four hours a day. She
can no longer wear clothes which touch her skin. She can no
longer walk in a warm spring rain because the pain of a single
raindrop is too much to bear. Something as simple as a hug from
her smallest granddaughter will make her fall to the floor in
tears. </p>

<p> She has spent the last few years traveling across the United
States to find a cure. The doctors have tried a long list of
treatments including surgery, drugs, ointments, electricity, and
many other things. None of them worked very well and many of them
were dangerous. The best of them was a nerve block. The nerve
block required my mother to lay on her stomach while the doctors
injected anesthetic directly into the nerve causing the problem.
The needle had to be placed precisely on the nerve so it usually
had to be moved around for a few minutes to get just the right
spot. It reached the limits of human pain. The pain was so great
that her body rigidly locked up, with her senses overloaded. She
could not scream, breathe, or even see. </p>

<p> On two occasions they punctured her lung with this procedure,
and once they actually stopped her heart. To revive her, they
gave her CPR, which means they had to pound on her ribs. When she
awoke she screamed at them to kill her. She said that she was
bitter for months because they had not let her die when they had
the chance. She has since left written instructions that, if her
heart ever stops again, she is not to be revived. Still, she said
the nerve block is worth it, because it gives her relief for
almost three days and, besides, there is always the chance that
she will luck out and they will kill her again. </p>

<p> Only one treatment has ever worked to ease the pain. That
treatment is morphine. Morphine does not make her into a drug
addict. It does not make her into some kind of mindless zombie.
It does not even make her high. It just allows her to live a
relatively normal life, free from the pain in her side. When
compared with the other available treatments, morphine is the
cheapest, safest, and most effective treatment for her condition.
</p>

<p> He doctors will not give her morphine, for two reasons. The
first reason is that they are afraid she will become addicted. A
study conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical School showed that the
addiction rate for the medical use of morphine was less than
one-half of one percent. Even when patients do become addicted,
morphine addiction can be easily managed in a proper medical
environment, so addiction is not a legitimate medical concern. </p>

<p> The second reason they will not prescribe morphine is that
they are afraid of the drug police. They know that the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the local police can seize their
property and destroy their careers over a single questioned
prescription, and the police do not even have to file criminal
charges to do it. It not only can happen, it does happen. Last
year, the Drug Enforcement Administration sent two doctors to
prison for prescribing Tylenol 3. That is Tylenol with codeine.
Tylenol 3 is a prescription drug in only two countries in the
world, the United States and South Africa, and the United States
is the only country which has ever sent a doctor to prison for
prescribing this common medicine. There are many other cases
where doctors have had their lives and careers ruined over
equally trivial matters. </p>

<p> My mother has mixed emotions when I speak out about her
problem. She says that she really does not want anyone's sympathy
because, since she has had this problem, she has discovered that
there are so many more people who are in worse condition than she
is. Some people with AIDS get this same kind of condition all
over their bodies. Every day of their lives is worse than any
horror movie that you have ever seen. They can't get morphine
either. Seven thousand five hundred people go blind from glaucoma
every year because the best medicine - marijuana - is illegal.
And the list goes on. </p>

<p> There are literally millions of people with chronic pain,
cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, and other conditions for which the safest
and most effective medicine is a drug which is now illegal.
Hundreds of thousands of them violate the drug laws every day
because they need these medicines to live. </p>

<p> On behalf of all of the families affected by AIDS, and
cancer, and glaucoma, and a dozen other diseases, I am here to
tell you that this drug policy is indecent and it must be
stopped. There is nothing moral about a drug policy which makes
sick people choose between prison and death. </p>

<p> Drug policy is a complicated issue and we will not have time
today to resolve all of the points under discussion. In the past
fifty years, however, there have been several occasions when
major commissions have been formed specifically to study the
evidence and the options for drug policy and to make
recommendations. There have been both public and private
commissions, domestic and foreign, performed by people of all
political persuasions from liberals to conservative law-and-order
Republicans, and people who aren't even on our political map.
They all recommended decriminalization. </p>

<p> I would like to read to you some of the studies which have
reached this conclusion: </p>

<p> <u>The LaGuardia Committee Report,</u> commissioned by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia, written by the New York Academy of Medicine,
and published by the City of New York in 1944. </p>

<p> <u>The Baroness Wootton Report</u>, published by the
government of the United Kingdom in 1967. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the Canadian Government Commission of
Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs</u>, published by the
Canadian Government in 1969. </p>

<p> <u>Dealing With Drug Abuse: A Report to the Ford Foundation</u>,
published by the Drug Abuse Survey Project in 1972. </p>

<p> <u>The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs</u>,
published by the Editors of Consumer Reports Magazine in 1972.
This is a landmark study, a &quot;must-read&quot;, used as a
basic textbook at major universities. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse</u>, commissioned by President Nixon, and published by
the U.S. Federal Government in 1973. </p>

<p> <u>The Facts About Drug Abuse</u>, published by the United
States Drug Abuse Council in 1980. </p>

<p> <u>An Analysis of Marijuana Policy,</u> published by the
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences in
1982. </p>

<p> <u>The Report of the California State Research Advisory Panel</u>,
commissioned by the State of California, and published in 1990. </p>

<p> The recommendations in these reports were endorsed by (among
others) the American Medical Association, the American Bar
Association, The American Association for Public Health, the
National Education Association, and the National Council of
Churches. </p>

<p> I might also add that the last two reports of the National
Commission on AIDS have also recommended that we adopt
non-criminal approaches to drug abuse. </p>

<p> We may debate the details of the many issues of drug policy
all day, but one basic fact is undeniable. When all of the issues
and all of the evidence is considered, the overwhelming weight of
the scholarly evidence on drug policy supports decriminalization.
</p>

<p> The first question that we need to ask ourselves is: How did
we get into this mess? Any study of the history of the drug laws
shows that they were based on two primary factors; racism and
ignorance. </p>

<p> You may have wondered why marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are
illegal while other equally dangerous drugs such as tobacco and
alcohol are legal, and even promoted by the Federal Government.
The primary reason is that alcohol and tobacco were associated
with white people while the other drugs were associated --
wrongly -- with people of color. </p>

<p> Opiates were first outlawed because of the fear that Chinese
men were luring white women to their ruin in opium dens. Ruin was
defined not as opium addiction, but as associating with Chinese
men. </p>

<p> In the early years of this century, many of the major
newspapers printed lurid articles about superhuman Negro Cocaine
Fiends who would take large amounts of cocaine which would cause
them to go on a violent sexual rampage and rape white women.
Police departments across the nation switched from .32 caliber
pistols to .38 caliber pistols because as one Police Chief
stated, &quot;Those cocaine niggers sure are hard to kill.&quot;
Newspaper stories of the day told lurid tales of Jewish peddlers
selling cocaine to poor southern blacks. There was also a
movement to ban caffeine for the same reasons. There was no
evidence to back up the myth of the Negro Cocaine Fiend simply
because most black people did not have the money to buy cocaine.
Any black man who did rape a white woman would have had to be
suicidal because in 1905 there were 105 recorded lynchings of
black men for unspecified offenses. </p>

<p> Marijuana was later outlawed largely as a repressive tool
against Mexican laborers who were competing with American workers
for jobs during the Depression. </p>

<p> Racism was one of the primary themes of the campaign against
drugs until the campaigns for civil rights in the 1950's and
1960's made it unacceptable. At that point, the drug warriors
turned to other myths to defend their cause. You have heard some
of those myths today. It is important to remember that many of
the myths you heard today were made up in the 1950's and 1960's
when it began to be apparent that the old myths just wouldn't cut
it any more. These laws never did have anything to do with public
health and safety. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> We next need to understand the facts on the issue. My first
graph shows the number of deaths caused by drugs, both legal and
illegal, in the United States in a typical year. </p>

<p> Tobacco kills about 390,000 people. </p>

<p> Alcohol kills about 80,000. </p>

<p> Sidestream smoke from tobacco kills about 50,000 people who
don't even smoke. </p>

<p> Prescription drugs kill at least 10,000. </p>

<p> Cocaine kills about 2,500. </p>

<p> Heroin kills about 2,000. </p>

<p> Aspirin kills about 2,000 </p>

<p> Marijuana kills 0. Even the DEA itself says that there has
not been a recorded death due to marijuana in the history of the
United States. </p>

<p> All of the illegal drugs combined killed about 4,500, or
about one percent of the number killed by tobacco. Tobacco kills
more people every year than all of the people killed by all of
the illegal drugs in the Twentieth Century. More Colombians die
from the effects of American tobacco than the number of Americans
who die from Colombian cocaine. As you may know, tobacco is
heavily subsidized and promoted by the United States Government.
The US Government demands that other countries buy more American
tobacco even while we threaten them with war for sending us their
marijuana and cocaine. </p>

<p> Right now we have about 1.3 million people in prison. More
than 600,000 of them are there for non-violent drug offenses. For
every person who died from illegal drugs last year, one hundred
and fifty people went to prison. Most of them were black men. </p>

<p> You may hear a good deal of take about the dangers of illegal
drugs. First let me state that the medical evidence is very clear
that, by any standard of measurement, alcohol and tobacco are
substantially more dangerous to both the individual and to
society than any of the illegal drugs. We have known this for at
least twenty-five years. This is not to say that use of any drug
is entirely safe. We could safely assume that almost anything we
put into our bodies is going to have some health risk, to a
greater or lesser degree. That is not the issue. </p>

<p> Just because something is hazardous does not automatically
mean that the best approach to those hazards is to throw millions
of people in prison. In fact, every major study of drug policy
has concluded that prison only makes those hazards worse and
increases the damage done to society. As one commission stated,
the more we learn about the dangers of drugs, the more it will
become apparent that massive prisons are a medical and social
disaster. It is precisely because of those health hazards that we
must not send people to prison for drug offenses. </p>

<p> We might win the war on drugs if we could be successful in
one of three areas. </p>

<p> First, we could try to stop the production of drugs in
foreign countries. There is no credible evidence anywhere which
would suggest that we could stop, or even greatly reduce, the
production of drugs in foreign countries. The Federal
government's own evidence shows that this is impossible and it is
a waste of money to try. </p>

<p> Second, we could try to stop drugs at the border. There is no
credible evidence anywhere which would suggest that we could
stop, or even greatly reduce, the flow of drugs across our
border. The Federal government's own evidence shows that this is
impossible and it is a waste of money to try. </p>

<p> Third, we could try to stop the sale of drugs within the
United States, even while we know that it is impossible to stop
their production, or to keep them outof the United States. There
is no credible evidence anywhere which would suggest that we
could stop, or even greatly reduce, the sale of drugs within the
United States. Again, the evidence shows that this is impossible
and, not only is it a waste of money to try but, in fact, the war
against drugs actually causes far more harm than good. </p>

<p> The largest part of that harm falls upon the African-American
community. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> I have here a few graphs which were taken directly from US
Federal Government statistics. The first graph shows the number
of people in prison over the last fifty years. The number of
people in prison was relatively stable for about fifty years,
until the 1970's when President Nixon started the first major
campaign against drugs. Then the number of inmates began to rise
sharply. It was also during the 1970's that a major recession hit
the country and African Americans, being at the bottom of the
economic totem pole, were the first to lose their jobs and the
last to be rehired when the economy changed. As a result of the
stresses on unemployed fathers, African-American families began
to fall apart and we saw the first great rise of black families
headed by single mothers. This became especially significant
because of what happened in the 1980s. </p>

<p> In the 1980s the rate of incarceration went through the roof.
Since 1980 we have tripled the number of people in prison and we
now have the largest prisons in the world. We will almost triple
their size again before the year 2000. </p>

<p> GRAPH </p>

<p> The next graph shows the racial breakdown of our prisons, and
projects those figures into the future, based on current trends.
By the year 2000, our prisons will be larger than the Nazi
concentration camps of World War II. About two-thirds of all of
the people in our prisons will be black men, most of them
arrested for non-violent drug offenses. For every black man who
goes to college, at least three will go to prison. Two-thirds of
all of today's black male teenagers will be dead, disabled, or in
prison before their thirtieth birthday. The largest single group
of them will go to prison for non-violent drug offenses. </p>

<p> Even as we speak, one-fourth of all of the young black men in
America are in prison, on probation, or on parole. In some inner
cities such as Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, which were test
cases for the war on drugs, more than half of all the young black
men in the city are under the supervision of the criminal justice
system. It is estimated that more than ninety percent of the
black men in these cities have already been incarcerated at least
once. </p>

<p> When an African-American man goes to prison he becomes
effectively permanently unemployable because nobody will hire a
black man with a prison record. Most of the young black men in
our nation's capitol are already economically dead as a direct
result of the war on drugs. </p>

<p> They become social pariahs, unwanted by employers and even by
the women in their own communities. They are unable to restore
themselves and the families that we will need to rebuild our
inner cities. The economic destruction of African-American men
caused by the war on drugs is perhaps the singlest biggest reason
that African-American families continued to disintegrate in the
1980's even in the midst of an economic boom. </p>

<p> Even conservative black leaders are now beginning to say that
the war on drugs is genocide and the new form of slavery and they
are right. Because of our misguided and ignorant drug policies,
we have already destroyed the better part of an entire generation
of African-American men. </p>

<p> In 1973 President Nixon's National Commission on Marihuana
and Drug Abuse said that the real drug problem is not heroin, or
cocaine, or marijuana. The real drug problem, they said, is the
ignorance of our public officials who have never bothered to read
the evidence. Today, we can prove that this is still true. </p>

<p> I would like my opponent to answer one simple question. I
have here a list of every major study of drug policy in the last
fifty years including the largest studies ever conducted by the
US Federal Government and the State of California. They all
recommended decriminalization. </p>

<p> Do you agree that the overwhelming weight of the scholarly
evidence on drug policy supports decriminalization? </p>

<p> Before you answer, remember that there are only three
possible answers to this question. </p>

<p> The first possible answer is yes, you agree that the
overwhelming weight of the scholarly evidence supports
decriminalization. </p>

<p> The second possible answer is no, you do not agree and,
therefore, you can provide a list of scholarly studies equal in
quality and quantity to the list I have provided. </p>

<p> The third possible answer is that you don't have a clue what
the scholarly evidence says because you have never read the most
basic research on the subject. </p>

<p> What is your answer? Do you agree that the overwhelming
weight of the scholarly evidence on drug policy supports
decriminalization? <br>

<h1>Arguments and Answers - Page 1 </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is a collection of actual arguments and answers from a
long chain of debates on drug policy. Somewhere in this archive,
every argument you ever heard in favor of the drug war is
encountered and rebutted. If I missed any, please send them to me
by e-mail: schaffer@smartlink.net </p>

<p> My opponent's comments are in <b>boldface</b>. My comments
are in plain text. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>{{1. &quot;....After adjusting for covariants, the
marijuana group showed small but statistically significant
increased risk for all three catagories of conditions
(Respiratory, accidental injury, and other).&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Other, longer studies, such as the Jamaican studies have
shown no statistically significant differences between marijuana
smokers and non-smokers, even when the marijuana smokers had an
average daily dose about 28 times that consumed by the average US
user. Therefore, one study is not going to break the back of the
collected research on marijuana. </p>

<p> The collected summation of marijuana research is this:
&quot;Marijuana, in its natural form, is probably the safest
therapeutically active substance known to mankind. It is safer
than many of the foods we commonly eat.&quot; -- Francis Young,
Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, after two years of review of all of the evidence
presented by the DEA and by those asking for reform. That is the
same conclusion supported by every major study of drug policy. </p>

<p> <b>{{2. &quot;Respiratory deposition of tar and adsorption of
carbon monoxide in experimental subjects were four and five times
higher, respectively, after smoking marijuana than after smoking
tobacco.&quot;}} </b> </p>

<p> Assuming this is true, how does this prove that throwing
millions of people in prison is the best approach to the problem?
</p>

<p> <b>{{3. &quot;Marijuana has repeatedly been found to be the
second most common drug, after alcohol, present in the blood of
nonfatally and fatally injured persons.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> There might be a good, logical reason for this. Marijuana is
detectable in the blood for up to two months after a person
smokes a joint, even though the high is long since gone. It may
simply be an indicator that far more people are smoking marijuana
than you thought. You also have to remember that common over the
counter drugs will make people test positive for marijuana. </p>

<p> You will note that they did not say &quot;drivers.&quot; It
is irrelevant what the passengers were using. </p>

<p> And, by this sort of reasoning, the penalties for alcohol
sale and possession ought to be even higher than the pot
penalties. Why aren't you fighting even harder for alcohol
Prohibition? </p>

<p> <b>{{4. &quot;Laboratory studies have shown decreased
driving-related skills after smoking marijuana.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Repeated real world experience has shown that marijuana is
not a major factor in traffic accidents. The reason is fairly
simple -- pot has a very mild effect on people and does not
destroy coordination the way alcohol does. The real problem here
is that the people who want to throw people in prison for drugs
do not actually know anything about the drug and its effects. </p>

<p> <b>{{5. &quot;In a Swedish study following a cohort of 45,540
male military conscripts for 15 years, heavier cannabis users had
a nearly three times greater risk of death than nonusers....and
had an elevated risk of schizophrenia compared with
nonusers.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> A Johns Hopkins study, just as credible, showed that
marijuana smokers were more ambitious than their peers and
usually succeeded better than the rest. </p>

<p> The question here is &quot;Death from what?&quot; Their
cannabis users could have been concentrated in those areas with a
higher risk of death, in light of the fact that they engage in
somewhat more risk taking than their peers. Like, for instance,
our soldiers who smoked pot in Vietnam. </p>

<p> As for schizophrenia -- Did the pot cause the schizophrenia,
or would it be more likely that a person with severe mental
problems would try all sorts of self-medication to stop the
voices in their head? I have a relative with schizophrenia and I
can tell you what the answer is. </p>

<p> And, if the person is developing schizophrenia -- for any
reason -- how does it help the situation to throw them in jail? </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot; The insoluable particulate (tar) phase of the
smoke from marijuana contains about 50% of some carcinogenic aryl
hydrocarbons, including benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene
then the smoke from a comparable quantity of unfiltered Kentucky
reference tobacco.&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> So? Should the prison sentences for tobacco be 50% of those
for pot? Or should we also account for the fact that pot smokers
typically smoke far fewer cigarettes than a tobacco smoker? Just
how long should we put tobacco smokers in jail, anyway? </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;The smoking of one marijuana cigarette - 800 to
900 mg, 1% to 3% delta-tetrahydrocannabinol - led to the
deposition in the lower respiratory tract of about a four-fold
greater quantity of insoluable particulates (tar) than smoking a
filtered tobacco cigarette of comparable weight...&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> See above. </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;...the authors [Polen, et al, of the accompanying
article] are the first to use a systematic review of medical
records to assess the health consequences of marijuana...Their
finding that near-daily marijuana smoking is a significant
independent risk factor for the development of respiratory
illness, injuries, and other medical problems requiring medical
attention CHALLENGES THE VIEW THAT MARIJUANA POSES INSIGNIFICANT
HEALTH RISKS.&quot;</b> }} </p>

<p> It will have to do a lot of challenging, because there is
alot of evidence to challenge. Actually, this is more evidence
for a change in the law because every major study of drug policy
said that prohibition only INCREASED the dangers which were
already present in illegal drugs. The more dangerous you assume
them to be, the more important it becomes to treat them in a
non-criminal manner. </p>

<p> But, of course, that is not really the point, anyway. Let's
suppose that I totally believed everything you just said. Why do
you automatically assume that putting millions of people in
prison is the best approach to the problem? If it wasn't a good
idea for alcohol, and we can see that it would be a dumb idea for
tobacco, why do you suppose it is such a great idea for any other
chemical? </p>

<p> <b>{{So, it would appear the marijuana is more dangerous than
tobacco. Itwould also appear that, given the statistics
concerning fatal accidents, that marijuana use can be deadly.}}</b>
</p>

<p> So how many people are actually killed by all these drugs in
a typical year, anyway? </p>

<p> And, while you're at it, there are perhaps thirty million
people who are regular users of pot. How many millions of people
do you think we ought to throw in prison in order to control this
problem? </p>

<p> And why was the most common agricultural crop in America made
illegal in 1937 in the first place? Was it because of these
&quot;dangers&quot;, or was it for some entirely different
reason? How did the most common crop in America suddenly become a
dreaded menace to society? </p>

<p> <b>{{}}Netherlands has fewer addicts per capita than the US.
So does almost every country in the world. So what?}}</b> </p>

<p> Gee, that would seem to argue that our prohibition isn't so
effective, wouldn't it? And you said it was easy to control!!! </p>

<p> <b>{{ Germany recently decriminalized possession of small
amounts of marijuana, as have several states in the U.S. So
what?}}</b> </p>

<p> Maybe you could tell me why hemp (and the other drugs for
that matter) were made illegal in the first place. </p>

<p> <b>{{&quot;When a heroin addicts can get precise doses at
regular intervals, he can function pretty normally.&quot; They
don't want to get high?}}</b> </p>

<p> Ever heard of Dr. William Halsted? Or Senator Joseph
McCarthy? What do they have in common? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I went and looked it up. You need 100 grams of heroin
to get a 5-year sentence or a whole kilo to get a 10-year
sentence. For cocaine, the figures were 500 grams and 5 kilos.
That's a lot of dope.}}</b> </p>

<p> See the 7-8-93 op-ed piece by Federal Judge Weinstein in the
NY Times. He points out that it varies from one city to another.
In some major metropolitan areas, 100 pounds will not get you any
jail time, while in others, a marijuana seed might mean life in
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{ If there is no evidence that punishment reduces crime,
we should shut down the prisons entirely.}}</b> </p>

<p> There are thirty million illegal drug users. Just tell me the
most reasonable number to put in prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{ You say that junkies don't do any harm, but would you
want to live next door to one?}}</b> </p>

<p> A better question is if you would want to have a drug addict
(William Bennett) as a drug czar? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I keep hearing this. No one provides any evidence. It
doesn't seem logical that people who have so much trouble
supporting a drug habit *outside* somehow acquire the necessary
income when you lock them up.}}</b> </p>

<p> Talk to someone who has been in prison. </p>

<p> {{ Then why lock up drunk drivers? Or any criminal?
Generally, we lock people up because they are a menace to
society. It is *always* possible to lose a potential
&quot;contributing member&quot; in this way, but generally we are
more interested in the rights of potential victims: Who could be
you, me, or anyone.}} </p>

<p> Anyone who commits an offense against another person should
be tried for the offense. What should be different is that a
person on cocaine who commits a crime should not get life in
prison while a drunk would plead diminished capacity for the same
crime. We should have consistent standards for all drugs and we
should apply our limited resources to the part of the problem
where it will do the most good. For example, we don't lock up
wine drinkers to try to control drunk driving. Generally, we do
lock people up because they are a menace to others. Of course,
that never was the reason for the drug laws. </p>

<p> You are far more likely to be the victim of something related
to alcohol and tobacco than from the effects of the illegal
drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{ The properties of heroin and alcohol are very
different, and the social context is also different. For example,
most people can use alcohol in moderate amounts without ever
becoming addicted. Also, alcohol can be brewed up in any bathtub,
or derived from common products such as after-shave and
mouthwash, so the potential for controlling abuse is much less.}}</b>
</p>

<p> Yes, the properties are different. Alcohol is just as
addicting and far more damaging to the health. </p>

<p> Yes, the social context is different. The illegal drugs were
outlawed primarily because they were associated (wrongly) with
racial minorities, while alcohol and tobacco were perceived as
&quot;white&quot; drugs. </p>

<p> The evidence shows that most drug users of all types use in
moderation. This can be shown quite quickly by a simple
comparison between the total number of users and the number of
addicts. </p>

<p> The fact that alcohol can be brewed in a bathtub is hardly a
sensible argument for any kind of policy. It is equally
nonsensical for other drugs. Does that mean we should legalize
marijuana because people can grow it in their closet? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Since &quot;every major study&quot; agrees with you, it
follows that youagree with &quot;every major study,&quot; for
example:</b> </p>

<p> <b>* The President's Commission on Organized Crime (1986)</b>
</p>

<p> <b>* The National Report of the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(1992)</b> </p>

<p> <b>* The President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws
(1993)</b> </p>

<p> <b>So, can I quote these studies as authoritative, or have
you suddenly changed your mind?}}</b> </p>

<p> <b>The first study has little to do with drug policy and
cannot be considered any kind of a study of the drug policy
issue.</b> </p>

<p> <b>The second is a statistical report with no consideration
of the historical or medical aspects of the problem (or many
other aspects for that matter.)</b> </p>

<p> The third did not do any real research on drug policy. </p>

<p> But, since I so rarely run into anyone who tries naming
anything, I will give you credit. Let's assume, for the sake of
argument, that all three studies were about drug policy and right
on the money. The score is now 10 to 3 against you. When you get
a little closer I will name some more on my side. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I believe your chronology is wrong. I remember reading
a book on the subject (_Chasing the Dragon_, as I recall), which
was published around 1985. Unfortunately I don't have it to hand
. . . But, as I recall, Britain had legalized prescription
narcotics in the 60s, and they were still legal at the time the
book was published. The result was an explosive increase in drug
use, along with the accompanying things that drug abusers like to
do: abuse their spouses, neglect their children and live off the
public dole. I believe it was the Majors administration, sometime
around 1990, which flirted with stricter drug enforcement (still
not very tough by American standards). Is this that what you're
talking about?}}</b> </p>

<p> The correct chronology is given in the text of the 60 Minutes
show contained in Hoover.zip. In the 80s, under US pressure, the
British adopted a get-tough policy. It was a disaster, causing
both health problems and rising crime. In Liverpool at the
current time, they prescribe heroin and cocaine to addicts. Most
of the addicts are healthy, employed, and living with their
families. One of the conditions of their treatment is that they
must not commit crimes. It works. They originally did it because
of the AIDS infection rates, and the infection rate has dropped
to less than one percent of the addicts -- while in the US the
rate is over fifty percent. They also found that Liverpool, which
had become famous for crime, was suddenly peaceful again. It is
happening now and about a half dozen of my friends (including
doctors) are now in England discussing it with them. </p>

<p> <b>}}The Dutch, may not be alone for long. Many other
European countries are looking to decriminalization; many have
signed the Frankfort Accord agreeing that is the best approach. I
dunno about that,}}</b> </p>

<p> The following countries have already either legalized drugs
or taken steps toward legalization: The Netherlands, Germany,
Switzerland, England, Italy, Spain, and Colombia. </p>

<p> <b>}}But it indicates that Germany is moving in the direction
of common sense, while we are not. Yeah, they are liberalizing
hash and persecuting the hard drug users. That's the direction of
common sense.}}</b> </p>

<p> Why is it common sense to persecute anyone? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Still, when soldiers returned to the States, where
drugs were neither cheap nor easy to find, they gave up the
habit.}}</b> </p>

<p> The studies of the issue said that all of the soldiers
surveyed reported they could get heroin after they got back any
time they wanted it. The reason they quit was because they were
no longer under stress. </p>

<p> <b>{{ And we also lock up left-handed people . . . as I have
already pointed out. However, there are very few people in prison
simply for being junkies; most of them have committed other
offenses.}}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely not true. There are considerable numbers. See the
testimony of the Corrections Commissioner of New York in
Hoover.zip. See also the op-ed piece by Federal Judge Jack B.
Weinstein in the 7-8- 93 New York Times. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Not at all. It is you have ignored my objection: The
argument that expensive to lock up junkies ignores the experience
with drunk driving. The fact is that severe penalties discourage
crime, and therefore reduce the number of people who need to be
locked up.}}</b> </p>

<p> There are thirty million illegal drug users in the US (give
or take). How many millions do you propose to lock up? </p>

<p> <b>{{ More deceptive figures. According to my 1993 World
Almanac, only 7% of prisoners serving terms of 1 year or more are
in federal prisons.}}</b> </p>

<p> What does that have to do with the price of eggs? </p>

<p> <b>}}How many people must we imprison, and at what cost,
before you think we will have solved the problem? --I dunno. }}</b>
</p>

<p> You hit the nail on the head that time. You obviously never
thought about it. That is the problem in a nutshell. As President
Nixon's commission said, the real drug problem is not marijuana,
heroin, or cocaine. The real drug problem is the ignorance of our
public officials who have never bothered to read the evidence. </p>

<p> <b>{{}}There are way more alcholics than there are heroin
addicts however, and the cost to society is astronomical. This
has much to do with the relative cheapness and availability of
alcohol. Do you really want to make narcotics equally cheap and
available?}}</b> </p>

<p> Narcotics are freely available at reasonable prices to anyone
who wants them. </p>

<p> <b>{{There are way more alcoholics than there are heroin
addicts however, and the cost to society is astronomical. Doesn't
that fact support continuing constraints against heroin, before
it can cause damage on an &quot;alcohol&quot; scale?}}</b> </p>

<p> No, not necessarily, but it does make me wonder why you
aren't campaigning even harder for alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> <b>{{ }}Prohibition of alcohol did not work...{{{</b> </p>

<p> <b>Depends what you mean by &quot;work&quot;.}}</b> </p>

<p> I will accept the Wickersham Commission's definition. They
said it was a hopeless disaster in all respects. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol consumption absolutely, positively went down
during</b> </p>

<p> <b>prohibition.}}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely false. The Wickersham Commission found that
alcohol use went down in the first year of Prohibition, but rose
every year thereafter, and that alcohol-related health problems
were much more severe. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Society, however, preferred its legal drug and repealed
prohibition.}}</b> </p>

<p> No, the Wickersham Commission, which was originally empowered
to find ways to improve Prohibition, concluded that it was
hopeless folly which did more harm than if we did nothing at all.
</p>

<p> <b>{{ It is also societies right to keep the lid on the
Pandora's Box of legalization of cocaine and heroin.}}</b> </p>

<p> So, how many millions of people should we put in prison for
drugs? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Clearly prohibition DID reduce consumption.}}</b> </p>

<p> That wasn't right the first time. It is equally wrong the
second. </p>

<p> <b>{{ In Malaysia, they are executed (at least the dealers
are).}}</b> </p>

<p> In Malaysia, the authorities kill more people for drugs than
the drugs do. And they still have a growing problem. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I wouldn't be so quick to discount the deterrent effect
of draconian measures.}}</b> </p>

<p> Neither would I. How many people do you think we ought to
execute to solve a problem that kills about 5,000 people a year? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I would personally love to see an intoxicant developed
that was safe, not physically addicting and doesnt make you (too)
stupid. (I'm dead serious). Marijuana is almost OK, but I truly
believe it makes one stupid (while under the influence) and a lot
of kids would have their intellectual growth stunted if it were
legalized.}}</b> </p>

<p> The Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, after hearing years of arguments on the subject,
concluded that &quot;marijuana, in its natural form, may be the
safest therapeutically active substance known to man&quot; and
that it is &quot;safer than many of the foods we commonly
eat.&quot; There is no evidence to support what you said about
intellectual growth. In fact, marijuana was a common food in the
19th century. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol does not directly involve the brain's internal
&quot;reward via euphoria&quot; mechanism, opiates do. They are
much more &quot;fun&quot; and way more addicting.}}</b> </p>

<p> Nope. See the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs for a good discussion of the issue. </p>

<p> <b>{{ The Liverpudlian addicts had to first come to the
doctor for help, before being registered. Are you suggesting that
potential heroin users come to the doctor for &quot;controlled
medically supervised doses&quot; before starting the habit - or
do they come after realizing they may have a problem?}}</b> </p>

<p> They come after they realize they have a problem. But the
program has dried up the sellers on the street, and it has
greatly reduced the number one source of new addicts -- old
addicts looking for recruits to support their habit. As a result,
crime rates, health problems, and addiction have dropped
dramatically. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Is it possible that heroin, at cigarette prices, may
lead to a lot of folks to suffer severe vocational and
interpersonal damage, before finally presenting themselves for
&quot;Controlled, medically supervised doses&quot;? The
experience during Prohibition is instructive.}}</b> </p>

<p> Is it possible that tobacco addicts under the same conditions
would behave in the same manner as junkies? The experience in
Europe, after WWII, when tobacco was scarce is instructive. The
experience of Prohibition is instructive. It was a failure in all
respects. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Despite the obvious problems associated with
prohibition, the rates of cirrhosis of the liver and of wife
beating plummetted.}} </b> </p>

<p> Wrong. See the report of the Wickersham Commission. </p>

<p> <b>{{I agree that substance abuse is the trigger for much
crime, violent and non-violent. In those cases, if you can
eliminate the abuse, you probably have a much better chance of
the individual becoming a contributing member. }}</b> </p>

<p> The great majority of such crime is due to the effects of
prohibition, not the effects of the drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{Instead of spending the money to maintain them in
prison, some sort of supervisd home confinement, coupled with
vocational training, counseling for the abuse, and routine drug
testing. Clean 'em up, train 'em, put 'em to work. That may sound
to simplistic, but what we're doing now isn't working, IMO. }}</b>
</p>

<p> The vast majority of drug users do not need treatment any
more than the vast majority of wine drinkers need treatment. For
the others, treatment is at least seven times as cost effective
as prison, with a far greater rate of success. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Alcohol is addicting to those predisposed.}}</b> </p>

<p> Correct. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Heroin is addicting (if used for non-analgesic
purposes) in everyone. Cocaine is the most addictive of all.}}</b>
</p>

<p> Wrong. See the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs for a good discussion. Heroin addicts commonly report that
it is much harder to kick tobacco than to kick anything else. Or
see the recent <a href="../library/basicfax.htm">NIDA rankings</a>
of addictive qualities. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Increased drinking during prohibition!! No way, no
evidence, makes no sense. The logistics of obtaining, and the
black market price of alcohol during prohibition were HUGE
natural constraints on drinking for the vast majority. (ie. for
all but the speakeasy crowd).}}</b> </p>

<p> See the Wickersham Commission report, or any of the other
studies I have mentioned. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Be careful who you say things like &quot; the deceptive
thing about... liver disease are DEGENERATIVE diseases which take
a little while to develop&quot; to {g}. In 20 yrs as a general
internist, I've treated plenty of alcohol relatedliver disease.}}</b>
</p>

<p> If you are a doctor, let me ask you a question. My mother
suffers from severe chronic pain as the result of a nerve injury
during surgery. It is bad enough that it has driven her to the
point of seriously considering suicide. She has been to the Mayo
Clinic, the National Pain Institute, the USC Pain Clinic and a
long list of others. She has tried a long list of treatments. You
name your best list, she has tried it. The doctors, and her own
experience, tell her that the best treatment for her condition is
either morphine or heroin. The doctors will not prescribe it to
her because they are afraid of the DEA -- they have said so. The
Department of Health and Human Services has issued two reports
which have stated that the undertreatment of pain is a national
tragedy and that is caused by fear. The California Medical
Association recently encouraged doctors to prescribe more
narcotics and said that the reason they did not was because of
fear of the police. </p>

<p> I will not ask you if you would prescribe morphine for my
mother because I have asked every other doctor who has appeared
here and they all copped out. I expect you would too. Just tell
me: Who should determine the medicine my mother gets -- her and
her doctors -- or the police? </p>

<p> <b>{{ It is clear that when prohibition was repealed, liver
disease jumped up within the year, because of resumed drinking.}}</b>
</p>

<p> No, alcohol use continued the rise that it had already
started during Prohibition. And, even if this was true, are you
recommending that we bring back alcohol Prohibition? Why not? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I'm sorry, but the statement that heroin is harmless
flies in the face of long-agreed-on clinical experience.}}</b> </p>

<p> What does your clinical experience tell you about the effects
of prison? Is it beneficial or harmful to someone with a drug
problem? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Show me the references. I will be willing to bet
anything, that they are not the result of well designed trials}}</b>
</p>

<p> Read any of the studies that I posted. I would suggest that
you start with the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit
Drugs, so you would understand how we got into this situation. </p>

<p> By the way, did you know that the medical community
unanimously opposed these laws when they were proposed and said
they would be a medical, social, and criminal disaster? Did you
know that one of the first actions of the drug police was to jail
more than 3,000 doctors, especially those who advocated drug
treatment? </p>

<p> And, can you tell me why hemp is illegal? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Historically technical question. Shouldnt be too hard
to look up. I doubt very much that it was the OVERT crime issue.
Society was not much affected by bootleggers killing other
bootleggers.}}</b> </p>

<p> One of the major factors was a campaign to &quot;save the
children.&quot; You see, the bootleggers discovered that they
could escape harsh penalties by having kids do the dirty work,
and there was quite a bit of concern about that. Sound familiar? </p>

<p> <b>{{ However one related factor may well have been society
was very concerned about corruption in the police and judiciary.
It would have been scary, back then, to think this corruption was
about to become institutionalised.}}</b> </p>

<p> Prohibition gave us the institution of organized crime, which
is still with us 60 years later. </p>

<p> <b>{{ This doesnt seem to be much of a factor, however, in
our current &quot;prohibition&quot;}}</b> </p>

<p> Where have you been? The entire narcotics squad of the LA
County Sheriff was sent to prison for corruption. The situation
is the same in New York and other major cities. I seriously doubt
if there is an honest drug enforcement agent living. I could go
on with stories of their corruption that would curl your hair. </p>

<p> <b>{{I don't like that picture very much at all.}}</b> </p>

<p> You painted a picture of what could happen. How about a
picture of what IS happening? According to the current rates of
incarceration, we will put more people in prison than Adolf
Hitler did, including about one-half of an entire generation of

<p> The vast majority of drug users of all t ypes (except

<p> The actual figures appear to be about the same as for the
white population. However, the drug laws were originally intended
to target minorities (look it up) and they target minorities
above all other groups today. For example, about 95 percent of
all the people sentenced under the mandatory minimums are black
men. Over time, because of the police pressure on drugs, and
because of the limited economic opportunities for black men, many
of them will turn to drug dealing as a way to make a living and
then, with the first stint in jail their future is formed. Black
men who have been to prison are virtually permanently
unemployable, so they return to the streets and act as bad role
models for the kids. </p>

prevalence, but neither would it alleviate the load on the
criminal justice system. A policy of reduced arrests at the
retail level probably would reduce the criminal justice load, but
would also lead to a relative increase in cocaine use and
addiction by a factor of two or three or more. A more sweeping
policy that eliminates both seizures and arrests would certainly
reduce the criminal justice load, but would lead to a relative
increase in cocaine use and addiction by a factor of four to
eight or more.&quot;}} </b> </p>

<p> So, under the worst circumstances they cite, there would be
perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 deaths per year from cocaine (4 to 8
times the current 2,500), compared to more than 400,000 for
tobacco, and more than 100,000 for alcohol. For heroin the
numbers would be similar, and for marijuana 4 to 8 times zero is
still zero. On the other hand, we would not have an expensive and
futile policy to put millions of people in prison. In fact, for
the same money that it took to put one person in prison we could
provide treatment for about one hundred. </p>

<p> Relative to your earlier statements on treatment, perhaps you
missed the recent study that said that treatment saves seven

ask them if they have used any illegal drugs (committed a felony)
in the last month. I know what I would tell you, regardless of
the truth. From what I have seen of that age group (having four

<p> Wrong. I can cite a whole long list of internationally
recognized medical experts in the field who state that, except
for the fact that heroin produces addiction, otherwise it is
&quot;harmless&quot;. Their words, not mine. Can you tell me who
Dr. William Halsted is? </p>

<p> <b>{{* Heroin is incredibly dangerous. A dose that is normal
for one addict may kill another. Even a &quot;normal&quot; dose,

<p> See above about &quot;harmless.&quot; The doctors in
Liverpool state that they have patients on &quot;massive
doses&quot; with no risk of overdose. They say &quot;heroin is
not a dangerous drug&quot; and they prescribe it every day. The
number of people killed by heroin in the US runs about 2,000 a
year or about one half of one percent of the number killed by
tobacco. Aspirin also kills about 2,000 people a year. The
Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs investigated
the issue of heroin &quot;overdoses&quot; and did not find a
single instance which they believed could be attributed to a true
&quot;overdose&quot;. Nearly all of the &quot;overdoses&quot;,
they said, had symptoms which were fundamentally incompatible
with an overdose, such as instant death, or pulmonary edema. They
said their research showed that the most probable cause of these
deaths was the impurities mixed with the heroin, not the her oin
itself. As the doctors in England put it, if an addict is buying
heroin on the black market which is 10 percent heroin and 90
percent cement, it does not take a genius to figure out what is
going to cause the most problems. </p>

<p> The low number of deaths from heroin is all the more
remarkable because it is usually taken in the most dangerous
manner possible. </p>

<p> <b>{{* Tolerance for heroin declines rapidly after

<p> More reasons why the doctors in Liverpool decided to take the

<p> Aspirin -- 2,000 </p>

<p> Heroin - 2,000 </p>

<p> Marijuana - No recorded deaths in human history. </p>

<p> The above figures do not include pneumonia type deaths. The
AMA published figures recently which stated that the total of all
such deaths for illegal drugs was about 20,000, still only a
small fraction of the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco. As I
have pointed out in other messages, there is a good deal of

<p> <b>{{ You don't see any danger, then, from extrapolating from
a small, homogenous country to a large, unhomogenous one?}}</b> </p>

<p> Considering the same thing is happening all over Europe, that
kind of equates to a large, unhomogenous one, doesn't it? And, by
the way, what is the exact difference which would keep their
approaches from producing benefits here? That is, assuming you
know enough about what is happening over there to know the
difference. </p>

<p> <b>{{ They &quot;go to jail&quot; quite frequently; they
don't do much prison time unless they deal or commit some other
crime.}} </b> </p>

<p> There are at least 52 Federal judges who disagree with you. I
will take their word, and the word of the New York State
Corrections Commissioner, over yours. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Prescript ion was a miserable failure in England,
according to _Living With Heroin_.}}</b> </p>

<p> Check again, and this time talk to some of the people
actually involved, as we have done. </p>

<p> <b>{{ By and large, the Legalizers are disturbed, unhappy
people who have friends and loved ones who are in prison or
strung out. The aim of the Legalizers is simply to spread the
misery around as much as possible. The more druggies there are,
the more &quot;normal&quot; it is. The farther the web of
destruction spreads, the better. The more people they can ruin
and destroy, they happier they will be. The driving force behind
legalization is Revenge.}}</b> </p>

<p> Now we come down to the real driving force behind drug
prohibition -- bigotry and ignorance. Do you really think that it
is the desire of such organizations as the British Association of
Chiefs of Police? </p>

<p> <b>{{ To advocate legalizing narcotics isn't political
suicide (the surgeon general did it) . . . but it is incredibly
dumb.}}</b> </p>

<p> No she did not. I suppose then, that the British Association
of Chiefs of Police, the head of Interpol, and the Colombian
Attorney General, as well as the California Medical Association,
the California Society of Addiction Medicine, etc., etc., etc.,
etc., are incredibly dumb? (I could go on with a list of about 40
pages of such people, but why belabor the point?) </p>

<p> <b>{{ If I were strung out, it's entirely possible my own
family would turn me in. Lots of druggies get turned in by their
own families; it's the only way to ensure treatment.}}</b> </p>

<p> Judge Gray was on a radio show one night and one of the
callers was a heroin addict who wanted help to get off drugs. He
said he had called the police to ask for help but they just threw
him in jail when he was desperately ill (with things other than
drugs), he got a criminal conviction and no help at all. </p>

<p> The pity is that people who think they ought to throw people
in jail &quot;for their own good&quot; hardly ever get the same
favor granted to them. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Interesting study. The fact that everyone is doing
drugs has &quot;nothing to do with drug availability.&quot;
Presumably, then, they would do just as much if there were no
drugs to be found . . . clever.}}</b> </p>

<p> That is not going to happen, so why worry about it? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Even the most strung-out junkie still wants to get
high. They keep increasing their dosage, every chance they get.
Higher dosage -}more drug tolerance -} fewer highs -} higher
dosage. It's a vicious circle.}}</b> </p>

<p> So the solution is to throw millions of people in prison? </p>

<p> <b>{{ Heh, half of all drug arrests are for minors. How do
you propose to legalize drugs for adults and keep them away from
the kids?}}</b> </p>

<p> You admit it is not happening under the current system, so
what's the difference? You can't think of anyone who could
control the sales to children better than the current people who
sell drugs, right? </p>

<p> <b>{{ &quot;Worth more&quot; means more expensive. More
expensive means less demand . . . even if one assumes that people
in prison have just as to spend as those outside . . .}}</b> </p>

<p> More expensive means more profits -- enough to corrupt entire
law enforcement agencies, like the LA County Sheriffs who went to
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{Perhaps you are correct in saying the vast majority
wouldn't become addicted. Perhaps. But then, I didn't like it
either, and I did become an addict. Was one for about 12 years.}}</b>
</p>

<p> It is as illegal as it can be and that didn't stop you, did
it? What makes you think it stops anyone else? Our policy, as it
is, does not seem to have benefited you. </p>

<p> Would your life have been improved if you had spent twenty
years in prison? By what you are recommending, you still probably
would not be out on the streets to engage in this conversation.
And, couldn't you still get your drugs if you decided you wanted
to? </p>

<p> <b>{{ I don't believe a non addict ever truly understands
what it is like.}}</b> </p>

<p> On the other hand, maybe it is the addict who does not
understand. In general, I don't believe that becoming an addict
gives anyone any great insights into national policy. That is
giving more credit to drugs than they deserve. </p>

<p> <b>{{ When you and Mona say that it isn't magical, you don't
know what you are talking about. When the first buzz of the drug
hits me, I become alive, and feel that I have become really
human. When straight, I do not have that feeling. }}</b> </p>

<p> That is not my experience with any of the drugs I have tried
and it is not the experience of the majority of people I know. If
you do not have the feeling of being human when you are straight
then it seems the problem is there whether you have the drug or
not. I (and most people I know) feel alive all the time so there
is not much need for drugs of any sort. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I continued using while convinced that I would die from
it. }}</b> </p>

<p> So prison, by comparison, would not do nearly as much to
dissuade you, would it? </p>

<p> <b>{{ However - I very rarely drove while high, because of
fear of getting caught. Addiction is _not_ logical. }}</b> </p>

<p> Another good reason why stiff penalties are unlikely to
dissuade addicts from using. Their behavior is not logical. </p>

<p> <b>{{ If it is legalized, there will be folks who will just
try it to see what it is like, and will never be straight again.
You do not account for those people. }}</b> </p>

<p> Yes I do. I don't like their behavior but I don't pretend
that putting them in prison is the proper approach to their
problem, either. </p>

<p> <b>{{Drugs _are_ magical to the addict. }}</b> </p>

<p> Lots of things are magical to the addict. The addicts I have
known used drugs of all types without regard for much of
anything. If they could not get heroin they would do other things
such as sniff gasoline, or inject coffee (quite a rush, they tell
me). That still does not mean that it is a good idea to throw
them in prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{}}As for inflicting pain, I must agree that is a noble
goal. </b> </p>

<p> <b>Sarcasm does not become you. If you never want to inflict
pain, then never raise a child. Never become a supervisor. Never
perform any function where you have the responsibility to modify
someone's behaviour. Pain, whether it be a swat on the butt, a
written reprimand, or a jail term, is an integral part of
behaviour modification.}} </b> </p>

<p> I don't believe in inflicting pain to the point where it
renders someone permanently unemployable and submits them to
things like gang rape, for trivial causes. Punishment, when used,
should be corrective, not destructive. </p>

<p> <b>{{I issue a mild protest over your figures on black male
drug use. You said 50% go to prison for drug abuse. Now you say
50% go to prison period, with drug use the single biggest cause.
But it is not a big point - I was just very shocked at your stat.
}}</b> </p>

<p> No, you misinterpreted. I am very careful about what I say on
this subject, because I have been saying it for a long time to
lots of people. </p>

<p> <b>{{The two most dangerous? Do you think smoking a cigarette
is as dangerous as free basing cocaine? C'mon Cliff! Sure, a lot
more people die from tobacco, but that is because a whole lot
more people use that. Tobacco is legal and marketed. That is
something I want to avoid for cocaine.}}</b> </p>

<p> Compare the death rates. The death rate, per user, for
cocaine is less than that for tobacco. And, just for interest, I
quote from a study done in 1967 - &quot;Cigarette smoking is
unquestionably more damaging to the health than heroin.&quot; --
Drs. Vincent P. Dole and Marie Nyswander, Rockefeller Univ. </p>

<p> <b>{{What do you think about increasing educational efforts?
Teach school kids more about it. Pound home what it can do, and
what help is available. }}</b> </p>

<p> As all of the major studies have said, most of the
educational efforts have been based around ridiculous scare
tactics which the kids soon discovered were hokey and
disregarded. The main problem is a massive lack of accurate
information by the people teaching the courses. </p>

<p> <b>{{What about more money to help folks get straight? I
think it would be poetic to increase the taxes on tobacco and
alcohol to pay for this. }}</b> </p>

<p> A recent Rand study showed that every dollar spent on
treatment saved seven dollars in related social costs. How about
just increasing the taxes on alcohol and tobacco until they pay
their own costs? </p>

<p> <b>{{Judge Gray's idea is intriguing. If we were to go to
legalization, that would be a much better way to handle it then
just turning it over to the market. Of course, that would make
the government our pushers. Sounds a little scary. }}</b> </p>

<p> His basic thought is that drugs are here anyway, so we should
not kid ourselves that we are stopping them. The truth is that we
currentlyinflict smaller losses (percentage-wise) on the drug
dealers than K-Mart suffers from shoplifters. As you probably
know, shoplifters are not about to put K-Mart out of business.
Given the fact that they will be here forever, let's at least
guarantee that there are pure, reliable sources which will not
make the related problems worse, and which will provide a tax
basis for providing treatment. </p>

<p> Keep in mind that Judge Gray is a former prosecutor with
numerous drug convictions. He has also sentenced more than his
share of people to prison for drug offenses, and is not regarded
as lenient. </p>

<p> When he first came out for a change in policy a little over
two years ago, he was vilified by all kinds of people. He just
got back from the State Bar Convention and reported that the
atmosphere has changed completely. He says he is getting more and
more support from other judges and law enforcement officials.
They don't all agree on what would be a better response, but they
agree that our current policy is a failure and should be
abandoned. </p>

<p> <b>{{As to your repeated mentioning of the Netherlands and
Liverpool, I am reminded of another drug success story. According
to reports, we had found a way to successfully combat heroin
abuse. It was low cost, and supplied free to addicts. Am
referring to the methadone program. It took us a long time to
realize what a horrible waste it was. But all the reports were
glowing..... }}</b> </p>

<p> The medical authorities I have talked to, and the research I
have read (see the list) have indicated that the methadone
programs were a major improvement. Not perfect, but a major
improvement. Of the authorities I have talked to they have all
said that the biggest problems with the methadone program were
created by the government itself. First, they said, was a
consistent pattern of lies about the results. The European
authorities have reported the same thing about what the US
Government says about their programs. Second, there were
restrictions on methadone which, in effect, granted monopolies to
certain people and allowed them to abuse the situation. It would
be much better, they said, if addicts could go to their regular
doctors for prescriptions, like any other medication. </p>

<p> Also, many of them point to the methadone programs as proof
that the narcotics are not especially dangerous, because
methadone is prescribed routinely without any significant
overdose problem. </p>

<p> <b>{{Let us look at some of your stats. You say the death
rate for tobacco is 400,000. For alcohol it is 100,000. For
cocaine it is 2,500. You then answer my question by saying the
2,500 does not include pneumonia type deaths. What does it
include? No doubt (correct me if I am wrong) it is a count of
those who OD, and die. Probably from ER's. How many of the
400,000 tobacco deaths are based on that criteria? }}</b> </p>

<p> As I said, the AMA published figures on this subject, and
said that, using the same standards of classification for the
deaths, the comparable figure for illegal drugs is about 20,000,
to tobacco's 400,000+. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Only way to die of an OD of tobacco is to be in a
tobacco wharehouse as it burns down. So, using that criteria, the
death rate for tobacco is probably close to zero. }}</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely wrong. You must have missed the news shows that
reported on the problem of nicotine poisoning in people who work
in the fields and pick tobacco. There are far more people who
receive permanent nervous system damage (and even die) from that
than from most of the illegal drugs. Nicotine, you may have
forgotten, is an insecticide. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Now if we include lung cancer, etc, with the tobacco
deaths, we must also include pneumonia, suicides, traffic
accidents, dehydration, AIDS, etc, in the cocaine deaths.}}</b> </p>

<p> The AMA's figures included those causes. Tobacco still kills
at least 20 times as many people as the illegal drugs. </p>

<p> <b>{{ Many people become very aggresive on crack, and get in
fights - and get killed. That is a cocaine caused death.}}</b> </p>

<p> Wrong. A study done in NY during the height of the crack
epidemic showed that, of 414 homicides, only three could be
traced to the effects of cocaine in any form, and two of these
were victim- precipitated. For example, in one case the murder
victim tried to rape someone who was high on crack and got killed
in the process. The study showed the only drug with a real
connection to violence was alcohol. This was recently confirmed
by the DOJ report &quot;Psychoactive Substances and
Violence.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>{{ In the same way, how many alcohol deaths are caused by
OD? Maybe a few hundred?}}</b> </p>

<p> Wrong again. Alcohol overdose death is not at all uncommon,
especially on college campuses. Former HEW Secretary Joseph
Califano once estimated that about 40 percent of all hospital
care in the US is due to alcohol related conditions, including
overdoses. </p>

<p> <b>{{ It is not easy to OD on alcohol so badly you die. You
tend to pass out first.}}</b> </p>

<p> False. People are simply lucky if they pass out, but alcohol
overdose deaths are not at all uncommon. The main reason you
don't hear about them so much is because they are not news. </p>

<p> <b>{{ So your stats include liver disease, etc. I have met a
heroin addict, who was unconscious, half in a gutter, on a cold
night. If he had died of exposure, he should have been listed as
a heroin caused death. It, of course, wouldn't have been.}}</b> </p>

<p> So maybe we should adjust the death figures for heroin
downward. As I said, even if you assume that, for whatever
reason, the deaths from illegal drugs are grossly underestimated,
you still don't get anywhere near the deaths caused by alcohol
and tobacco. You should take a big clue from this. The reasons
for the drug laws never did have anything to do with the reasons
you are stating. When the laws were first passed, no medical
evidence was even presented to show that these drugs were harmful
and, in fact, the medical authorities in the US were opposed to
the laws. While we are on the subject of history, maybe you can
tell me why hemp was outlawed? </p>

<p> <b>{{Please see the above. Also, your figures are now
counting deaths only. Not fair for a discussion like this. How
many messed up lives do cocaine and heroin cause? If a man is
sent to prison, it does not kill him, it messes up his life. So -
lets compare like to like. }} </b> </p>

<p> So we take someone who already has a problem and mess up his
life some more? Interesting approach, but I fail to see how it
provides any benefit. </p>

<p> <b>{{You say there are approximately 1,000,000 people in
prison for drug abuse. That is 1,000,000 messed up lives.
According to your stats, that leaves 29,000,000 still abusing
drugs outside. That leaves 29,000,000 messed up lives. Now, to
save the 1,000,000 in prison, youwant to vastly increase the
29,000,000. }}</b> </p>

<p> The first point you should recognize from these stats is that
it is folly to believe that anything is under control right now.
So, basically, you are supporting a campaign that has no way to
achieve your stated goals, even if it was a good idea. The lives
messed up in prison are messed up permanently. Black men (by far
the majority of those prosecuted for drug offenses) are virtually
permanently unemployable once they have a prison record. They can
recover from a drug habit (and many do) but it is much more
difficult to recover from a stretch in prison. </p>

<p> And, as for the other 29,000,000, the vast majority of them
are not any more messed up than the average wine drinker. That
much is self-evident, or the problem would be far worse than it
is. </p>

<p> <b>{{Have you ever had a person you truly cared about who was
an addict? }}</b> </p>

<p> Sure, one of my aunts and a cousin I grew up with, among
others. I deplore their behavior and I wish they would stop but,
at the same time, I recognize that neither they nor society would
be better off if we spent a million dollars to put them in
prison. </p>

<p> <b>{{What do I think is a reasonable number of people to
imprison in order to stop drug abuse? Enough so that the overall
welfare of the country comes out ahead. }}</b> </p>

<p> I agree with that last part. So how many should we put in
prison to come out ahead? Just tell me what the number is so we
can make plans to build that many prison cells. </p>

<p> <b>{{ I think we are a long way from passing the point where
more people are messed up by the prison than by drug abuse. }}</b>
</p>

<p> How would you know if you admit you don't know the stats on
deaths or people in prison? </p>

<p> <b>{{How many additional deaths, resulting from the
legalization of drug use, would it take for you to cry &quot;Too
many!&quot; }}</b> </p>

<p> What evidence do you have to show that there would be
additional deaths? Other than your own opinion, that is. All the
evidence I have seen says that the death rate would probably go
down with a more intelligent policy. <br>

<h1>DRUG LEGALIZATION DEBATES </h1>

<p><b>Part 2 - About 15 pages</b> </p>

<p><b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p>The following pages are actual excerpts from some of my
debates on drug policy. </p>

<p>The person I am debating in many of these questions is an M.D.
with about 25 years experience in medicine. You can see how he
started out from the first paragraph. He wound up agreeing with
me and posted a message telling everyone he had changed his mind
and supported a plan similar to the plan used in Liverpool. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>I SAID: Research done at the Federal hospital at Lexington,
KY, was unable to establish what a lethal dose of heroin might
be. In addition, the doctors in Liverpool who prescribe heroin to
addicts every day state that &quot;heroin is not a dangerous
drug&quot; and they have some patients on massive doses of heroin
with no risk of overdose. </p>

<p>{{ Cliff, you must stop this dangerous garbage before you kill
someone. Opiates cause the suppression of respiration. </p>

<p>You quietly stop breathing and die. The LD50 (dose required to
kill half the population of a test animal) of the various opiates
has been well worked out. Specific opiate antagonists such as
naloxone can and are LIFE-SAVING in opiate overdose cases.
Naloxone does nothing but antagonize the respiratory effects of
opiates.}} </p>

<p>You had better talk to the doctors listed in Signer.zip
because they are the ones who told me, as well as the doctors in
Liverpool who prescribe it. They announced it on 60 Minutes so
they reached far more people than I ever will. The people who
told me are -- without doubt -- the leading authorities in the
world on the subject. One of them, in fact, has headed up
California's official investigation into the subject for the last
25 years. There have been other doctors on these boards who have
already recognized that the credentials of the people I am
referring to were far superior to their own. If you would like to
compare credentials, I will list theirs. </p>

<p>Of course, even if heroin was a significant health hazard,
that still would not mean that prison was a productive approach
to the problem. Every major study said that it was precisely
because of these dangers that we should not take this approach --
because this policy only made things worse. </p>

<p>{{ It is true that habitual users become resistant to these
effects, but, for God's sake believe me when I say that a naive
user is in mortal danger from the same dose of heroin.}} </p>

<p>Naive users can be in mortal danger from a lot of things,
including alcohol, automobiles, and firearms. I can't begin to
imagine all the things that we might have to protect you from.
That does not mean it is a good idea to throw them in prison, or
you either, even if you did succumb to the temptations of heroin.
</p>

<p>{{Please give us the words actually used the doctors by the
doctors you are quoting above. If you want to be believed, back
up your opinions WITH QUOTES.}} </p>

<p>Dr. Benson Rowe stated that heroin was &quot;harmless&quot;.
Present in the room at the same time, and voicing no protest were
Dr. Frederick H. Meyers, Dr. Herbert Berger, and the others
listed in Signer.zip. You may look them up in Who's Who. Also,
the doctors in Liverpool stated on 60 Minutes that &quot;Heroin
is not a dangerous drug.&quot; They ought to know because they
prescribe it every day. The full transcript of the program is in
Hoover.zip. </p>

<p>{{ The reason, of course, that you cant is that these notions
fly in the very face of modern neuro-pharmacology.}} </p>

<p>As I said, I will be glad to compare the credentials of these
people with anyone you would like to name. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>The following message is from David C. I thought it was
particularly good. </p>

<p>PMFJI, </p>

<p><b>{{Drugs are illegal because using them is very bad for
people, and therefore very bad for the country.}}</b> </p>

<p>Either I missed something and you finally made tobacco and
alcohol illegal in America or you are saying that tobacco and
alcohol are not drugs or you are saying that using tobacco or
alcohol is not very bad for people. I don't think there are any
other possibilities. Either way this would seem to be a very
silly thing to say. </p>

<p>Let me inject some statistics into your debate: </p>

Looks to me like we both have a serious drug problem - and that
it is the probable cause of some crimes. Also looks like you
wouldn't really want to stuff too many more Americans in jail -
its obviously not working. Australia generaly follows the
American model RE: Drug law, although minor offenders are treated
much more leniently (ie users). </p>

<p>Looking at the statistics would lead one to think that some of
the programmes that continental Europe have for limitting drug
use might be worthwhile. &quot;Liberal&quot; or not, if they work
they would be better than whatever it is we are doing now. I
think your society and mine are obfuscating their moral duty in
the treatment of drug offenders if we continues to simply lock
them up. And, it would seem, wasting a lot of money. </p>

<p>I assume you have never been inside a prison? The probability
of meeting death in a prison is much higher than outside of it.
Prohibition of alcohol didn't work very well early this century.
I don't think that the track record of prohibition of drugs is
doing very well either. </p>

<p>I am told that over half the population of Australia has
smoked marijuana (no source). Should we just build a prison wall
around the place and lock the lot up?? </p>

<p>Regards </p>

<p>David C. </p>

<p>Thirty million people in prison? What an idea! First, face the
fact that there is no way in Hell that we can afford to throw
enough people in prison to make this policy effective. You might
as well go out and throw rocks at the moon and claim that you are
getting closer every time. We can't do it even if it was a good
idea. </p>

<p>So, it looks like the first thing we ought to do is look for
Option #2. Any suggestions? </p>

<p><b>{{You see the horrors of putting drug abusers in prison. I
see the horrors of drug abuse period.}}</b> </p>

<p>Every major study of drug policy agreed that prison only
increased the existing dangers of drugs, and made the situation
worse. In the case of drugs like heroin, they said that nearly
all of the damage to the individual health and to society was the
result of the fact that the drugs were illegal and therefore
unregulated. </p>

<p><b>{{Consider the possibility that continued vigorous
prosecution of the drug laws may limit FUTURE incarcerations in
the long term.}} </b></p>

<p>So how many millions should we put in prison right now? </p>

<p><b>{{ In the meantime I'm comfortable leaving the question in
the hands of our elected representatives.}}</b> </p>

<p>Certainly any change in the laws will have to come from them.
But tell me, where do you agree or disagree with the conclusions
presented by the CU Report, and why? </p>

<p><b>{{ for God's sake, you gave a reference. If discourse is to
mean anything, you must be prepared to back up the reference.}} </b></p>

<p>It would be nice if you did the same, or maybe just answered
some of the simple questions I have asked. Like: who is Dr.
William Halsted and how does his story relate to what you said
earlier? </p>

<p>I am beginning to believe you have not read the CU Report or
you would know the answer to this one right off the top of your
head. </p>

<p><b>{{ }} Dr. Benson Rowe stated that heroin was
&quot;harmless&quot;. {{ The full quote, in context, please.}}</b>
</p>

<p>The occasion was the signing of the Hoover Resolution at the
Hoover Institute at Stanford. Present in the room were the people
listed in Signer.zip, as I said. Dr. Benson Rowe is Professor
Emeritus of Cardiac Surgery at the University of California at
San Francisco. In introducing himself to the assembled group, he
explained how he became interested in the drug issue. He said it
was immediately after World War II when he began doing surgery on
some addicts with damaged heart valves. In order to find out what
was damaging their heart valves he went to the county coroner and
researched the issue with the bodies of people who had died. He
discovered, much to his surprise, that the coroner and every
other medical authority agreed that heroin was not the cause of
the injury to the heart valves. The cause of the injury, instead
was the impurities in the street drug, and the infections which
resulted from injecting anything in unsanitary conditions. He
said that, after almost fifty years of research on the subject,
he was convinced that, except for the fact that heroin caused
addiction, it was otherwise medically &quot;harmless&quot; to the
body. The other doctors in attendance nodded agreement. </p>

<p>At the same conference I asked Dr. Frederick Meyers about what
medication he would recommend for my mother's condition. He said
that opioids were the drug of choice and that they should have no
harmful effects on my mother. </p>

<p><b>{{}}Also, the doctors in Liverpool stated on 60 Minutes
that &quot;Heroin is not a dangerous drug.&quot;{{{ The full
quote, in context, please.}}</b> </p>

<p>See below. The show aired December 28, 1993. Ed is Ed Bradley.
Julia is an addict. Alan Perry is a counselor at the clinic. As I
said, the full text is in Hoover.zip which you could have looked
up and read yourself. </p>

<p>Ed: Julia says she's now able to have normal relation, to hold
down a job as a waitress and to care for her 3 year old daughter.
Without the prescription, where do you think you would be? </p>

<p>Julia: I would probably be dead now. </p>

<p>Ed: Once, they have gotten their prescriptions, addicts must
show up for regular meetings to show that they are staying
healthy and free from crime. But how can anyone be healthy if
they are taking a drug like heroin? </p>

<p>Alan Perry: Pure heroin is not a dangerous drug. We have
people on massive doses of heroin. </p>

<p>Ed: Alan Perry is a former Drug Information Officer for the
local Health Authority and now a counselor at the clinic. So how
come we see so much damage caused by heroin? </p>

<p>Alan: The heroin that is causing that damage, is not causing
damage because of the heroin in it, it is causing damage because
of the bread dust, coffee, crushed bleach crystals, anything that
causes the harm and if heroin is 90% adulterated that means only
10% is heroin, the rest is rubbish, and if you inject cement into
your veins, you don't have to be a medical expert to work it out,
that's going to cause harm. </p>

<p>Ed: Many at the clinic like George still suffer from the
damage caused by street drugs. Alan Perry believes you can't
prescribe clean drugs and needles to addicts without teaching
them how to use them. </p>

<p>Alan: You know the major causes of ill health to drug
injectors is not even the dirty drugs they take, it is their bad
technique. Not knowing how to do it. In America I have seen
addicts missing legs and arms and that is through bad technique.
So we show people how to, not how to inject safely, but how to
inject less dangerously. We have to be clear about that, you have
stoned people sticking needles in themselves in a dangerous
activity. The strategy is called &quot;harm minimalization.&quot;
</p>

<p><b>{{There is a program in Oakland, Calif. When a drug abuser
comes in, and is convicted of a felony charge, he has the
possibility of a new program. . . .}}</b> </p>

<p>You seem to miss the point of these programs. These programs
came about as a result of recognition that prison does not work.
The point of these drug courts is to do anything they can to keep
people out of prison. </p>

<p><b>{{But good news! Did you watch NBC news tonight? If so, you
saw the description of a drug program in Oakland. See my post to
David C. for a quickie description. It keeps drugs illegal, and
keeps many users out of prison, and sobers them up. Wow. }}</b> </p>

<p>You should have caught the A&amp;E special about what is
happening in Europe. They featured the Chief of Police of Oakland
and the Sheriff of San Francisco both saying that the drug war
should be abandoned because it is absolutely hopeless. You
probably missed the news that the mayors of San Francisco,
Oakland, and San Jose held a press conference (along with their
respective law enforcment officials) to announce their signing of
the Hoover Resolution. </p>

<p><b>{{But there was even more good news with it. A man was
quoted who was trying to sell the program. He pointed out that it
saved a whole lot of money. Said it costs $20,000 a year to keep
a druggie in prison. So, unless the average amount of time served
for a drug offense is 23 years, your figure of $450,000 is way
high. }}</b> </p>

<p>The $450,000 figure is composed of the following: $150,000 for
arrest and prosecution, according to figures compiled by the
State of New York. About $150,000 for a prison cell, which is
what it costs here in California. In New York this figure is a
little lower - but still over $100,000. Then add about $30,000
per year for an average term of five years. Total: about $450,000
</p>

<p><b>{{Also, Mr C. pointed out the number of prisoners per
100,000 in this country. It 426, which comes to a little over
1,000,000 altogether. So Cliff's figure of 1,000,000 now in
prison on drug charges must have also been a bit off. (Maybe he
used it like the figure for black males - there are 1,000,000 in
prison, and some of them are there on drug charges.)}}</b> </p>

<p>As earlier, you are misstating what I said. Let me try it
again. There are currently about 1.4 million people in the
prisons and jails of the US and the population is rising rapidly,
primarily because of drugs. The 1.4 million figure is the
population in the prisons on a given census day, which means the
actual count of people who went through those prisons is higher
than that figure. By the Federal Government's own estimates, we
will soon reach the points where we have more than 1.5 million
people in prison (on a given census day) and about two- thirds of
those people will be there for drug charges. The full figures, if
you care to read them, are available in the Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics, published by the DOJ and available
at your local Government book store or through your local
library. </p>

<p><b>{{Drugs are illegal because using them is very bad for
people, and therefore very bad for the country. }}</b> </p>

<p>Absolutely false. That never was the reason for the laws. </p>

<p><b>{{ It is far to our benefit to have a nation of sober
people. }}</b> </p>

<p>No doubt about that, but prison does not achieve that very
well. </p>

<p><b>{{It merely depends on what you want to discourage. Using
drugs is a behavior which is subject to negative reinforcement.}}
</b></p>

<p>The average drug user never sees any such negative
reinforcement from the criminal justice system, except perhaps
that it makes their drugs cost a little more. If that is your
object, you should face the fact right now that this is a
failure. </p>

<p><b>{{How, then, would you persuade them to seek treatment?}}</b>
</p>

<p>My good friend Judge James P. Gray says he does it all the
time with people with alcohol problems, without threatening them
with prison. </p>

<p><b>{{Well, yes, &quot;separation from society&quot; now means
prison. You have some other alternative?}}</b> </p>

<p>So answer the question: How many millions of people do you
think we ought to put in prison for drugs? </p>

<p><b>{{Once again, the British experiment with prescription
heroin has been a failure: &quot;The prescription of
pharmaceutically pure heroin in controlled doses is, in most
essential respects, a thing of the past in Britain.&quot;
(&quot;Drug Problems and Criminal Justice Policy in
Britain,&quot; _Contemporary Drug Problems_, Summer 1992)}}</b> </p>

<p>My good friend, Dr. Clarke Smith, a member of the California
Academy of Family Practice just got back from there last week and
reported that heroin and cocaine are CURRENTLY being prescribed
and that the authorities consider it quite successful. The 60
Minutes show on this subject aired on December 28, 1993, and we
have personally confirmed the facts with the British doctors on
several occasions. The doctors say that their biggest problem
with the program is that the United States Government keeps lying
about it. </p>

<p><b>}}prison as rehabilitation is a disproven illusion</b> </p>

<p><b>According to who?}}</b> </p>

<p>According to Thomas Coughlin, the New York State Commissioner
of Corrections, for one. </p>

<p><b>{{Work-release programs are already a standard part of the
prison system in many states, and have been for many years.}}</b>
</p>

<p>Most convicts do not have the opportunity to participate in
any such programs. These programs have been virtually
discontinued in California. </p>

<p><b>{{ Once again, what you saw that 15-minute television
episode doesn't prove a thing. What may have occurred (according
to Ed Bradley) in one clinic in Liverpool does not allow one to
generalize to the entire society. Anyone can create a
&quot;successful&quot; heroin maintenance program by taking the
addicts who are stable anyway and putting them in the program.
That is, if there are 500 addicts and 20 or 30 of them are
stable, then when you put the 20 or 30 stable addicts in a
maintenance program, you can claim a big &quot;success,&quot; but
you haven't really accomplished anything. Britain has been
practicing heroin maintenance since 1926, according to
&quot;Contemporary Drug Problems,&quot; and very few physicians
prescribe it anymore. If you want to impress anyone with the
supposed successs of the Liverpool program, you will have to come
up with something better than a TV report. I have been to the
library and researched the issue; if you want to continue the
debate, so should you.}}</b> </p>

<p>The more I think about this message, the more I see someone
who is in serious denial here. I have told you of the 60 Minutes
show, the A&amp;E one hour show (originally produced by the BBC),
and the fact that we have personally contacted the doctors
involved to confirm that both shows were accurate. As I said, a
group -- headed by Dr. Clarke Smith, a member of the Board of
Directors of the California Academy of Family Physicians, went to
Europe to confirm what is happening in several areas. The doctors
confirmed to us that the shows were accurate and your information
is, shall we say, outdated. Decriminalization and even outright
legalization are being called for by both medical and police
authorities all over Europe. As far as research goes, you can
download Signer.zip in library 13 of the Issues forum and start
contacting some of the doctors listed there. If you want to know
who they are in more detail, look them up in Who's Who, also at
your local library. </p>

<p>If you have researched this so well in the library, why
haven't you read any of the studies I mentioned? </p>

<p>So I am calling your bluff again. The doctors involved in
Liverpool are named in the text of the 60 Minutes program in
Hoover.zip. They are listed with information in Liverpool, or you
can simply call the public health service in Liverpool, as we
originally did, and ask to be put in touch with the doctors
running the program. Go ahead. Call them and tell us the results.
And while you are at it, remember to ask them about the vote of
the British chiefs of police. </p>

<p><b>{{ The Chinese are biologically the same as the Americans.
They react to addictive substances the same as we do.}} </b></p>

<p>Aren't the Europeans biologically the same as us, too?
Therefore, the programs which are currently working in Europe
should work here. </p>

<p><b>{{ Try reading what I wrote before you comment on it:
&quot;People who had boring or stressful jobs turned to opium:
court eunuchs, wealthy housewives, harried clerks, soldiers going
into combat, students preparing for exams.&quot; These people
have their counterparts in America.}}</b> </p>

<p>Court eunuchs have their counterpart in America? Other studies
of the same period of time showed that opium use in China was not
a lot different from alcohol use in the US. That is, the majority
of the users were weekend recreational users who could take it or
leave it. The percentage who appeared to be addicted was not much
different than the percentage one would expect from alcohol. </p>

<p>And, since you seem to be so good at history, you ought to
know that the first anti-opium laws in the US had nothing to do
with public health and safety. The first anti-opium law was an
1875 San Francisco ordinance banning the smoking of opium in
opium dens, a peculiarly Chinese custom. The stated reason for
the law was the fear that Chinese men were luring white women to
their &quot;ruin&quot; in opium dens. &quot;Ruin&quot; was
defined not as opium addiction, but as associating with Chinese
men. The racism behind these laws was overt from the very
beginning. At the same time, opium remained available in all
sorts of medicinal preparations, more commonly used by whites. </p>

<p><b>{{ Again, you should read what I wrote. During the period
of legal narcotics trade, between 1858 and 1906, the incidence of
narcotics use increased from around 5% of the population to
approximately 25%.}}</b> </p>

<p>And it was on a steady decline from 1906 to 1914 when the
Harrison Narcotics Act was passed, primarily because of the Pure
Food and Drug Act of 1905 which made manufacturers list the
ingredients and therefore allowed consumers to intelligently
choose. You may also recall that the major medical societies all
stated that the Harrison Act was a medical, criminal, and social
disaster and urged its repeal. After the passage of the Act, the
problems of drug use rose sharply. </p>

<p>And, maybe you could share with us the reasons why hemp -- the
largest crop in America -- was made illegal? </p>

<p><b>{{ Great idea, only what is more positively reinforcing

<p>Well, most people I know think that the mundane old stuff like
making an honest living, and being sober enough to enjoy your
family is a whole lot better than any drug high. </p>

<p><b>{{ &quot;Drug users referred to treatment by the criminal
justice system stay in treatment longer on average than those

criminal activity as are those voluntarily in drug
treatment.&quot; _Bureau of Justice Statistics National Report_
(1992).}}</b> </p>

<p>That's easy to do if you are behind bars for twenty years. And
the ones that went to prison are &quot;as successful&quot; as the
ones who went voluntarily. Because it is so expensive to process
them through prison, don't you think it would be a better idea to
get them to go voluntarily? </p>

<p><b>{{ I don't see what this has to do with drug offenses.

<p>That is the word of the world's leading medical experts on the
subject, including the doctors in Liverpool who prescribe it
every day. There is a long list of them in Signer.zip. If you
need more information on them you can read Who's Who or I can
probably put you in touch with a good number of them. (I have

</p>

<p><b>{{How many more children are you willing to hand over to

<p>Not one -- which is one the main reasons that the current

<p><b>{{ Gosh, a serious question! It's been *so* long!}}</b> </p>

<p>I have asked you lots of serious questions but you don't want
to answer them. So here is an old one, slightly rephrased: Let's
suppose I believe everything you say about drugs and the best
kind of drug program. You say that prison must be an integral
part of that program. So, as a taxpayer who has to pay for the
prisons, I ask you: There are thirty million drug users in the
United States. How many millions do you want to throw in prison? </p>

<p>Further supposing I believe everything you say: If prison is
such a good idea for these drugs, why isn't it an equally good
(or even better!) idea for alcohol and tobacco? </p>

<p><b>{{ The failure of our present program is that it treats
dealers as criminals and addicts as victims.}}</b> </p>

<p>No, as the judges and other law enforcement officials have
told me, it is a disaster (not just a failure) because it never
was a good idea in the first place. </p>

<p><b>{{ This is a rather arbitrary distinction, since most
dealers are also addicts and most addicts are involved in
crime.}}</b> </p>

<p>Under the law all users are dealers. </p>

<p><b>{{ Also, it is also useless trying to suppress drug dealing
without suppressing drug abuse. Therefore, I believe that a
successful drug policy should place greater weight on curtailing
drug abuse.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree there. </p>

<p><b>{{ Drug abuse occurs for a number of reasons. People who
are poor and uneducated turn to drugs because they have nothing
better to do with their lives. Unfortunately, you can't do much
about that, short of a general reform of American society. It is
important, however, that treatment programs offer addicts an
alternative lifestyle. Taking someone out of a rotten, no-future
life in a miserable slum and putting them in treatment is
useless, if they can only go back to a rotten, no- future life in
a miserable slum.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree there. </p>

<p><b>{{ In this light, vocational training is very important. It
is important that training be suited to the individual and also
provide him with the opportunity for pursuing a meaningful
career. But in all cases, it should be made plain that the
alternative to honest work is prison.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree that vocational training is very important. </p>

<p>Well, we don't have any programs funded to meet the
&quot;honest work&quot; part of it so the alternative is always
prison. Of course, once they go to prison, it doesn't matter if
they get vocational training or not, because nobody is going to
hire them anyway. As a society, that is called shooting ourselves
in the foot. </p>

<p><b>{{ A lot of affluent people, who have plenty other
opportunities, also use narcotics. For such individuals, the
stigma of going to jail is very important, and so punishment is a
strong deterrent.}}</b> </p>

<p>Poor people get jail. Affluent people get the Betty Ford
Clinic. That disparity in the outcome of this policy is one of
the reasons that every major study of drug policy has recommended
decriminalization. </p>

<p><b>{{ The MADD movement provides a good model of how effective
legislation can produce a real social change: There is now a
strong stigma against drunk driving, and so the offense has
declined. Legalized gambling provides a counter-example: There is
no stigma against playing Lotto or video poker, and so millions
of people gamble who never did it before.}} </b></p>

<p>Your analogies are weak. Drunk driving is a public behavior.
There is a useful purpose to enforcing laws on public behavior
and, because the behavior is public, the laws have a chance to
confront the offender and stop the situation. The same is not
true with drug use. </p>

<p><b>{{ So, treatment and punishment are both important for
controlling the drug problem. }}</b> </p>

<p>The information supplied above does not support this
conclusion. </p>

<p><b>{{ One often hears the argument, however, that we should
treat addicts *instead* of throwing them in jail. However, these
are not logical alternatives. Many addicts will not accept
treatment unless they are already in jail or are threatened with
imprisonment.}}</b> </p>

<p>The Rand Corporation recently issued a study which said that
every dollar spent on drug treatment saved an additional seven
dollars in related social costs. On the other hand, every dollar
spent on putting drug users in prison costs about an additional
fifteen dollars in related social costs. </p>

<p>Of course, the British have a way of getting addicts to accept
treatment and become crime-free. They simply tell the addicts
that they will lose their legal prescription if they don't
straighten their lives out. It works a whole lot better than what
you are recommending. </p>

<p><b>{{ Judges often do sentence minor drug offenders to
treatment rather than prison. This has merit; we definitely need
to expand drug treatment and make it more available.}}</b> </p>

<p>We agree on this point. I would also point out that judges
often sentence minor offenders to unconscionable prison terms
over trivial offenses, like the young woman who got a mandatory
minimum of ten years without even touching drugs. </p>

<p><b>{{ But we also need to end the cycle by which addicts go
into treatment, then relapse. }}</b> </p>

<p>You missed the 60 Minutes show and the A&amp;E show on
Liverpool (obviously) so you might be interested in what the
doctors there said. They said that all modes of treatment or
punishment for drug use that they could find produced the same
essential result. That is, about five percent of the addicts per
year would come off of drugs by themselves, regardless of what
you did. They said it seemed to be as much a process of
maturation as anything else. Therefore, they said, rather than
punish them and seriously impact their health with dirty heroin,
dirty needles, etc., they opted to give the addicts prescriptions
for heroin and cocaine, and teach them how to manage their
addiction until they can mature off of it. As a result, most of
the health problems have been eliminated, most of the crime has
been eliminated, and most addicts are employed and living with
their families. </p>

<p><b>{{ For this reason, I would support a program of
accelerated minimum sentences for second and subsequent offenses.
When an addict proves untreatable, the next best alternative is
to separate him from society. In addition, the accelerated
schedule of punishments provides incentive to reform.}}</b> </p>

<p>So I ask again. How many people do you propose to put in
prison? </p>

<p><b>{{ The aim of treatment programs is to end addiction. }} </b></p>

<p>The primary aim of the British program is to keep addicts
healthy long enough to end the addiction. </p>

<p><b>{{ But it is also important to prevent untreated addicts
from becoming a menace to society. }}</b> </p>

<p>Their crimes are primarily property crimes and are a result of
the fact that drugs are illegal. In Liverpool, where they have
tried another approach, the addicts are no longer a menace to
society. </p>

<p><b>{{In this light, methadone programs have been very
successful. While methadone is addictive, it can be taken orally
and is much more long- lasting in preventing withdrawal than is
heroin.}}</b> </p>

<p>Many famous medical experts, such as Dr. Frederick H. Meyers
point out that the prescription of methadone (a narcotic) in such
large amounts proves that narcotics are not inherently dangerous.
</p>

<p><b>{{ A heroin addict needs an injection every few hours and
often becomes violent if he doesn't get it. }}</b> </p>

<p>A recent report by the Department of Justice titled
&quot;Drugs and Violence&quot; says that the only drug which has
any real connection to any kind of violent crime is alcohol. Even
if what you said was true, it would seem that we would be far
better off with an approach like they are using in Liverpool. A
managed daily prescription would seem to be the best way to
insure that this does not happen. If you had read any of the
studies I have mentioned, you would know that tobacco and alcohol
users exhibit the same kinds of anti-social behavior when they
are deprived of their drug. </p>

<p><b>{{ Finally, I would support expanded drug testing. At
present, the police are well equipped to test drunk drivers, but
narcotics users may evade punishment, unless they happen to have
the drugs in their possession. Definitely, police stations should
be equipped to test persons arrested for reckless driving and
similar offenses for drugs. Regular drug testing should also be a
part of all prison programs.}}</b> </p>

<p>Why wouldn't you support the same thing for alcohol and
tobacco? They do far more damage than illegal drugs so we would
be far better off to put the same effort against them. How about
it? Should we throw George Burns in jail because he refuses to
give up cigars? </p>

<p>And do you want to punish people based solely on their drug
tests? After all, you have money in your pocket right now with
cocaine dust on it and it is possible that enough of it got in to
your system to make you register positive. That is, of course, if
you didn't already test positive because you took a cold
medication, or a headache pill, or a cough syrup, or ate certain
kinds of bread, etc., etc., etc., <br>

<h2>25 More pages of the Drug Legalization Debate </h2>

<p> by Clifford A. Schaffer </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>But there is a more pressing argument. I know human nature
to at least some degree. People do things for many reasons, but
primarily because they get more pleasure than pain from the
thing. Your argument is that if you remove a whole lot of the
pain from drug use, that people will not use drugs more. Are you
therefore saying that making heroin illegal causes people to want
to use it more? Why? Do people enjoy paying fines? Do they like
prison?</b> </p>

<p> <b>Please provide me with some sensible reasons why you
believe people would not use drugs more, or would use them less,
if drugs were legal.</b> </p>

<p> The basic reason is the same simple reason that most people
do not spend their days staggering around on booze. I tried it
and realized that I enjoyed being sober a whole lot more. The
vast majority of the people are the same way. As I said before,
there is nothing magical about these drugs which causes them to
be hypnotically attractive. As a matter of fact, I don't think I
would like them much myself because one of the most common
effects is to make users puke. Maybe it is hard for other people
to understand, but I don't think that puking is much fun. </p>

<p> As for inflicting pain, I must agree that is a noble goal.
Take a group of people who are not well off anyway and make it
our goal to inflict as much pain on them as we can. </p>

<p> Let's consider a certain little statistical fact. The number
of people in prison is currently only a small fraction of the
total number of users. Therefore, the current system cannot
inflict pain on more than a small number of the users and must be
seen as quite ineffective in your stated goal. Without
considering the fact that our prisons are currently overloaded,
just tell me how many more millions of people we should put in
prison to inflict the proper amount of pain. </p>

<p> <b>Please also confirm your quote to me on the percentage of
black men going to prison on drug charges. You said it was 50%.
Is that accurate? If so, what percentage of black men, in total,
abuse drugs? If 50% go to prison, total use must approach 100%.
If not, what is the figure? (I guess this has one point in your
favor. If 100% of black males now are drug abusers, legalizing
drugs would not cause the percentage to go up.) </b> </p>

<p> About half of all black men in America will be incarcerated
at least once by the time they are thirty. The source of this is
information extrapolated from the DOJ report The Prevalence of
Imprisonment, and studies by the Sentencing Project that show
that about one-fourth of the black men under 30 are _currently_
in prison, on probation, or parole. Drug offenses will be the
single biggest cause for this. The figures on drug use through
the population are about the same for whites as it is for blacks.
The disproportionately high percentage of blacks arrested can be
accounted for by a number of factors. The first is that these
laws originally were intended to target minorities and the
tactics used to enforce them tend to target minorities over
whites. For example, it is easier to pick up twenty street
dealers in a minority community than it is to get the same number
by busting middle class white houses. Also, the drug business
provides a unique opportunity for young black men. These and
other factors create a situation where, in certain inner city
neighborhoods, ninety percent of the black men have already been
to prison at least once. Also, black men are more likely to be
convicted because of poor legal representation, and more likely
to be sentenced to prison when they are convicted. </p>

<p> <b>Okay!! Finally. What other options do you have in mind?
This has the possibility of being a very productive thread. No
snide insults or sarcasm. What other options are there? </b> </p>

<p> There are quite a few. The first point that I would make is
that we should have a consistent philosophy and approach to all
recreational drugs. That is, if you would not think it good for
7-11 clerks to sell cocaine to children, then we should be
equally tough about tobacco. At the same time, if you recognize
that throwing tobacco smokers in prison would be
counterproductive, then it stands to reason that it would be
counterproductive for other drugs. Figure out what would be a
good policy for the two most dangerous drugs -- alcohol and
tobacco -- and it will be easy to figure out what should be done
about the others. </p>

<p> Judge Gray has called for &quot;regulated distribution&quot;.
His idea is that drugs would be available at government regulated
stores of some sort at prices that would be low enough to
discourage the black market. Advertising would be prohibited
under his idea and all drugs would be sold in plain wrappers with
warning information and, most importantly, a number to call to
get help. </p>

<p> The Netherlands has taken a different approach. They still
have drug laws but make it a point not to enforce them except in
cases where there are bad drugs, or people are making themselves
obnoxious. Their primary purpose is to reduce the harm done by
drugs and part of their plan is to get people to come in for
treatment. </p>

<p> In Liverpool, they are prescribing heroin and cocaine to
addicts as part of the public health service. Part of the price
of getting the prescription is that addicts must agree to stop
committing crimes and to get their lives together. </p>

<p> With some drugs, such as marijuana, it is doubtful whether
any sort of regulation is even desireable. The Dutch ignore it to
the point of allowing it to be sold openly in coffee shops and it
does not seem to cause any problems. </p>

<p> <b>Now there are burglars in my neighborhood. Some of them do
the same crime for years - and will keep on doing it for more.
Is, therefore, the threat of prison not relevant? Should we
remove that threat? Should we legalize buglary, because prison
only makes it worse? I don't think so. You have indicated that
legalizing hard drugs would lower the rate of drug abuse. Perhaps
you also believe legalizing burglary would lower that crime. I
disagree on both counts. The threat of prison is a deterrent to
potential burglars, robbers, murderers, etc. I believe it is also
a deterrent to potential drug abusers. Once addiction has been
reached, that threat is less powerful. But that does not mean we
remove it. </b> </p>

<p> I get this tired, irrelevant argument a lot. First, burglary
is not the same as drug use so comparisons of the legal methods
for controlling them are silly. Second, if we had thirty million
burglars (or criminals of any kind) we would have to find another
method of dealing with the problem just because the criminal
justice system could not handle the load. In this case it doesn't
matter what you want to do, it is a matter of what you can do. </p>

<p> <b>You also indicated that I should be imprisoned as a drug
addict. I assume you are being sarcastic again. (Which, BTW, is
rude.) Since I have now been sober for 13 years, and 15 days,
prison is not called for. However, remember that drugs took 12
years of my life. If I had been jailed in year two or three, and
that huge shock had persuaded me to stay sober, I would have
gained 9-10 years of a productive life back. I, in retrospect,
really wish that had happened. I miss those 12 years a lot. </b> </p>

<p> No, I was not being sarcastic, I was simply following the
logical conclusion of what you said. I would point out that,
under the current laws you might have done a lot more than a
couple of years in jail. And, when you got out, you would be
virtually unemployable (at anything decent, anyway) which would
have severely impacted your attempts at recovery. </p>

<p> <b>You again brought up several times that legalizing drugs
(which you oppose) in other countries lowered the rate of drug
abuse. Because of my knowledge of the way people act, I find that
either I do not understand what you mean, or your stats are
simply wrong. As I said above, if you made burglary legal, would
there be fewer of them? If you sold hamburgers for 10cents, would
we buy fewer? I just find the idea that making hard drugs
controlled, legal, and cheap would result in less use of them. </b>
</p>

<p> My point again that you are not acquainted with all of the
facts on this issue. It is happening in Europe. As one Dutch
official put it, junkies are their own worst advertisement and
they really don't need much in the way of education to persuade
people that drug addiction is something they want to avoid. </p>

<p> As I said before, I recommend that you read the CU Report,
and see the A&amp;E special which recently aired on this subject.
</p>

<p> <b>You asked about your mother being unable to get the drugs
she needs. I do not know the situation at all. I believe that any
drug that would help your mother should be available to her,
including marijuana and heroin. Of course, that is not the point
here.</b> </p>

<p> Then you do not understand a whole lot about the drug war.
The repression of medical use and research into these drugs was
an integral part of the whole campaign from the very beginning.
When the laws were first passed the drug police jailed more than
3,000 doctors, specifically aiming at those who were treating
addicts, and those who voiced disagreement with the policy. They
effectively shut down all research into the medical uses and even
research into the causes and cures for drug addiction for over
fifty years (and it is still difficult to do honest drug research
in this country). It was a deliberate, calculated reign of terror
against the medical profession which is still intact today. </p>

<p> If you will research this a little you will discover why this
reign of terror exists. That is, if these drugs are under the
province of the medical profession where they really belong, then
the whole drug prohbition will fall apart quite rapidly. </p>

<p> As I said before, your assumptions about why these laws are
here are totally wrong. The reasons you have stated never did
have anything to do with the laws. </p>

<p> <b>We have discussed this. You play with stats to advance
your point, regardless of the intellectual integrity. </b> </p>

<p> You have not presented any stats in contrast to mine, so I
wonder how you can say this. </p>

<p> <b>You also said that eight times the number that die from OD
on drugs, die from that drug use for other reasons - pneumonia,
for example. You ignored my point that many deaths would not be
attributed to drug use because there was something else handy,
such as exposure, or AIDS.</b> </p>

<p> No I didn't. I quoted the AMA figures on the subject. You
have cited nothing but your own opinion in response. </p>

<p> <b>You have again cooked your figures. Lets say a policeman
pulls over the car of a junkie tonight for erratic driving. A
search shows five rocks in his pocket. He is arrested. Knowing he
is busted, he pleads guilty. According to your figures, that cost
$150,000. Balderdash. </b> </p>

<p> Aren't we deliberately missing some points here? For every
one which does what you suggested (and there are fewer of them as
the penalties go up) there are others who fight it all the way.
The AVERAGE cost is what is being cited. </p>

<p> <b>They then build a cell - especially for him. They can't
use the one that some burglar is now leaving. </b> </p>

<p> Well, yes they could. That is what is happening now --
violent offenders are being released early so we can throw more
drug users in prison. That doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
Therefore, in order for the law not to cause more harm than good
(by releasing another offender early) we have to build a new
prison cell. </p>

<p> <b>No - that would mean you had to prorate the cost of the
cell by everyone who uses it. Would be an honest way, but would
not boost your cause. Balderdash again. </b> </p>

<p> By what you are saying, the total number of people sent to
prison would not increase beyond what it is today -- therefore no
beneficial effect from tougher penalties. </p>

<p> <b>An official in Oakland who desperatly wanted to show how
much money was being saved by his drug program as opposed to
prison, put the cost of prison at $20,000 per year. You say
$30,000. Balderdash. </b> </p>

<p> No, the figures I used come from the Wall Street Journal and
the DOJ. The figures vary somewhat from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction, and according to the type of prison but they are
all in the same range. You can get the most current figures
yourself by calling the National Clearinghouse and Data Center
for Drugs and Crime. </p>

<p> <b>In Phoenix they put folks in tents!! Its warm, and they
have many cots like in the army, but it is cheap. And a good
deterrent. Folks don't like it. So my guess for my addict above
is about $2,000 to arrest and and convict, $1,500 for the
prorated cost of the cell, and $10,000 for the six months he
would actually serve. Comes to $13,500, as opposed to your
$450,000. </b> </p>

<p> But, of course, your guess is not any more informed than some
of your other statements. Personally, I will take the testimony
of people like Thomas Coughlin, the New York State Commissioner
of Corrections, before I would accept yours. </p>

<p> <b>I am developing a deep mistrust for your facts and
figures. Many of them _may_ be correct, but when I find some to
be in error, I know that you would deliberatly mislead if you
felt you could get away with it. So now I divide by two, an then
doubt. </b> </p>

<p> So go read the resources I have mentioned yourself. If you
had done that in the first place, we wouldn't be having this
discussion now. </p>

<p> <b>Drugs are not magical in a literal sense. They just have a
profound effect on the minds of some people, that some of those
people have compared to magic. </b> </p>

<p> I thought so. But, of course, either way it does not indicate
that prison is the correct approach. </p>

<p> <b>PatI ask you - how many more deaths, and destroyed lives,
would it take before you said legalizing drugs was a bad idea?
Will await your answer. Please make it public. Thanks. </b> </p>

<p> <b>You have dodged this question about four times now. I am
not asking your opinion on whether you think legalizing drugs
would have that effect. I am asking _If it did._ Please answer. I
think the lurkers here deserve an answer. </b> </p>

<p> As I said, I never said I supported legalization, so the
question is misdirected. If legalization is what you have stated
then I wouldn't support it whatever the figures are. </p>

<p> The answer here depends upon what you mean by
&quot;legalizing drugs&quot;. If you mean that cocaine, heroin,
etc., would be sold as freely as convenience store clerks sell
tobacco to children then it is possible that addiction and deaths
would increase, although the evidence clearly shows that they
would still not approach the death rates imposed by alcohol and
tobacco. So, even in that case, one has to wonder why the major
push should not be against alcohol and tobacco first. </p>

<p> But, of course, I am asking you if you have any evidence
(besides your own opinion) that it would increase the deaths. So
far, you have not responded to that. </p>

<p> <b>You said it is not okay with you if a junkie frys his
brain, or dies, from drug abuse. Why not, if he chooses to take
the drug? I thought that was the core of your argument - that we
had no right to interfere with him, because he could choose what
he wanted, and endure the results. Where am I missing this?</b> </p>

<p> This point is not, and never was, the core of my arguments. I
really don't care what you think about anyone's individual
&quot;right&quot; to use recreational drugs, as long as you
recognize that prison is not the proper approach in any case. </p>

<p> But, to get back to this point, let's consider a specific
example. My mother is desperately ill with severe chronic pain. I
won't bore you with the medical history, so let it suffice to say
that she has been all over the US and talked to the nation;s
leading medical experts on the subject. They have all said that
the best medications for here condition are the narcotics -
heroin and morphine. She cannot get either one because the
doctors are afraid they will be prosecuted over any questioned
prescription. In these cases, don't you think that the people who
should be making the decision on the medical use of drugs should
be the doctors, in consultation with their patients? </p>

<p> Both the Dept. of Health and Human Services and the
California Medical Association have issued reports stating that
the undertreatment of pain in this country is a &quot;national
tragedy&quot; and the only reasons for it are the fear and
ignorance created by the drug war. </p>

<p> Can we at least agree that any policy which denies medicine
to sick people has something seriously wrong with it -- both
morally and practically? </p>

<p> <b>You said it was &quot;tyranny&quot; to send a person to
prison for drug abuse, because we would be denying him his right
to make choices. Tyranny is a judgemental word. Is it tyranny to
prohibit sexual harassment? </b> </p>

<p> I never used the word &quot;tyranny&quot;. Who are your
quoting? </p>

<p> <b>((Who are we to cram our views down the throat of some
poor, middle aged, overweight, pathetic, animal of a business
manager? We are a society. We look out for each other. I won't
let that manager hurt people if I can stop it. Why? Because I
care about the people he is hurting, more than I care about his
pride. Would be willing to bankrupt him in a lawsuit, to stop
him, and the others like him, from hurting people. That same
concern is why I want drugs to remain illegal. I care about the
people who are having their lives messed up by drugs. I want it
to stop. Yes, prison is not a good way to do this, but it is the
best way I see available to us right now. </b> </p>

<p> I agree that you have a paternalistic attitude toward
interfering in other people's lives. I don't agree that prison is
the correct approach, even if your attitude was either moral or
justified. </p>

<p> It is also obvious that you are not acquainted with all the
ways we might do this. Try reading some of the studies I have
mentioned. </p>

<p> <b>If you can come up with a way that will assuredly reduce
the amount of human suffering because of drug abuse, please share
it. You know by now that I don't buy the &quot;make it legal, and
people will stop using it&quot; argument. Okay - you don't buy
prison is better than legalization. Do you have any other ideas??
What can we brainstorm? Imagine you and I were co-dictators of
this country. We could change any law, as long as we both agreed.
What would we do about drug abuse??</b> </p>

<p> A good point here, which is why I was one of the co-authors
of the Hoover Resolution. It is true that we can come to a better
solution if we will all sit down, read the facts, and discuss
them. The immediate problem here is that you are not yet
acquainted with all the facts, or the possible options. First, I
would recommend that you take a trip to the local library and
read The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs. You
will find it fascinating, whatever your views may be. </p>

<p> Or, you may just want to check out what they are doing in
Europe. </p>

<p> <b>PatDo you think some adict who chokes to death on his own
vomit is not a victim?</b> </p>

<p> <b>PeterHe &quot;victimized&quot; himself.</b> </p>

<p> <b>PatYes, that is the core of the pro-legalization argument.
</b> </p>

<p> Absolutely false. There is a lot here that you don't
understand. </p>

<p> <b>I say so what? He is just as dead. Don't you care? That
_does_ make legalization seem much more attractive. If, say, an
additional 200,000 people die in the first year, the legalizers
would simply say they &quot;victimized&quot; themselves, and
therefore it is no big thing</b> </p>

<p> First, show me some evidence that this would happen. There is
no evidence anywhere that I can find. For openers, you might try
reading some of the studies I have mentioned. </p>

<p> Second, even if it did happen, there is even less evidence
that prison is the best approach to minimizing the problem. As I
have said many times before, all the major studies said that
prison was the worst approach. </p>

<p> Third, even if it did happen (which all major studies refute)
all major studies agreed that abandoning prison would still be a
better approach. </p>

<p> Fourth, as we have discussed before, legalization and prison
are not the only options. </p>

<p> . </p>

<p> <b>Please see this point. Responding that you don't think
more peole would die is not addressing this. I am asking you
&quot;What if they _do_ die?&quot; Is that even an issue to you? </b>
</p>

<p> Sure it is. That's why I want to see an approach which works
a whole lot better than what we are doing now. Every major study
agreed that the current system kills people from a whole lot of
causes. </p>

<p> <b>You referred back to Frank again, and said that Frank was
referring to &quot;responsible&quot; freedom. I had wondered
whether, if you were with Frank, drunk, and about to climb down a
cliff, whether he would smile and nod, or try to stop you by
whatever means necessary. Frank said &quot;a situation in which
any outside authority can proscribe the actions of an individual
agent, even if the motivation is to &quot;protect&quot; that
agent &quot;from himself&quot; is indefensible. It is a god-given
right to not only be wrong, but to also injury onself,
overtly/intentionally or covertly/unintentionally.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> We have already established that tough laws and big prisons
could not stop you from harming yourself with drugs. Should we
perhaps just attach a 24-hour bodyguard to you because you are a
known risk? How about isolation? </p>

<p> <b>Now, please, lets you and I get serious. Assume
legalization is _not_ an option. Can you think up options to
lower the amount of suffering caused by drug abuse? Visits to
LARC's by high school classes?</b> </p>

<p> <b>How about producing a very long lasting drug that makes
cocaine and heroin not function? Antabuse does a similiar thing
for alcoholics, but only stays in the system for about a week
after the last use. How about prison farms, where addicts are
seperated from the general population, and spend most of their
time in education and hard manual labor, for the duration of
their sentence? Any ideas at all????</b> </p>

<p> There are lots of ideas, some of which I have already shared
with you. In Europe they are trying even more than we have
discussed here and nearly all of those programs are having better
results than what we experience here. </p>

<p> As for the prison farms and hard manual labor, I suggest
again that (assuming you are right) we should start with the
addicts we know -- namely you. What's wrong with that? It would
improve your life greatly, wouldn't it? </p>

<p> <b>So, our government is wasteful and inept. That doesn't
preclude imprisonment as being a proper course of action.</b> </p>

<p> No, but the absolute futility of this approach, combined with
the fact that every major study of the issue says it does more
harm than good would preclude it as a proper course of action. </p>

<p> I would also like to ask you exactly when prison became a
&quot;proper course of action&quot; because no such fact was ever
established when these laws were first passed. </p>

<p> <b>I know of one who died from heroin. He was in my wedding
party. I know of another who died in an automobile wreck while
under the influence of cocaine. He was my best man. They're the
only two statistics I need to be familiar with. Unfortunately I
know more. Perhaps if they had been in jail, they would be
statistics.</b> </p>

<p> The obvious point here is that drugs are illegal as hell but
they did not stop either one of these tragedies. This makes it
all the more curious why you would support a policy that did
nothing for your friends. </p>

<p> <b>At the risk of sounding offensive, I dare say that until
you have lived and shared in the misery associated drug addiction
and abuse, you know absolutely nothing beyond the politically
slanted statistics that you've read or have access to. Perhaps
you do know something about this misery, in which case you've let
your mind lead your heart.</b> </p>

<p> I hear this a lot and it is BS from beginning to end. First,
let me assure you that I have a pretty fair amount of experience
with addicts, as do all of the doctors and others listed in
Signer.zip. I dare say that the experience of any one of them
would far outweigh the experience you have had. </p>

<p> I don't think that knowing someone who was an addict or even
being an addict yourself provides any great insights into a
proper national policy. That gives entirely too much credit to
drugs. </p>

<p> As for not knowing anything beyond the politically slanted
statistics, it is apparent that you have not been to the library
and read the studies I have mentioned many, many times. If you
had, you would find that the statistics -- and their
interpretation -- are quite clear to anyone who has bothered to
read the evidence. As President Nixon's own commission said, the
real problem is the ignorance of our public officials who have
never bothered to read the evidence. </p>

<p> <b>Increased &quot;incidence,&quot; not increased
&quot;reports.&quot; And yes, I expect that a 25% incidence of
narcotics would indicate harm to society.</b> </p>

<p> Perhaps you are wrong here, because the major studies of the
issue stated that, despite the widespread usage, it did not seem
to be a major problem. Furthermore, even if it was, there was no
evidence presented to Congress to show that the Harrison
Narcotics Act was an appropriate approach to the problem. In
fact, as stated earlier, the medical officials in this country
felt it was not the proper approach. Furthermore, if you will
read the Consumers Union Report (which you seemed to have missed
in your trips to the library) you will find that most members of
Congress did not realize that they were passing what would turn
out to be a Prohibition law. Similarly, when hemp was outlawed in
1937, most members of Congress did not realize that they were
outlawing a commercial crop which was grown in virtually every
state in the US. </p>

<p> <b>you equate the social, economic, and political milieu of
19th century China with that of modern day America</b> </p>

<p> <b>I am not doing anything of the kind.</b> </p>

<p> It seems to me you were. But, regardless, the information you
presented did not support the stated conclusions. </p>

<p> <b>I suggest you write to the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and tell them that their figures are in error.</b> </p>

<p> I suggest you research your facts a little better. You have
missed most of the major research on this issue. </p>

<p> <b>Drug abuse imposes its own costs on society.</b> </p>

<p> True enough. The point is that there is no evidence that
prison does anything to reduce those costs. In fact, every major
study of the issue (which you missed on your trip to the library)
said it only increases the costs. </p>

<p> <b>why we shouldn't help smokers and excessive drinkers kick
the habit</b> </p>

<p> <b>Sounds like a good idea. It's the Christian thing to do.</b>
</p>

<p> So let's get really Christian and throw them all in jail for
their own good. If you are a Christian, let me ask you a simple
question. If we gave this problem to Jesus, what would he do?
Would he build bigger prisons, or would he build hospitals and
schools? Would he punish people, or would he heal them? Before
you answer, please note that I have talked to a lot of members of
the clergy and they all come back with the same answer. As one
said, &quot;Put that way, the answer is obvious.&quot; </p>

<p> <b>When the smokers start robbing me at gun point, I'll start
to worry . . .</b> </p>

<p> Then you should start to worry the minute cigarettes come
under drug Prohibition. If you had read the major studies of the
issue you would know that tobacco users commit the same kinds of
anti-social behavior as other addicts when they are deprived of
their drug of choice. </p>

<p> <b>I don't think you understand that drug addiction is
physically harmful. _American Academic Encyclopedia_:
&quot;Tolerance develops to most of the effects of these drugs,
which means that the dose must be regularly increased to maintain
a constant effect.&quot; This leads to a gradual physical
deterioration which is generally obvious in long-time junkies.</b>
</p>

<p> The statement by the American Academic Encyclopedia does not
establish any harm to the body other than increased craving. Your
statement is easily proven wrong by the doctors I have talked to
(listed in Signer.zip) who are the world's leading experts on the
subject. </p>

<p> And, of course, I have been asking everyone on this board who
Dr. William Halsted is and how he is relevant to this issue. But,
of course, you don't know such basic facts as that, so there
ain't much point in asking you, is there? </p>

<p> <b>There are only 15,000 - 20,000 hard drug users in the
Netherlands. It's a small country. I have no figures on
mortality. However, I would expect they have a similar proportion
of OD cases to what we have here.</b> </p>

<p> In 1992 they had 28 deaths from heroin overdose in the entire
country. This is all the more remarkable when you consider that
heroin is usually injected and thus bypasses all the bodies
defenses against overdose. </p>

<p> <b>_Contemporary Drug Problems_ is not a &quot;book&quot; but
an academic journal. In this case, the author of the article
&quot;Drugs and crime in an accommodating social context: the
situation in Amsterdam&quot; was written by Martin Grapendaal, Ed
Leuw and Hans Nelen, who are introduced as follows:</b> </p>

<p> <b>. . .</b> </p>

<p> If you would like some more direct information, I can put you
in touch with Michael Hessing (former chief of police of
Rotterdam), Robert Van der Hoeven, the DA, etc., etc., etc. </p>

<p> <b>To accuse someone of lying would be rude, and so
naturally, I have not done so. I merely express a healthy degree
of skepticism as to Cliff's statements. As to his motives, I do
not care to speculate.</b> </p>

<p> Please read Signer.zip in library 13. I met with Friedman and
others on February 23, 1993 at the Hoover Institution and signed
what became known as the Hoover Resolution. I have become
reasonably well known for this, having persuaded such people as
William Von Raab, Dear Abby, and others to support the
Resolution. If you like, I will send you the transcript of the
radio show Hugh Downs did about me. I am fairly well known in
this field so, if you knew anything about it, you would run
across my name eventually. </p>

<p> As to my motives, I have stated them quite clearly on a
number of occasions. My mother cannot get the medicine she needs.
</p>

<p> <b>To begin with, there is no need to lock them all up, and
certainly not to imprison them all simultaneously. If you read
&quot;Narctics Reform,&quot; you understand that I never
advocated locking up *all* heroin users. First-time offenders
should be allowed treatment + probation, provided they have not
committed any other offense. Subsequent drug offenses would be
punished according to an accelerated schedule: Second-time
offenders would be obliged to do some jail time, third-time
offenders would get a longer sentence, and so on. Since the
recidivism rate for drug offenses is only 30%, this would reduce
the number of addicts requiring long-term confinement to a
relative handful.</b> </p>

<p> So, let's try the question again. How many people should be
locked up? Don't give me vague generalities, give me some
numbers. </p>

<p> <b>I have not expressed any opinion, pro or con, as to the
legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. However, eleven
states have already decriminalized simple possession of
marijuana, without any obvious harmful results.</b> </p>

<p> Of course, you are not familiar with how hemp or any of the
other drugs became illegal in the first place, are you? </p>

<p> <b>I believe that the difference between promoting the
legalization of narcotics and the use of narcotics is a very fine
distinction. One leads to the other.</b> </p>

<p> Correct me if I am wrong, but I think we have already
established that you have never read the major research on the
issue and therefore would not be quite qualified to make this
judgment. As it turns out, those who are now recommending
legalization are those who have spent decades trying to limit
drug abuse. </p>

<p> <b>You prefer being robbed at gunpoint? That is a false
economy.</b> </p>

<p> If someone commits a robbery, as my good friend Judge Gray
will tell you, that is an entirely different issue and they
should be brought before a court of law. Until then, however, it
is pointless to try to control private drug use with criminal
law. </p>

<p> <b>With stubborn cases who refuse to reform, that may be the
only alternative. These represent only a small minority, however.</b>
</p>

<p> So you still have not answered the simply question of how
many should go to jail. I bet you never thought about it, did
you? </p>

<p> <b>Child-molesting doesn't *necessarily* involve violence nor
threat of violence. In the case of teen prostitution, it's a
purely commercial arrangement.</b> </p>

<p> It may interest you to know that Joseph Califano, in a report
to the governor of New York in 1980, estimated that 70 percent of
all child molestation and abuse cases are related to alcohol. So
it again brings up the question of why you aren't campaigning for
alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p> <b>Well, er, no. Not quite. Cliff said exactly this --
&quot;Wait! You just convinced me that prison is the right
approach! We ought to start by throwing the known drug addicts
(that's you) into prison &quot;for their own good.&quot; A good
twenty year stretch in the pen will change your mind about how
appealing these drugs are.&quot; </b> </p>

<p> I told you that any time you thought it would be a good idea
for you to spend ten years locked in a small room as some thug's
sexual plaything I would be more than happy to do what you think
is the best thing for you. </p>

<p> <b>I thought he was being sarcastic, and replied &quot;You
also indicated that I should be imprisoned as a drug addict. I
assume you are being sarcastic again. (Which, BTW, is rude.)
Since I have now been sober for 13 years and 15 days, prison is
not called for.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> Oh, but you are still a known risk for addiction aren't you?
How else are we going to protect you from yourself? </p>

<p> Dr. Andrew, </p>

<p> Re the issue of comparative toxicity of drugs, the following
might interest you. Marijuana is not included, of course, because
there are no recorded deaths from marijuana in human history
(source: DEA). Therefore, there would be little point in
reporting the death rate from pot. Because the death rate is
ZERO, there seems to be even less point in jailing people for its
use. </p>

<p> Actually, I think these numbers might be understated with
respect to the number of users of heroin and cocaine. Other
figures I have seen are somewhat higher and, as I mentioned, I
believe the survey method itself promotes underreporting of users
for several reasons. Therefore, it seems quite possible that the
death rates per user for heroin and cocaine may be somewhat lower
than the figures stated below. </p>

<p> With respect to the number of deaths by heroin, you may
recall that the CU Report stated that they could not find any
heroin &quot;overdose&quot; death in which they believed the
medical evidence supported the label of &quot;overdose.&quot;
Oooooops! Sorry! I forgot you haven't read the CU Report! </p>

<p> By the reasoning that you have given before (what little
actual reasoning we have seen) we ought to throw people in jail
for (fill in the blank) because this drug can kill people. By
those standards, the heaviest penalties ought to be for alcohol
and tobacco. </p>

<p> You are, of course, free to present any valid citable
information which would conflict with these figures -- but you
haven't done it yet, so I don't expect you to start now. </p>

<p> (b) Estimates vary greatly, depending upon whether all health
</p>

<p> consequences, or only those traditionally associated with </p>

<p> alcoholism, are considered. The Fifth Special Report to the </p>

<p> U.S. Congress on Alcoholism and Health from the Secretary of </p>

<p> Health and Human Services contains two references indicating </p>

<p> a death toll of 200,000: The report states, first, that
alcohol </p>

<p> &quot;plays a role in 10% of all deaths in the United
States,&quot; </p>

<p> which comes to about 200,000 deaths each year. P. vi. It
further </p>

<p> states that present estimates of the death toll from alcohol </p>

<p> abuse are as high as 93.2 per 100,000. Ibid., p. x. This </p>

<p> ratio translates into a total of about 210,000. </p>

<p> (c) These figures were determined as follows: Drug Abuse
Warning </p>

<p> Network (DAWN) heroin and cocaine fatalities for 1984, 1985, </p>

<p> and 1986 were averaged. The number of suicides was
subtracted. </p>

<p> The figures were discounted to account for deaths in which </p>

<p> both heroin and cocaine played a role. Since DAWN covers </p>

<p> about one-third of the nation's population but almost all </p>

<p> major urban areas where drug use florishes, totals were
doubled </p>

<p> to arrive at yearly estimates of 2,000 for heroin deaths and </p>

<p> 1,000 for cocaine deaths. Finally, these figures were dis- </p>

<p> counted by 80 percent in accordance with the analysis
presented </p>

<p> in the text. </p>

<p> <b>Cliff, I've been practicing medicine for 20+ yrs.</b> </p>

<p> <b>I'm also active in medical politics (currently
president-elect of the medical staff of a major tertiary care
hospital).</b> </p>

<p> <b>We have a rich tradition of communicating and discussing
among ourselves all matters relevant to clinical practice,
economics and ESPECIALLY governmental control.</b> </p>

<p> <b>The communication is accomplished via formal (peer
reviewed) journals as well as by a welter of &quot;popular&quot;
medical periodicals.</b> </p>

<p> As I said before, I will be more than happy to compare your
credentials on this subject against the credentials of the
doctors who made the statements. But let's start with the simple
points first; </p>

<p> The total amount of heroin you have prescribed in your career
is _______? Please fill in the blank. </p>

<p> If you are an average US doctor you have never laid your
hands or eyes on medicinal heroin and certainly have never
prescribed it. Therefore, it would seem obvious that your
knowledge is inferior to the doctors I have talked to who have
actually worked with it. As I also said, I will be happy to put
you in touch with some of them. As I suggested to Forrest
Johnson, you can call them yourself if you like. Try, for
instance, just calling the publich health service in Liverpool
and ask to speak with the doctors in charge of their program. I
would be interested to hear the response you get. </p>

<p> If you were really knowledgeable about the subject (like some
of the doctors I have talked to) you would also be able to tell
me about the supplies of heroin in the US which are legal, how
they got here, and what they are used for. But, of course, you
can't even tell me who Dr. William Halsted is (even though you
CLAIMED to have read the book which describes him in some detail)
so we will not move on to the hard questions. </p>

<p> Why is it that you have such a difficult time answering
simple questions? What is the problem here anyway? </p>

<p> <b>NOWHERE AND AT NO TIME HAVE I RUN ACROSS ANY MENTION OF
DOCTORS JAILED FOR TREATING PATIENTS OR VOICING DISAGREEMENT WITH
ANYTHING.</b> </p>

<p> As I said before, it is becoming increasingly apparent that
you have not read the Consumers Union Report or any of the other
studies I mentioned. If credibility is an issue, yours is fading
fast. Were you telling us all a big story when you said you read
it? </p>

<p> <b>We have one journal (Medical Economics) that searches out,
investigates and reports on ANY &quot;sensational&quot; aspect of
non-clinical MD related activity.</b> </p>

<p> <b>They would go nuts if they thought they were missing a
story such as this.</b> </p>

<p> Again, I say that you have not read the materials you said
you read. It did not happen last week, it happened immediately
after the laws were passed and had the effect of stopping all
drug research and treatment for several decades. (Did you perhaps
miss the part about &quot;several decades&quot;). </p>

<p> But, to go on to more recent matters -- It is also apparent
that you have not read the reports issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services about the undertreatment of pain, and
you are not familiar with the California Medical Association's
recent statements on the issue. Your communication is lacking.
You can get a full copy of the HHS report by calling
1-800-4CANCER. </p>

<p> Also, as I stated previously, Dr. Harvey Rose of Sacramento
was prosecuted for giving Darvon to an 84-year old woman with
crippling arthritis. It almost destroyed his practice. I will put
you in touch with him if you like. As a result of his experience,
he wrote California's Intractable Pain Treatment Act which seeks
to give doctors some protection against this kind of arbitrary
prosecution. </p>

<p> Also, in 1992, the DEA sent two Chicago doctors to prison for
prescribing Tylenol 3. As you may know (assuming you really are a
doctor -- we have had some pretenders here before) Tylenol 3 is
not even a prescription drug except in the US and South Africa,
and the US is the only country in the world which has ever jailed
a doctor for prescribing it. </p>

<p> You may also be interested in the case of Florida vs.
Martinez which appeared on Court TV and has been repeated several
times because it was such an interesting trial. Mr. Martinez is
an AIDS counselor who was handing out morphine to anyone who
would come in and ask for it. Mr. Martinez does not have any kind
of medical training (other than OJT as a AIDS counselor) and
freely admitted that he was violating both state and Federal drug
laws. His only defense was that his actions were a medical
necessity because of the barbaric policies on drugs. The
testimony was quite interesting. When the jury heard all of the
evidence they voted unanimously for acquittal and stated that Mr.
Martinez was a &quot;hero&quot;. </p>

<p> Also, my mother's doctors have stated that the specific
reason that they will not give her morphine (or heroin) is
because they are afraid of prosecution if they do. These doctors
have included the doctors at the Mayo Clinic, the National Pain
Institute, the USC Pain Clinic, etc., etc., etc. As you recall, I
asked you if you would prescribe it for her and got the usual
cop-out. Your credibility is lacking in more than one respect. </p>

<p> <b>Your inflammatory statement demands proof.</b> </p>

<p> <b>As I have said before, your credibility is fatally
jeopardized by these sorts of wildly improbable statements.</b> </p>

<p> The proof demands that you actually read the things you said
you read. Your credibility also hinges on whether you can answer
any of the simple questions I have put to you. For example: Who
was Dr. William Halsted and why is his story relevant to the
things you have said? (He asked for the umpteenth time.) </p>

<p> Frankly, I would think that anyone who had been in medical
practice for more than 20 years would be able to answer these
questions a whole lot easier. Why is it that a practicing
physician cannot answer simple questions on this issue when he
claims to be an expert? </p>

<p> <b>There was an article in my morning newspaper. . . .It
first reported that the heroin hitting the streets today is more
pure, costs less, and is more lethal. Cliff and Mona please note
- lethal means that heroin is not harmless.</b> </p>

<p> A newspaper article with an unsupported statement about drugs
</p>

<p> <b>They also quoted Lee Brown, the country's drug policy
director, as saying that since some of the stigma has been
removed, heroin is now more socially acceptable. It use is
increasing. He also said its use is increasing because you can
now get purer doses for less money. (That is fundamental economic
theory coming out again. Please note, as it gets to be a more
quality product, and the price goes down, its use goes up -
despite the Netherlands.) </b> </p>

<p> Heroin is more socially acceptable? Who does he hang around
with? </p>

<p> If quality is going up and price is going down, then
obviously the drug war is not having its desired effect. This
much seems obvious. </p>

<p> <b>He stated there are now 2.7 million hard-core, chronic
drug users in this country. </b> </p>

<p> That much is correct. How many of them do you want to put in
prison? - Recognizing, of course, that jailing them would require
TRIPLING the size of every prison and jail which now exists in
America. </p>

<p> <b>Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., was quoted ast calling
heroin a vicious drug that tempts its users into a lifetime of a
living hell. (Hmmmmmmm.... they don't, apparently, just stop the
first time they vomit.)</b> </p>

<p> Charles Schumer -- Now there is an informed, intelligent,
reliable, impartial source that you can rely on. (Being sarcastic
here, in case you didn't catch it. This guy is famous for his
ignorance of the subject.) </p>

<p> <b>Thomas Constantine, administrator of the DEA, who came
there from the New York State police, gave a short history on how
the quality and purity of heroin is increasing. Street heroin
purity has gone from 7% a decade ago to an average of 36% now. In
New York and Boston, it reaches 95%.</b> </p>

<p> So he said interdiction was not working. I think we covered
that before. </p>

<p> <b>Opium production has quadrupled in the last decade. </b> </p>

<p> Ten years ago the DEA estimated that only one percent of the
entire world's opium supply would be required to supply the
entire demand in the US. Now I guess it is down to one-fourth of
one percent. </p>

<p> <b>End of article. It appears that heroin is not harmless,
and as its quality goes up and its price goes down, its use goes
up. Lets keep it illegal. </b> </p>

<p> It appears that you have a newspaper article with a bunch of
unsubstantiated statements. Of course, even assuming that heroin
is as dangerous as stated, that still does not establish that
throwing people in prison is the best approach to the problem.
The example of alcohol is instructive in this regard. </p>

<p> So, in conclusion, you have leaped from one unsubstantiated
statement to a conclusion which would be a non-sequitir in any
case. </p>

<p> <b>You frequently take sentences one at a time, and respond,
thereby answering points I am not making. </b> </p>

<p> Yes, because the points you made in those sentences cannot be
substantiated by an evidence I have found. You proceed from wrong
information to wrong conclusions. Let's get the information right
first, and then we might be able to move on to correct
conclusions. </p>

<p> <b>Also, frequently your response is not responsive. If you
say &quot;Heroin is harmless!&quot; and I respond &quot;But
according to your stats, 20,000 people a year die from it!&quot;
it is _not_ appropriate to then say &quot;But putting them in
prisons doesn't work.&quot; Please respond to the thought, or
skip it. It is very hard to maintain a dialog when you jump
around. </b> </p>

<p> Please get it straight what I have said. I did not say that
20,000 people die every year from heroin. (If you can't get this
straight then there is all the more reason to question the other
things you say). </p>

<p> What I said was that the AMA estimated that 20,000 people die
from ALL illegal drugs from ALL causes, including overdose,
accidents, etc. </p>

<p> Simply stating the number of people who die does not provide
any support for the notion that prison is a beneficial approach.
As I have stated previously, far more people die from alcohol and
tobacco which, by your reasoning, would show that prison ought to
be an even better idea for these drugs. In order to show that
prison is a beneficial approach, it must be shown that the number
of deaths would decrease with more people put in prison -- in
some proportion that would provide a real benefit in terms of the
cost. (You know, a simple cost-benefit analysis -- which you have
stated previously you have never even seriously considered.) </p>

<p> <b>Perhaps not. The post was addressed to Mona, not you.
Please pay attention. </b> </p>

<p> You stated that a junkie's right to fry his own brains was
the core of the arguments for (for lack of a better word)
&quot;legalization&quot;. I pointed out that you are wrong. You
can take those arguments away entirely and prison is still not a
good idea. </p>

<p> <b>Okay, you are being cute. Since your true position appears
to be in favor of legalizing drugs, I will attribute that to you,
and simply ignore any more comments like the above. If I am
wrong, state your position on legalization. </b> </p>

<p> We have been over this ground before. My position is that we
should have one consistent philosophy and approach to all
recreational drugs. That would require re-thinking our approach
to not only heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, but alcohol and
tobacco as well. </p>

<p> <b>You cannot have everything both ways, Cliff. If you are
not being sarcastic, then you really do believe that I should be
imprisoned. For twenty years. Because I am an addict. Of course,
that thought is contrary to your beliefs most of the time. So do
you _really_ want me in prison because I am an _uppity_ addict?
The only things your really know about me are that I am an addict
(whom, you believe, should not be imprisoned), and I disagree
with you on this policy (and I should be imprisoned.) </b> </p>

<p> <b>Or, of course, maybe there is some hypocrisy in your
belief system. </b> </p>

<p> You are the first addict I have run across who believes that
spending ten years in a small cell as someone's girlfriend (hope
he doesn't have AIDS) would improve his life. If you really
believe it, I am willing to grant it. I don't see any other way
that we could protect you against all the harmful things you
might do to yourself. </p>

<p> <b>It is a common failure of those who get frustrated in a
discussion to take their opponents view, and change it to
something else, and then oppose that. Please stop doing that. </b>
</p>

<p> That's called setting up a straw man. You might want to take
your own advice here. </p>

<p> <b>I am truly dismayed. If an additonal 200,000 people died
in the first year alone, you would still say that your &quot;no
prison&quot; policy is best. Good grief, Cliff, how many would it
take? I was trying to pick a number high enough so you would say
&quot;If that many more people died, of course I would change my
mind about legalization.&quot; You didn't. That many deaths
wouldn't be enough. Am not sure what I can say. Doesn't make much
sense to keep raising the ante until you do say Enough. </b> </p>

<p> As I said, since I don't agree with the policy you are asking
about in the first place, then it doesn't make much sense to
answer such a question. </p>

<p> And, you seem to have missed the question that I have been
asking of everyone. What evidence do you have to show that this
(or any number of increased deaths) would happen? As I said, all
the evidence I have run across says the opposite -- and I have
named that evidence. Do you have any evidence? (Apparently
nothing besides your own opinion, right?) </p>

<p> <b>Can we at least agree that any policy which denies
medicine to sick people has something seriously wrong with it --
both morally and practically? </b> </p>

<p> <b>I agree wholeheartedly. </b> </p>

<p> See, we do agree on some things. Now let's proceed to the
next point. Why is this happening when everyone I talk to seems
to agree that it is wrong? </p>

<p> <b>Ok, an example. You state it costs an average of $450,000
to imprison someone for drug abuse. Part of that cost, according
to you, is $150,000 for building the cell. This implies that
every drug offender has to have a new cell built for him. All
must be in one man cells, and none of them are reused upon the
release of the drug abuser. This is clearly absurd. You stick by
it. I don't have to provide a stat for what the prorated use of a
cell would cost to see that. It is obvious. When I see you cook
stats like that, I then doubt all of your stats because of a
perceived lack of intellectual integrity. </b> </p>

<p> Those are the costs stated by people such as Thomas Coughlin,
the New York State Commissioner of Corrections. I will believe
him before I believe you, particularly when you have not
presented any evidence to back up your statements. </p>

<p> The cells may indeed be reused on the release of the drug
abuser, but you seem to miss the major point here. It would seem
obvious that we have not put enough of them in prison to stop the
problem. Sending a drug abuser (or better yet, a violent
criminal) out the back door when another drug abuser comes in the
front door does not accomplish anything. Therefore, the prison
population will have to increase significantly before this policy
becomes effective. The question is, at what level of prison
population will this program have a real effect? As you have
stated, you don't have a clue what the answer to that one is, so
it really doesn't matter what numbers I cite. </p>

<p> <b>Cliff, you clearly don't understand what addiction is
like. You don't understand how people become addicts. You don't
seem to be very concerned over messed up lives, or deaths, that
could be caused by legalizing drugs. If messed up lives, and
deaths, are not the issue, than what is? If those are not the
issue, than is it only the money angle? Is it the pride of your
position? What is your motivation? </b> </p>

<p> Aside from the fact that you seem to have missed my position
on this issue: </p>

<p> As I have stated, I have relatives who are addicts, including
one that I grew up with like a brother. As I have stated, while I
deplore their behavior I have to recognize that prison would not
benefit them or society. My objective is to make them whole
again, not to destroy them by turning them into someone's
girlfriend in a small steel room for ten or twenty years. You may
like that and think that is beneficial for you, but I do not
accept that as an appropriate remedy for the people I know. </p>

<p> My motivation is that I would like to </p>

<p> a) change the laws so my mother can get the medicine she
needs. Even you have agreed that denial of medicine is wrong.
(Now you need to understand why it is happening.) </p>

<p> b) develop a policy which helps people instead of destroying
them. </p>

<p> c) Destroy the mythology which surrounds this issue, which
was the original basis for these laws in the first place. It is
increasingly apparent that you do not understand how the laws
came about, and therefore have an incorrect understanding of
where we are today. </p>

<p> <b>You have asked a number of people about imprisoning
30,000,000 drug abusers. I believe that all the serious folks I
know of say they are willing to imprison enough to lower the
suffering rate. I know of no one who believes that would take
30,000,000. Am not sure how many it would take. </b> </p>

<p> That is exactly my point. The people who support this policy
(including you) have never bothered to answer (or even ask) such
basic questions as this. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Don't feel lonesome
here, because I have asked every government official that I have
run across and all I ever get in response is a rather stupid
expression on their face. How good can this policy be if no one
has ever thought about where we are going with it? </p>

<p> <b>If I ever see that the rate of human misery is, overall,
going up because of putting drug abusers in prison, I would look
into overturning at least some of the laws. </b> </p>

<p> Then look again, and do it more closely. </p>

<p> <b>I know you have rejected my descriptions of addiction, and
how addicts act. </b> </p>

<p> Not so. I believe you completely. As I said, that is the
reason that the CU Report and others have said that drug
prohbition will not work -- because the addicts do not respond
rationally and, therefore, the laws don't mean much to them in
terms of deterrence. Obviously, the laws did not deter you. </p>

<p> <b>But please consider what I told Cliff (when he told me he
thought I should be thrown in prison). I was a practicing addict
for 12 years, and those years are now lost forever. If you had
thrown me in prison, for the typical sentence for a first time
possessor, I _might_ have been so rattled that I would have
sought help, and stopped. If you had done that in year two of the
twelve, you would have given me ten years of life back. Mona, I
really would like those years back. Prison would have been very,
very worth it. </b> </p>

<p> I have no doubt that you would like those years back. We
tried everything we could with law enforcement to give them to
you and our efforts did not succeed. That's why I think we should
have thought about it a little better and developed a plan which
might have helped you more than this one did. As far as I can
see, the only thing this policy did for you was to make treatment
less available because all the money is being spent on prisons. </p>

<p> Yes, we might have given you ten years of life back (assuming
you would respond to jail when you admit that the thought of your
own death did not deter you). You would have spent that ten years
locked in a small steel and concrete room playing the role of
someone's girlfriend. I don't know your personal sexual tastes
but, for the addicts I have known, I would not consider that as
an acceptable remedy to their problem. Most of the ones I have
seen who went through something like that wound up considerably
more screwed up than when they went in. <br>

<h2>Presentations to Social Clubs </h2>

<p> <b>How to make presentations to social groups such as
churches, Lions Clubs, Rotary, and other similar groups.</b> </p>

<p> <b>By Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h3>How to find them. </h3>

<p> Many of them will be listed in your local phone directories.
If no chapters of a particular group are listed in your area, it
doesn't necessarily mean they don't exist. You can also look in
the Encyclopedia of Associations, at your local library, to
contact their national headquarters and ask for any chapters in
your area. </p>

<h3>What kind of groups typically have meetings where people can
make presentations? </h3>

<p> Here are just a few examples: </p>

<p> Lions, Rotary, Elks, Moose, churches, synagogues, Chambers of
Commerce, Business groups, other social clubs, political parties,
etc. Any place where more than a few people gather for nearly any
purpose may be an opportunity to make a presentation. </p>

<h3>How to get a date to speak to their group. </h3>

<p> First, put together a coherent, sensible presentation of
material pertinent to your area of interest. It is best to
present factual, interesting material, rather than political
diatribe. Visual displays and graphics are always good to help
keep the audience's interest. </p>

<p> Second, call them. You will be surprised at the number of
social groups which are looking for, or receptive to, speakers.
Calling them is the toughest part for many people, but it is
really easy. The worst that can happen is that they will say no,
and you have heard that before. </p>

<h3>What is interesting to these groups? </h3>

<p> Many of these groups want speakers for their regular
luncheons.all the time for their lunch and, therefore they cover
a wide variety of topics over the year. You will often find a
situation where there is someone who is designated to find good
speakers for the meetings who invariably has a hard time finding
enough interesting speakers to fill the bill. Therefore, in many
cases, there is a wide degree of latitude in what these groups
would like to hear. The facts about hemp are usually interesting
to these groups, but there are any number of other subjects which
would also get a good reception with a good presentation. </p>

<h3>Dress and act conservatively. </h3>

<p> The people in these groups are business people for the most
part, and will expect and appreciate a business like demeanor and
approach. Whether you like it or not, they are most likely to
respond favorably to conservatively dressed and
&quot;normal&quot; looking and acting people, as opposed to the
&quot;hippy&quot; look. </p>

<h3>Use Visual Aids </h3>

<p> Charts, graphs, pictures, and other visual aids can be very
helpful in getting your point across. There are a number of
charts and graphs on these pages as samples of things you might
use. </p>

<h3>Read the Persuasive Strategies and Debate Materials </h3>

<p> These social groups tend to be politically and socially
conservative so wild-eyed arguments about how it is everyone's
right to get loaded will not get a good reception. The best
approach is a soft, factual approach which presents some part of
the vast amount of information which most people don't know about
drugs. Don't promote or even defend the use of drugs, drug
dealers, or anything else that your audience will find hard to
accept. You will often have a long way to go to convince them, so
don't try to bring them too far, too fast. </p>

<h3>But I am afraid to make presentations to groups. </h3>

<p> What are you afraid of? That you will look like a fool? (As
if that hasn't happened before.) Seriously, speaking in front of
a group is one of the items which produces the highest levels of
fear in many people. They realize everyone is looking at them and
they get nervous and freeze up. The more nervous they get, the
more they worry about it, and the more nervous they get. </p>

<p> Forget it. If you are afraid of embarrassing yourself and
looking like a fool, don't worry. In the first place, most people
don't have to stand up in front of a group to look like fools, so
looking like a fool is nothing new. Get over it. Everyone looks
like a fool now and then. The truth is that most members of most
audiences are so awestruck by anyone who can get up in front of
an audience and speak (because they know they couldn't do it
themselves) that they will never notice that you are nervous - at
least not to the degree that you feel nervous. </p>

<p> Experience will get you over it. The first presentation is
the roughest, and from that point it gets progressively easier.
By this time I have done so many, and encountered all the
questions that come up so many times, that I could do these
things in my sleep. There are a lot of other people who are also
quite adept at presentations and they started out as shy
wallflowers just like you. Give it a try. You will find it is a
lot of fun. <br>

<h1>The Washington Hemp Education Network </h1>

<p> <strong>Operating Abstract</strong> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p> The following text defines the structure and mission of a
non-profit educational organization known as the Washington Hemp
Education Network (W.H.E.N.). This organization consists of
volunteer members. </p>

<h2>Mission Statement </h2>

<p> The mission of the Washington Hemp Education Network
(W.H.E.N.) is to empower the people of Washington State, through
educational activities about the history, status, and uses (both
current and potential) of the Hemp plant (cannabis sativa, also
known as marijuana), to make informed choices about the issues
surrounding re-legalization of Hemp in Washington State. </p>

<h2>Recognition of Benefit </h2>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network recognizes as
beneficial all responsible commercial, medicinal, and spiritual
uses of the Hemp plant conducted for peaceful ends. </p>

<h2>Program and Goals </h2>

<p> To achieve the stated mission, the Washington Hemp Education
Network will plan and implement legal, nonviolent projects that: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Raise public awareness of the history and beneficial uses
        of the Hemp plant; </li>
    <li>Educate the public to recognize and reject misinformation
        about Hemp; </li>
    <li>Facilitate changes in current laws to allow the people of
        Washington State to grow Hemp openly and engage in normal
        market activities with Hemp products; </li>
    <li>Through education and coalition, help to empower people
        who have been disempowered by misguided government
        policies concerning Hemp; </li>
    <li>Promote research and development of sustainable,
        environmentally responsible Hemp cultivation, and of
        beneficial products derived from Hemp. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Criteria </h3>

<p> All projects planned and implemented by the Washington Hemp
Education Network will be consistent with the Mission,
Recognition of Benefit, and Program and Goals statements defined
herein. </p>

<h3>Endorsement and Support </h3>

<p> The Washington Hemp Education Network will endorse and
support only those projects undertaken by individuals or other
entities that are consistent with the Mission, Recognition of
Benefit, and Program and Goals. </p>

<h2>Method of Operation </h2>

<p> This organization will meet regularly and will operate on the
principle of consensus. As defined by the Center for Conflict
Resolution, Madison, WI, consensus is &quot;a decision-making
process in which all parties involved explicitly agree to the
final decision. </p>

<p> Consensus decision making does not mean that all parties are
completely satisfied with the final outcome, but that the
decision is acceptable to all because no one feels that his or
her vital interests or values are violated by it.&quot; </p>

<p> A board of directors will not be elected; rather, the
founding charter members will constitute the decision-making
body, will serve as the projects and issues forum facilitation
group, and will exercise no power other than that of presiding
over meetings as defined by the Method of Operation, and of
approving membership applications and filling vacancies in the
charter member group when a charter member leaves the group. </p>

<p> Other future members may be added to the decision-making body
of charter members if a consensus decision for such action is
made by the charter members. Members other than charter members
are encouraged to participate in discussions on issues that are
being addressed during the decision-making process; participation
in the final consensus </p>

<p> decision is limited to charter members. </p>

<h3>Consensus Procedures </h3>

<ul>
    <li>o For each meeting, the charter members will appoint a
        rotating clerk, who will convene the meeting and govern
        the discussions during the meeting. The clerk is
        responsible for compiling and disseminating the agenda
        and supporting materials at least four days prior to the
        meeting. </li>
    <li>o If one or more members feel that a decision must be
        reached, the clerk must clearly state the issue to be
        decided and allow each member to speak uninterrupted
        about the issue. After each member speaks once about the
        issue, it can be debated if necessary by the group;
        however, members must not interrupt other speakers and
        must wait until granted the floor by the clerk before
        speaking. </li>
    <li>o Members must listen attentively and strive to
        understand each point of view, knowing that through the
        consensus process each decision must ultimately be a
        compromise of all points of view. </li>
    <li>o The clerk will develop a decision statement as the
        debate proceeds. The clerk will then document the
        evolution of the debate and will modify the position of
        the group by incorporating each point of view into the
        decision statement. </li>
    <li>o When all points of view have been made known, and the
        decision statement has reached a static state, the clerk
        will call for consensus on the statement. Three possible
        positions may be taken by the charter members: Consent,
        Object, or Stand Aside: </li>
    <li>o Consent indicates the member agrees to support the
        decision as the best compromise that can be achieved by
        the group. </li>
    <li>o Object indicates the member will not allow consensus to
        occur; if ONE member objects, the decision is discarded
        and no action is taken on the issue by the organization
        at that time. </li>
    <li>o Stand Aside indicates the member cannot agree with the
        decision but will not prevent the decision from being
        adopted </li>
    <li>by the group; the decision stands as long as no one
        indicates </li>
</ul>

<h2>Object. </h2>

<p> These procedures should suffice for most issues facing the
charter members of W.H.E.N. If a situation should arise that
cannot be resolved by the above procedures, the clerk will
reference the consensus handbook published by the Center for
Conflict Resolution. Charter members who are absent from
announced meetings are by default relinquishing their consensus
vote for the affected meetings only. </p>

<h1>How To Reduce Junk E-Mail </h1>

<p> From: Ryan Rossman &lt;rossm_ry@catseq.catlin.edu&gt; </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>The 3 keys to reducing &quot;junk&quot; email. </h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Accurate Subject headings.</b> </li>
    <li><b>If you send it to the whole list, make sure it applies
        to the whole list.</b> </li>
    <li><b>Be substantial, ask yourself am I contributing to the
        list or detracting?</b> </li>
</ol>

<h3>Subject Lines: </h3>

<p> One way to make it easier to get to the meaty information you
want is to have *accurate* subject lines. If the subject line of
your post says Re: Proposed Strategies and you are talking about
something completely different, or are branching off from this
discussion create a new subject heading. Example: </p>

<p> Instead of just Re: Proposed Strategies which doesn't really
tell anyone what the content of the message is about. Try... </p>

<p> Discussion of CD Tactics (was Re: Proposed Strategies) </p>

<p> This is very helpful, in discovering and only reading the
posts you want to read. </p>

<h3>Personal Posts: </h3>

<p> Short, one or two line posts that only make a personal
statement torwards one or two people should be done in private.
The main goal is to respect other members of the group enough so
as to not post something that they are just going to have delete.
</p>

<p> There are two ways to avoid problems with being personal. </p>

<ol>
    <li>If all you really want to do is make a short 1 or 2 line
        personal rseponse to someone don't send it to the entire
        list just send it to that person. </li>
    <li>If you are making personal comments make sure that there
        is also something substantial that is pertinent to
        everyone included in the post. </li>
</ol>

<p> Basically if it doesn't have something that applies to the
whole list, don't post it to the whole list. </p>

<p> Please don't hestiate to be controversial or disagree with
others, this is called freedom of speech and its why a revolution
was waged, but do NOT use drctalk-l for excessive personal
banter. If it has substance </p>

<p> with a little banter, I don't think we have a problem.
Meaning that you can say nice &quot;Amens!&quot; and &quot;Way to
go!&quot; **IF** you also include something a little bit more
meaningful. If there is no substance and a lot of banter you
probably shouldn't have sent it to the whole list. This includes
the 1 or 2 line personal notes. </p>

<p> If we still have a problem with &quot;junk&quot; posts and
the traffic volume is still too high there are more stringent
measures that can be imposed. <br>

<title>How to Write Letters to the Editor</title>

<h1>How to Write Letters to the Editor</h1>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> <br>
</h2>

<p> A personal note by Cliff Schaffer: </p>

<p> Over the years, I have written a lot of letters to the editor
and about three out of four of them get published. A lot of
people have asked me what are the good techniques for writing
letters to the editor. The first thing I tell people is to
remember that they fit about ten letters in a typical editorial
section (out of the hundreds they receive) so the ones they
publish either: </p>

<p> 1) Are the best single expressions of what many people said. </p>

<p> 2) Make some point exceedingly well. </p>

<p> 3) Are signed by some prominent person. </p>

<p> In all cases, the letters are usually short and to the point,
and the editors have edited them even further to make them
shorter. Most people who write letters to the editor would
probably like the satisfaction you get when you see your letter
published. That way, at least you are certain that they read it.
However, it is also apparent that the media can be influenced by
letters they do not acknowledge. We have found many times that a
simple letter to someone in the media wound up in major media
coverage weeks or months later. </p>

<p> I was going to write up a formal set of rules for how to
write letters to the editor, but I found someone who had done it
already. He did quite a good job in saying the same essential
things I would have said. </p>

<p> =================================== </p>

<p> How to Write Letters to the Editor by Richard Rider </p>

<p> Short, concise letters are always more likely to be published
than long, meandering ones; try to keep them under 150 words. The
longer letters are also more likely to be edited. It's better
that you do your own editing. </p>

<p> Ever notice how you read letters to the editor in the paper?
Most people read the shorter letters first and then perhaps later
read the longer ones. Thus your shorter letter has a better
chance of being read. </p>

<p> WHAT TO WRITE? Unlike single-issue or special-interest
groups, libertarians can select from an enormous range of
subjects. Replying to editorials, agree or disagree, is very
effective. </p>

<p> Every day the news offers us all too many topics on which to
comment. </p>

<p> Be timely; try to respond within two or three days of the
article's publication. Pick an issue of particular importance to
you - don't be afraid to let some passion show through. </p>

<p> Here are some stylistic considerations: </p>

<p> 1. State the argument you're rebutting or responding to, as
briefly as possible, in the letter's introduction. Don't do a
lengthy rehash; it's a waste of valuable space and boring to
boot. </p>

<p> 2. Stick to a single subject. Deal with one issue per letter.
</p>

<p> 3. Don't be shrill or abusive. Editors tend to discard
letters containing personal attacks. Even though you're dying to
call Jesse Jackson a preachy parasite, stifle the urge. </p>

<p> 4. Your letter should be logically organized. First a brief
recitation of the argument you are opposing, followed by a
statement of your own position. Then present your evidence. Close
with a short restatement of your position or a pithy comment </p>

<p> (&quot;Jimmy Breslin says possession of firearms should be
limited to law enforcement officers. I say when only the police
have guns, the police state is just around the corner.&quot;). </p>

<p> 5. Use facts, figures and expert testimony whenever possible.
This raises your letters above the &quot;sez you, sez me&quot;
category. For instance: &quot;Anthony Lewis calls for taxing the
rich as a way to balance the budget. Is he aware of the fact that
if we confiscated the entire income of the top wage earners in
this country (those with income above $200,000), this would run
the federal government for exactly 8 days?&quot; </p>

<p> Readers respect the opinions of people with special knowledge
or expertise. Use expert testimony to bolster your case
(&quot;George Will claims we need to draft to defend America. But
General Edward C. Meyer, Army Chief of Staff, recently stated . .
.&quot;). </p>

<p> 6. Proofread your letter carefully for errors in spelling,
punctuation and grammar. Newspapers will usually edit to correct
these mistakes, but your piece is more likely to be published if
it is &quot;clean&quot; to begin with. Read your letter to a
friend, for objective input. </p>

<p> One suggestion is that a letter shouldn't be mailed the same
day it is written. Write, proofread and edit the piece. Then put
it aside until the next day. Rereading your letter in a fresh
light often helps you to spot errors in reasoning, stilted
language and the like. On the other hand, don't let the letter
sit too long and lose it's timeliness. </p>

<p> 7. Try to view the letter from the reader's perspective. Will
the arguments make sense to someone without a special background
on this issue. Did you use technical terms not familiar to the
average reader? </p>

<ol>
    <li>Should your letter be typed? In this day and age,
        generally yes. Double or triple space the letter if it is
        short. For faxing purposes, we appreciate it if the
        letter is all on one page, so single spacing might be the
        only option available. </li>
    <li>Direct your missives to &quot;Letters to the
        Editor,&quot; or some similar sounding title. </li>
</ol>

<p> 10. Always include your name, address, day-time phone number
and signature. The papers will not publish this information, but
they may use it to verify that you wrote the letter. If we are
fax broadcasting your letter, do not put a date on it. We may
have to wait a day or two before broadcasting it out, depending
on how many letters are waiting for dissemination. </p>

<p> 11. Most important - WRITE! Do not try to do a perfect
letter. Just give it a good effort and send it off. Letter
writing is the one thing that any one of us can do on our own
without the need to work through a group. No committees are
necessary. Just do it! </p>

<p> Don't be discouraged if your letter isn't published. The
editor may have received more responses on that issue than he
feels he can handle. </p>

<p> If we are faxing your letter, you will almost certainly be
published somewhere. The only drawback is that we do not have a
good feedback system, so you may not know which of the papers
publish your letter, particularly the smaller ones. </p>

<h1>A Summary of M.K. Gandhi's Technique for Political Action </h1>

<p> <b>By Mary Sibley</b> </p>

<p> February 1995 </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>PREFACE </h2>

<p> I have prepared this description of the political action
technique of M.K. Gandhi at the request of Dave Hall for
distribution to the DrugReform Coordination Network (DRCNet) and
other drug policy reform advocates who may have an interest in
Gandhi's technique. I have read much about Gandhi's technique and
know that I still do not fully comprehend its application and
implications. My knowledge is especially scanty in the area of
organizational structures through which Gandhian campaigns were
conducted, although I surmise that Gandhi's campaign
organizations were highly structured. I am currently seeking
texts describing and analyzing Gandhi's organizational
structures. If anyone has such a text, I would appreciate access
to it. If anyone has studied Gandhi's life and work and reads
something within this that seems to be wrong, misleading, or a
misinterpretation, I would welcome suggestions. In addition, I
would be glad to participate in further discussion. </p>

<h2>CREDITS </h2>

<p> For assistance in organizing my thoughts, I give credit to
Joan V. Bondurant, whose book &quot;Conquest of Violence: The
Gandhian Philosophy of Conflict&quot; (second edition, 1965,
Princeton University Press) I consulted occasionally while
writing this. In the text that follows, annotations are sparse.
If anyone is interested in reading more about a particular topic,
let me know and I will provide references. INTRODUCTION </p>

<h2>How this Discussion Is Organized </h2>

<p> This discussion is organized into three sections. The first
section discusses the cultural context and other conditions under
which Gandhi conceived and conducted political campaigns. The
second section discusses the fundamental principles of a Gandhian
campaign. The last section discusses the steps in a Gandhian
campaign and includes my opinions about the similarities between
these steps and steps that have been taken by drug policy reform
advocates. A Short Definition of Gandhi's Political Technique
Gandhi's political technique is a process of creatively engaging
with others to transform an unjust cultural, economic, social, or
governmental system into one that is more just. Scope of Gandhi's
Technique Gandhi is most famous for his political activism with
respect to ending British rule in India. He used the technique
not just to work toward reform and ultimately removal of British
rule in India, but also in many conflict situations between
Indians only. For example, he organized and led programs designed
to change how the upper class Hindus treated the lower class
Hindus. Gandhi himself considered his most important work the
constructive programs designed to remove the underlying causes of
poverty and to rebuild strong local economies in impoverished
areas. Without this work, poor Indians would not have had the
sustenance needed to participate in the many campaigns that led
to home rule. Martin Luther King applied techniques similar to
Gandhi's in the United States when working to end civil rights
injustices based on race. Many of King's programs, speeches, and
writings strongly resemble Gandhi's, with terminology and other
specifics tailored to the issues and systems at hand. Another
20th century leader who has successfully used similar techniques
when engaging a cruel and conscience-less government is Vaclav
Havel. The injustices that these leaders were working to overcome
occurred in widely varying cultures, social systems, and
governments. Because I assume that most readers are specifically
interested in political strategies with regard to changing unjust
laws in the U.S., the following discussion focuses on the
application of Gandhi's techniques in conflicts with governments.

<h2>SECTION 1. CONTEXT AND CONDITIONS </h2>

<h3>The Cultural Context in which Gandhi Developed His Techniques
</h3>

<p> India is multi-cultural with most cultures based on
religions. The Hindus are the largest group, followed by the
Muslims, who constitute a large minority. Then come a much
smaller number of Sikhs. Many other religious groups exist, but
they are very small in numbers. People of these religions had
lived side-by-side in relative peace for thousands of years when
the British arrived. As the British became established
economically, they started an insidious campaign to divide the
Indian people along religious lines, especially by planting in
Muslims fear of discrimination from Hindus should the British not
keep the Hindu influence in check. The British were quite
successful in promoting disunity between the Hindus and Muslims,
a legacy that to this day engenders hatred and bloodshed. The
Sikhs were selected to be the native component of the
British-controlled police force. The Sikhs were a large enough
minority to provide enough police for British purposes, and yet a
small enough group that Sikh police were patrolling and
incarcerating primarily Hindus and Muslims. After a couple of
hundred years of British encroachment on the cultures,
inter-cultural fear and suspicion that had not existed before the
British became the norm. </p>

<h3>Gandhi's Starting Place in Society </h3>

<p> Gandhi was born a Hindu. The Hindu society is stratified
(some say &quot;calcified&quot;) into classes referred to as
castes. The caste into which one is born determines the jobs one
may have, the education one may pursue, the privileges one is
allowed, the places one may gather water, the people with whom
one may eat, etc. The highest caste is the Brahmans; the lowest,
the untouchables. Outside of these are the outcastes. The
outcastes are those who violated the rules of their caste to the
extent that the authorities within the caste cast them out.
Thereafter, they are to be shunned by others in the caste--no one
may help them, they are not allowed to work within the caste,
etc. Gandhi was a member of the Bania caste, which participated
in business and government in his home state. Gandhi was publicly
ordered an outcaste when he was in his late teens because he went
to Britain to study law; his caste's leaders said it was against
the religion to leave the country. The leaders actually went so
far as to inform the caste members that if they saw him off when
he left for England, they would be fined! Gandhi wrote in his
autobiography, &quot;The order had no effect on me, and I took my
leave . . .&quot; ( M.K. Gandhi, &quot;An Autobiography: The
Story of My Experiments with the Truth,&quot; Part I, Chapter
XII, [1927] translation by Mahadev Desai, published in the U.S.
in 1957 by Beacon Press, Boston). </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>SECTION 2. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES </h2>

<p> Gandhi adhered to four fundamental principles familiar to the
Westerner. Three are truth, non-violence, and self-suffering. The
fourth is concerned with means and ends. All campaigns conducted
under his guidance were consistent with these principles
(occasional errors arose due to the experimental nature of the
technique and limitations in campaigners' previous experience).
These fundamental principles are summarized below. </p>

<h3>Truth </h3>

<p> Gandhi did not fully define the &quot;truth&quot; but instead
said that he was seeking after it. He was seeking after it
through socio-political action, just as others might seek after
it through a mystical or spiritual path, the study of
mathematics, or the creation of art. I gather from my readings
that the goals of most his contemporaries were much more
immediate and concrete (like a cost-of-living increase for
workers in a textile mill, the right for untouchables to walk
past a temple used by Brahmans, the replacement of British rule
with home rule, etc.). The replacement of British rule was a
mighty goal. Those who held it accepted the need for a large
number of intermediate goals that they collectively agreed (often
after long and arduous debate) would contribute directly or
indirectly to achievement of the mighty goal. Some of the
intermediate goals included things that even the most uneducated,
illiterate, and impoverished could grasp immediately, like: (1)
Having all Indians weave their own cloth rather than buy British
cloth (most Indians made their own clothing) and (2) Repealing a
salt taxation and regulation scheme that drove the cost of salt
so high that the poor could not afford it. Salt is an essential
dietary element in India's climate and can be collected from
India's ocean beaches or retrieved from inland deposits by anyone
after a bit of instruction. The salt laws brought the British
significant revenues. Enforcement of the salt laws included fines
and incarceration for those who were caught making or collecting
salt for personal use and most especially if the person was
producing and distributing marketable amounts outside of the
government's regulatory structure. </p>

<h3>Non-Violence </h3>

<p> Gandhi maintained that no human or group of humans could know
the complete truth. No matter how close one thinks one might be
to the truth, one could be in error either wholly or in some
lesser way that is not immediately apparent. Because of this, he
maintained that no one could use violence toward others to press
his or her view of the truth forward. This principle excluded all
acts of violence, and Gandhi's definition of violence was broad.
As one might expect, physical violence could not be used against
an opponent. He also maintained that there should be no violence
in one's expression and words. The non-violence principle
required that an opponent be treated with utmost respect. Smear
campaigns aimed at defamation of character were not in his
political action toolbox, just as murder of lawmakers, judges,
bureaucrats, and police were not in his toolbox. Gandhi's
non-violence is a full antonym for violence. Not only does
non-violence refrain from destructive acts, it is aggressively
and provocatively constructive. Thus, Gandhi's campaigns did not
seek to defeat an opponent, but instead to convert the opponent
to a more just position and to challenge the opponent to act upon
the new position. In addition, Gandhi held that there must be an
opportunity for an opponent to save face, so long as no
fundamental principle or aim of the action was thereby
compromised. </p>

<h3>Self-Suffering </h3>

<p> Self-suffering is an integral element of Gandhi's technique
and a necessary corollary to provocative non-violent action.
Self-suffering can take the form of material and social
sacrifice. For example, loss of employment, property, or income
as a result of holding to one's view of the truth is a form of
self-suffering. Self-suffering reaches its personal extremes in
incarceration, physical injury, and the sacrifice of one's life.
Gandhi wrote: &quot;Suffering injury in one's own person is . . .
of the essence of non-violence and is the chosen substitute for
violence to others.&quot; (M.K. Gandhi, &quot;Non-violence in
Peace and War,&quot; 2nd edition, Ahmedabad: Navajivan, 1944, p.
49). He also wrote, &quot;Non-violence in its dynamic condition
means conscious suffering. It does not mean meek submission to
the will of the evil-doer, but it means the pitting of one's
whole soul against the will of the tyrant.&quot; (M.K. Gandhi, in
&quot;Young India,&quot; August 11, 1920 ). Self-suffering is
preferred over submitting to humiliation and pr ovides a way to
preserve one's personal dignity in the face of those who would
treat one unjustly. Throughout his writings and campaigns, Gandhi
emphasized that inviting self-suffering is something that must
not be done lightly. One who invites self-suffering must be
prepared for the fullest possible sacrifice that may result from
one's actions. </p>

<h3>Means and Ends </h3>

<p> Gandhi believed that means do not serve ends, rather means
create ends. Thus, to attain an end that is positive and
truthful, one must use means that are positive and truthful. This
philosophy can be summarized by his statement, &quot;the means
are the ends in the making.&quot; Means that create ends have two
interesting implications. First, one cannot define a just,
non-violent end and then use unjust and violent means to attain
it--for the end will be in character with the means used. This
view precludes taking actions under the philosophy summarized in
the statement &quot;the ends justify the means&quot;--a
philosophy that seems to permeate current U.S. policy-making.
Indeed, the &quot;ends&quot; being created by current government
policy with regard to some drugs are very different than the
officially stated goals. </p>

<p> A second implication is that, while one must always be moving
toward a goal of pure truth and justice, the end cannot be
defined precisely in advance. Each action one takes creates the
next action and that one, the next, each action always in keeping
with the last and moving progressively closer to truth and
justice. Through actively engaging with fellow activists and the
opponent, one grows in understanding of what must be done, a step
at a time, to create the most just and truthful end. </p>

<p> The technique becomes dynamic when it succeeds in provoking
internal change in the opponent. Thus the knowledge and
understanding of both the activist and the opponent grow
simultaneously toward truth and justice. However, the technique
is not self-propelling; it is usually used in a context of a
stagnant, inert, or deliberately destructive force and requires
tremendous energy. The activist must constantly reassess the
opponent's comprehension and adjust the program so that it is
more than reactive to the opponent's change--every change must be
viewed as an opportunity to press the campaign further forward. </p>

<h3>What Gandhi's Contemporaries Thought About the Fundamental
Principles </h3>

<p> A few of Gandhi's contemporaries adhered to the fundamental
principles as inviolable guides by which to conduct one's
personal life as well as one's social or political actions.
However, the majority of his contemporaries accepted the
fundamental principles as policies. They recognized the success
of the principles in empowering the disempowered and realized
that, even if viewed as policies, the principles were the key to
winning &quot;home rule&quot; with an unarmed and impoverished
army of the disenfranchised. </p>

<p> This acceptance as policy rather than principle caused Gandhi
some dismay. When the activists with whom he was working rejected
these even as policy, he would leave the political sphere and
return to his constructive work toward remedying the devastating
economic problems in the villages of India. Eventually, his
contemporaries always asked him to return to the political
sphere. </p>

<h2>SECTION 3. STEPS OF A GANDHIAN CAMPAIGN </h2>

<h3>The Progress of a Campaign </h3>

<p> Upon discovering an opportunity for reform or change, a
campaign is conducted through several steps. Each step is a
necessary prerequisite to the next, for each must fully develop
the context in which the next occurs. The early steps develop the
public stage upon which later steps, if they become necessary,
can be played out. Some of the steps initiated early in the
campaign, especially education, continue throughout the campaign.
The progression is designed to maximize early in the campaign all
opportunities for the opponent to make positive changes and save
face without campaigners moving to more provocative measures. The
careful progression provides fullest opportunity for the
campaigners to adjust their position if they discover that they
have inadvertently violated a fundamental principle. It gives
campaign leaders the opportunity, through engaging with the
opponent early in relatively low-risk situations, to
realistically assess their own strengths and weaknesses and those
of the campaigners and to determine what more provocative steps
can and cannot be taken successfully. </p>

<p> A Summary of the Steps of a Gandhian Campaign </p>

<p> The steps of a campaign are: </p>

<p> -- Investigation of the facts, situation, and conditions </p>

<p> -- Education of the campaigners, the public, and the opponent
</p>

<p> -- Negotiation and arbitration </p>

<p> -- Preparation of the campaigners for more provocative
measures </p>

<p> -- Agitation </p>

<p> -- Issuing of an ultimatum </p>

<p> -- Economic boycott and forms of strike </p>

<p> -- Non-cooperation </p>

<p> -- Civil disobedience </p>

<p> -- Creation of alternate structures </p>

<p> In India, these steps eventually led to the establishment of
a parallel government in some places, which provided Indians with
some of the experience needed to assume self-government when
British rule was removed. </p>

<p> The steps of a campaign are described in the paragraphs
below. In brackets I have mentioned my current opinion of where
drug policy reform advocates have made the most progress.
Investigation of the Facts, Situation, and Conditions A Gandhian
campaign is founded on an objective assessment of the facts. All
facts are considered; none are rejected or downplayed if they do
not fit the expectations of the campaigners--to do so would be to
move away from the complete truth. The situation of campaigners
and those experiencing the injustice are examined. As full an
understanding of the situation as possible is developed among all
involved. The conditions at the time--public awareness and
opinion, the situation of the opponent, and other relevant
factors are all considered and weighed. </p>

<p> [Drug policy reform advocates seem to me to be strongest
here. The only difficulty I've seen is the occasional attempt to
reject or downplay a pertinent fact that doesn't quite
&quot;fit,&quot; but this is usually remedied through discussion
among reform advocates.] </p>

<h3>Education of the Campaigners, the Public, and the Opponent </h3>

<p> With the facts in hand and the situation and conditions fully
examined, education begins. All who join the campaign must be
educated; they become representatives through their association
and must be fully informed. The public is often unaware of or
misinformed about injustices; they must be educated to understand
why change is needed. Many opponents are similar to the
public--they are unaware or misinformed. Gandhi felt that there
were only a few pponents who would actually want injustices to be
perpetuated or continue. Gandhi was an optimist and believed even
those few could be converted. [Drug policy reform advocates are
weak here, but getting stronger. At the International Conference
for Drug Policy Reform last November, attendees recognized the
need to raise public awareness about injustices of the drug war.
I understand that organizations like NORML are following up with
activities geared toward education of the general public. The
Washington Hemp Education Network (W.H.E.N.) was started by a
group of marijuana policy reform activists in Washington State
who recognized the need for education. My personal experience has
been that many of the people who join W.H.E.N. recognize the
injustices and are looking for the facts. Others join because
they have much knowledge and want opportunities to educate and
persuade others. Some relish entering the opponents' sphere and
educating! Also, Cliff Schaffer's persuasive strategies provide
an excellent example of guidelines that have been tailored to
move the opponent toward the truth given an opponent's entry
position in a discussion. Such guidelines must be assessed and
modified periodically to ensure that they keep pace with the
inevitable progress the opponents will make when so persuaded.] </p>

<h3>Negotiation and Arbitration </h3>

<p> Remedy for the injustice is sought first through established
channels within the existing system. Petitioning for change of
unjust laws, challenging unjust laws in the courts, and other
legislative or legal methods fall under this step. </p>

<p> [Drug policy reform advocates working on reform of marijuana
laws have done plenty of negotiation and arbitration at the
federal level and in many states. I am not aware of as high of a
level of negotiation effort for substances like heroin, cocaine,
etc.] </p>

<h3>Preparation of the Campaigners for More Provocative Measures </h3>

<p> Immediately upon recognizing the existence of a conflict
situation that might lead to more provocative measures, Gandhi's
technique calls for intense preparation. The motives of
campaigners are examined, weaknesses of the group are identified,
and exercises in self-discipline undertaken. The goal of this
step is to assess and develop the campaigners' ability to adhere
to fundamental principles and to continue action in the face of
significant risks. There is much discussion of the issues at
hand, the current situation and conditions, and of the potential
results of various courses of action. [I have not heard of drug
policy reform advocates undertaking such self-examination and
participating in mutually agreed upon exercises in
self-discipline. I have heard discussions and analyses about
potential actions that fall under subsequent steps.] </p>

<h3>Agitation </h3>

<p> Agitation includes legal high-profile activities such as
rallies and picketing. Such events are opportunities for the
leaders to assess the group's readiness to proceed with higher
profile and more difficult steps without deteriorating into
violence. Mass gatherings also provide an opportunity to begin
instructing campaigners who have not been trained previously in
the fundamental principles, to communicate developments in the
campaign, and to explain the next step. </p>

<p> [I haven't heard much about this kind of agitation. Agitation
I have heard about has involved small numbers of people and, as
far as I know, it has not been part of a sequence of steps such
as described here. I do not believe that Hemp Fests, even if no
one smoked, would meet the criteria by which Gandhi defined
agitation because they are not part of a highly focused political
campaign and do not have a strong educational focus.] </p>

<h3>Issuing of an Ultimatum </h3>

<p> A strong appeal is made to the opponent. The appeal is quite
explicit. It states the problem, identifies a constructive
solution and the responsibilities of each party in the solution,
and explains what the campaigners will do if the opponent does
not participate in the solution. The ultimatum should include
provision for the opponent to save face within the scope of the
fundamental principles. The opponent is fully informed about the
next step. In fact, from this step forward, every single step
taken is preceded by a full advance disclosure to the opponent of
what will be done, when, and where. Before each step commences,
the opponent is offered the opportunity to change. </p>

<p> [If drug policy reform advocates started a Gandhian campaign
today, I believe that they would be years from being able to
issue ultimatums that actually carried any weight.] </p>

<h3>Economic Boycott and Forms of Strike </h3>

<p> In India, Indians boycotted foreign cloth with such success
that they had a significant impact on the mills in Britain.
Strikes have been used extensively in the U.S. for in all kinds
of reform campaigns A scene in the movie &quot;Gandhi&quot; shows
the power of a nationwide strike. [To conduct an economic boycott
requires economic alternatives for the boycotters. To conduct an
effective strike, a campaign needs great numbers of campaigners
and who have economic alternatives. As far as I can tell, drug
policy reform advocates are generally dependent on the dominant
economic structures and so are weak on this point.] </p>

<h3>Non-Cooperation </h3>

<p> Non-cooperation involves refusal to support the portions of
the system that require reform or accept benefits from the
system. For example, during the campaign to remove British rule,
Indians resigned from government posts, removed their children
from government schools, returned awards and medals that they had
received from the government, and so on. Economic boycott and
strikes described in the previous step can be regarded as forms
of non-cooperation. [The judges who refuse to try drug cases are
engaged in non-cooperation. People who refuse to provide urine
samples as a condition of employment are engaged in
non-cooperation.] </p>

<h3>Civil Disobedience </h3>

<p> Civil disobedience extends non-cooperation to the active and
open breaking of selected laws. Gandhi set complete and voluntary
obedience to laws as a prerequisite for civil disobedience. Laws
to be broken were selected very carefully for their position at
the heart of the problem or for their symbolic value. Civil
disobedience involves a deliberate courting of arrest and, upon
arrest, no defense is offered in the courts. In fact, full
admission of guilt is required. The prosecutors, juries, and
judges are challenged to see the injustice of the law that they
are defending against the civil disobedient and to cease their
cooperation with the injustice. In mass campaigns involving civil
disobedience in India, prisons filled up very quickly. Very
often, the leaders were arrested in an attempt to dishearten the
campaigners and end the campaign. Sometimes they were arrested
upon delivery to the authorities of their notice of intent to
disobey! Other times, the government ignored them completely
which, of course, encouraged more people to join the campaign. If
the government ignores the first civil disobedients, the
provocative nature of increasing numbers of civil disobedients
eventually compels the government to act. And compelling the
opponent to act is the point of civil disobedience. Two important
organizational points must be mentioned here. Every campaign in
which the leaders may be arrested must provide succession of
leadership. A succession procedure must be planned in advance so
that civil disobedience continues apace no matter how many
leaders have been arrested. The second point involves support for
the families of the civil disobedients. There must always be
people who are willing to forego civil disobedience and remain
free to take care of the children, the aged, and the ill. Support
people should be identified in advance and should, under no
circumstances, court arrest. </p>

<p> [Medicinal marijuana suppliers and users come to mind as a
possible example of civil disobedients, although an analysis
would reveal that very few of these civil disobedients actually
meet all of the criteria set forth by Gandhi.] </p>

<h3>Creation of Alternate Structures </h3>

<p> If, after all of these steps, the existing system fails to
become more just, an alternate means of ensuring justice must be
developed. This is especially important when the existing system
is so corrupt that people are disobeying it not just as part of a
campaign, but simply because they find themselves unable to
conduct their lives peacefully without disobeying it. Such a
system is approaching inevitable collapse by virtue of its
inherent flaws. Alternate structures must be built in advance not
only to provide for immediate needs, but also to prevent (or at
least mitigate) the potential release of destructive,
anger-driven energy that often follows an oppressive system's
collapse. [Medicinal marijuana buyers' clubs provide an example
of an alternate structure.] </p>

<h3>Demands of Gandhi's Technique on Campaigners </h3>

<p> Gandhi's technique exacts a great deal from a campaign's
leadership and those who follow them. They must tirelessly plan
and monitor the progress of the campaign, reassess their position
and the position of the opponent, and respond creatively and
provocatively to events as they unfold. Leaders must be flexible
enough to respond to change. </p>

<p> At the same time, they must have the insight to know which
potential responses might lead to stagnation of the campaign or
will compromise a fundamental principle--for either will lead to
setbacks. </p>

<p> Leaders must be consummate communicators: with the opponent,
the public, potential supporters, and those who have joined the
campaign--else misunderstandings and misinterpretations can arise
as the campaign is adjusted to changing conditions and events.
Leaders must have an ability to organize, inspire, and use fully
the talents of an extremely diverse group of people who volunteer
their services to a campaign. People with widely varying
perspectives and beliefs must be transformed from a disorganized
scattering of supporters in conflict not just with the
government, but often with each other, to a coherent, responsive
unit that can target its actions and responses with great force.
Finally, all in the campaign must have an ability to manage or
dispel the tension and anger that can arise when their efforts
appear to be frustrated, when there are disagreements among
campaigners, and when they directly confront an often-hostile
opponent. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>CONCLUSION </h2>

<p> Many drug policy reform advocates have been using political
action techniques similar (though not identical) to the steps
described above. But drug policy reform advocates have not
catalyzed into a dynamic, coherent group that can act
synchronously to achieve a clearly defined goal. I believe that,
if reform advocates' efforts were synthesized in a Gandhian
sequence with an underpinning of the fundamental principles,
success would be inevitable. </p>

<p> This Act may be cited as the `Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of
1995'. </p>

<p> SEC. 2. ADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE. </p>

<p> (a) In General: Chapter 223 of title 18, United States Code,
is amended by adding at the end the following: </p>

<p> `Sec. 3510. Admissibility of evidence obtained by search or
seizure </p>

<p> `(a) Evidence Obtained by Objectively Reasonable Search or
Seizure: </p>

<p> Evidence which is obtained as a result of a search or seizure
shall not be excluded in a proceeding in a court of the United
States on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation
of the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
if the search or seizure was carried out in circumstances

<p>HOUSE CHAMBER ACTION </p>

<p> FOR THE LAST THREE LEGISLATIVE DAYS </p>

<p> 02-08-95 </p>

<p> Exclusionary Rule Reform: By a recorded vote of 289 ayes to
142 noes, Roll No. 103, the House passed H.R. 666, to control
crime by exclusionary rule reform. </p>

<p> Agreed To: </p>

<p> The Volkmer amendment that exempts searches and seizures
carried out by or under the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms from the relaxation of the exclusionary rule
(agreed to by a recorded vote of 228 ayes to 198 noes with 3
voting 'present', Roll No. 101). Earlier, a Conyers amendment was
offered but subsequently withdrawn that contained identical
provisions; </p>

<p> The Traficant amendment that exempts searches or seizures
carried out by or under the authority of the Internal Revenue
Service from the relaxation of the exclusionary rule; and The
Fields of Louisiana amendment, as amended by the McCollum
substitute, that provides that none of the provisions shall be
construed so as to violate the fourth article to the
Constitution. </p>

<p> Rejected the Serrano amendment that sought to exempt searches
or seizures carried out by or under the authority of the </p>

<p> Immigration and Naturalization Service (rejected by a
recorded vote of 103 ayes to 330 noes, Roll No. 102). </p>

<p> 02-07-95 </p>

<p> Exclusionary Rule Reform Act: House completed all general
debate and began consideration of amendments to H.R. 666, to
control crime by exclusionary rule reform; but came to no
resolution thereon. Consideration of amendments will resume on
Wednesday, </p>

<p> February 8. </p>

<p> Rejected: </p>

<p> The Conyers amendment that sought to limit and codify the
'good faith' exception to searches and seizures with warrants
later to be found invalid; and to enact the current limited 'good
faith' exception for searches in which evidence was not excluded
if it was retained in a 'good faith' reliance on a statute, which
was later held to be unconstitutional (rejected by a recorded
vote of 138 ayes to 291 noes, Roll No. 98); and </p>

<p> The Watt amendment in the nature of a substitute that sought
to strike provisions applying the 'good faith' exception to the
exclusionary rule to warrantless searches; and to replace it with
the text of the fourth amendment of the United States
Constitution (rejected by a recorded vote of 121 ayes to 303
noes, Roll No. 99). </p>

<p> H. Res. 61, the rule under which the bill is being
considered, was agreed to earlier by voice vote. </p>

<p> 02-06-95 </p>

<p> Reports Filed: The following reports were filed as follows: </p>

<p> H. Res. 61, providing for the consideration of H.R. 666, to
control crime by exclusionary rule reform (H. Rept. 104-20). </p>

<title>DRUG REFORMERS ATTACK HOUSE BILL HR 666 </title>

<h1>DRUG REFORMERS ATTACK HOUSE BILL HR 666 </h1>

<p> California NORML Press Release: February 9, 1995 </p>

<p> Contact: Dale Gieringer, Cal NORML (415) 563-5858. </p>

<p> <a name="DDE_LINK6"><b>DRUG REFORMERS ATTACK HOUSE BILL HR
666 &quot;THE BEAST&quot; FOR DOUBLE STANDARD ON EXCLUSIONARY
RULE</b> </a> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Outraged drug reformers denounced Congress' passing of a
bill, HR 666, nicknamed &quot;The Beast,&quot; which weakens the
exclusionary rule against illegal police searches in some cases,
such as drug offenses, but not gun trafficking or tax crimes. The
bill, which permits illegally seized evidence to be used if the
arresting police exercise &quot;good faith,&quot; was amended by
Rep. Harold Volkmer (D- Missouri) to exclude searches by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, out of concern for the
rights of gun owners. A similar amendment by Rep. James Traficant
(D-Ohio) excludes the IRS. </p>

<p> California NORML attacked HR 666 as &quot;A grotesque
travesty of justice,&quot; saying &quot;Whatever logic there may
be in the 'good faith' exception to the exclusionary rule is
totally obliterated by making an exception for particular
offenses. By what logic do we let the DEA run roughshod over the
Fourth Amendment when ferreting out home marijuana gardeners,
while making the BATF wear kid gloves in pursuing arms
traffickers?&quot; </p>

<p> Rep. Volkmer defended his amendment in light of the BATF's
misconduct at Waco, saying &quot;I haven't seen any agency as
abusive as the BATF.&quot; However, NORML counters that the DEA
is even more abusive. &quot;To speak of the DEA and 'good faith'
is an oxymoron,&quot; says California NORML coordinator Dale
Gieringer, &quot;This is an agency whose agents are trained
professional liars and chronic perjurers, engaged in trampling
the privacy of citizens, buzzing their land with helicopters,
spying on garden stores, seizing property without due process,
denying medicine to patients who need it, and running a network
of drug-dealing informants.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;HR 666 sets a constitutional double standard for
protection of privacy that violates the 14th Amendment right to
equal protection of laws. In effect, it says it's O.K. to play
loose with the rights of home marijuana gardeners, but not gun,
alcohol, or tax criminals. HR 666 subverts the Fourth Amendment,
the bulwark of our constitutional right to privacy. We call on
the Senate and President to reject this grotesque perversion of
justice.&quot; </p>

<h1>Bumper Sticker Ideas </h1>

<p> This page is a compilation of ideas people had for good
bumper stickers for a drug policy reform campaign. Enjoy. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> &quot;Visualize Drugpeace,&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;It's the Prohibition -- Not Drugs,&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Stop the War on Us,&quot; </p>

<p> Prohibition love it or leave it. </p>

<p> Peace on Drugs. </p>

<p> CIA Cocaine in America. </p>

<p> DEA: the competition </p>

<p> Make love on drugs, </p>

<p> Not war on drugs </p>

<p> Fight real crime- </p>

<p> End the drug war. </p>

<p> - Ben Masel (I think) </p>

<p> Just say know </p>

<p> (or no thank you) </p>

<p> Why can't we all just get abong? </p>

<p> As Ira Glassner noted in his editorial printed in last
sundays NY times </p>

<p> --in response to &quot;It's Drugs Stupid&quot;---Hey,
&quot;It's Prohibition Stupid.&quot; </p>

<p> Legalize it, Don't Criticize it. </p>

<p> Drug Prohibition is the Problem Not the Solution </p>

<p> I read once that if you take a black sharpie and black-out
the &quot;kids off&quot; </p>

<p> on the DARE bumper stickers, it reads, </p>

<p> &quot;DARE to keep drugs&quot; </p>

<p> Pro-MJ and I vote! </p>

<p> Free the weed, the stalk and the seed! </p>

<p> Free Pot (from tyranny) </p>

<p> Drugs Are Real Expensive </p>

<p> &quot;Stop the Violence: End the Drug War&quot; </p>

<p> PROHIBITION = &lt;the word &quot;CONTROL&quot; surrounded by
a big slashed circle&gt; </p>

<p> REGULATION = CONTROL </p>

<p> How about &quot;DECLARE PEACE&quot; superimposed over the
image of a </p>

<p> pot leaf on one side and a hand with the V-shaped peace sign </p>

<p> on the other? </p>

<p> Stop drug violence </p>

<p> End the drug war </p>

<p> [Perhaps using red/white octagon STOP sign and yellow/black
diamond END sign] </p>

<p> DARE: Lying to </p>

<p> kids about drugs </p>

<p> [Lying to kids has to be in high contrast, bright yellow on
black] </p>

<p> Save the trees </p>

<p> Legalize hemp </p>

<p> Prohibition _is_ our drug problem </p>

<p> &quot;It's Prohibition, Stupid&quot; - (inspired by E.
Nadelmann) </p>

<p> Tax it. </p>

<p> For Freedom of Diet -- Abolish Neo-prohibition! </p>

<p> End the Drug War. </p>

<p> Begin the War on Real Crime </p>

<p> THE DRUG WAR BREEDS CRIME </p>

<p> NOBODY'S SAFE FROM THE DEA </p>

<p> WANT SAFE STREETS? END THE DRUG WAR! </p>

<p> MAKE AMERICA SAFE: END THE DRUG WAR! </p>

<p> OUR DRUG WAR: $100,000,000,000.00 DRUG LORD SUBSIDY </p>

<p> PROHIBITION IS A FAILURE </p>

<p> &quot;WAR ON DRUGS&quot; = WAR ON AMERICA </p>

<p> LAND OF THE PRISONER HOME OF THE DRUG WAR </p>

<p> (as in &quot;land of the free, home of the brave&quot;.
Superimposed on a </p>

<p> waving American flag. In fact it would be really cool if
&quot;free&quot; </p>

<p> and &quot;brave&quot; were printed but scribbled out and
&quot;prisoner&quot; and </p>

<p> &quot;drug war&quot; were written in.) </p>

<p> US OUT OF COLOMBIA - DEA OUT OF MENDOCINO </p>

<p> ...Fight Crime, Not Drugs... </p>

<p> ....End Drug Prohibition -- Before It's Too Late... </p>

<p> How about: School free drug zone. </p>

<p> &gt;Prohibition: Didn't work Then </p>

<p> &gt;Of Drugs Doesn't Work Now! </p>

<p> &gt;Freedom still works better - Abolish Prohibition </p>

<p> DEA OUT OF L.A. </p>

<p> Save Our Children -- Stop the Drug War, or </p>

<p> Save our Community -- Stop the Drug War <br>

<p>LIBERTY ACTIVISTS' LIST </p>

<p> v 1.36 06/1995 </p>

<p> So you're sick of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;? Here's an
international list of over 200 organizations which support drug
law reform, although most of them are in the US. Look for one in
your area. Please distribute this list widely, and send in any
groups which are not listed already. There's an active group here
for almost any taste. Joining your favorite organization is best,
though if you're worried about persecution, just send anonymous
money or a letter of appreciation. Take advantage of your
democratic rights while you still have some! </p>

<p> If you're already in a law reform organisation, you can use
this list to contact others with similar interests, and share
information or facilities. Just knowing that there are others
working on these issues can be a big morale booster. </p>

<p> The power of pro-liberty organisations can be multiplied many
times by fast and efficient communication, which spreads news and
promotes co-ordinated action. Electronic mail and conferencing is
the most efficient way to achieve these necessary abilities. For
example, this list doubled its size in eight months of
circulation over the Internet. I strongly encourage active groups
and individuals to use this powerful technology. </p>

<p> This listing was originally kicked off with a list of groups
reproduced with permission from the February, 1992 issue of High
Times magazine (contact details at the end of the list). </p>

<p> Since then, it has grown considerably through the kindness of
those who have contributed additional entries, including Chris
Klausmeier, Macca Macpherson, Dave Thomson and Keith Lim. </p>

<p> Please reproduce and distribute widely with this
acknowledgment. Post it on bulletin boards if you can. </p>

<p> PLEASE SEND NEW LISTINGS </p>

<p> I don't know any more about most of these groups, than what
appears here. If you know about other active groups not listed
here, or if any entries need correction, please e-mail me at
schaffer@smartlink.net, or mail to the address below, for
incorporation in future editions of this list. </p>

</h2>

<p> (Chapter Report, 03/09/94, GAO/GGD-94-73). </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h1>

<p> U.S. banking and tax laws require the filing of reports on
currency transactions exceeding $10,000. People disguising
illicit income are sidestepping U.S. reporting rules by smuggling
cash out of the country--apparently with relative ease. Once the
funds are deposited in a foreign financial institution, they are
much harder to trace and can be spent or transferred back to the
United States with less risk of exposure. Treasury Department and
U.S. Customs Service officials have no way to estimate the amount
of currency being smuggled, although law enforcement officials
GAO spoke with believe that the amount is
substantial--potentially billions of dollars each year. In
addition to discussing the extent of currency smuggling, this
report describes the techniques used to smuggle currency and U.S.
efforts to curtail it. </p>

<p> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 0 </p>

<p> PURPOSE </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:1 </p>

<p> A major weapon in this country's efforts to combat money
laundering are banking and tax laws that require the reporting of
large cash transactions. To avoid these requirements, currency
and other negotiable instruments are being smuggled out of the
country. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senate
Committee on Governmental Affairs, asked GAO to assess the extent
of currency smuggling and determine what the Customs Service is
doing to curtail it. </p>

<p> BACKGROUND </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:2 </p>

<p> Money laundering is the process of disguising illicit income
to make it appear legitimate. In 1970 Congress enacted the Bank
Secrecy Act as a major step in fighting money laundering. The
act's implementing regulations require that several types of
reports be filed, such as the Currency Transaction Report, which
banks and other financial institutions are to file on currency
transactions exceeding $10,000. Another report is required from
anyone transporting more than $10,000 in currency or monetary
instruments into or out of the country. In 1984, the Internal
Revenue Code was revised to require an additional report. Persons
engaged in a trade or business who receive more than $10,000 in
cash payments in a single transaction or series of related
transactions must file a report with the Internal Revenue
Service. </p>

<p> Requirements to report large cash transactions have made it
increasingly difficult to disguise and conceal the huge amounts
of cash that criminal activity such as drug trafficking can
generate. According to law enforcement officials, one
increasingly popular method of circumventing the reporting
requirements is to smuggle the currency out of the country. Once
the funds are deposited in a foreign financial institution, they
are much more difficult to trace and can be spent or transferred
back to the United States with less risk of exposure. </p>

<p> RESULTS IN BRIEF </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:3 </p>

<p> Treasury and Customs officials said that the amount of
currency being smuggled out of the country cannot be determined.
Moreover, because of the clandestine nature of smuggling, a sound
basis for estimates is difficult to establish. While estimates
vary, law enforcement officials GAO interviewed agreed the amount
is substantial and could be billions of dollars a year. </p>

<p> Smugglers use a variety of techniques and conveyances. For
example, bulk shipments are sometimes driven across the border or
hidden in air or ocean cargo shipments. Individuals have been
stopped attempting to board aircraft with several hundred
thousand dollars in cash hidden on their bodies. Some have even
swallowed rolls of bills wrapped in condoms. The U.S. mail is
also being used to ship currency out of the country without
reports being filed. </p>

<p> Smuggling currency out of the country is relatively easy. The
nation has thousands of miles of unguarded borders; where ports
do exist, the inspection of outbound cargo and passengers is not
given the same emphasis as inbound inspection. Although
comparative data are not available, the Customs Service
acknowledges that most of its resources are devoted to inspecting
passengers and cargo entering the country. Nonetheless, in the
4-year period ending September 30, 1992, the Customs Service
interdicted and seized $171 million in currency and negotiable
instruments that was being taken out of the country without being
reported. </p>

<p> The level of effort given outbound inspections is generally
determined at the local level, and resource allocations are
constrained by the necessity of maintaining an adequate level of
inbound interdiction efforts. However, Customs has recently
increased the Service-wide oversight of and emphasis on its
efforts to interdict unreported currency leaving the country. </p>

<p> GAO'S ANALYSIS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4 </p>

<p> CURRENCY SMUGGLING CIRCUMVENTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4.1 </p>

<p> Faced with the difficulties of laundering money domestically,
many individuals take currency and other negotiable instruments
to other countries, where it can be put into the flow of commerce
and returned to this country under an air of legitimacy. The
extent of the outbound currency problem is unknown, although some
estimates are available. The 1984 President's Commission on
Organized Crime estimated that as much as $5 billion a year in
currency generated by the illegal drug trade was being taken out
of the country. More recently, an Arizona law enforcement
official has estimated that as much as $3 billion is being
smuggled into Mexico or elsewhere every year just through that
state's border. Although these are not analytically based
estimates, they are experts' assessments of the magnitude of the
problem. (See pp. 16 and 17.) </p>

<p> Foreign and U.S. currencies are brought into and taken out of
the country on a routine basis and for legitimate reasons. In
fiscal year 1992 businesses and individuals filed over 32,000
reports with Customs of almost $30 billion in currency and
negotiable instruments leaving the country. These reports can be
used to trace the funds. Consequently, currency is being smuggled
out of the country to avoid any record that would associate
individuals or businesses with large amounts of funds. (See pp.
15 and 16.) </p>

<p> A number of methods are being employed to smuggle currency
out of the country. Law enforcement officials GAO interviewed
described them as ranging from simple to complex. The variety of
concealment techniques makes smuggling extremely difficult to
detect. For example, currency has been found hidden on passengers
and in luggage, commercial cargo, false compartments, vehicles,
vessels, mail, and commercial aircraft. As with drugs, there have
even been instances where individuals have swallowed currency or
taped it to various parts of their bodies. (See pp. 17 through
28.) </p>

<p> Individuals caught smuggling currency represent many
nationalities and are stopped en route to a number of
destinations. Consequently, no typical profile or country of
destination exists. (See pp. 36 and 37.) </p>

<p> CUSTOMS HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS IN COMBATTING CURRENCY SMUGGLING
</p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4.2 </p>

<p> The Customs Service has traditionally emphasized those
programs directed at inspecting the flow of persons and cargo
into the country. Enforcement efforts to interdict illegal
exports do exist, however, and include one program,
&quot;Operation Buckstop,&quot; specifically aimed at selectively
inspecting passengers and cargo leaving the country to ensure
that currency being transported outside the United States is
reported. (See pp. 29 and 30.) </p>

<p> Customs does not collect data on a nationwide basis that can
be used to compare the resources used on inbound and outbound
inspections. Outbound inspections, however, are the exception
rather than the rule. Only 85 of the 338 Customs ports have staff
performing outbound inspections on a full-time basis. These staff
total 130 of the 6,228 inspectors in Customs. (See p. 29.) </p>

<p> GAO visited 28 ports in 11 Customs districts and found a wide
variation in how and when Operation Buckstop inspections were
done. Resource constraints were a major factor in making these
decisions. Other considerations included the perceived threat of
currency smuggling at particular ports, the adequacy of
facilities to accommodate outbound inspections, and the
availability of specialized equipment for examining bulk cargo.
(See pp. 29 through 32.) </p>

<p> Customs efforts to combat currency smuggling have resulted in
substantial amounts of currency being interdicted. However,
Customs officials acknowledged that the seizures represent only a
fraction of the amount that is probably taken out of the country
unreported. In the 4-year period ending on September 30, 1992,
$171 million was seized by Customs inspectors as it was being
smuggled out of the country. (See p. 34.) Fifty-two of Customs'
338 ports reported 862 seizures totalling $42.4 million in fiscal
year 1992. (See app. II.) Most of the currency seized (71
percent) was being smuggled on commercial aircraft, while 17
percent of the seized currency was found on commercial ocean
vessels. (See p. 38.) Eighty-six percent of the currency was
seized at 10 ports, and more than a third was seized at 1 port,
New York's JFK airport. </p>

<p> In the first 11 months of fiscal year 1993 seizures had
increased to 913 for a total of $39.2 million. (See pp. 44 and
45.) Increases over the number of seizures in fiscal year 1992
could be related to an increase in smuggling activity, an
increase in Customs outbound inspection activity, or both. </p>

<p> CUSTOMS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE OUTBOUND CURRENCY
INSPECTIONS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4.3 </p>

<p> Customs has increased the oversight and emphasis given
currency interdiction efforts on a nationwide basis. These
efforts include the preparation of an Inspector's handbook to
ensure uniform procedures during Operation Buckstop inspections
and special initiatives, such as testing the use of specially
trained dogs to detect U.S. currency. In addition, certain
geographical areas and means of conveyance have been targeted for
special attention. (See pp. 43 through 45.) </p>

<p> The primary factor limiting any increase in Operation
Buckstop initiatives is scarce resources. Any personnel,
equipment, and funds directed to outbound interdiction efforts
are generally at the expense of those Customs programs directed
at inbound interdiction. </p>

<p> Because its overall level of resources is not increasing, the
Customs Service is faced with the challenge of determining the
appropriate balance between inbound and outbound interdiction
efforts. (See pp. 44 and 45.) </p>

<p> RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:5 </p>

<p> GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:6 </p>

<p> Customs officials provided GAO with oral comments on a draft
of this report. (See p. 45.) They said the report was factually
correct and an objective presentation of the problems faced by
Customs in combatting currency smuggling. </p>

<p> INTRODUCTION </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 1 </p>

<p> Money laundering is the disguising or concealing of illicit
income in order to make it appear legitimate. Recognizing that
money leaves a trail that can be traced to an underlying crime,
Congress has enacted legislation to make money laundering more
difficult to conceal and easier to prosecute. These efforts have
been rewarded in that laundering money through U.S. financial
institutions and businesses is now considered to pose an
increased threat to those seeking to disguise illicit cash. </p>

<p> Law enforcement officials believe that successes in
combatting money laundering have caused criminals to avoid
stringent U.S. reporting requirements by smuggling the cash out
of the country. Once across the border the money is much more
difficult to trace and can be more easily hidden under the guise
of normal business transactions. This report describes the known
extent to which currency and other monetary instruments are being
smuggled out of the country, the methods used, and what Customs
Service efforts are under way to interdict these funds. </p>

<p> CRIMINALS FACE PROBLEMS IN DEALING IN LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1:1 </p>

<p> Criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking generate
enormous amounts of cash. It is estimated that the sale of
illegal drugs in this country could be as much as $100 billion
each year. Although the preferred medium of exchange is cash, the
transactions often are small and drug traffickers must contend
with a large volume of small-denomination bills. </p>

<p> Although the process of money laundering has been broken down
into a number of steps, it is generally agreed by law enforcement
and regulatory officials that the point at which criminals are
most vulnerable to detection is &quot;placement.&quot; Placement
is the concealing of illicit proceeds by converting the cash to
another medium that is more convenient or less suspicious for
purposes of exchange, such as property, cashier's checks, or
money orders; or depositing the funds into a financial
institution account for subsequent disbursement. </p>

<p> Because of the problems associated with converting and
concealing large amounts of cash--about 450 paper bills weigh 1
pound, so that $1 billion in $100 bills would weigh over 11
tons--placement is perhaps the most difficult part of money
laundering and is currently the primary focus of U.S. law
enforcement, legislative, and regulatory efforts to attack money
laundering. </p>

<p> REPORTING REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE RISKS OF LAUNDERING
MONEY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1:2 </p>

<p> Federal efforts to detect placement and track the
international movement of money and monetary instruments across
the nation's borders were significantly enhanced with the passage
of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in 1970. The act requires
individuals as well as banks and other financial institutions to
report large foreign and domestic financial transactions to the
Department of the Treasury. The implementing regulations of the
act require the following </p>

<p> reports: </p>

<p> Currency Transaction Report (IRS Form 4789): this report must
be filed by financial institutions\1 for each deposit,
withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer,
by, through, or to such financial institutions that involves a
transaction in currency of more than $10,000. </p>

<p> Currency Transaction Report by Casino (IRS Form 8362): this
report must be filed for each currency transaction in excess of
$10,000 by any licensed casino operating in the United States
with gross annual gaming revenues in excess of $1 million. </p>

<p> Report of International Transportation of Currency or
Monetary Instruments (Customs Form 4790): this report must be
filed when currency or monetary instruments over $10,000 are
transported from or into the United States. </p>

<p> Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (Treasury Form
TDF 90-22.1): this report must be filed annually by U.S. persons
who have a financial interest in or signature authority over bank
accounts, securities accounts, or other financial accounts in a
foreign country that have a combined value in excess of $10,000. </p>

<p> The act has been amended to provide substantial criminal and
civil penalties for institutions that fail to file the required
reports and for individuals who deliberately evade certain
reporting requirements. </p>

<p> In addition to the BSA reports, Section 6050I was added to
the Internal Revenue Code in 1984 requiring any person engaged in
a trade or business (other than financial institutions required
to report under the Bank Secrecy Act) who receives more than
$10,000 in cash payments in a single transaction or series of
related transactions to file a report with the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). The Secretary of the Treasury requires the report
be filed on an IRS Form 8300, Report of Cash Payments Over
$10,000 Received in a Trade or Business. </p>

<p> Data from the BSA reports and the Forms 8300 are maintained
on two computer databases. One is used by IRS in investigations
involving tax fraud and evasion. The other is used by law
enforcement agencies at the state and federal level in criminal
investigations, not only of money laundering, but also in
identifying suspicious transactions that might indicate other
possible criminal activity; evaluating the merits of any
potential criminal cases; and tracing, analyzing, or identifying
the disposition of proceeds from any illegal activity. </p>

<p> By far, the report most frequently filed has been the
Currency Transaction Report (CTR). In May 1993, we testified
before the House Banking Committee\2 that over 95 percent of the
BSA reports filed up to that time were CTRs and that since 1987
the annual filings of CTRs had increased at an average rate of
12.7 percent. We also pointed out that Treasury and law
enforcement officials generally believe that in the past,
traditional banks and other financial institutions were the
primary means used by money launderers. The officials also
believe that increased efforts by federal regulatory and law
enforcement agencies, as well as enhanced cooperation by the
banks themselves, have significantly improved bank compliance
with the reporting requirements, making it much more difficult
for banks to be used for money laundering purposes. </p>

<p> Given the increased level of risk, criminals must now pursue
money laundering methods less susceptible to detection. One such
method is to take the cash out of the country, after which it is
not subject to U.S. reporting requirements and can be
reintroduced into the financial system with the appearance of
legitimacy. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 As defined by Treasury, &quot;financial institutions&quot;
include banks, federally regulated security brokers, currency
exchange houses, funds transmitters, check cashing businesses,
and persons subject to supervision by state or federal bank
supervisory authority. </p>

<p> \2 Money Laundering: The Use of Bank Secrecy Act Reports by
Law Enforcement Could Be Increased (GA0/T-GGD-93-31, May 26,
1993). </p>

<p> OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1:3 </p>

<p> The Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, asked us to assess the
extent to which currency is being smuggled out of the U.S. and
identify what efforts the Customs Service is taking to prevent
the smuggling. Rather than attempt to provide a quantified
estimate of how much smuggling is occuring, it was agreed that we
would present the estimates of knowlegeable law enforcement
officials. </p>

<p> To address these objectives, we reviewed pertinent laws and
regulations and an extensive body of published material,
including congressional hearings and reports; academic and
periodical literature; and reports prepared by federal and state
agencies, private research associations, and other experts. We
also met with knowledgeable officials and reviewed records within
the Customs Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN). </p>

<p> To review ongoing interdiction efforts by Customs we obtained
Service records and held discussions with knowledgeable Customs
officials at the headquarters, district, and port levels. To the
extent possible, we verified the statistical information we
obtained through a review of the source records and observations.
</p>

<p> We also visited Customs ports and district offices that were
judgmentally selected based on the locations having a high degree
of outbound interdiction activity. Overall, the Customs districts
we visited were responsible for 87.4 percent of all the outbound
currency seizures during fiscal year 1992. We ensured that our
visits included land border crossings with both Canada and
Mexico, seaports on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and
major airports throughout the country. To provide a basis for
comparison, we visited some smaller ports as well as ports that
had no outbound currency seizures. </p>

<p> As shown in appendix I, we visited 11 districts and 28 ports.
Since the sites were selected judgmentally as described above,
the results of our work cannot be projected nationwide. At each
of the ports visited, we met with Customs officials and observed
inspection activities. Where available, we analyzed documentation
on outbound currency inspections and seizures. We attempted to
identify all the currency smuggling schemes that Customs had
detected and to determine the rationale for local differences in
interdiction efforts. </p>

<p> To determine the status of efforts to combat outbound
currency through the U.S. mail, we met with officials in both the
Customs Service and the Postal Service in Washington, D.C. We
reviewed the current status of proposed interagency agreements
and discussed the status of current inspection efforts. </p>

<p> We provided the Customs Service with a draft of this report
and received oral comments from agency officials. </p>

<p> We did our work between February 1992 and November 1993 and
in accordance with generally accepted governmental auditing
standards. </p>

<p> CURRENCY SMUGGLING IS BEING USED TO EVADE REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 2 </p>

<p> Transporting large amounts of foreign and domestic currency
into or out of the U.S. is legal and a relatively common
occurrence. However, Treasury regulations require that the
destination, method of transport, and owner of the funds be
identified. Individuals attempting to remove large amounts of
illicit cash out of the country prefer to remain anonymous and
that the shipment be unrecorded. Consequently, they often resort
to smuggling. </p>

<p> The exact amount of money being smuggled out of the country
is unknown. Because of our open borders and the priority given
inbound interdiction efforts, billions of dollars in U.S.
currency could be leaving the country each year unreported. </p>

<p> REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPORTING CURRENCY INTO OR OUT
OF THE COUNTRY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:1 </p>

<p> Businesses and individuals transport currency into or out of
the country for a number of legitimate reasons. For example,
financial institutions and exchange houses operating on the
border may need to take currency back into the country. Also,
businesses and individuals may find they can negotiate better
deals in foreign markets by having currency on hand. </p>

<p> As discussed earlier (see ch. 1), any individual or business
that transports more than $10,000 in currency or monetary
instruments\3 into or out of the country must file a Report of
International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments
(CMIR) or face a fine or imprisonment. Generally, this filing is
made at the Customs port where the funds cross the border
although some CMIRs can be mailed to Customs headquarters in
Washington, D.C. The information to be reported on the CMIR
includes the name and other identifying information of the
individual transporting the funds, the method being used to
transport the funds, the amount being transported, the owner of
the funds, and the destination of the funds. </p>

<p> In fiscal year 1992, more than 200,000 CMIRs were filed to
report about $61 billion in currency entering or leaving the
country. The amounts being transported can be quite large. In
fiscal year 1992, 43 percent of the outbound CMIRs filed by
businesses and 6.5 percent of the outbound CMIRs filed by
individuals were for amounts of at least $100,000. The largest
outbound business CMIR was for $72,852,579, while the largest
outbound individual filing was for $23,800,000. Overall, the
average business CMIR was for $1,124,111, while the average
individual CMIR was for $61,680. Table 2.1 provides a breakdown
of the CMIRs filed by amounts reported, type of filer, and
whether the funds were entering or leaving the country. </p>

<p> Table 2.1 </p>

<p> Distribution of CMIRs Filed in Fiscal </p>

<p> Year 1992 </p>

<p> Amount Amount </p>

<p> -------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- </p>

<p> Inbound 124,786 $6.836 50,537 $24.057 </p>

<p> Outbound 6,348 $0.389 26,123 $29.365 </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Source: U.S. Customs Service. </p>

<p> Customs officials told us that there is no reason to assume
that the number of CMIRs being filed should be relatively equal
for inbound and outbound traffic and, as table 2.1 shows, they
are not. Since we do not know how many outbound CMIRs should have
been filed, we cannot draw any conclusions about compliance with
the reporting requirements from the disparity between inbound and
outbound filings. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \3 As defined by Treasury regulations, &quot;monetary
instruments&quot; include forms of payment that are bearer
negotiable, such as traveler's checks and money orders. For
clarification purposes, the word &quot;currency&quot; as used in
this report will also refer to monetary instruments. </p>

<p> THE AMOUNT OF CURRENCY BEING SMUGGLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY IS
UNKNOWN </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:2 </p>

<p> Despite the fact that U.S. currency is routinely taken out of
the country for legitimate purposes, Customs officials said that
criminals are anxious to avoid the paper trail created by filing
a CMIR. Thus, they resort to currency smuggling by carrying money
out of the country in some surreptitious or concealed manner. </p>

<p> Treasury and Customs officials told us that it is not
possible to measure accurately how much currency is being
smuggled out of the country. Moreover, because of the inherent
clandestine nature of the activity, it is very difficult to
establish a sound basis for estimates. These officials believe,
however, that the millions of dollars in currency being
interdicted (see ch. 3) represent only a small fraction of the
total amount being smuggled. </p>

<p> Currency smuggling has been recognized as a problem since at
least 1984, when the President's Commission on Organized Crime
reported that as much as $15 billion of the $50 to $75 billion in
illegal drug money then being earned in the United States moved
into international financial channels each year. Of the $15
billion, as much as $5 billion was thought to be transported in
the form of currency, with the remainder being wired abroad after
deposit in the U.S. banking system. </p>

<p> A 1987 Customs Service report on money laundering methods
reported that the currency flow between two countries, Colombia
and Panama, and the United States indicated that approximately $1
billion a year in U.S. currency was being returned to this
country, but a corresponding flow of U.S. currency was not being
reported as sent to those countries. </p>

<p> Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
reported in July 1992 that currency smuggling was extensive and
appeared to be increasing. Nonetheless, the report concluded that
&quot;The extent of currency smuggling is subject to a great deal
of conjecture.&quot; </p>

<p> In February 1992 hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,
federal as well as state law enforcement officials expressed
their concerns with the emerging trend of currency being smuggled
into Mexico. An Arizona Assistant Attorney General testified that
law enforcement personnel were aware of the export of cash drug
proceeds and estimated that as much as $3 billion in U.S.
currency a year was being smuggled out of the country from
Arizona into Mexico or elsewhere. A Deputy Attorney General for
California testified that individuals had been caught walking
across the California border into Mexico with shopping bags
containing as much as $500,000 in currency. However, as discussed
below, Mexico is not the only destination of U.S. currency being
smuggled out of the country. </p>

<p> CURRENCY SMUGGLING METHODS VARY CONSIDERABLY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3 </p>

<p> Smuggling currency out of this country is relatively simple
because of the nation's border characteristics and because of our
historic treatment of exports and outbound passengers.
Geographically, the contiguous United States has approximately
11,323 miles on two oceans and the gulf coast, 3,987 miles of
shared border with Canada, and 1,933 miles of shared border with
Mexico. While Customs maintains over 300 ports where vehicles and
cargo can leave the country by air, land, or sea, there is little
to prevent a person leaving the country by simply crossing the
border at other locations. </p>

<p> Smugglers use a variety of techniques to take money out of
the country. The remainder of this chapter presents some examples
of methods used by currency smugglers, sorted by type of
conveyance used. </p>

<p> AIR </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.1 </p>

<p> Customs officials believe that smuggling currency by
commercial airlines has long been a preferred method, since (1)
the passenger can stay close to his money during the transport,
(2) so many destinations can be reached easily and quickly, and
(3) so little preplanning is required. Passengers on commercial
air carriers can smuggle currency concealed on their persons, in
hand-carried baggage, or in the checked luggage compartments of
the aircraft. Commercial flights can be direct routes to foreign
destinations or may connect with other domestic flights prior to
overseas departure. Customs provided us with several examples of
how currency is smuggled out of the country on commercial
airlines. </p>

<p> In March 1988 Customs seized $402,334 from a passenger
departing from Los Angeles International Airport en route to
Colombia. While performing a search for outbound currency
violations, an inspector found a duffel bag with two 5-quart
cooker/fryers packed in boxes. The unusual weight of the boxes
caused the inspector to examine their contents, whereupon he
noticed that the screws holding the bottoms of the appliances had
been tampered with. Upon removing the screws, the inspector found
bundles of U.S. currency stuffed into the bottoms of the
appliances. </p>

<p> In November 1988 Customs seized $1,017,832 being transported
in checked baggage from Miami to Colombia. The currency consisted
primarily of $20 bills stacked in groups of 100 and bound by
rubber bands. The currency was packed among the wiring in
electric space heaters and in suitcases. A follow-up
investigation resulted in the seizure of an additional $2,400,000
from a garage at the residence of one of the violators identified
in the investigation. This currency was wrapped in foil and
concealed in microwave ovens and heaters awaiting shipment. </p>

<p> In January 1991 a Chicago O'Hare security guard at the X-ray
security point observed a large amount of currency hidden in a
false-bottom briefcase. The guard notified Customs officials, who
responded by performing a search of passengers boarding the
flight to Paris, which had a connection to Hong Kong. The CMIR
requirement was announced over the intercom prior to passengers
boarding the flight. The suspected violator approached an
inspector and declared $9,650. He was told that he had to declare
currency only if it exceeded $10,000. While boarding the
aircraft, the suspect was stopped in the jetway and advised again
of the currency requirement. He orally declared $100,000 but then
completed a CMIR for $105,000. He again was afforded an
opportunity to amend his declaration and did so for $170,000.
Customs' inspection disclosed the suspect was carrying $184,200,
which was then seized. </p>

<p> In September 1992 federal and state authorities performed an
outbound currency search of a commercial carrier's crew members
departing from New York-JFK with final destination to Colombia. A
flight attendant was stopped and informed of the currency
reporting requirement. She declared a total of $1,000. Upon
examination of her hand-carried crew bag, a Customs inspector
found $2,600 in a roll of toilet paper, $12,400 in an envelope,
$20,000 in a wooden box, $1,627 in her wallet, $5,000 in a
carry-on garment bag, $40,000 in a box of laundry detergent, and
$13,300 in her jacket pocket. In total, she was carrying $95,541.
The money was seized and the flight attendant was arrested. </p>

<p> Currency smugglers have become more sophisticated in their
concealment methods as Customs has targeted international flights
for outbound searches. One such technique is concealment on or
within the body itself. Figure 2.1, for example, shows an
individual who had strapped money to his waist and another
individual with money taped to his lower body. Customs documented
one case at New York-JFK where a woman had swallowed $7,500 in 15
condoms, hidden $3,500 in 7 condoms in a body cavity, and
concealed $47,894 in her baggage. </p>

<p> Figure 2.2 shows examples of money being extracted from a
lotion bottle and currency secreted in a false-bottom briefcase. </p>

Currency by Concealment on the Body </p>

Service. </p>

Personal Baggage </p>

Service. </p>

<p> Currency smuggling by air is not limited to passengers but
also may include air cargo. In the largest such detected case,
inspectors at New York-JFK found $6,469,024 in 26 sealed metal
containers. In another case, inspectors found $1,752,106 in cash
and money orders in a water heater. Figure 2.3 is a Customs
diagram of how this money was concealed. In still another case,
airline employees accidentally pierced the support railing on a
pallet containing empty fruit boxes, eventually leading to the
discovery of $989,915 hidden in hollowed-out portions of the
wood. </p>

$1,752,106 in Currency </p>

Service. </p>

<p> LAND </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.2 </p>

<p> Smuggling currency across land border crossings lacks some of
the advantages of using air carriers. First, there are only two
countries--Mexico and Canada--that border the United States. If
the actual currency is bound for some other country, it still has
to be converted or shipped again from the intermediate stop.
Also, the smuggler must physically go to the border rather than
simply board an international flight. </p>

<p> At the same time, border crossings offer advantages for
smugglers. Customs presence tends to be less at the outbound
stations, and inspections are infrequent because they create
massive traffic jams. Even if outbound searches are being
performed, the individual still can wait until the last minute to
turn around, seek another crossing, or prepare a CMIR. If the
smuggler wishes to exit at an official crossing, Customs
maintains 98 ports on the Canadian border and 36 on the Mexican
border. Also, the smuggler can easily carry the currency across
the border at some point where it is not patrolled. </p>

<p> Another advantage of land border crossings is that the
smuggler often has a vehicle in which to conceal currency.
Customs agents have found currency in obvious locations, such as
on the seat and in the trunk, as well as in concealed locations,
such as false compartments, dashboards, and door panels. Customs
officials said that unless they have some evidence that these
unusual concealment methods are being used, they are not likely
to perform the detailed searches necessary to disclose the hidden
funds during routine inspections. </p>

<p> Figure 2.4 shows some of the problems associated with
preventing currency smuggling at land border crossings. In many
locations on the Canadian border there is no Customs presence at
all, and individuals and vehicles can cross the border at will.
For example, one picture shows a crossing on an isolated country
road in Vermont while another shows a crossing on a residential
street in a Vermont town. Another picture shows the unpatrolled
nature of the border in a Washington town, where an individual
can enter Canada simply by walking across a park. </p>

<p> Figure 2.4: Typical Unpatrolled Crossing Points on the
U.S.-Canadian Border </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> Even where Customs does have a checkpoint, the emphasis is
generally on inbound traffic. Figure 2.5 graphically illustrates
the differences in control of inbound and outbound traffic on the
Mexican border. In this typical crossing at San Ysidro,
California, there is a considerable backup on the Mexican side,
while cars and pedestrians from the United States cross into
Mexico unimpeded. </p>

<p> Figure 2.5: U.S.-Mexican Border Crossing at Otay Mesa,
California (Inbound on Left, Outbound on Right) </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> In another example of currency being smuggled across a land
border, Customs stopped an individual crossing into Mexico as a
pedestrian at Otay Mesa, California. When asked if he had
currency to declare and informed of the CMIR requirement, the
individual told the Customs agents he was carrying $9,000. A
search of the individual disclosed $14,010 in a portfolio, $2,126
in his pants pockets, and $200 in his wallet. After he refused
once more to complete a CMIR, Customs seized the currency--except
for $200 he was allowed to keep in order to continue on to his
stated destination--and allowed the individual to leave the
country. A follow-up investigation revealed that this individual
had submitted CMIRs during previous crossings, proving that he
was aware of the reporting requirement. </p>

<p> In another case, four individuals were crossing the border at
Hidalgo, Texas, in a van. Asked by Customs if they had currency
to declare, they responded that they did not. After a search
located two suspicious envelopes, they again were asked and again
responded that they had nothing to declare. A search of the
envelopes led to the seizure of $18,657 and the arrest of two of
the occupants. </p>

<p> In November 1990, Customs inspectors and Border Patrol agents
located in Holland, Vermont, seized $1,289,700 destined for
Canada. The violators were arrested for attempting to transport
unreported currency out of the United States using heavy-duty
all-terrain vehicles on a back road. </p>

<p> SEA </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.3 </p>

<p> Smuggling money by commercial shipping is even more
cumbersome than by land, since (1) it may require the use of
other parties such as exporters or ship personnel and (2) the
smuggler may be physically separated from the currency for long
periods. At the same time, however, shipping offers certain
advantages for smuggling. Ships leave U.S. harbors bound for
countries around the world, and ship cargo typically involves
such large containers that currency is very easy to conceal and
difficult to detect. </p>

<p> Customs recently has begun to target sea shipments for
outbound inspections, and several large dollar value seizures
have been made. In September 1989, for example, Customs
inspectors in Newark seized $763,240 that had been concealed
beneath the floor of a refrigeration unit in a ship bound for
Colombia. </p>

<p> In July 1992, Customs inspectors at the Newark seaport seized
$7,175,161 from two 20-foot containers loaded with dried peas on
board a vessel destined for Colombia. The violator, a packing and
shipping company, had freshly painted each container in order to
conceal the false front walls. A subsequent investigation led to
the seizure of an additional $4,000,000 when a suspect was
apprehended at his residence, bringing the total seizure amount
to over $11 million. According to Customs, the violator said the
seizure represented approximately 1 month's drug profits. </p>

<p> In March 1992 the press reported that Panamanian authorities
had seized $7.1 million from two containers on a ship inbound
from Miami. The money had been scheduled for deposit in a Spanish
bank in Panama. The money launderer was believed to have been
using a U.S. paper company as a front for his operations. </p>

<p> A report prepared by Customs Office of Intelligence in
January 1989 noted that smugglers were likely to continue their
use of commercial shipping due to the minimal risk involved. </p>

<p> MAIL </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.4 </p>

<p> Federal law enforcement agencies agree that a significant
amount of currency is being sent out of the country through the
U.S. mail and commercial carriers without being reported.
Officials at Customs, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and
FinCEN said that although the extent of the problem could not be
measured, the U.S. mail and private mail couriers are being used
to send currency (primarily money orders) out of the country
without the required CMIR being filed. The volume of mail and
packages leaving the country each day--as well as the large
amount of currency that a single package can hold--makes this a
relatively easy and safe means of smuggling money out of the
country. </p>

<p> An intelligence report issued by Customs in January of 1989
cited several cases that lend credibility to the belief that
smugglers use mail and international air courier companies to
smuggle currency overseas. In March 1988, for example, Customs
officials in Los Angeles reported that they were working a joint
investigation with Newark, New Jersey, involving the shipment of
cashier's checks for amounts under $10,000 to Panama in which the
smuggler used three private delivery services and the U.S. Postal
Service. </p>

<p> More recently, a Customs inspection at a private carrier's
hub in Memphis found large amounts of currency in packages
supposedly carrying business documents. One of the packages
contained $30,000 in money orders, the second $30,000 in
traveler's checks, and the third $16,800 in money orders.
Although the packages were sent by two separate entities, all
were bound for Colombia. </p>

<p> Similarly, the Postal Inspection Service has seized currency
being mailed to overseas locations during its own money
laundering investigations. Specific data on the number and dollar
amount of seizures made by the Inspection Service are
unavailable, but the Service estimates that as many as 25
separate criminal organizations are involved in sending
unreported currency and money orders out of the country through 1
major airport on the East Coast alone. </p>

<p> CUSTOMS HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS IN COMBATTING CURRENCY SMUGGLING
</p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 3 </p>

<p> In order to collect revenues and interdict illegal imports,
most Customs resources are dedicated to inspecting passengers and
cargo entering the country. Even so, the Service does have a
nationwide effort under way to interdict illegal exports.
Included in this initiative is one program specifically aimed at
the interdiction of currency being smuggled out of the country. </p>

<p> In the 4-year period ending in September 1992 Customs seized
over $170 million in unreported currency. Although this is a
substantial amount, Customs officials acknowledge that it is
small in comparison to the amount that is probably leaving the
country undetected. </p>

<p> Recent Customs initiatives have increased the direction and
emphasis given to efforts to curb currency smuggling. Given a
limited pool of resources, however, any increase in outbound
inspection programs is generally at the expense of Customs'
inbound interdiction efforts. </p>

<p> OUTBOUND INSPECTIONS FOR UNREPORTED CURRENCY AND OTHER
ILLEGAL EXPORTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:1 </p>

<p> The Customs Service has traditionally emphasized those
programs directed at inspecting the flow of persons and cargo
into the country. Relatively few resources have been devoted to
outbound inspections. Customs performs its outbound currency
interdiction program as a part of an overall outbound enforcement
effort that includes other contraband items, such as precursor
chemicals for the manufacture of illegal drugs, stolen vehicles,
high-technology equipment, guns and weapons, and any material
being exported to embargoed nations. </p>

<p> Customs does not collect data for measuring how much time and
effort are spent on outbound inspection efforts as opposed to
inbound inspections. Based on the following statistics, however,
outbound inspections appear to receive less emphasis than inbound
inspections: </p>

<p> Only 85 of the more than 300 ports have dedicated outbound
enforcement teams. However, these 85 ports include many of the
major ports, including international airports. </p>

<p> Of the 6,228 Customs inspectors nationwide, only 130 have
been assigned to outbound inspections on a full-time basis as of
fiscal year 1993. </p>

<p> Although no records are available on the level of outbound
inspections, Customs officials said the rate was much lower than
for inbound traffic, where about 8 percent of cargo is subject to
inspection. </p>

<p> Of the various Customs programs targeting illegal exports,
one program--&quot;Operation Buckstop&quot;--is specifically
intended to prevent the unreported export of currency from the
United States. Historically, outbound inspections for the purpose
of interdicting currency were done at only a few locations and as
special operations. The locations chosen for the inspections were
limited to suspected routes of unreported currency destined for
narcotic producing and bank-haven countries. Operation Buckstop
was initiated as a nationwide special operation in February 1986,
and between 1988 and 1991 it was expanded and incorporated with
other national outbound enforcement programs. </p>

<p> Today, Operation Buckstop is the generic term for all Customs
Service efforts to inspect outgoing passengers and cargo to
interdict currency being smuggled out of the country. In general,
these efforts mirror inbound inspections. Individuals and cargo
shipments are screened and some are chosen for more detailed
examination based on the judgment of the Customs inspector.
Because of limited resources and the emphasis on inbound
inspections, however, outbound inspections are the exception
rather than the rule. Consequently, Customs is very selective
when targeting ports for implementing a Buckstop operation. </p>

<p> According to Customs officials, there is no typical Operation
Buckstop inspection effort. Participation and specific operating
procedures are left to the discretion of individual Customs
district offices and ports. Some Operation Buckstop efforts are
port initiatives, while others are coordinated at the district
level. Some districts and ports have inspectors specifically
dedicated to Buckstop inspections on a full-time basis. Others
have a cadre of inspectors dedicated to outbound inspections,
some of whom participate in Buckstop efforts. Finally, some
locations use whatever inspectors are available at the time. </p>

<p> Districts and ports also vary in the number of inspectors
involved and the frequency with which they perform Buckstop
inspections. For example: </p>

<p> The San Diego district has a designated team of inspectors
for Buckstop operations that rotates among the seven ports within
the district. One day the team may be at the San Ysidro land
border crossing, the next at the international airport, and the
next at the seaport. </p>

<p> Some large airports, such as Los Angeles International (LAX)
and New York-JFK, have dedicated teams of Buckstop inspectors
that work selected flights but differ on the frequency of
inspections. Inspections at LAX are performed 8 hours a day,
while outbound inspections at New York's JFK are performed from 6
a.m. to midnight. Only a limited number of flights can be
targeted for inspections, based on the workload and the
availability of the dedicated inspectors. </p>

<p> In the St. Albans, Vermont, district, an outbound inspection
that includes Buckstop efforts is performed at land border
crossings for a 24-hour period once every 6 months. There are no
full-time outbound or Buckstop teams; rather, the inspectors
available at the time perform the inspections. </p>

<p> To augment these efforts, Customs headquarters and some of
the ports involved in Operation Buckstop have developed special
initiatives from time to time. For example, we identified the
following during our site visits: </p>

<p> Operation Million Air. This effort specifically targeted
private aircraft. In San Diego, it included Customs' Office of
Enforcement agents, personnel from Customs' Command Communication
Intelligence Unit, and special agents from the Federal Aviation
Administration. The first operation resulted in five seizures,
two of them involving a total of $223,786 in currency. </p>

<p> Operation Pistachio. In this effort, Chicago O'Hare
inspectors specifically targeted weekend flights, because
Operation Buckstop normally is restricted to the regular work
week. Currency seizures totalling over $350,000 from previous
inspections prompted this initiative. </p>

<p> Operation Backdoor. The Nogales, Arizona, district targeted
two land border crossings and seized nearly $400,000 from
motorists over an 8-month period. This effort was similar to one
known as &quot;Operation Pipeline&quot; in Blaine, Washington. </p>

<p> Operation Cyclops II. This initiative resulted in the seizure
of over $1 million in negotiable monetary instruments passing
through Los Angeles International Airport. Five arrests were also
made. </p>

<p> As with all inbound or outbound inspections, Operation
Buckstop inspections are performed by port personnel working
under the authority of Customs' Office of Inspection and Control.
If the inspectors determine that an individual is in violation of
the reporting requirements during their examinations, the
individual is detained and the local Office of the U.S. Attorney
is contacted to determine the likelihood the case will be
prosecuted and what action to take. For various
reasons--including an extensive caseload of higher priority
offenses--the U.S. Attorney may decline to prosecute. In this
event, Customs can still seize the currency and seek civil
forfeiture of the funds. If the amount in question is less than
$500,000, the forfeiture may be pursued administratively. </p>

<p> Resource constraints contribute significantly to determining
when and where Buckstop inspections are performed. At the ports
visited, we found that the staffing on outbound enforcement teams
ranged from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 20 persons. To
supplement their staffing, some districts and ports obtain
assistance from the National Guard, state and local authorities,
and special task force operations. However, the extent to which
these resources were used varied, and no records were kept to
determine the level of effort expended. </p>

<p> Customs officials said the lack of resources was not merely a
matter of personnel. They noted that much of the traffic leaving
the country is bulk cargo, which is difficult to inspect without
large and sophisticated equipment. Customs has a shortage of such
equipment and the equipment it does have--like the
personnel-tends to be devoted to inbound inspections. </p>

<p> To illustrate the level of Buckstop inspections, we obtained
statistics from Chicago O'Hare, one of the country's busiest
international airports. As of September 1992, an average of 1,888
flights a month left O'Hare for foreign destinations. The number
of flights inspected each month averaged 64, from a low of 18 to
a high of 135. An average of 32.17 percent of the passengers on
these flights was interviewed or otherwise subjected to
inspections. These inspections resulted in 59 seizures of
outbound currency totaling $1,759,328. </p>

<p> In June 1992 Customs dedicated 10 full-time inspector
positions to outbound inspections at O'Hare. While this has
increased coverage, the team typically works overlapping shifts
through the regular work week. These shifts result in coverage
for 13-1/2 hours daily. At the time of our visit, almost no
inspections were made at other hours during the day or on
Sundays, except for special operations. </p>

<p> SEIZURES OF CURRENCY BEING SMUGGLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:2 </p>

<p> In fiscal year 1989 Customs began to accumulate statistics
for all seizures of currency resulting from all outbound
interdiction efforts, including those seized as a result from
Operation Buckstop inspections. From fiscal year 1989 through
fiscal year 1992, Customs made 2,940 outbound currency seizures
totaling $171.3 million. Customs officials said that this figure
represents only that amount that can be attributed to the direct
interdiction of currency being smuggled out of the country. We
were also told that on a number of occasions currency has been
seized during an investigation and it was later determined that
an attempt to smuggle it out of the country had been planned. In
these cases, however, the seized currency is not counted as
resulting from interdiction efforts. </p>

<p> Table 3.2 shows the number and dollar values of outbound
seizures since fiscal year 1989 compared to all currency seizures
made by Customs over the same period. </p>

<p> Due to the lengthy forfeiture process and the methods used to
maintain statistics, we were unable to determine the percentage
of the above seizures actually resulting in forfeitures to the
government. Customs officials said that many of the smaller
seizures are returned during the administrative adjudications
after a fine has been levied. However, most of the seizures
exceeding $100,000 are eventually forfeited. Figure 3.1 describes
the number and value of seizures of $100,000 or more made since
1989. </p>

<p> Figure 3.1: Number and Dollar Amount of Outbound Seizures of
$100,000 or More </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> A relatively small number of ports account for the bulk of
currency seizures. However, as shown in figure 3.2, 10 of these
ports accounted for about 85 percent of the $42.4 million seized
during the year. New York-JFK alone accounted for more than a
third of the seizures. (See app. II for a list of the 52 ports
that reported seizures in fiscal year 1992.) </p>

<p> Figure 3.2: 10 Ports Accounted for Most of the Outbound
Currency Seizures in Fiscal Year 1992 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> Customs does not maintain overall statistics on the number of
outbound inspections made, so there is no readily available way
to determine the frequency with which violations are identified
during a Buckstop inspection. Customs officials at the ports we
visited told us that most outbound currency seizures result from
labor-intensive &quot;cold hit&quot; examinations rather than
long-term investigative actions. They also said that seizures
come from individuals of varying nationalities and headed for
destinations around the world, which makes it even more difficult
to profile any particular suspects or target specific flights.

<p> For fiscal years 1991 and 1992, smuggling attempts on
commercial airlines yielded the most seizures by dollar value. As
discussed in chapter 2, Customs officials believe that commercial
air travel is a favored means for smuggling currency because the
travel time is short, the individual stays close to the money,
and almost any destination is readily accessible. For this
reason, Customs tends to perform more outbound inspections at
airports. Customs officials were not sure whether the large
volume of seizures on commercial airlines was due to this being
the most prevalent type of conveyance or to this being the area
where Customs devoted more resources. Table 3.4 shows the
seizures for fiscal years 1991 and 1992 by method of conveyance. </p>

<p> Customs officials believe that the impact of Operation
Buckstop is much greater than the actual seizures appear to show.
They said that the program is also resulting in additional
compliance with CMIR requirements. They pointed out that in
performing the inspections, the inspectors often require
travelers to complete a CMIR on the spot rather than seizing the
currency. For example, Chicago-O'Hare made 59 seizures of
outbound currency totaling $1,759,328 during calendar year 1992.
Customs officials told us that during this same period, they
caused an additional $4,747,288 to be reported on CMIRs. </p>

<p> PORT FACILITIES MAKE OUTBOUND INSPECTIONS DIFFICULT </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:3 </p>

<p> The physical location of outbound inspections can pose a
problem for Operation Buckstop that has no parallel for inbound
inspections. </p>

<p> When performing inbound inspections, Customs can keep
individuals or goods from being released until Customs officials
have conducted the necessary examinations. At each port, Customs
maintains a facility for these purposes. </p>

<p> Outbound inspections are much harder to perform. One reason
is that individuals and businesses traditionally have been
allowed to leave the country without having to be inspected and
are resistant to the delays and inconvenience involved in
outbound inspections. This difference is obvious in the aerial
photograph of the border crossing at San Ysidro, as shown in
Figure 3.3. Note the backup on the inbound (Mexican) side
compared to the no traffic backup on the outbound (U.S.) side.
During Operation Buckstop inspections, the same type of backup
would take place on the outbound side. </p>

<p> While conditions at seaports and airports are somewhat
different, the principle is the same. Outbound searches add to
the departure time. Customs officials said that even if they had
sufficient resources to perform the same level of outbound
searches they perform for inbound traffic, the resistance from
industry and international passengers would be another factor
that would have to be considered. </p>

<p> OUTGOING U.S. MAIL IS PRECLUDED FROM OPERATION BUCKSTOP
INSPECTIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:4 </p>

<p> As we noted in chapter 2, federal law enforcement agencies
agree that a significant amount of currency is being sent out of
the country through the U.S. mail and commercial carriers without
being reported. Customs performs warrantless searches of parcels
being sent out of the country by commercial carriers, but the
legal authority of Customs to inspect outgoing U.S. mail without
a search warrant is a matter of dispute between Customs and the
Postal Service. </p>

<p> \4 Consequently, Customs inspects outbound mail only after it
has determined through an investigation that there is probable
cause for obtaining a search warrant. </p>

<p> As discussed in a previous report,\5 the Postal Service
believes that Customs does not have the statutory authority to
inspect outgoing mail without a search warrant. As a result, the
Postal Service has precluded Customs from initiating routine and
random inspection efforts such as Operation Buckstop for U.S.
mail being sent out of the country. </p>

<p> Without the ability to perform warrantless searches, Customs
cannot conduct outbound inspection programs such as Operation
Buckstop when the U.S mail is involved. Customs officials told us
they believe that if there were Operation Buckstop searches done
on the U.S. mail--even on the limited basis as done at other
border crossings--millions of dollars in unreported currency
would be seized as well as the country's borders made more secure
against other types of illegal exports. </p>

<p> Customs and the Postal Service are aware of this problem and
have been working toward a solution. In July 1992, the agencies
began drafting proposed amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act and
Title 39 statutes governing postal operations under which Customs
would perform warrantless searches of outbound mail. They also
began working on an agreement to implement warrantless search
procedures should the amendments be enacted. However, as of
November 1993, Customs and the Postal Service had been unable to
reach an agreement on either the proposed amendments or the
working arrangements. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \4 The authority of Customs to perform certain warrantless
searches of mail coming into the country was upheld in a 1977
Supreme Court decision (United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606
(1977). </p>

<p> \5 Export Controls: Use of the Mail to Illegally Export
Sensitive Technology (GAO/C-NSIAD-90-31, May 18, 1990). </p>

<p> CUSTOMS IS INCREASING THE EMPHASIS GIVEN OUTBOUND INSPECTIONS
</p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:5 </p>

<p> The Customs Service is aware of the impact of currency
smuggling on efforts to combat money laundering and has
implemented several initiatives to emphasize the importance of
outbound inspections to interdict unreported currency. These
efforts are also designed to increase and improve management of
outbound inspections on a nationwide basis. </p>

<p> In its 1991 U.S. Customs National Financial Enforcement
Strategy and Implementation Plan, Customs cited as a key
objective the need to continue exploring and developing new and
innovative outbound operations in the private aircraft, cargo,
passenger, land border, and courier areas. This directive also
instructed the district directors to integrate outbound currency
interdiction initiatives into their district drug strategies. </p>

<p> In an effort to increase the overall effectiveness of
outbound currency searches through greater uniformity and
coordination, a Customs' survey team of headquarters and regional
staff visited seven major airport locations participating in the
Operation Buckstop initiative during 1991. The survey team's
objective was to determine whether the success experienced in
outbound currency interdiction at Miami and New York-JFK was
attributable to a greater incidence of smuggling or to personnel,
procedures, or strategies in place at these locations. </p>

<p> In its report, the survey team acknowledged that each
location was facing increased pressures on inbound processing as
the number of flights and arriving passengers and cargo workload
ontinued to rise. This workload, coupled with the ever-present
narcotics threat, had caused Customs headquarters to direct local
ports to allocate resources accordingly. Fewer and less-intensive
Operation Buckstop operations resulted. The survey team made the
following conclusions and recommendations in order to increase
the overall effectiveness of Operation Buckstop: </p>

<p> The outbound currency threat is &quot;as great as ever&quot;
and Customs is not addressing the problem on a continuing basis.
The ports should establish dedicated outbound teams that would
concentrate on Operation Buckstop. </p>

<p> Resources are available that are not being fully used in
support of Operation Buckstop. Ports need to increase their use
of such resources as the National Guard, state and local law
enforcement authorities, and joint task forces. Also, ports
should conduct special outbound initiatives using asset
forfeiture funds when appropriate. </p>

<p> The use of specialized equipment such as X-ray vans for
outbound currency interdiction under Operation Buckstop has
received lower priority than for incoming cargo. Customs needs to
purchase more of this equipment. </p>

<p> There are no national directives on training, procedures,
intensity, or regularity of inspections required under Operation
Buckstop. Program standards, such as a national directive, are
needed to resolve inconsistencies and reemphasize the importance
of Operation Buckstop. </p>

<p> As a result of the airport survey report, Customs is
developing a national directive and establishing a National Task
Force to develop a handbook to ensure that minimum uniform
standards are adhered to during Buckstop operations. The drafts
of these documents emphasize the factors management feels are
crucial for a successful outbound program, including effective
targeting and thorough port threat assessments and good working
relationships with Customs' Office of Enforcement. Customs
districts were informed of these plans in May 1992, but, as of
November 1993, the directive and handbook had not yet been issued
in final form. </p>

<p> On March 1, 1993, Customs initiated a joint operation
involving the Service's Office of Inspection and Control and
Office of Enforcement. &quot;Operation Outlook&quot; is a
sustained outbound enforcement operation that emphasizes currency
interdiction. Its purpose is to assess the threat of outbound
contraband, including unreported currency, on a
district-by-district basis and determine the resources required
to address the threat. Under Operation Outlook, Customs has taken
several steps designed to enhance its ability to combat currency
smuggling. These include the following: </p>

<p> Several dogs have been specially trained to detect concealed
U.S. currency and are on duty at several ports on a test basis.
These dogs have also been used to assist other ports in special
outbound enforcement efforts. </p>

<p> Certain conveyances, such as commercial parcel shipments,
have been targeted and certain areas of the borders have been
&quot;blitzed&quot; with additional staff and equipment resources
temporarily assigned. </p>

<p> Several efforts have begun to explore the feasibility of
increasing the use of intelligence sources, both in Customs and
other agencies, to better target specific cargo shipments and
carriers for outbound inspections. </p>

<p> On the basis of the results of the first 6 months of
Operation Outlook, Customs is optimistic about the operation. A
total of 599 outbound currency seizures were made from March
through August of 1993, a substantial increase from the 499
seizures made during the same time period in 1992. The 599
seizures represented $26.6 million in currency. In the 5-month
period prior to Operation Outlook, October 1992 through February
1993, 314 seizures totaling $12.6 million had been made. </p>

<p> The Customs Service has also increased the significance of
currency smuggling in its strategic plan. The Customs 5-year
plan, released in September 1993, identified four goals that must
be addressed in order for the Service to achieve its mission:
Trade, narcotics, money laundering, and outbound enforcement. The
interdiction of unreported currency is specifically highlighted
under both the money laundering and outbound enforcement goals. </p>

<p> CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:6 </p>

<p> Certain criminal activities, such as illegal drug sales,
produce a tremendous amount of currency that would be regarded as
suspicious unless it is disguised as legitimate. Consequently,
U.S. efforts to combat money laundering rely heavily upon the
reporting of transactions involving large amounts of cash. To
avoid these requirements, individuals have resorted to smuggling
the currency out of the country to spend or deposit it. </p>

<p> The Customs Service is responding to the growing threat posed
by currency smuggling by increasing national oversight of and
emphasis on its outbound inspection programs. In general,
however, any increase in outbound inspections reduces the level
of effort given inbound inspections. Determining the appropriate
balance between inbound and outbound interdiction efforts is an
extremely difficult task. Moreover, the solution is unlikely to
remain constant and will require periodic adjustments to reflect
changing circumstances. The Customs Service has demonstrated that
it is aware of the overall problem and the constraints it must
deal with to address it. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:7 </p>

<p> We provided a draft of this report to the Customs Service to
review and asked for oral comments. On January 14, 1994, we met
with the Assistant Commissioner, Inspection and Control, and his
staff, who told us that they agreed with the data and information
in the report. They also said that the report was an objective
and balanced presentation of the problems Customs faced in
combatting currency smuggling and accurately described the
agency's plans to increase these efforts in the future. They
offered several editorial suggestions to clarify certain
information, and we made these changes where appropriate. </p>

<p> In response to your request, we are providing you information
on U.S. antidrug efforts in Peru. Specifically, we ascertained
(1) the rationale for, and costs associated with, the
construction, maintenance, and operations of the Santa Lucia
base, an antidrug base in the Upper Huallaga Valley; (2) the
subsequent rationale for discontinuing support of the Santa Lucia
base; (3) and the current status of U.S. efforts to restructure
antidrug programs in Peru. </p>

<p> BACKGROUND </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :1 </p>

<p> Nearly two-thirds of the world's coca crop is grown in Peru.
Most of that coca is processed into cocaine base, which is flown
to Colombia to make cocaine for shipment to the United States and
Europe. Since the 1980s, the primary coca-growing and
drug-trafficking activities in Peru have been in its Upper
Huallaga Valley. </p>

<p> During the early 1980s, the United States provided support
for Peru to conduct manual eradication of mature coca leaf.
However, because of security concerns for personnel conducting
manual eradication, these activities ceased in 1987. Gradually,
the United States began to (1) support Peruvian efforts to
eradicate coca seedbeds and (2) conduct law enforcement
operations against drug-trafficking activities. Before 1989, both
operations were conducted by helicopter from Tingo Maria, about
150 miles southeast of Santa Lucia, the center of illegal drug
activities. In 1989, the United States and Peru moved their
operations to a base located near the town of Santa Lucia. The
base, which became the center of U.S. and Peruvian eradication
and law enforcement operations, supported between 430 and 492
personnel, including 32 U.S. personnel. The United States
continued to provide support to the base until late 1993. The map
on page 3 shows the locations of these bases. </p>

<p> The Departments of State and Defense and the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) coordinate antidrug activities with Peruvian
law enforcement and military organizations. At the U.S. embassy
in Peru, these functions are carried out by the Narcotics Affairs
Section (NAS), the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, and
the DEA Country Attache's Office. Other U.S. agencies also
provide support to Peruvian antidrug programs and operations. </p>

<p> RESULTS IN BRIEF </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :2 </p>

<p> The Santa Lucia base was constructed to serve as a secure
center to house and support antidrug forces responsible for
eradicating coca and conducting law enforcement activities to
stop the flow of illegal drugs from Peru through Colombia to the
United States. Between fiscal years 1988 and 1993, the State
Department spent about $49.2 million to construct, maintain, and
operate the base. In fiscal year 1994, the Congress reduced the
State Department's international Narcotics Control Program from
$148 million to $100 million. In December 1993, the U.S. embassy
restructured its antidrug programs in Peru because it could not
continue to support the base while also supporting other efforts
required in the U.S. antidrug strategy. The restructuring efforts
included (1) moving U.S. helicopter maintenance operations to a
Peruvian naval base in Pucallpa (see fig. 1), (2) turning over
the operation and maintenance of the Santa Lucia base to Peru,
and (3) returning the State Department's fixed-wing aircraft that
were used to support the base to the United States. </p>

<p> As part of the decision to stop supporting the Santa Lucia
Base, the executive branch approved a formal mobile basing
concept to implement antidrug efforts, which included
establishing an operational planning group within the U.S.
embassy. The U.S. embassy has been slow in implementing the
mobile basing concept because of maintenance problems with
helicopters, internal differences within the U.S. embassy over
how the group actually would function to coordinate law
enforcement operations, and the May 1994 decision by the United
States to stop sharing with the government of Peru information
that could be used to shoot down civilian aircraft suspected of
drug trafficking. Legislation was recently passed to allow
information sharing to resume; however, the administration has
not reached agreement with Peru on certain required
preconditions. </p>

<p> RATIONALE FOR BUILDING THE SANTA LUCIA BASE </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :3 </p>

<p> According to U.S. officials, the rationale for building the
Santa Lucia base was to place U.S. personnel in the safest
possible environment from which to conduct antidrug activities.
U.S. personnel flying into the heart of the drug-trafficking area
were increasingly at risk because in the mid-1980s, the Sendero
Luminoso--a Maoist organization attempting to overthrow the
Peruvian government--took control of the area. This group
protected those trafficking in drugs in return for monetary
support for the Sendero. </p>

<p> In 1988, the United States began to build the Santa Lucia
base, which included an airfield, a maintenance facility for 6 to
10 U.S. UH-1H helicopters used for eradication and law
enforcement missions, and housing. Because the base was in a
highly dense, tropical area with no safe, accessible roads,
fixed-wing aircraft (C-123s and C-130s) were supplied by the
State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters
(INM)\1 to transport personnel, equipment, and supplies to the
base from Lima several times each week. In addition, DEA and
Peruvian aircraft used the base for law enforcement operations. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 INM maintains an air wing of rotary and fixed-wing
aircraft to assist host governments in conducting
counternarcotics operations in several Central and South American
countries, including Peru. </p>

<p> COSTS OF THE SANTA LUCIA BASE </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4 </p>

<p> According to INM and U.S. embassy records, about $49.2
million was provided to construct, maintain, and operate the
Santa Lucia base during fiscal years 1988-93. These funds were
included as part of the State Department's International
Narcotics Control Program, which is authorized under the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961, section 481, as amended. INM provided
these funds for five projects in Peru (see table 1). </p>

<p> Total $49.2 </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> CONSTRUCTION COSTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4.1 </p>

<p> Included in the $9.8 million construction project are the
costs of daily laborers to construct the base and its related
infrastructure; installation of prefabricated housing; equipment
and commodities needed to construct and operate helicopter and
fixed-wing aircraft facilities and an airstrip; recreational
equipment, food, and clothing; and miscellaneous items such as
payments to the Peruvian engineer in charge of constructing the
airstrip and the rental of heavy equipment. </p>

<p> CORAH COSTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4.2 </p>

<p> The $16.9 million for CORAH was provided for the direct and
indirect costs of supporting between 200 and 250 Peruvian workers
to help construct, maintain, and operate Santa Lucia base;
provide support services; and perform limited antidrug duties.
Direct costs were for activities on the base, including operating
equipment such as electrical generators, providing food service,
cutting the grass, procuring supplies, and monitoring
U.S.-provided equipment to ensure that it was used for
counternarcotics purposes. </p>

<p> Indirect costs were for support provided from the CORAH
headquarters at Tingo Maria, including the purchase of food,
construction equipment such as trucks and a bulldozer, supplies
and materials, and general supplies for Santa Lucia; and
administrative support functions for CORAH personnel at the base.
</p>

<p> Between March 1990 and November 1993, 10 CORAH workers
eradicated coca seedbeds about 3 to 4 hours a day, 3 to 4 days a
week. This work was suspended in November 1993 because of
budgetary constraints. In addition, up to 50 CORAH workers
installed concrete obstacles to block </p>

<p> 10 illegal airstrips in the Upper Huallaga Valley. The costs
for blocking the airstrips could not be readily determined, but
the embassy's Narcotics Affairs Section said they were included
in the direct and indirect costs discussed above. </p>

<p> LAW ENFORCEMENT COSTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4.3 </p>

<p> About $6.4 million was spent for police support at Santa
Lucia, including (1) per diem for Peruvian police officers
stationed at the base to provide security for the base and for
workers on eradication missions and (2) commodities used by the
police to support the base. </p>

<p> PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT COSTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4.4 </p>

<p> About $4.6 million was provided for salaries and expenses of
the NAS staff and activities related to administrative support of
the base as well as other antidrug programs in Peru. Such support
included processing procurement vouchers for goods and services. </p>

<p> FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT COSTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4.5 </p>

<p> About $11.5 million was spent on operating and maintaining
the fixed-wing aircraft that transported personnel, supplies, and
other items to and from Santa Lucia. Generally, two C-123 and two
C-130 aircraft were used for these missions. This was funded by
INM's airwing account and not included in Peru's antidrug program
budget. </p>

<p> RATIONALE FOR SUSPENDING U.S. SUPPORT FOR SANTA LUCIA BASE </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5 </p>

<p> The Congress reduced the State Department's annual
International Narcotics Control Program request for fiscal year
1994 from $148 million to $100 million. After coordinating with
various U.S. agencies involved in antidrug activities regarding
program options, the State Department decided that it could not
adequately support maintenance and operations at the Santa Lucia
base while supporting its antidrug programs in Peru and other
countries. Thus, in December 1993, the United States stopped
supporting the base and the Peruvian government assumed
responsibility for the base's administrative and operational
control. </p>

<p> State Department officials reported that although trafficking
activities had moved outside of the immediate range of
U.S.-provided helicopters, they would have maintained the Santa
Lucia base had the budget not been reduced. U.S. embassy
officials stated that they had already begun to cover an expanded
area by conducting helicopter operations using forward operating
locations outside of the Santa Lucia area. </p>

<p> STATUS OF RESTRUCTURING COUNTERNARCOTICS OPERATIONS IN </p>

<p> PERU </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6 </p>

<p> Some aspects of the restructured programs have been completed
and are in place. Specifically, NAS has moved its helicopter
maintenance facilities from Santa Lucia to Pucallpa and the
government of Peru is now responsible for operating the Santa
Lucia base. In addition, INM-owned fixed-wing aircraft used to
support U.S. antidrug operations have been returned to the United
States and fixed-wing aircraft are now being rented from Peru.
However, the U.S. embassy has faced a number of obstacles to
fully implementing a mobile basing concept for conducting
antidrug missions, including problems with helicopter
maintenance, internal conflicts over the responsibility for
planning and coordinating antidrug operations, and a U.S.
decision not to share with Peru real-time information and
assistance that could lead to the shoot down of civilian aircraft
suspected of drug trafficking. </p>

<p> MOVE TO PUCALLPA </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.1 </p>

<p> To stay within the budget, the State Department moved
helicopter maintenance facilities and associated U.S. and
Peruvian police personnel from Santa Lucia to several different
sites in Pucallpa, where an international airport is located. The
airport serves as the center from which operations are conducted
and for resupplying and supporting maintenance operations. The
airport also houses U.S. fixed-wing aircraft used by DEA and
other agencies to support law enforcement operations. The
maintenance facilities, aviation ground support equipment, and
spare parts for 10 UH-1H helicopters are located at a Peruvian
naval base in Pucallpa. About 15 U.S. contractor personnel assist
the Peruvian police in maintaining and operating the
helicopters.\2 A total of about 30 U.S. and 30 to 35 Peruvian
personnel live in a hotel about 10 minutes from the naval base. </p>

<p> The United States spent about $450,000 for (1) security
improvements to the hotel, (2) improvements to three warehouses
behind the hotel, (3) improvements to a refueling area, and (4)
refurbishment of a warehouse and extension of the perimeter wall
at the naval base. Planned projects include improvements to the
hotel and naval base and construction of a small hangar and ramp
area at the airport for fixed-wing aircraft. Cost estimates for
these projects were not available. </p>

<p> U.S. embassy personnel stated that U.S. personnel are not
allowed to leave the hotel unless they are transported in
official vehicles to and from work because of security concerns.
According to NAS personnel, morale at Santa Lucia was much better
because personnel were free to move around the base after work
and tended to interact more readily. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \2 DynCorp Aerospace, Inc., a private contractor, provides
management, administrative, rotary-wing, and maintenance
services. </p>

<p> PERU'S SUPPORT OF SANTA LUCIA </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.2 </p>

<p> With the loss of U.S. support to Santa Lucia, the government
of Peru agreed to administer the base and maintain it as a
location from which antidrug operations could be conducted.
According to the U.S. Embassy's NAS Director, U.S. officials were
concerned that the government of Peru might be unable to provide
the resources needed to maintain and operate the base adequately.
At the time of our visit, the airstrip needed repair because of
holes in the runway and other maintenance problems. The NAS
Director estimated that about $1.5 million is needed to repair
the airstrip. Nevertheless, DEA is continuing to conduct antidrug
operations from the base. </p>

<p> ELIMINATING THE USE OF INM-OWNED FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT TO
SUPPORT ANTIDRUG OPERATIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.3 </p>

<p> Because the State Department stopped supporting the Santa
Lucia base, INM-owned fixed-wing support was terminated. In
December 1993, INM's fixed-wing aircraft--two C-123s and two
C-130s--and almost $10.1 million in aircraft spare parts were
shipped for storage to Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson,
Arizona. The 28 personnel responsible for maintaining the
aircraft were returned to the United States. To support antidrug
missions at Pucallpa, the embassy now rents fixed-wing aircraft
from the Peruvian air force and civilian companies. According to
the embassy, the monthly rental costs should be less than
$20,000. </p>

<p> MOBILE BASING CONCEPT </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.4 </p>

<p> The embassy's implementation of the mobile basing concept has
been complicated by several problems. The concept included the
following assumptions: </p>

<p> 8 to 10 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft would be
available for antidrug operations, and an operational planning
group would be established in the embassy to plan law enforcement
operations. </p>

<p> In early 1994, the Defense Department notified State that it
had to ground UH-1H helicopters that had certain engine numbers,
which had to be overhauled because of mechanical problems. This
created maintenance problems with the UH-1H helicopters that
limited the embassy's ability to fully support the mobile basing
concept. Five of the 10 helicopters used in Peru were grounded
for 6 weeks because their engines required overhaul. A total of
11 engines had to be overhauled at a cost of $1.65 million. The
five remaining helicopters were used extensively during the
6-week period, and thus, all subsequently needed maintenance at
about the same time. In June 1994, 3 of the 10 helicopters were
in for scheduled maintenance, leaving the embassy with only 7 to
conduct operations. Recent embassy reports say that high levels
of metal particles are being found in gear boxes and engines,
indicating excessive wear and use. An embassy official indicated
that this situation may cause future maintenance problems and
affect mobility of operations. </p>

<p> According to DEA officials, helicopter maintenance problems
have limited their ability to plan and conduct operations. For
example, a DEA official stated that of the 13 missions requiring
helicopter support during a recent 3-month period, the
helicopters experienced mechanical problems during 6 of them. In
two cases, DEA teams were delayed in the jungle because of the
problems. In addition, DEA's CASA-212 fixed-wing transport
aircraft was grounded for several months because of maintenance
problems. Finally, an embassy official stated that Peruvian
aircraft are frequently grounded because their mechanics have not
been properly trained. </p>

<p> To further complicate matters, the operational planning group
was not formally established by the U.S. Ambassador until July
1994, 7 months after the mobile basing concept was approved, and
has not yet been staffed. The delay was caused by internal
differences within the U.S. embassy about the structure and
staffing of the group. The NAS Director believed that the group
should be responsible for more than law enforcement operations
and include eradication operations, administrative and training
support to the Peruvian police, and other operations that may be
needed. He also believed that, since the group would be under the
DEA attache that it should be composed primarily with persons
having law enforcement backgrounds to ensure that DEA conducts
operations meeting U.S. antidrug objectives in Peru. DEA and U.S.
military personnel, on the other hand, believed that the group
should be primarily responsible for planning law enforcement
operations and be staffed with military personnel, who would be
more experienced in planning specific operations and identifying
logistics support requirements for law enforcement operations in
the jungle and interacting with Peruvian military forces in
planning military-type operations. According to U.S. officials,
the group will be staffed with DEA agents as well as military
personnel providing operational, communications, and logistical
expertise. The group will be under the control of the DEA country
attache. According to a U.S. embassy official, no specific
assignments of military personnel have been made to date. </p>

<p> CUT-OFF OF REAL-TIME U.S. ANTIDRUG INFORMATION </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.5 </p>

<p> Another factor affecting the mobile basing concept's
implementation is the May 1, 1994, decision to stop sharing
certain drug-trafficking information with the governments of
Colombia and Peru, which we reported on in August 1994.\3 </p>

<p> This step was taken because of legal concerns about the
probable criminal liability of U.S. personnel who provide
information that could lead to the shooting down of a civilian
aircraft suspected of transporting illegal drugs. According to
U.S. officials, the sharing of real-time information is critical
to ensuring that they can take timely action against
drug-trafficking activities to increase the risks associated with
these activities. The officials stated that the policy decision
had impacted on their ability to conduct antidrug operations. </p>

<p> Although the impact that the policy has had on the flow of
drugs being shipped from Peru to Colombia is unclear, it is clear
that pilots flying between Peru and Colombia have changed their
operations, since there is little fear of interception by U.S.
and Peruvian forces as long as detection capabilities remain
negligible and there is no sharing of information. </p>

<p> Various U.S. reports and officials have stated that, before
the May decision, drug traffickers wanted to minimize their
exposure to the air interdiction threat. Thus, they (1) used
fewer flights with larger drug loads, (2) flew mainly in the
early evening hours, and (3) spent on an average only about 10 to
12 minutes in loading and unloading their cargoes. U.S. officials
in Peru said that since the policy change, drug traffickers have
changed their operations and (1) have begun multiple flights with
smaller drug loads and (2) have begun flying during the day, and
some traffickers have doubled their time on the ground. In
addition, U.S. officials stated that an analysis of flight
patterns indicates that traffickers are reverting to more direct
air routes from Peru into Colombia instead of the indirect and
more time-consuming routes they were taking before the cutoff of
information. DEA officials advised us that the policy to not
share real-time information has caused them to forego law
enforcement operations against illegal drug activities. Finally,
a recent Defense Department report states that the policy of not
sharing real-time information has reduced the risks associated
with drug-trafficking activities in Peru. </p>

<p> On October 5, 1994, the President signed legislation that
provides official immunity for authorized U.S. personnel from
liability, notwithstanding any other provision of law, if
information they provide is used to shoot down civilian aircraft
suspected of drug trafficking. However, before sharing of
information can resume, the President must determine that (1)
illicit drug trafficking poses a national security threat to Peru
and (2) Peru has appropriate procedures in place to protect
against the innocent loss of life. The executive branch is
discussing this issue with the Peruvian government. As of
November 30, 1994, the sharing of information had not yet
resumed. </p>

LETTER </p>

<p> February 1995 </p>

<p> The President of the Senate </p>

<p> The Speaker of the House of Representatives </p>

<p> In 1990, the General Accounting Office began a special effort
to </p>

<p> review and report on the federal program areas we considered
high </p>

<p> risk because they were especially vulnerable to waste, fraud,
abuse, </p>

<p> and mismanagement. This effort, which has been strongly
supported by </p>

<p> the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House
Committee </p>

<p> on Government Reform and Oversight, brought much needed focus
to </p>

<p> problems that were costing the government billions of
dollars. </p>

<p> In December 1992, we issued a series of reports on the
fundamental </p>

<p> causes of problems in designated high-risk areas. We are
updating </p>

<p> the status of our high-risk program in this second series.
Our </p>

<p> Overview report (GAO/HR-95-1) discusses progress made in many
areas, </p>

<p> stresses the need for further action to address remaining
critical </p>

<p> problems, and introduces newly designated high-risk areas.
This </p>

<p> second series also includes a Quick Reference Guide
(GAO/HR-95-2) </p>

<p> that covers all 18 high-risk areas we have tracked over the
past few </p>

<p> years, and separate reports that detail continuing
significant </p>

<p> problems and resolution actions needed in 10 areas. </p>

<p> This report discusses the asset forfeiture programs of the </p>

<p> Departments of Justice and the Treasury. It describes the
progress </p>

<p> made in the management of seized and forfeited property since
our </p>

<p> December 1992 report. The value of seized property
inventories has </p>

<p> grown from a reported $33 million in 1979 to almost $2
billion in </p>

<p> 1994. Over the years, Justice and Treasury have transformed
their </p>

<p> problem-ridden seized property programs into more
businesslike </p>

<p> operations. However, some significant problems remain with
seized </p>

<p> property management. In recent years, interest in the asset </p>

<p> forfeiture programs has extended beyond property management
to </p>

<p> questioning whether forfeiture laws are applied appropriately
and </p>

<p> effectively and consideration of how forfeiture proceeds
should be </p>

<p> used. This report focuses on the most recent program changes
made </p>

<p> and highlights areas needing sustained management attention. </p>

<p> Copies of this report series are being sent to the President,
the </p>

<p> Republican and Democratic leadership of the Congress,
congressional </p>

<p> committee chairs and ranking minority members, all other
members of </p>

<p> the Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget, </p>

<p> the Attorney General, and the Secretary of the Treasury. </p>

<p> Charles A. Bowsher </p>

<p> Comptroller General </p>

<p> of the United States </p>

<p> OVERVIEW </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 0 </p>

<p> For more than 200 years, the federal government has had the
authority </p>

<p> to take property through forfeiture. Beginning about 1980,
the </p>

<p> number and value of seizures started growing dramatically as
law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies began relying more heavily on forfeiture
to </p>

<p> fight drug traffickers and other organized crime figures. The
</p>

<p> Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 expanded the
government's </p>

<p> seizure authority and established forfeiture funds within the
</p>

<p> departments of Justice and the Treasury.\1 Recently, asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> laws were expanded to cover crimes associated with money
laundering </p>

<p> and certain financial institutions-related offenses.
Collectively, </p>

<p> enforcement actions associated with these changes have
resulted in </p>

<p> the value of Justice's and Treasury's seized property
inventories </p>

<p> growing from a reported $33 million in 1979 to almost $2
billion in </p>

<p> 1994. </p>

<p> THE PROBLEM </p>

<p> As asset forfeiture programs grew in the 1980s, our attention
was </p>

<p> focused primarily on the management of seized and forfeited
property. </p>

<p> We found that property was not being properly cared for after
it was </p>

<p> seized, resulting in lost revenue to the government when the
property </p>

<p> was sold. Much has been accomplished in this area since the
1980s. </p>

<p> However, some significant problems remain with seized
property </p>

<p> management, and continued oversight is necessary. Also, the </p>

<p> departments of Justice and the Treasury continue to operate
two </p>

<p> similar but separate seized asset management and disposal
programs </p>

<p> without plans for consolidation, despite legislation
requiring them </p>

<p> to develop a plan to consolidate postseizure administration
of </p>

<p> certain properties.\2 </p>

<p> In recent years, interest in the asset forfeiture programs
has </p>

<p> extended beyond asset management to questioning whether
forfeiture </p>

<p> laws are applied appropriately and effectively and
consideration of </p>

<p> how forfeiture proceeds should be used. </p>

<p> PROGRESS </p>

<p> In our December 1992 high-risk report on asset forfeiture
programs, </p>

<p> we reported that major operational problems relating to the </p>

<p> management and disposition of seized and forfeited property
had been </p>

<p> identified and corrective actions were being initiated.
However, </p>

<p> although some management and systems changes have improved
program </p>

<p> operations, our recent audits of the Customs Service's fiscal
year </p>

<p> 1992 and 1993 financial statements revealed serious
weaknesses in key </p>

<p> internal controls and systems, which affected Customs'
ability to </p>

<p> control, manage, and report the results of its seizure
efforts, </p>

<p> including accountability and stewardship over property
seized. As a </p>

<p> result, tons of illegal drugs and millions of dollars in cash
and </p>

<p> other property have been vulnerable to theft and
misappropriation. </p>

<p> Customs recognizes the need for long-term and systematic </p>

<p> improvements, and its Commissioner established a senior
management </p>

<p> task force to review the seized property program in its
entirety. </p>

<p> Actions are being taken to address the internal control and
systems </p>

<p> problems; however, many of these efforts are in various
stages of </p>

<p> development. </p>

<p> Problems also persist with the Marshals Service's maintenance
and </p>

<p> disposal of seized and forfeited property, according to
recent </p>

<p> Department of Justice Office of Inspector General audit
reports. </p>

<p> These audits show the need for continued emphasis on and
vigilance </p>

<p> over seized property management. </p>

<p> We also reported in December 1992 that Justice and Treasury
were </p>

<p> pursuing an initiative for consolidating postseizure
management of </p>

<p> noncash seized property inventories. Legislation enacted in
1988 </p>

<p> required them to develop a plan to consolidate postseizure </p>

<p> administration of certain properties. Furthermore, in June
1991, we </p>

<p> identified substantial savings that could be realized through
merging </p>

<p> postseizure noncash property management functions. Although a
small </p>

<p> scale pilot project for consolidation was in effect from
October 1992 </p>

<p> through September 1993, no significant progress has been made
toward </p>

<p> consolidation. Since eliminating duplicate programs is one of
the </p>

<p> Vice President's National Performance Review goals, Justice
and </p>

<p> Treasury should aggressively pursue options for efficiency
gains </p>

<p> through program consolidation. </p>

<p> Our December 1992 high-risk report also highlighted growing
interest </p>

<p> in the forfeiture programs regarding the appropriate
application of </p>

<p> the asset forfeiture laws. In 1993, the Supreme Court issued
three </p>

<p> decisions that more clearly define the appropriate use of
asset </p>

<p> forfeiture authority. Also, several bills were proposed in
the last </p>

<p> Congress to put tighter controls on forfeiture. The
departments of </p>

<p> Justice and the Treasury have each taken several actions in
an effort </p>

<p> to strengthen the integrity of the asset forfeiture program, </p>

<p> including implementing new policy guidance intended to ensure
that </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies do not become overzealous in their
use of </p>

<p> the asset forfeiture laws or become too dependent on the
funds </p>

<p> derived from seizures. </p>

<p> OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE </p>

<p> The two agencies with custodial responsibilities for seized
property, </p>

<p> the Marshals Service for Justice and the Customs Service for </p>

<p> Treasury, have made improvements in seized property
management and </p>

<p> disposition over the years. However, significant problems
remain and </p>

<p> continued oversight is necessary to ensure policies and
procedures </p>

<p> are followed and adequate safeguards are in place. In
addition, </p>

<p> Justice and Treasury should aggressively pursue options for </p>

<p> efficiency gains through program consolidation. We will
continue to </p>

<p> monitor seized property management activities. </p>

<p> Much attention has been focused on the appropriate
application of the </p>

<p> asset forfeiture laws. It is too soon to tell whether the
recent </p>

<p> actions taken by Justice and Treasury will provide sufficient
</p>

<p> safeguards against improper seizures. Ensuring that adequate </p>

<p> safeguards are in place and adhered to will require
considerable </p>

<p> forfeiture program management attention and oversight in the
future. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 The funds were originally created within the Department of
Justice </p>

<p> and U.S. Customs Service. The Congress established the
Department </p>

<p> of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund in October 1992 to supersede
the </p>

<p> Customs Fund. </p>

<p> \2 The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-690,
21 </p>

<p> U.S.C. 887 (1988). </p>

<p> BACKGROUND </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 1 </p>

<p> Asset forfeiture programs were intended to (1) punish and
deter </p>

<p> criminal activity by depriving criminals of property used or
acquired </p>

<p> through illegal activities and (2) make seized property
available as </p>

<p> assets to strengthen law enforcement. Seized and forfeited
property </p>

<p> can be cash, bank accounts, automobiles, boats, airplanes,
jewelry, </p>

<p> art objects, or real estate. Justice and Treasury also seize </p>

<p> thousands of tons of illegal drugs and counterfeit items that
have no </p>

<p> resale value to the federal government. These items are
typically </p>

<p> held by the agencies until they are approved for destruction.
</p>

<p> Although the government has had forfeiture authority for over
200 </p>

<p> years, it was rarely utilized as a law enforcement tool until
the </p>

<p> 1980s. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 expanded </p>

<p> forfeiture authority and established asset forfeiture funds
within </p>

<p> the Department of Justice and the U.S. Customs Service to
hold the </p>

<p> proceeds of forfeitures and to finance program-related
expenses (for </p>

<p> example, property management expenses) as well as certain law
</p>

<p> enforcement activities, such as the payment of rewards for </p>

<p> information related to asset seizure and training directly
related to </p>

<p> the asset forfeiture program. </p>

<p> Until recently, Treasury law enforcement agencies other than
Customs </p>

<p> (the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Criminal
Investigation </p>

<p> Division of the Internal Revenue Service; and the U.S. Secret
</p>

<p> Service) participated in the Justice Fund. In October 1992,
the </p>

<p> Congress created the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to supersede
the </p>

<p> Customs Fund.\3 The Treasury agencies that previously
participated in </p>

<p> the Justice Fund began making deposits into the Treasury Fund
in </p>

<p> October 1993. Figure 1 shows the two fund receipts for the
years </p>

<p> they have been in operation. </p>

<p> Figure 1: Forfeiture Fund </p>

<p> Receipts, Fiscal Years 1985 </p>

<p> Through 1994 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Sources: Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury,
and U.S. </p>

<p> Customs Service. </p>

<p> These funds have always collected more than the allowable
expenses </p>

<p> that could be charged against them.\4 Year-end surpluses in
the </p>

<p> Justice Fund have historically been used for law enforcement </p>

<p> purposes, such as building prisons, hiring U.S. Attorney
office </p>

<p> personnel, or funding special activities through the Office
of </p>

<p> National Drug Control Policy. Year-end surpluses in the
Customs Fund </p>

<p> were transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.
Beginning in </p>

<p> fiscal year 1995, the year-end surpluses in the Treasury
Forfeiture </p>

<p> Fund will be available to the Secretary of the Treasury for
any law </p>

<p> enforcement activity of a federal agency. </p>

<p> Asset forfeiture legislation authorizes Justice and Treasury
to share </p>

<p> forfeiture proceeds with state and local law enforcement
agencies and </p>

<p> foreign governments that participate in law enforcement
efforts </p>

<p> leading to seizure and forfeiture. From fiscal years 1986
through </p>

<p> 1994, Justice and Treasury shared over $1.4 billion and $394
million, </p>

<p> respectively, in forfeited property and cash with over 3,000
state </p>

<p> and local law enforcement agencies. </p>

<p> As the forfeiture programs grew in the 1980s, Justice and
Customs </p>

<p> experienced significant problems with asset management and </p>

<p> disposition. However, as the programs matured, the agencies
gained </p>

<p> more control of them. Improvements made in the areas of
seized </p>

<p> property management and management information systems were
discussed </p>

<p> in our December 1992 high-risk report. For example, in 1987
Justice </p>

<p> and Customs established policies designed to minimize the
unnecessary </p>

<p> holding of seized cash. Also, legislation enacted in 1990
subjects </p>

<p> the funds to annual financial audits. These audits have been
done </p>

<p> each year since 1990. However, problems remain with property </p>

<p> management and, therefore, continual oversight is necessary.
One </p>

<p> issue that still has not been resolved is the consolidation
of </p>

<p> Justice's and Treasury's seized property management
functions. </p>

<p> \4 Allowable expenses exclude certain costs such as salaries
and </p>

<p> benefits of seizing agents which are borne by the seizing
agency. </p>

<p> PROGRESS AND CONTINUING CONCERNS </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 2 </p>

<p> In December 1992, we reported on the status of the asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> programs and progress made as well as emerging issues. The
following </p>

<p> examples describe the progress that has been made since that
time, </p>

<p> and the key continuing concerns. </p>

<p> SEIZED PROPERTY MANAGEMENT </p>

<p> PROBLEMS REMAIN </p>

<p> Our fiscal year 1992 and 1993 financial statement audits of
the U.S. </p>

<p> Customs Service revealed inadequate safeguards over, and
incomplete </p>

<p> and inaccurate accounting and reporting of, seized property.
Customs </p>

<p> is taking steps to address these problems; however, these
efforts are </p>

<p> in various stages of development. </p>

<p> Customs conducted its first nationwide physical inventory of
seized </p>

<p> property, drugs, and currency in February 1994. As a result
of this </p>

<p> inventory, Customs was able to identify and correct many
significant </p>

<p> errors in the recorded quantities and values of seized
property. </p>

<p> This effort was also intended to establish an accurate
baseline for </p>

<p> monitoring and reporting activity that results from Customs' </p>

<p> enforcement efforts. However, some Customs locations did not </p>

<p> effectively perform all of the inventory procedures. As a
result, </p>

<p> reported seized property balances included erroneous values. </p>

<p> Customs has also undertaken significant efforts to strengthen
</p>

<p> safeguards at its storage locations. Specifically, it has
performed </p>

<p> a study and evaluation of the adequacy of its physical
safeguards </p>

<p> over seized property and currency at 21 medium-to-high volume
storage </p>

<p> facilities. In addition, Customs constructed new facilities
in two </p>

<p> districts and has plans for renovation at other facilities. </p>

<p> While these efforts are commendable, Customs must establish
and </p>

<p> implement additional policies and procedures, such as
periodically </p>

<p> summarizing and assessing the results of its seizure efforts
for a </p>

<p> period of time, and make significant enhancements to its
seized </p>

<p> property tracking system to ensure proper accountability for
and </p>

<p> stewardship over seized property. In addition, a significant
and </p>

<p> sustained effort by Customs management will be required to
ensure </p>

<p> that established policies and procedures and planned
improvements are </p>

<p> properly implemented. Otherwise, Customs' ability to report
reliable </p>

<p> financial information and effectively carry out its seizure
program </p>

<p> will continue to be diminished. Also, tons of illegal drugs
and </p>

<p> millions of dollars in currency and other property will
remain </p>

<p> vulnerable to theft and misappropriation. </p>

<p> Problems also persist with the Marshals Service's maintenance
and </p>

<p> disposal of seized and forfeited property, according to
recent </p>

<p> Justice Department Office of Inspector General reports. In
March </p>

<p> 1993, the Inspector General reported mismanagement by
contractors </p>

<p> hired by the Marshals Service to maintain and dispose of
property, </p>

<p> resulting in excessive costs and lost revenues of almost $2.8
million </p>

<p> in six districts. Two and a half million dollars of the
excessive </p>

<p> costs and lost revenue resulted from a lack of effective
Marshals </p>

<p> Service oversight of real property management contracts. For </p>

<p> example, the Marshals Service failed to detect improper
payments for </p>

<p> property taxes, attorney fees, and title insurance. In March
1994, </p>

<p> the Inspector General reported that the Marshals Service was
not </p>

<p> disposing of forfeited property expeditiously, allowing
property to </p>

<p> deteriorate, thus resulting in lost revenue. The Marshals
Service </p>

<p> has initiated various actions to address these problems, such
as </p>

<p> revising procurement policies, conducting contract management
reviews </p>

<p> at certain districts, and providing additional training to
seized </p>

<p> assets management staff, according to the Inspector General. </p>

<p> PROPERTY MANAGEMENT CONSOLIDATION </p>

<p> EFFORTS UNSUCCESSFUL </p>

<p> In an effort to address duplication of effort, one of the
provisions </p>

<p> of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 required the Attorney
General and </p>

<p> the Secretary of the Treasury to develop and maintain a joint
plan to </p>

<p> coordinate and consolidate postseizure administration of
property </p>

<p> seized for drug-related offenses. In June 1991, we
recommended </p>

<p> consolidating the management and disposition of all noncash
seized </p>

<p> properties, designating the Marshals Service as the
custodian. We </p>

<p> estimated program administration costs could be reduced 11
percent </p>

<p> annually if Justice and Customs consolidated the postseizure </p>

<p> management and disposition of such items. We also reported
that </p>

<p> consolidation would likely result in lower contractor costs
due to </p>

<p> economies of scale. </p>

<p> Consolidation efforts to date have been unsuccessful. The
Marshals </p>

<p> Service and Customs entered into a memorandum of
understanding in </p>

<p> October 1992 for a 1-year small scale pilot consolidation
project </p>

<p> whereby the Marshals Service managed and disposed of Customs'
real </p>

<p> property and Customs managed and disposed of vessels for the
Marshals </p>

<p> Service at four districts. A total of 52 properties were
involved in </p>

<p> the pilot project, which dissolved at the end of the 1-year
period. </p>

<p> No cost analysis or evaluation of the effectiveness of the
project </p>

<p> was done. There are no future plans for consolidation of
asset </p>

<p> management and disposition functions at this time. </p>

<p> We still believe that consolidation of asset management and </p>

<p> disposition functions makes sense. Both agencies seize
similar types </p>

<p> of property that is generally located in the same geographic
areas. </p>

<p> However, under the current operating structure, each agency
maintains </p>

<p> a separate and distinct program for managing and disposing of
its </p>

<p> property. Justice, through the Marshals Service, contracts
directly </p>

<p> with vendors that provide the service. Treasury, through the
Customs </p>

<p> Service, has a nationwide contractor that provides custodial
services </p>

<p> either directly or through subcontracts with other vendors. </p>

<p> DUPLICATE ASSET FORFEITURE FUNDS </p>

<p> AND PROGRAMS </p>

<p> We see areas of possible duplication between the two funds
and </p>

<p> programs that extend beyond property management and
disposition </p>

<p> activities, to include forfeiture fund administration and
management. </p>

<p> The Treasury Forfeiture Fund structure essentially mirrors
that of </p>

<p> the Justice Fund. Both funds have their own management,
operations </p>

<p> staff, custodial agencies (Marshals Service and Customs), and
</p>

<p> contractors to maintain and dispose of property. The funds
work </p>

<p> closely together to develop policies that minimize variations
in </p>

<p> forfeiture procedures and operations. Although the funds
coordinate </p>

<p> closely, the existence of two separate funds has the
potential for </p>

<p> unnecessary duplication. For example, each department
recently </p>

<p> issued its own set of very similar program guidance. </p>

<p> On the other hand, Justice and Treasury are pursuing
consolidation of </p>

<p> asset tracking systems. Both departments have agreed to
develop, </p>

<p> implement, manage, operate, enhance, and support a
Consolidated Asset </p>

<p> Tracking System (CATS). CATS is intended to be the primary
automated </p>

<p> system for asset tracking and management used by all agencies
</p>

<p> participating in both the Justice and Treasury asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> CATS would make it possible to track the entire life cycle of
an </p>

<p> asset from seizure, through forfeiture, to disposal. The
system </p>

<p> would avoid the duplicate data entry that occurs due to the
various </p>

<p> participating components having incompatible systems. With
all </p>

<p> participating agencies using the same system, any user of
CATS would </p>

<p> have available the current status and processing details for
any </p>

<p> asset, regardless of which agency entered the information.
CATS is </p>

<p> being pilot tested, with participation from all Justice and
Treasury </p>

<p> agencies, except Customs. Customs plans to begin looking at
the </p>

<p> feasibility of CATS participation in the near future. The
success of </p>

<p> a single automated tracking system is dependent on the
participation </p>

<p> of all agencies, including Customs. We encourage Justice and </p>

<p> Treasury to continue to identify areas of duplication and
pursue </p>

<p> options for consolidation, such as their efforts with CATS. </p>

<p> IMPROVED GUIDANCE FOR THE USE OF </p>

<p> SHARED ASSETS </p>

<p> Continuing this consolidation theme, in July 1992 we
concluded that </p>

<p> because state and local law enforcement agencies often see
the </p>

<p> Justice and Customs asset sharing programs as one, the
programs </p>

<p> should have the same guidelines, with the same
interpretations of </p>

<p> appropriate asset use. Officials in some state and local
agencies </p>

<p> found the guidance vague and confusing, with Justice and
Customs </p>

<p> allowing different uses of shared proceeds despite having
similar </p>

<p> program policies. We recommended that Justice and Customs
issue </p>

<p> joint guidelines for asset sharing with clear, specific
definitions </p>

<p> for concepts such as &quot;law enforcement purposes&quot; and
&quot;supplanting of </p>

<p> resources.&quot; </p>

<p> Joint guidelines have not been issued. However, Treasury and
Justice </p>

<p> issued separate sets of revised and mutually agreeable asset
sharing </p>

<p> guidance in October 1993 and March 1994, respectively. The
clarified </p>

<p> guidance is intended to significantly reduce state and local
law </p>

<p> enforcement agency confusion about appropriate uses of shared
assets </p>

<p> and should lead to fewer improper uses of assets. </p>

<p> EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN SAFEGUARDS </p>

<p> AGAINST IMPROPER SEIZURES </p>

<p> As discussed in our 1992 high-risk report, increasing
concerns have </p>

<p> been voiced by Members of Congress, the media, and law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials about the potential for abuse of the property
interests of </p>

<p> innocent owners and third parties in the asset
seizure/forfeiture </p>

<p> process. Because revenue generation is one of the clearly </p>

<p> articulated goals of the forfeiture program, concerns have
also been </p>

<p> expressed that law enforcement agencies may have a vested
interest in </p>

<p> receiving the proceeds of forfeitures and that this interest
could </p>

<p> influence law enforcement priorities. </p>

<p> Furthermore, in 1993 the Supreme Court issued three decisions
that </p>

<p> have more clearly defined the appropriate use of asset
seizure and </p>

<p> forfeiture authority. For example, in Austin v. United
States, 113 </p>

<p> S. Ct. 2801 (1993), the Court concluded that the challenged </p>

<p> forfeiture constituted punishment and thus was subject to the
</p>

<p> limitations of the excessive fines clause of the Eighth
Amendment to </p>

<p> the Constitution. The Eighth Amendment ban on excessive fines
</p>

<p> requires that there be a relationship between the seriousness
of an </p>

<p> offense and the property that is taken. </p>

<p> Several bills were proposed in the last Congress that would
have </p>

<p> significantly affected the forfeiture programs. For example,
one </p>

<p> bill mandated that certain forfeiture proceedings be
conducted only </p>

<p> upon the conviction of the property owner for the relevant
crime. </p>

<p> That bill also required that a portion of the forfeiture
proceeds be </p>

<p> used for community based crime control programs. </p>

<p> The Department of Justice is also concerned about any
appearance of </p>

<p> conflict of interest or overzealous use of seizure and
forfeiture </p>

<p> laws. Justice has taken several actions to address these
concerns. </p>

<p> To provide leadership to state and local law enforcement
agencies, </p>

<p> Justice issued a National Code of Professional Conduct for
Asset </p>

<p> Forfeiture officials. Justice also initiated a project to
coordinate </p>

<p> and expand federal forfeiture training in an effort to ensure
that </p>

<p> state and local law enforcement agencies are in full
compliance with </p>

<p> constitutional and statutory limitations on seizure and
forfeiture. </p>

<p> The departments of Justice and the Treasury have implemented
new </p>

<p> policy guidance to strengthen the integrity of the asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> program. For example, to minimize any adverse effects of
forfeiture </p>

<p> on innocent persons, Justice and Treasury issued new policies
and </p>

<p> procedures that require expedited notice to owners of seized
property </p>

<p> and payments to lienholders. Justice also proposed
regulations in </p>

<p> June 1994 that would clarify when innocent persons whose
property is </p>

<p> used by others for criminal purposes are entitled to relief. </p>

<p> FURTHER ACTION NEEDED </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 3 </p>

<p> The asset forfeiture programs continue to remain highly
visible, as </p>

<p> evidenced by the recent policy guidance and proposed
regulations as </p>

<p> well as numerous proposed changes to forfeiture legislation.
Justice </p>

<p> and Treasury have made many improvements to their asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> programs over the years. However, enhancements to seized
property </p>

<p> tracking systems and development and implementation of
additional </p>

<p> policies and procedures are needed to help ensure adequate </p>

<p> accountability and stewardship over seized property. In
addition, </p>

<p> continued oversight will be required to ensure that existing
policies </p>

<p> and procedures and planned improvement efforts are properly </p>

<p> implemented. We will continue to monitor seized property
management </p>

<p> activities. </p>

<p> Possible duplication of resources within the two forfeiture
funds and </p>

<p> programs is of particular interest in light of budget
constraints. </p>

<p> Justice and Treasury should aggressively pursue options for </p>

<p> efficiency gains through consolidation. </p>

<p> Although significant problems remain with seized property
management, </p>

<p> some of the attention has shifted toward concerns about law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies becoming overzealous in their use of the
asset </p>

<p> forfeiture laws or too dependent on the funds derived from
such </p>

<p> seizures. It is too soon to judge the effectiveness of the
recent </p>

<p> efforts taken by Justice and Treasury to strengthen
safeguards </p>

<p> against improper seizures. Our future work will include
keeping </p>

<p> abreast of these efforts and assessing any future legislative
</p>

<p> changes. </p>

<p> <u>United States General Accounting Office</u> </p>

<p> GAO Testimony </p>

<p> Before the Legislation and National Security Subcommittee,
Committee on Government Operations, House of Representatives </p>

<p> Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: </p>

<p> I am pleased to be here today to discuss the military's
surveillance of the drug-smuggling threat. My testimony today is
based on a series of reports concerning DOD's role in drug
interdiction that we have issued to the House Government
Operations Committee over the past several years. </p>

<p> <u>RESULTS IN BRIEF</u> </p>

<p> The Department of Defense (DOD) has significantly expanded
the nation's capability to detect and monitor cocaine
smugglers--the principal targets of the military's surveillance
efforts. However, we found that although this expanded capability
has become increasingly more costly, it has not led to any
reduction in the estimated flow of cocaine onto American streets.
</p>

<p> The fact is, Mr. Chairman, the budget increases that have
allowed DOD to expand its surveillance capabilities have not been
based on measurable goals and results. Consequently,
decision-makers have lacked critical information needed to assess
the costs and benefits of military surveillance. </p>

<p> The nation's continuing failure to reduce the cocaine flow is
not an indictment of DOD's surveillance efforts. But in the
absence of measurable goals for DOD's mission, we believe it is
the best evidence available for objectively assessing the
contribution that military surveillance has made to the drug war.
And that evidence strongly indicates that military surveillance
is not producing results commensurate with its costs. </p>

<p> <u>BACKGROUND</u> </p>

<p> The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1989
made DOD the lead agency for detecting and monitoring air and
maritime shipments of illegal drugs to the United States. The
mission is part of a multi-agency effort, under the Office of
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), to deter smuggling and
reduce drug supplies by interdicting shipments to the United
States. Most interdiction efforts have been concentrated on
cocaine from South America, which ONDCP has designated the
primary drug threat in the United States. </p>

<p> Interdiction involves two broad functions: surveillance (that
is, detection and monitoring) and apprehension. DOD's
surveillance mission supports the U.S. and foreign law
enforcement agencies that apprehend suspects and seize their
cargo, both in the source countries where cocaine is produced and
in the transit zones between South America and the United States.
Law enforcement agencies participate in both the surveillance and
apprehension phases. DOD is generally precluded from the
apprehension phase (the so-called &quot;end game&quot;) because
of laws restricting military participation in law enforcement
activities. </p>

<p> Funding for DOD's surveillance mission grew from about $212
million in fiscal year 1989 to an estimated $844 million in
fiscal year 1993. DOD has requested $890 million for fiscal year
1994. </p>

<p> <u>DOD HAS EXPANDED SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES BUT AT A COST</u>
</p>

<p> Before 1989, the limited surveillance assets of civilian law
enforcement agencies allowed only intermittent and sporadic
coverage of key cocaine-smuggling zones in the Caribbean and the
eastern Pacific. Since becoming the lead agency for detection and
monitoring, DOD has improved that coverage by providing the
resources to conduct extensive surveillance of primary smuggling
routes. With this expanded coverage, DOD has contributed to drug
seizures by detecting suspects early, monitoring them
continually, and handing them off to law enforcement agencies
near expected arrival zones. </p>

<p> However, this increased capability has been expensive. DOD's
extensive surveillance requires a major commitment of aircraft,
ships, and personnel. To put the costs of that commitment into
perspective, the commander of one joint task force testified in
1992 that they are equivalent to what would be &quot;expended
over a year on a Sixth Fleet deployment into the Mediterranean--a
substantial commitment.&quot; Some of those costs would have to
be incurred for training exercises even if DOD were not involved
in counterdrug operations--but some would not. Some aircraft and
ship crews engaged in counterdrug operations receive little
training related to the military's traditional war-fighting
mission. </p>

<p> <u>FUNDING INCREASES NOT BASED ON MEASURABLE GOALS OR RESULTS</u>
</p>

<p> This substantial commitment has been made through a series of
funding increases since DOD became the lead agency in 1989, even
though drug-war planners have never established specific goals or
valid effectiveness measures for the surveillance mission. In the
absence of such measures: </p>

<p> the success or failure of military surveillance cannot be
assessed quantitatively, </p>

<p> the resources required for military surveillance cannot be
objectively determined, and therefore </p>

<p> Congress and the executive branch are denied the kinds of
objective assessments needed to evaluate alternatives and make
policy decisions. </p>

<p> <u>INCREASED SURVEILLANCE HAS NOT PRODUCED COMMENSURATE
RESULTS</u> </p>

<p> Despite the increased surveillance capabilities that DOD is
providing, interdiction success remains elusive and progress
toward national supply-reduction goals remains negligible. </p>

<p> A key goal of the National Drug Control Strategy has been to
reduce cocaine supplies on the streets of American cities.
According to sources in the intelligence community, however, the
estimated volume of cocaine entering the country has not
appreciably declined since DOD was given its lead-agency mission.
This failure to reduce the drug flow into America cannot be
attributed to the efficiency of DOD's surveillance efforts or any
single initiative in the national strategy, but the inability to
interdict shipments in decisive numbers is a contributing factor.
</p>

<p> Interdiction has had limited successes. Seizures have
increased, and traffickers have been forced to adopt new, and
presumably more expensive, smuggling methods. But these successes
have not made a difference in terms of deterring smugglers and
reducing the flow of cocaine. Interdiction assessments that have
been made indicate that most smugglers are not apprehended. And
the price, purity, and availability of cocaine on American
streets has remained relatively stable. </p>

<p> The capability of military surv eillance to rectify this
situation is limited. The limitation is that surveillance of
suspect ships and planes is not the weak link in the interdiction
process. The weak link is the inability to apprehend suspected
smugglers in transit countries and at our borders. </p>

<p> <u>INTERDICTION SUCCESS REQUIRES APPREHENSION CAPABILITIES</u>
</p>

<p> Simply stated, the capability to detect and monitor drug
smugglers does not assure interdiction success--no matter how
extensive that capability may be. Success ultimately depends on
the capability to apprehend smugglers--arresting people and
seizing their cargo and equipment. However, DOD's surveillance
capabilities exceed the apprehension capabilities of law
enforcement agencies, especially in the countries that U.S.-bound
cocaine transits. </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers have been able to remain relatively
immune to apprehension by adopting new tactics. Instead of flying
cocaine directly into the United States, for example, they fly it
into Central America and Mexico--where U.S. law enforcement
agencies lack jurisdiction and host-nation apprehension
capabilities are limited. The traffickers then move the cocaine
up near our Southwest border by various means and transport it
into the United States in cars, trucks, and other conveyances.
Traffickers also transport cocaine in shipping containers and in
the numerous, difficult-to-find hiding places aboard large
vessels. </p>

<p> Without more law enforcement assistance in the transitting
countries and without improved search technology at U.S. ports
and border crossings, traffickers can continue to ship cocaine
via these methods with relative impunity. Sustaining or
increasing DOD's surveillance capabilities will not do the job. </p>

<p> <u>DRUG PROFITS</u> <u>MAKE INTERDICTION</u> <u>SUCCESS
DOUBTFUL</u> </p>

<p> According to the National Drug Control Strategy, the real
value of interdiction lies in the disruption of trafficking
organizations, thus raising their cost of doing business.
However, this is difficult to achieve, even with the increased
surveillance capability provided by DOD. Part of the problem is
that the enormous profits in cocaine trafficking make
interdiction losses relatively inconsequential, especially in
light of the fact that production and smuggling costs account for
such a small part of street prices. In 1988, for example, the
RAND Corporation reported that only 10 percent of cocaine's final
price is attributable to production and smuggling costs.' </p>

<p> Most of the price growth occurs after cocaine crosses U.S.
borders. Our 1991 report noted that the price for enough cocoa
leaf to produce one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine was between
$65 and $370. The finished product that entered the country was
valued at $800 to $5,000 per kilogram. After being diluted, the
street price equated to between $70,000 and $300,000 a kilogram.
Therefore, the profit margin--after cocaine has passed beyond
DOD's surveillance and the threat of interdiction in route or at
our borders--could range from about 6,000 to 8,600 percent. Given
this huge profit margin, it appears unlikely that interdiction
will be a significant cost deterrent to traffickers, regardless
of the surveillance support that DOD provides. </p>

<p> <u>CONCLUSIONS</u> </p>

<p> In summary, Mr. Chairman, military surveillance has not
demonstrated that it can make a contribution--to either drug
interdiction or to the national goal of reduced drug
supplies--that is commensurate with its cost. The portion of the
federal drug budget allocated to military surveillance has nearly
quadrupled over the last 5 years, without measurable goals or
results to show that the increases were warranted. Moreover, the
available evidence indicates that they were not warranted. Even
with DOD's increased surveillance support to interdiction,
cocaine remains affordable and readily available in the United
States. The continuing failure to reduce the amount of cocaine
entering the country can undoubtedly be attributed to many
factors. But the fact is that adding military surveillance to the
nation's interdiction efforts has not made a difference in our
ability to reduce the flow of cocaine to American streets. </p>

<p> 'Peter Reuter, Gordon Crawford, Jonathan Cave, et al., <u>Sealing
the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in
Drug Interdiction</u>. The RAND Corporation (January 1988). </p>

<p> The National Drug Control Strategy has noted that
interdiction efforts should be viewed, not in isolation, but as
merely one of the fronts on which the drug war is being waged.
The same can reasonably be said of DOD's part in the interdiction
process. Some level of surveillance is an essential part of the
interdiction program called for in the National Drug Control
Strategy. However, the level of that effort should be
commensurate with the relative contribution that it makes--and
can be expected to make--to the national war on drugs. We believe
that contribution has not been demonstrated by expanded military
surveillance. We also believe that continuing failures to
interdict decisive numbers of cocaine shipments and to reduce the
cocaine flow into the U.S. indicate that the government is not
getting a reasonable return on the increased funding provided for
military surveillance. </p>

<p> Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement. I will be happy to
answer any questions you or members of the Subcommittee may have.

<p> GAO Testimony </p>

<p> Before the Subcommittee on Information, Justice,
Transportation, and Agriculture, Committee on Government
Operations, House of Representatives </p>

<p> Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee: </p>

<p> I am pleased to be here today to discuss the results of our
review on drug trafficking in Central America.' Our work, which
was conducted at the request of this Subcommittee, focused
primarily on (1) U.S. efforts to curb the flow of cocaine to the
United States and the obstacles to those efforts, and (2) the
capabilities of Central American countries to interdict cocaine
shipments and their dependence on U.S. assistance. </p>

<p> Strategically located between the United States and the
cocaine producing countries of South America, Central America and
its coastline are used by drug traffickers to facilitate cocaine
transshipment to Mexico and onward to the United States. The U.S.
Customs Service estimates that two-thirds of all cocaine entering
the United States crosses the U.S.-Mexican land border where
concealment in cargo is the preferred method of operation.
Although the amount of cocaine that transits Central America is
not known, the Department of State estimates that as much as 70
tons of cocaine annually transits Guatemala, the country which is
the focus of U.S. interdiction efforts in the region. The United
States, in 1993, programmed about $56.5 million to curb the flow
of drugs in the Central American region. Of this total, over $48
million was for U.S. directed interdiction efforts. </p>

<p> Drug Control <u>Interdiction_Efforts in Central America Have
Had Little Impact on the Flow Of_Drugs</u> (GAO/NSIAD-94-233,
Aug. 2, 1994). </p>

<p> <u>Drug Control:</u> Impact of DOD's Detection and Monitoring
on Cocaine Flow (GAO/NSIAD-91-297, Sept. 19, 1991): <u>Drug
Control: Heavy Investment in</u> Military <u>Surveillance Is Not
Paying Off</u> (GAO/NSIAD-93-220. Sept. 1, 1993): and <u>Drug
Control: Expanded Military_Surveillance Not</u> Justified by
Measured Goals<u> or Results </u>(GAO//T-NSIAD-94-14, Oct. 5,
1993). </p>

<p> <u>RESULTS</u> IN <u>BRIEF</u> </p>

<p> Despite various U.S. government interdiction efforts, Central
America continues to be a major transshipment point for cocaine
shipments to the United States. Available evidence suggests that
the supply of drugs enteringthe United States via Central America
remains virtually uninterrupted. Drug traffickers have adjusted
their modes of operations to evade U.S. air interdiction efforts
and are increasingly using sea and land transportation to move
drugs through Central America and on to the United States. </p>

<p> U.S. efforts to control the flow of narcotics have centered
on intercepting drug trafficking aircraft transiting the region
and seizing drugs destined for the United States. The primary
effort has been Operation Cadence, a program combining the
efforts of various U.S. government agencies with interdiction
operations conducted by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and
Central American police personnel. Initiated in 1991, Operation
Cadence involves the deployment of specially trained U.S. law
enforcement agents to Guatemala who, working on information and
intelligence developed by DEA, Department of Defense (DOD), and
the U.S. Customs Service, attempt to seize trafficking aircraft
and their cargos. </p>

<p> According to DEA, Operation Cadence has been responsible for
seizing almost 29 metric tons of cocaine since its inception.
However, annual Cadence cocaine seizures have declined. The
number of detected flights to the seven countries of Central
America fell from 84 in 1992 to 25 in 1993. Suspected trafficking
flights into Guatemala fell from 57 in 1992 to 13 in 1993. As a
result of Operation Cadence's ability to successfully seize a
growing percent of those aircraft choosing to land in Guatemala
and six consecutive successful interdiction operations during the
June to September 1993 period, traffickers have avoided Guatemala
and no suspected trafficking flights have been detected entering
the country between October 1993 and March of this year. </p>

<p> Operation Cadence achievements, however, have had little
impact on the flow of drugs to the United States. This is because
traffickers have changed to different modes of transportation
that are much more difficult to identify and stop. For example,
traffickers are increasingly using over-land and oversea air
drops to deliver cocaine to Central America. Traffickers are also
said to be changing their routes to avoid radar assets on the
northern coast of South America. A DEA official involved in
Operation Cadence told us that traffickers are believed to be
flying small aircraft into the jungle area that separates
Colombia and Panama, trucking drug cargoes across Panama, and
reloading the drugs on small aircraft that mix with legitimate
air traffic in the region. In addition, DEA reports indicate that
maritime vessels and air cargo containers are now responsible for
the bulk of the cocaine being moved into Central America and much
of the cocaine being smuggled into the United States. The use of
ships and boats allows cocaine to be transported in greater bulk
and more easily concealed--increasing the difficulty of detection
when commingled with legitimate cargo. </p>

<p> The large volume of vehicular traffic crossing into Mexico
from Central America also provides traffickers with ample
smuggling opportunities. Once into Mexico, whether by air, boat,
or land, the drugs are usually destined for the United States.
Almost 6,600 tractor trailer trucks and 21 1,000 passenger
vehicles cross the U.S.-Mexican border each day making drug
shipments difficult to detect. </p>

<p> The Central American nations through which these drugs travel
have neither the resources nor the institutional capability to
address the new drug trafficking modes and are heavily dependent
on U.S. assistance. Various U.S. government agencies are working
with Central American countries on a number of small-scale
projects to address new trafficking modes. However, the outcome
of these efforts is uncertain due to the limited host country
capabilities and changes in U.S. program emphasis from drug
interdiction in the transit countries of Central America to
intercepting drugs in the source countries of South America. </p>

<p> <u>U.S. AGENCIES EFFORTS TO CONTROL DRUG TRAFFIC FACE
OBSTACLES</u> </p>

<p> For fiscal year 1993, State, DEA, DOD, and the U.S. Customs
Service programmed over $48 million to support Operation Cadence
and other interdiction activities in Central America. This
expenditure primarily represents the cost of U.S. personnel and
services and the operation of U.S.-owned radar and aircraft.
Using various land-, sea-, and air-based radar, DOD programmed
$24.7 million on detecting and monitoring drugtrafficking
aircraft as they left South America and approached the Central
American isthmus. The U.S. Customs Service spent at least $9
million to monitor suspect trafficking aircraft and track them in
Central American airspace. The Department of State budgeted $6.1
million to operate and maintain aircraft used to transport
Cadence personnel to aircraft landing sites and $1 million to
train and support Guatemalan police personnel involved in
interdiction operations. DEA spent $828,000 to support the
deployment of Operation Cadence teams to the region and $6.5
million to operate its offices in six Central American countries.
</p>

<p> In addition to supporting Operation Cadence, the Department
of State programmed almost $8 million to improve the drug
interdiction capabilities of six Central American nations;
support drug eradication efforts; and inform Central American
citizens about the adverse impacts of drug production,
trafficking, and abuse. </p>

<p> <u>Obstacles to Successful Interdiction Operations</u> </p>

<p> In addition to problems inherent in identifying and
interdicting drug traffickers, U.S. efforts in Central America
face a number of other obstacles, some of which involve national
sovereignty and jurisdictional issues. For example, Operation
Cadence activities in Belize were suspended for about a year
because the government of Belize prohibited the entrance of
Cadence personnel armed with M-16 rifles. <b>Belize, </b>continues
to prohibit Department of State helicopters armed with M-60
machine guns from flying over Belize. Similarly, the government
of Honduras does not allow Guatemalan aircraft or personnel to
fly over its territory. According to one State Department
official, regional suspicions have also inhibited joint training
and adversely affected joint drug interdiction operations. </p>

<p> At a 1993 conference, Central American presidents discussed
greater antidrug cooperation and pledged their commitment to
develop specific regional counterdrug programs within 6 months.
To date, however, none of the actions approved at the presidents'
conference have been initiated. </p>

<p> <u>INTERDICTION CAPABILITIES OF CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES
ARE SEVERELY LIMITED AND HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON U.S</u>. <u>ASSISTANCE</u>
</p>

<p> Although all of the Central American countries--Belize, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
Panama--have drug control efforts underway, no country possesses
the technical, financial, or human resources necessary to run an
efficient drug interdiction program. In addition, none of the
countries has an organization in place to effectively counter the
overland or maritime drug movement. The limited interdiction
efforts that they do undertake face obstacles and are highly
dependent on U.S. assistance. </p>

<p> 3 Department of State helicopters used in Operation Cadence
are operated and maintained by a U.S. government contractor,
which employs Guatemalan civilian pilots. Also, Cadence
interdiction teams include a number of host nation law
enforcement personnel who are restricted to operations within
their country. </p>

<p> <u>Limited Capabilities and Obstacles</u> </p>

<p> None of the Central American countries have the resources
necessary to purchase sophisticated equipment and develop
well-trained personnel to combat the well-financed, creative, and
highly adaptable drug traffickers. No Central American nation has
a navy or coast guard capable of adequately patrolling all of its
territorial waters. For example, four Honduran Navy ships are
responsible for patrolling that country's 400 mile Caribbean
coast. At the time of our field visit, three of these ships were
in dry dock, and Honduras, for a long period of time, could not
afford fuel for the fourth ship. </p>

<p> Programs specifically dedicated to counternarcotics
activities suffer from inadequate funding. In Honduras, for
example, anti-drug police officers earn as little as $60 a month.
</p>

<p> Corruption also limits the effectiveness of Central American
governments' narcotics control efforts. In its 1993 and 1994
reports to Congress on the international narcotics control
strategy, State reported concerns of narcotics related corruption
in all seven countries of Central America. </p>

<p> <u>Funding for U.S. Narcotics Control Activities Is Declining</u>
</p>

<p> As a result of budgetary constraints and concern over the
effectiveness of State's narcotics control program, Congress
reduced the funds available for this worldwide program from
$147.8 million to $100 million in fiscal year 1994. During fiscal
year 1993, the United States provided a combined total of $6
million in narcotics control assistance to six of the seven
Central American countries. Current plans are to provide these
countries with $3 Billion during fiscal year 1994. </p>

<p> To accommodate reduced funding level in Central America,
State Department terminated the deployment of an
interdiction/eradication helicopter to Belize, reduced the number
of helicopters it had deployed to Guatemala, and greatly reduced
the number of flying hours available to support Operation Cadence
interdiction activities. This reduced level of aviation support
has adversely affected interdiction efforts, since DEA has had to
reduce the number of Operation Cadence teams in Guatemala. </p>

<p> In February 1994, the White House released the new national
drug control strategy, which changed the focus from interdicting
drug shipments in the transit zone toward stopping the flow of
drugs at their source. Along with the shift in emphasis, the
strategy clearly envisions a reduced role for DOD and its
detecting and monitoring assets in the transit zones. The impact
of this strategy shift is not yet clear. </p>

<p> Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement. I will be happy to
answer any questions you or members of the Subcommittee have. <br>

<h2>The DRUG WAR- Colombia Is Implementing Antidrug Efforts, but
Impact Is Uncertain</h2>

<p><b>Statement of Joseph E. Kelley, Director-in-Charge,
International Affairs Issues, National Security and International
Affairs Division</b> </p>

<p><b>GAO/T-NSIAD-94-53</b> </p>

<p><b>October 5. 1993</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>GAO Testimony </p>

<p>Before the Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security
Committee on Government Operations, U.S. House of Representatives
</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: </p>

<p>I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent report on
the progress and problems that U.S. and Colombian agencies have
experienced in implementing U.S. antidrug programs in Colombia
between fiscal years 1990 and 1992. This report is a follow-up to
our initial report that was issued in September 1991.1 </p>

<p>In August 1989, President Bush approved the Andean Strategy, a
major component of the U.S. national drug control strategy, which
is designed to help reduce the supply of illegal drugs being
shipped to the United States. </p>

<p><u>RESULTS IN BRIEF</u> </p>

<p>In the 3 years since the Andean Strategy was announced,
Colombia has demonstrated its commitment and political will by
taking action to support U.S. counternarcotics objectives. It has
applied pressure against drug-trafficking activities through law
enforcement and military actions and has disrupted
drug-trafficking activities in Colombia and, as a result, U.S.
officials believe these programs are effective. The effectiveness
of Colombia's efforts and U.S. programs could not be determined
however, because U.S. officials lack the data needed to make such
an assessment-specifically the amount of cocaine being shipped
from Colombia to the United States. </p>

<p>My testimony point out that various obstacles have hindered
the implementation and effectiveness of U.S. efforts in Colombia.
These obstacles included the limited ability of some Colombian
agencies to plan and implement effective programs, increased
insurgency and narcoterrorist activities, the expansion of drug
trafficking activities into opium cultivation, corruption within
the Colombian government, and the lack of effective antidrug
programs in other neighboring countries. Further my testimony
describes certain U.S. management problems that have hindered the
planning and implementation of U.S. antidrug programs in
Colombia. </p>

<p>-- The State Department reduced the funding for military and
law enforcement programs because of budgetary constraints. These
constraints have impeded and will continue to impede programs
that U.S. Embassy officials believe are needed to enhance
Colombia's antidrug capabilities. U.S. Embassy officials stated,
however, that even if the enhancement programs were fully funded,
they did not know whether these programs would fulfill U.S.
antidrug objectives or whether more funds would be needed. We
believe that it will be difficult to determine what funding
levels are needed to fully meet U.S. antidrug objectives because
the cartels are flexible and can easily adjust their operations
to elude law enforcement efforts, and are expanding their
activities in Colombia and elsewhere. </p>

<p><u>Drug War: Observations on U.S. Counternarcotics Aid to
Colombia </u>(GAO/NSIAD-91-296, Sept. 30, 1991). </p>

<p>We also note that poor coordination among U.S. agencies has
resulted in the inefficient use of resources, and weaknesses in
inventory and financial management practices affecting Colombian
national police programs are hindering program effectiveness. </p>

<p>Regarding the oversight of U.S. programs, U.S. military
officials have been slow to implement end-use monitoring plans
and U.S. Embassy officials cannot provide assurance that U.S.
policies regarding the use of aid and human rights are being met.
Our recent report makes recommendations to the Director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy regarding the need to
reevaluate antidrug programs in Colombia and throughout the
Andean region and to the Secretary of State to improve the
management and oversight of U.S.-provided aid. </p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND</u> </p>

<p>In August 1989, President Bush approved the Andean Strategy, a
major component of the U.S. national drug control strategy, which
is designed to help reduce the supply of illegal drugs, including
cocaine and heroin, being shipped to the United States. Under
that strategy, the United States provides increased levels of
military, law enforcement, and economic aid to Bolivia, Colombia,
and Peru to assist them to disrupt drug-trafficking activities.
The United States places special emphasis on Colombia because it
is the leading source country for processed cocaine. Furthermore,
Colombia is the home of two major cartels, Medellin and Cali,
that are responsible for most of the drug-related activity. </p>

<p>Simply put, the goal of U.S. counternarcotics programs in
Colombia is to assist that government in its efforts to disrupt
and ultimately dismantle drug-trafficking activities within its
borders. Between fiscal years 1990 and 1992, the United States
agreed to provide about $504.3 million worth of aid to assist the
Colombian government to achieve this goal. of this amount, the
United States agreed to provide Colombia with $397.2 million
worth of military and law enforcement aid and guaranteed loans
from the Export-Import Bank to improve the capabilities of law
enforcement and military organizations to disrupt
drug-trafficking activities. The remaining $107.1 million was
economic aid designed to improve Colombia's balance of payments,
strengthen its judiciary and economy, and support poppy
eradication operations of the police. </p>

<p><u>PROGRAMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED, BUT IMPACT IS UNCERTAIN</u>
</p>

<p>The United States and Colombia are undertaking a variety of
programs and initiatives to meet U.S. counternarcotics objectives
for Colombia. Colombia has increased efforts designed to disrupt
some drug-related activities of the major cartels. Although U.S.
officials admit that these efforts have not significantly reduced
the availability of cocaine in the United States, they believe
that the efforts are effective and should be continued. However,
we do not believe that the effectiveness of these efforts can be
assessed because U.S. officials lack the data needed to make such
a determination. Furthermore, the potential impact that U.S.
programs are having on drug-related activities are affected by
various obstacles in and around Colombia. </p>

<p><u>Antidrug Programs Are Being Implemented</u> </p>

<p>U.S. aid is being used to implement various programs designed
to meet U.S. antidrug objectives in Colombia. For example: </p>

<p>-- The first objective is to strengthen the institutional and
political will of the Colombian government to take action against
drug-trafficking activities. Improving the judicial system is a
high priority of this objective. In 1990, the U.S. Agency for
International Development began developing a 6-year, $36 million
program designed to improve Colombia's judicial system. We found
that progress is beginning to be made on improving that system. </p>

<p>The second and third objectives relate to improving the
capabilities that are needed for the Colombian government to
conduct counternarcotics operations against drug-related
activities. Most of the $397.2 million in military and law
enforcement aid and guaranteed loans have provided the Colombian
law enforcement and military organizations with the equipment,
training, and support needed to improve their capabilities. </p>

<p>The fourth objective is to strengthen Colombia's economy. As
of April 1992, the United States had provided about $41 million
in Economic Support Funds to reduce Colombia's debt to the United
States and multilateral lenders. This allowed Colombia to use its
own funds to soften the impact of reducing the role of illicit
drugs in the economy, financing alternative development projects,
and supporting drug awareness programs. </p>

<p><u>Colombia Is Taking Action to Disrupt Drug-Trafficking
Activities</u> </p>

<p>Our review indicated that Colombia's actions are disrupting
drugtrafficking activities. Between calendar years 1990 and 1992,
the Colombian government seized 177 metric tons of cocaine,
destroyed 737 labs, and destroyed over 13,000 hectares of opium
poppy. </p>

<p>Both the United States and Colombia made law enforcement
operations against the Medellin cartel, headed by Pablo Escobar,
their initial priority because of the cartel's dominant role in
cocaine production and terrorism. In March 1993, the Drug
Enforcement Administration reported that these efforts have
resulted in disrupting many of the cartel's activities. In
addition, Pablo Escobar turned himself into the government for
trial in 1991. Although he escaped from prison in mid-1992, U.S.
officials believe that his power has substantially declined. </p>

<p>The Colombian government has also begun to take law
enforcement action against the Cali cartel. One operation
resulted in the seizure of more than $54 million from bank
accounts maintained in five countries. </p>

<p>Despite Colombia's efforts to disrupt drug-trafficking
activities, U.S. officials admitted that cocaine remains readily
available to U.S. users. However, these officials believe that
U.S. programs in Colombia should continue to be funded because
they are effective in disrupting drug-trafficking activities and
in meeting U.S. counternarcotics goals. </p>

<p><u>Data to Measure Program Impacts and Contributions Are
Lacking</u> </p>

<p>We do not believe that U.S. officials can determine the impact
of efforts to disrupt drug-trafficking activities or their
contribution to reduce the supply of cocaine being shipped from
Colombia to the United States because they lack the data to make
this assessment. U.S. officials recognize that problems exist
with the data that is being used to measure effectiveness. </p>

<p>Statistics such as seizures, labs destroyed, number of
arrests, or changes in the prices and availability of cocaine are
frequently used as measures of effectiveness. However, these data
by themselves cannot be used to evaluate the effectiveness of
programs. For example, while increased seizures are generally
viewed as an indicator of success, a decrease in seizures does
not necessarily mean that a program is less effective than it was
previously. Furthermore, estimates used to determine drug
availability and consumption are generally not designed to
measure the effectiveness of individual U.S. interdiction
programs. </p>

<p>To evaluate the impact of Colombia's antidrug efforts to
disrupt drug-related activities or reduce the supply of cocaine
being shipped from Colombia to the United States, U.S. officials
would need information on the amount of cocaine being shipped
into the United States, the deterrent effect that these efforts
have on drug-related activities, and the effectiveness of
interdiction alternatives. This data is not available. Without
this data it is difficult to determine the impact and
contribution that programs in Colombia are making in meeting U.S.
antidrug goals. For example, without knowing the amount of
cocaine being shipped out of Colombia into the United States,
neither the percentage of cocaine being interdicted nor the
effectiveness of antidrug operations in reducing the amount of
cocaine can be easily determined. </p>

<p><u>Long-Term Commitment Is Needed</u> </p>

<p>Even though U.S. officials recognize that they lack the data
needed to determine program success, they believe that the
national drug strategy's goals of disrupting drug-trafficking
activities and reducing the supply of cocaine entering the United
States will require a long-term commitment on the part of the
United States and Colombia to continue law enforcement efforts. </p>

<p>According to U.S. officials, Colombia's efforts against the
cartels are similar to U.S. law enforcement efforts against
organized crime, which has existed for many years. In fact, these
officials stated that Colombia faces even more significant
obstacles than the United States does because it has limited
resources and technologies available to fight the cartels and the
cartels are as powerful or more powerful than many criminal
organizations in the United States. </p>

<p><u>Obstacles Hinder U.S. Programs</u> </p>

<p>Various obstacles in and around Colombia are hindering the
effectiveness of U.S. programs in Colombia. They include the
following: </p>

<p>Colombia's ability to plan and implement effective
counternarcotics programs has weaknesses. Various U.S. reports
show that some civilian agencies as well as the police have not
been effective in planning or implementing programs. </p>

<p>Increased active insurgency and narcoterrorism activities in
large sections of Colombia hinder the government's efforts to
maintain the presence needed to sustain counternarcotics
pressure. Two guerilla groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the National Liberation Army, are reportedly
involved in drug-trafficking activities in Colombia. </p>

<p>The cartels are expanding their activities into heroin. U.S.
estimates show that in less than 2 years, poppy cultivation in
Colombia has expanded from about 2,500 to about 32,700 hectares.
In early 1992, the Colombian government formally approved an
aerial eradication program to supplement its manual program
because it was concerned about this expansion. Under the program,
the police are using helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft
originally provided by the United States for cocaine operations
for aerial poppy eradication. As a result, cocaine operations
have declined, while poppy eradication operations have increased.
Current plans show that increases in aid will be needed to
continue operations against cocaine interdiction and poppy
eradication. </p>

<p>Various U.S. Embassy reports show that corruption exists
throughout the government. Corruption was a primary reason why
Pablo Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, escaped in mid-1992
from prison to avoid prosecution. </p>

<p>Colombian programs will not succeed unless other regional
antidrug programs are effective. We have reviewed programs in
Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, and Mexico. Our reports
show that significant obstacles have also impeded the
effectiveness of these programs. U.S. officials stated that even
if Colombia were successful in eliminating drugtrafficking
activities within its borders, the trafficking would spill over
into other countries, especially countries that were not
aggressive in interdiction efforts. </p>

<p><u>U.S. MANAGEMENT DIFFICULTIES HINDER IMPLEMENTATION OF
COUNTERNARCOTICS PROGRAMS</u> </p>

<p>Both the U.S. Embassy and the Defense Department reported
numerous problems in planning and implementing counternarcotics
programs in Colombia. For example the U.S. Embassy had numerous
problems in procuring equipment for the police in a timely,
efficient, and effective manner. </p>

<p>We also found several problems that affected the ability of
the United States to implement programs in a timely, efficient,
and effective manner. These problems included the inability of
the State Department to provide funding levels needed to
implement programs that U.S. officials believe are needed to meet
U.S. antidrug objectives, the lack of effective coordination
between the Departments of State and Defense, and inventory and
financial management. </p>

<p><u>Budgetary Constraints Limit Available Funding to Support
Programs</u> </p>

<p>To implement the counternarcotics strategy in Colombia, the
United States has primarily relied on two funding sources--the
Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP) and the International
Narcotics Control Program, both managed by the State Department.
Since 1992, the State Department has not allocated the funding
needed to support the programs that U.S. officials in Colombia
believe are needed to meet U.S. counternarcotics objectives. </p>

<p> <u>The Drug War: U.S. Programs in Peru Face Serious
Obstacles </u>(GAO/NSIAD-92-36, Oct. 21, 1991); <u>The Drug War:
Extent of Problems in Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela</u>
(GAO/NSIAD-92-226, June 5, 1992); <u>The War on Drugs: Narcotics
Control in Panama </u>(GAO/NSIAD-91-233, July 16, 1991) ; and <u>Drug
Control: Revised Drug Interdiction Approach Is Needed in Mexico</u>
(GAO/NSIAD-93-152, May 10, 1993). </p>

<p>In fiscal years 1992 and 1993, U.S. officials in Colombia
estimated that $116 million worth of FMFP aid would be needed to
implement various programs to improve the capabilities of the
police and military organizations involved in counternarcotics
operations. However, because of budget constraints, the State
Department allocated only $73 million. As a result many of the
counternarcotics requirements for law enforcement and military
organizations could not be funded. </p>

<p>In fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the U.S. Embassy estimated that
law enforcement programs funded under the International Narcotics
Control Program would need about $62.1 million worth of aid to
support several existing projects. However, because of budgetary
constraints, the State Department provided only about $45.4
million, which was not considered to be adequate to fully support
even one of the several projects. </p>

<p>Budgetary constraints may continue to affect the U.S. ability
to provide the funds that may be needed to meet additional
requirements that U.S. officials believe Colombia needs to fight
drug-related activities. In early 1992, the U.S. Embassy
recognized that additional requirements, not included in original
plans, would be needed to strengthen the counternarcotics
capabilities of both law enforcement and military organizations.
In reviewing an enhancement plan developed by the U.S. Embassy,
the executive branch decided that before any funding would be
provided, two criteria would have to be met. First, requirements
had to meet critical needs, and second, the Colombian government
had to be able to absorb the equipment. Based on its analysis,
the executive branch identified about $12 million worth of
additional aid to provide. According to the office of National
Drug Control Policy, this aid was delivered in April and May
1993. Even though the U.S. Embassy believes that additional
requirements are needed, the executive branch has not included
more funding for the plan in fiscal years 1993 and 1994. </p>

<p>U.S. Embassy officials stated that these actions will affect
implementation of the enhanced programs in Colombia. However,
they admitted that even if all the requirements identified in the
enhancement plan were fully funded, they did not know whether the
funding would be adequate to fully meet U.S. antidrug objectives
or whether additional funds would be needed. </p>

<p>We believe that it is difficult to determine what funding
levels will be needed to achieve U.S. antidrug objectives in
Colombia because the cartels are flexible and can easily adjust
their operations to elude law enforcement efforts. Also, they are
expanding their activities (i.e. relocating activities in
sections of Colombia where the government cannot maintain control
and diversifying operations into opium-related drug-trafficking
activities) within Colombia and elsewhere. </p>

<p><u>Coordination and Management of Inventory and Finance
Difficulties</u> </p>

<p>Our review also indicated that the Departments of State and
Defense were not effectively coordinating some of their programs.
This lack of coordination has led to an inefficient use of
resources. For example, reports indicated that the Colombian air
force could not use some U.S.-provided equipment because it was
either the wrong type or was missing parts. we also found that
various offices within the U.S. Embassy had not effectively
implemented a police helicopter training course. As a result, the
program was charged a cancellation fee of $297,000 when the
police did not send students to the course in January 1992. </p>

<p>We also found that, because of ineffective inventory and
financial management practices, the State Department could not
provide adequate logistics support in a timely manner. The
resulting lack of spare parts hindered U.S. ability to meet its
goal of maintaining a 70-percent availability rate for police
aircraft. Various administrative financial management problems
also exist. For example, contractors were not paid in a timely
manner for services performed, which has led to difficulties in
supporting the antidrug programs and has had a detrimental effect
on antidrug operations. </p>

<p><u>OVERSIGHT OF U.S. PROGRAMS IS LACKING</u> </p>

<p>U.S. military officials have been slow to implement the
monitoring plans that they believe are needed to provide adequate
assurances that U.S. aid is being used as intended. Although U.S.
officials informed us in 1991 that such plans were being
implemented, they had not been fully implemented at the time of
our review. Furthermore, U.S. officials did not have procedures
or the data to determine whether units involved in human rights
abuses had received U.S. aid. We found two instances where
individuals reportedly involved in human rights abuses belonged
to particular units that had received U.S. aid. </p>

<p><u>RECOMMENDATIONS</u> </p>

<p>Because (1) U.S. officials lack the data needed to evaluate
program effectiveness, (2) various obstacles impede program
implementation, (3) additional resource requirements have been
identified to meet the expanding drug trade, and (4) U.S.
budgetary constraints will continue, we have recommended that the
Director of the office of National Drug Control Policy, in
conjunction with other agencies, reevaluate U.S. antidrug
programs in Colombia and throughout the Andean region to
determine what the U.S. antidrug objectives should be for each
country. We also recommended that the Director evaluate what
types of programs should be included, what funding would be
necessary to support these programs, and whether this funding
would ensure that the programs could significantly disrupt
drug-trafficking activities and reduce the supply of cocaine
being shipped to the United States. As part of this reevaluation,
a quantitative baseline should be established to evaluate
progress that U.S. antidrug programs in Colombia and the other
Andean countries are having on meeting established U.S. antidrug
objectives and goals. </p>

<p>Our report also includes other recommendations to the
Secretary of State that are designed to improve the management
and oversight of U.S.-provided aid to ensure that it is used in
an efficient and effective manner and in accordance with U.S.
policies. </p>

<p>This concludes my testimony. I will be happy to answer any
questions you or the Subcommittee may have regarding our review. </p>

Government Operations House of Representatives </p>

<p> Dear Mr. Chairman: </p>

<p> In response to your request, we reviewed U.S.-assisted
narcotics control efforts in Central America.' This report
describes (1) the drug trafficking situation in that region, (2)
the efforts being made by various U.S. departments and agencies
to curb the flow of cocaine and the obstacles they face in
carrying out these efforts, (3) the capabilities of Central
American countries to interdict cocaine shipments and their
dependence on U.S. assistance, and (4) new U.S. counterdrug
initiatives. </p>

<p> Results in <b>Brief: </b>Despite various U.S. government
interdiction efforts, Central America continues to be a primary
transshipment point for cocaine shipments to the United States.
Available evidence suggests that the supply of drugs entering the
United States via Central America remains virtually
uninterrupted. Law enforcement officials stated that drug
traffickers have adjusted their modes of operations to evade U.S.
air interdiction efforts and are increasingly using sea and land
transportation to move drugs through Central America to the
United States. Drugs moved by these new trafficking modes are
very difficult to detect and interdict. The Central American
nations have neither the resources nor the institutional
capability to address the new drug trafficking modes and are
heavily dependent on U.S. assistance. Various U.S. government
agencies are working with some Central American countries on a
number of small-scale projects to address new trafficking modes.
However, the outcome of these efforts is uncertain due to limited
host country capabilities and shifts in U.S. program emphasis
from drug interdiction in the transit countries of Central
America toward intercepting drugs and disrupting drug
organizations in the source countries of South America. </p>

<p> 'Central American countries are Belize, Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. </p>

<p> <u>'Drug Control: Expanded Military Surveillance Not </u>Justified<b>
</b><u>by</u> Measured Goals <u>or Results </u>(GAO/T-NSIAD-94-14,
Oct. 5,1993); <u>Drug Control: Heavy Investment in Military
Surveillance Is Not </u>Paying Off (GAO/NSIAD-93-220, Sept. 1,
1993); and Drug Control: <u>Impact of DOD's</u> Detection and <u>Monitoring
on</u> Cocaine Flow (GAO/NSIAD-91-297, Sept. 19,1991). </p>

<p> <b>Background:</b> By the late 1980s, most cocaine entering
the United States was flown directly from the producing countries
of South America into northern Mexico, where the cargo was then
transported by truck across the border. However, in response to
joint U.S. -Meexican drug interdiction efforts in northern
Mexico, traffickers began to adjust their routes and moved their
operations and staging areas to southern Mexico and neighboring
Central American countries.' </p>

<p> Strategically located between the United States and the
cocaine producing countries of South America, Central America and
its coastline are used as a bridge by drug traffickers to
facilitate cocaine transshipment to the United States. The two
primary air routes used to move cocaine from Colombia to Central
America and Mexico are the western Caribbean corridor and the
more frequently used eastern Pacific corridor.' (See fig. 1.)
From various points along these corridors, traffickers either
land and offload their drugs or airdrop their drug cargoes. Drugs
are then stockpiled for shipment to Mexico and then the United
States. </p>

<p> <u>3Drug Control: Revised Drug Inter-diction Approach Is
Needed in Mexico</u> (GAO/NSIAD-93-152, May 10, 1993). </p>

<p> 'In a limited number of cases, traffickers in producing
countries have been known to fly their drug cargoes directly to
the United States or Canada. </p>

<p> <u>Figure 1: Primary Cocaine Trafficking Routes</u> From
Colombia to Central America and the United States </p>

<p> Drugs Continue to <b>Transit </b>Central America </p>

<p> In recent years, the major thrust of the U.S. drug strategy
in Central America has been to intercept drug trafficking
aircraft as they move drug cargoes along established trafficking
routes. This strategy appears to have been successful in
Guatemala, the primary transhipment country of the region, but
has had little impact on the flow of drugs to the United States. </p>

<p> According to law enforcement officials, the strategy has not
been effective because traffickers have adjusted their methods of
operation and destinations to evade U.S. detection and
interdiction efforts. In addition, the U.S. government and
Central American countries face numerous obstacles to developing
effective counterdrug programs. Although the amount of cocaine
that transits Central America is not known, the Department of
State estimates that as much as 70 tons of cocaine transits
Guatemala annually, the country at the focus of U.S. interdiction
efforts in the region. </p>

<p> As the United States has increased its ability to detect,
monitor, and interdict drug trafficking aircraft moving from
South America to Central America and the United States,
traffickers have turned to more complex and evasive means of air
delivery and to less detectable highway and sea transportation.
Some U.S. officials believe that, in a limited number of
instances, drug traffickers have changed their air shipment
methods to avoid detection by Department of Defense (DOD) radar.
For example, one drug enforcement official told us that
traffickers are flying small aircraft into the jungle area that
spans the border between Colombia and Panama, trucking drug
cargoes across Panama, and reloading the drugs on small aircraft
that mix with legitimate air traffic in the region. Ms technique
avoids the radar assets that DOD has focused on the northern
coast of South America. </p>

<p> According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),
maritime vessels and air cargo conveyances are now responsible
for the bulk of the cocaine being moved into Central America and
much of the cocaine being smuggled into the United States. The
use of ships and boats allows cocaine to be transported in
greater bulk so that it can be more easily concealed and
increases the difficulty of detecting drugs that are commingled
with legitimate cargo. The National Narcotics Intelligence
Consumers Committee reports that cocaine has been hidden in the
walls of cargo containers, in bulk cargo such as coffee, and
attached to the vessels themselves. The U.S. Customs Service
faces an enormous challenge as it attempts to examine all
containers entering U.S. ports. For example, over 44,000 sea
containers arrived at U.S. seaports from cocaine source and
transit countries during fiscal year 1992. Of this total, Customs
examined 13 percent of the full containers and 25 percent of the
empty ones. </p>

<p> The large volume of vehicular traffic crossing into Mexico
from Central America also provides traffickers with ample
smuggling opportunities. Once into Mexico, whether by air, boat,
or land, the drugs are usually destined for the United States.
Almost 6,600 tractor trailer trucks and 21 1,000 passenger
vehicles cross the U. S.-Mexico border each day. Customs
estimates that two-thirds of all cocaine entering the United
States crosses the U. S.-Mexico land border concealed in cargo.
Appendix I contains detailed information on drug trafficking in
Central America. </p>

<p> Numerous Agencies U.S. narcotics control efforts in Central
America have centered on intercepting drug trafficking aircraft
transiting the region and seizing drugs Involved in U.S. destined
for the United States. The primary focus has been Operation
Interdiction <b>and</b> Cadence, a program combining the efforts
of various U.S. government Control Efforts agencies with
interdiction operations conducted by DEA and Central American
police personnel. Initiated in 1991, Operation Cadence involves
the deployment of specially trained U.S. law enforcement agents
to Guatemala who work with information and intelligence developed
by DEA, DOD, and Customs to seize trafficking aircraft and their
cargoes. </p>

<p> Available data indicates that State, DEA, DOD, and Customs
programmed over $48 million to support Operation Cadence and
other interdiction activities in Central America during fiscal
year 1993. These expenditures primarily represented the cost of
U.S. personnel and services and the operation of U.S.-owned radar
and aviation assets. With the use of various land-, sea-, and
air-based radar assets, DOD spent an estimated $24.7 minion on
detecting and monitoring drug trafficking aircraft as they left
South America and approached the Central American isthmus.
Customs spent at least $9 million to monitor suspect trafficking
aircraft and track them once they entered a particular country's
airspace. The Department of State spent $6.1 million to operate
and maintain aircraft used to transport Cadence personnel to
aircraft landing sites and $1 million to train and support
Guatemalan police personnel involved in interdiction operations. </p>

<p> DEA spent $828,000 to support the deployment of Cadence teams
to the region. DEA also spent about $6.5 million to conduct
routine investigative activities not related to Operation Cadence
and operate offices in six Central American countries. </p>

<p> 1The National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee is a
multiagency U.S. government panel that <b>was </b>established <b>in
</b>1978 to coordinate foreign and domestic collection, analysis,
dissemination, and evaluation of drug-related intelligence. </p>

<p> According to DEA, Operation Cadence has been responsible for
seizing almost 29 metric tons of cocaine since its inception in
May 1991.6 However, annual Cadence cocaine seizures have
declined. The number of detected flights to the seven Central
American countries fell from 84 in 1992 to 25 in 1993. The number
of suspected trafficking flights into Guatemala fell from 57 in
1992 to 13 in 1993. As a result of Operation Cadence's ability to
successfully seize a growing percent of those aircraft landing in
Guatemala and six consecutive successful interdiction operations
from June to September 1993, traffickers have avoided Guatemala.
No suspected trafficking flights were detected entering Guatemala
from October 1993 to March 1994, the last month for which data is
available. Operation Cadence has also provided some interdiction
and training assistance to Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras
through the short-term deployment Of DEA personnel. </p>

<p> In addition to supporting Operation Cadence, the Department
of State spent almost $4 million to improve the drug interdiction
capabilities of six Central American nations; support drug
eradication efforts; and inform Central American citizens about
the adverse impacts of drug production, trafficking, and abuse.
It also spent $4 million to operate and maintain State-owned
eradication aircraft in Guatemala and Belize. The U.S. Coast
Guard spent $400,000 to train regional maritime forces in vessel
boarding and inspection procedures. Appendix 11 further discusses
U.S. anti-narcotics activities in Central America. </p>

<p> In addition to problems inherent in identifying and
interdicting drug traffickers, U.S. efforts in the Central
American transit zone have been limited by national sovereignty
and jurisdiction issues. For example, Cadence activities in
Belize were suspended for about 1 year because the government of
Belize prohibited the entrance of Cadence personnel armed with
M-16 rifles. The government of Belize currently prohibits
Department of State helicopters armed with M-60 machine guns from
flying over that country. Similarly, the government of Honduras
does not allow Guatemalan aircraft or personnel to fly over its
territory. In Honduras, flight plans for U.S. interdiction
aircraft must be filed 48 hours in advance. One State Department
official said that regional suspicions have also inhibited joint
training and adversely affected joint drug interdiction
operations. </p>

<p> 'One metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms or 2,205 pounds. </p>

<p> Central American presidents discussed greater anti-drug
cooperation at a conference in February 1993 and issued a
declaration stating their commitment to develop specific regional
counterdrug programs within 6 months. As part of their agreement,
the presidents also committed to establishing a new Central
American counterdrug commission. To date, none of the actions
approved at the conference have been initiated. </p>

<p> Central American Although all of the Central American
countries have drug control efforts underway, no country
possesses the technical, financial, or human Drug Interdiction
resources necessary to run an efficient drug interdiction
program. In Capabilities Axe addition, none of the countries has
an organization in place to effectively Limited and counter the
overland or maritime drug movement. The limited interdiction
efforts that they do undertake are highly dependent on U.S.
assistance. </p>

<p> Dependent on Assistance </p>

<p> A U.S. <b>senior </b>Guatemalan narcotics control official
told us that air and land interdiction rates in Guatemala would
fall by at least 80 percent without U.S. assistance. In Honduras,
a Department of State representative said that the drug
interdiction effort would quickly wither away without the
continued insistence and assistance from the United States. </p>

<p> Limited Capabilities and Obstacles </p>

<p> None of the Central American countries has the resources
necessary to purchase sophisticated equipment and develop
well-trained personnel to combat the well-financed, creative, and
highly adaptable drug traffickers. </p>

<p> No Central American nation has a navy or coast guard capable
of completely controlling its territorial waters. For example,
four Honduran Navy ships are responsible for patrolling that
country's extensive Caribbean coast. Three of these ships have
been in dry dock, and Honduras could not afford fuel for the
fourth ship for a long period of time. In addition, Honduras is
the only Central American country with the radar capability to
monitor its airspace. </p>

<p> 'Department of State helicopters used in Cadence operations
are operated and maintained by a U.S. contractor, which employs
Guatemalan civilian pilots. Also, Cadence interdiction teams
include a number <b>of </b>host nation law enforcement personnel
who are restricted to operations within their specific country. </p>

<p> Corruption also limits the effectiveness of Central American
governments' narcotics control efforts. In its 1994 International
Narcotics Control <u>Strategy</u> Report to Congress, State
reported concerns of narcotics-related corruption in all seven
Central American countries. Instances cited by State ranged from
the premature release of people arrested and convicted on drug
charges to the alleged involvement of prominent individuals in
drug trafficking. In another country, DEA has reported that the
host nation organization responsible for conducting its
surveillance and undercover operations is the least professional
law enforcement agency in the country and the one most
susceptible to corruption. </p>

<p> Funding for U.S. Narcotics Budgetary constraints and concern
over the effectiveness of State's Control Activities narcotics
control program resulted in Congress reducing the funds available
for this worldwide program from $147.8 million in fiscal year
1993 to $100 million in fiscal year 1994. Both host country
assistance and U.S. direct interdiction efforts are being reduced
to accommodate the lower level of funding. </p>

<p> The United States, through the Department of State, provided
about $5 million in narcotics control assistance to six of the
seven Central American countries during fiscal year 1993 and
plans to provide about $3 million in similar aid during fiscal
year 1994. This assistance provides training and logistics and
maintenance support to counternarcotics police in Belize, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. Narcotics
control training provided by the Department of State focused or,
strengthening the capabilities of drug law enforcement units.
Some of this training is provided by the U.S. Customs Service,
which instructs Central American personnel on interdiction
techniques and detector dog operations; the U.S. Coast Guard,
which provides training on vessel boarding techniques; and DEA,
which provides training in investigatory techniques. </p>

<p> Within Central America, the Department of State has focused
its efforts in Guatemala and Panama, where it established
narcotics affairs sections to manage in-country programs and
oversee much smaller projects in neighboring countries. State
helped the government of Guatemala to organize an interdiction
unit, develop a narcotics-related intelligence and information
clearinghouse, and establish a unit to coordinate interdiction
operations. State also supports Guatemalan efforts to eradicate
opium poppy and marijuana cultivations by providing equipment,
commodities, and aviation support. </p>

<p> To accommodate reduced funding for counterdrug programs in
Central America, State terminated the deployment of an
interdictionleradication helicopter to Belize, reduced the number
of helicopters it had deployed to Guatemala, and greatly reduced
the number of flying hours available for support of Operation
Cadence interdiction activities. Ms reduced level of aviation
support has adversely affected interdiction efforts and DEA has
reduced the number of Operation Cadence teams deployed in
Guatemala. </p>

<p> U.S. Plans to Combat Overland Drug<b> Trafficking</b> </p>

<p> In recognition of the limited usefulness of existing
programs, U.S. anti-drug agencies, along with some Central
American governments, are Maritime and developing new small-scale
approaches to address the growing threat of maritime and overland
trafficking through the region. However, it is not clear whether
these initiatives will develop into viable programs because of
limited host country capabilities and changing emphasis and
program priorities in the U.S. drug control strategy. </p>

<p> DEA has developed a proposal for a maritime force to patrol
the coast of Honduras. Funding constraints, however, have caused
State to reject DEA'S proposal. In Guatemala, the Department of
State has approached Guatemalan shipping interests and proposed a
port inspection project that would tighten controls and safeguard
the integrity of goods shipped via Guatemalan ports. Start-up
costs for this project would be provided by State, and subsequent
costs would be the responsibility of the port authority, which
would impose a fee on those who use the port and its facilities. </p>

<p> In the meantime, in February 1994, the White House released
the new National Drug Control Strategy, which shifted the focus
from interdicting drug shipments in the transit countries of
Central America to intercepting drugs and disrupting drug
organizations in the source countries of South America. The
strategy clearly envisions a reduced role for DOD and its
detecting and monitoring assets in Central America and makes less
money available for U.S. assistance to Central American
countries. The full impact of this strategy shift on transit zone
efforts is not yet clear. </p>

<p> Efforts to Control Drug Trafficking Through Central America </p>

<p> To reduce the use of Central America as a staging area for U.
S.-bound drug shipments, the United States has created and funded
a number of programs that assist countries as they combat
narcotics trafficking. All seven Central American countries have
received U.S. narcotics control assistance and have narcotics
control efforts in place. Although U.S. Narcotics control
initiatives vary among the Central American countries, the
overall U.S. strategy aims to increase their ability to curb drug
trafficking and eventually take responsibility for drug control
operations within their respective countries. </p>

<p> Drug <b>Trafficking </b>in Guatemala </p>

<p> In 1990, drug traffickers began to alter their established
air transit routes through Mexico and expand their operations
into Guatemala. The Department of State estimates that as much as
70 tons of cocaine annually transit Guatemala. The number of
confirmed drug trafficking flights entering the country increased
from 4 in 1989 to 36 in 1990. Guatemala is an attractive transit
location for drug trafficking because it is situated halfway
between the United States and Colombia, has hundreds of
unmonitored landing strips, and has no radar capability. Drug
trafficking aircraft have concentrated their activities in three
regions of the country: the coastal Pacific plains of
southwestern Guatemala, the river valleys and isolated jungle
flatlands of the northern Peten region, and the area around Lake
Izabal in eastern Guatemala. Air delivery techniques involve the
traditional landing and offloading drug cargoes and the
increasing practice of airdropping drug cargoes over land and sea
to waiting confederates. </p>

<p> Seaborne drug transshipment is centered in-the eastern
Guatemualan port of Puerto Santo Tomas. Once in Guatemala,
traffickers use a variety of smuggling methods to forward drug
cargoes to the United States. These range from traditional air
transportation to the use of cargo containers, tractor trailers,
automobiles, boats, and air cargo. According to the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA), the transportation of cocaine
aboard air cargo shipments departing Guatemala and the overland
shipment of cocaine by tractor trailer through Mexico are the two
most serious problems being encountered in Guatemala. </p>

<p> Appendix I </p>

<p> Efforts to Control Drug Trafficking Through Central America </p>

<p> Narcotics Control Three organizations in the Guatemalan
government have anti-narcotics Organizations responsibilities:
the Treasury Police, the National Police, and the military's
intelligence unit. </p>

<p> The Guatemalan Treasury The Guatemalan Treasury Police has
primary responsibility for drug Police enforcement and
eradication and is the principal beneficiary in Guatemala of U.S.
narcotics control assistance. About 350 Treasury Police agents
are involved in different aspects of the drug war. A
20-manTreasury Police unit known as the &quot;Tiburones&quot;
patrols Guatemala's coast and inland waterways and is responsible
for monitoring the entry and exit of contraband at Guatemala's
largest seaport. Another unit known as the &quot;Halcones&quot;
focuses on road blocks and is involved in overland interdiction
operations. A 15-man rapid reaction airmobile platoon accompanies
DEA agents during drug seizure operations. A unit of helicopter
door gunners protects U.S. helicopters involved in eradication
and interdiction operations. In addition, manual eradication <b>units
</b>address the problem of opium poppy and marijuana cultivation.
The Treasury Police also has a drug detector dog unit. </p>

<p> The Guatemalan National Police </p>

<p> At the request Of DEA, a Narcotics Task Force consisting of
15 National Police investigators was formed in 1989 to conduct
undercover and surveillance operations. DEA, however, reported in
1992 that the National Police was the law enforcement agency
believed to be most susceptible to corruption and least
professional in Guatemala. </p>

<p> Guatemalan Military Intelligence </p>

<p> All drug enforcement activities must be coordinated with the
Guatemalan military intelligence unit, currently the sole source
of narcotics-related intelligence. U.S. officials prefer that the
Guatemalan military not be involved in the drug war because of
its poor human rights record. AU forms of U.S. military
assistance, except for military education and training, have been
suspended. </p>

<p> Narcotics Control Efforts </p>

<p> In addition to participating in Operation Cadence, the
government of Guatemala is undertaking several other narcotics
control activities that are supported by the Department of State.
The government of Guatemala has established a clearinghouse for
narcotics-related information and intelligence, a drug detector
dog program, a port inspection and policing unit, and a
counternarcotics intelligence unit and has participated with the
United States in counternarcotics exercises. </p>

<p> The Guatemala City Joint Information Coordination Center is a
counternarcotics information clearinghouse staffed with
Guatemalan personnel and supported by the Department of State.
The center has several computer terminals that are used to track
private aircraft, vessels, and people suspected of drug
trafficking. </p>

<p> A drug detector dog program at the Guatemala City
international airport was established in 1990. The program
consists of Treasury Police dog handlers and eight dogs that have
been trained to detect illegal drugs. Under this program, all
baggage, both private and commercial, and air cargo is to be
inspected. Although the program has not resulted in any major
seizures, DEA believes the level of security awareness at the
airport has been raised and the presence of the dogs and handlers
poses a deterrent to drug smugglers. The program is funded by
airline, cargo, and export association organizations that use the
airport. </p>

<p> The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City is working with Guatemalan
shippers and port authorities to establish a
self-inspection/policing unit. This unit will inspect ships and
cargo for drugs prior to their departure from the port. According
to U.S. officials in Guatemala, State win provide the funds
necessary to initiate the unit, and subsequent costs are expected
to be met by a tax levied on shippers and vessels using
Guatemalan ports. </p>

<p> During 1993, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps conducted a small
joint exercise with Guatemalan Naval Forces that focused on
coastal and river counternarcotics operations on Guatemala's
Pacific and Caribbean coasts. </p>

<p> Cocaine Seizures As shown in table 1. 1, the amount of
cocaine seized in Guatemala has declined since joint
U.S.-Guatemalan interdiction operations began in 1991. U.S.
officials view this decline as an indicator of the success of the
program, since fewer trafficking aircraft are now choosing to
land in Guatemala. These officials also note that a higher
percentage of those aircraft that choose to land are being seized
than before Operation Cadence began. For example, from May 1993,
when interdiction helicopters and personnel began using night
vision equipment, to the end of 1993, Operation Cadence teams
interdicted all six trafficking aircraft detected by the U.S.
Southern Command. Although some U.S. officials noted that
aircraft have apparently evaded U.S. radar assets and continue to
land in Guatemala, Operation Cadence is viewed as the most
successful interdiction program anywhere. 'Me Department of State
believes the operation's success can be corroborated by the
number of landings reported by ground intelligence sources.
According to State, these reports have historically paralleled
the number of flights detected by the U.S. Southern Command and
have revealed no undetected landings. </p>

<p> Drug Trafficking in According to the Department of State and
DEA, Honduras is a transit route for cocaine destined for the
United States and, to a lesser extent, Europe. </p>

<p> Honduras The government of Honduras maintains a radar system
that covers a majority of the country. Furthermore, the Honduran
Air Force has shot down suspected traffickers three times since
1986. Although Honduras possesses the capability to effectively
deter air trafficking, its capability to deter other methods of
trafficking are limited. Drug trafficking via land and sea routes
remains essentially unhindered, according to State. </p>

<p> Honduras is attractive for maritime drug trafficking because
of its poorly guarded coastline, Bay Islands region with a long
history of smuggling, active fishing industry, and containerized
export of seafood products to the United States. U.S. officials
view maritime transportation as the primary shipping method used
by organizations operating in Honduras. </p>

<p> According to DEA and Department of Defense (DOD) officials,
several Honduran families residing in the Bay Islands have
extensive family and business ties throughout Central America and
are believed to be transporting cocaine throughout the region and
into the southeastern United States. The close-knit island
society, their mistrust of outsiders, and the islanders distinct
appearance have prevented DEA from developing informants with
knowledge of island drug trafficking or cur-rent information on
the activities of the island families. 'Me government of Honduras
has a minimal presence on the Bay Islands, and, according to U.S.
officials, law enforcement personnel assigned to the islands have
been quickly corrupted and all drug interdiction efforts to date
have been compromised. </p>

<p> Although few roads are paved in Honduras, the country is a
transit country for the overland shipment of drugs. The
Inter-American Highway passes through a small portion of
southwestern Honduras and is viewed as the major route for
drug-laden trucks bound for the United States. According to
officials in Honduras, traffic on the highway is heavy and
vehicle monitoring and inspection is minimal. </p>

<p> Narcotics Control As of March 1994, four organizations in the
Honduran government had </p>

<p> Organizations anti-narcotics responsibilities: the National
Police, the Air Force, the Navy, and the military's intelligence
unit. </p>

<p> The Honduran National Police Narcotics control efforts in
Honduras are to be carried out by three strike units of the
National Police, which is an arm of the Ministry of Defense.
These units receive equipment and support from the Department of
State and are located in the capital of Tegucigalpa, the
northwestern city of San Pedro Sula, and the Caribbean port of La
Ceiba. </p>

<p> The Honduran Air Force The Honduran Air Force plays a major
role in deterring the air movement of drugs through Honduras. 'Me
Honduran Air Force has three radar facilities that provide almost
complete radar coverage of the country. State reports that
airborne traffickers generally avoid Honduras because on three
occasions most recently in 1992-the Honduran Air Force shot down
drug smuggling aircraft. </p>

<p> The Honduran Navy The Honduran Navy is responsible for
deterring maritime trafficking. However, the Honduran Navy is
small and has four ships available to patrol its extensive
Caribbean coast. One U.S. official found that three of the ships
were in dry dock awaiting funds to finance repair and the fourth
had been tied to a pier for a long period of time because
Honduras cannot afford fuel. In 1994, DEA proposed establishing a
maritime anti-narcotics strike force in Honduras. The lack of
available funds to purchase the necessary boats and equipment
caused State to reject this proposal. </p>

<p> Honduran Military Intelligence During the mid-1980s, the
Honduran military's intelligence unit assumed border inspection
duties that had previously been the responsibility of the
Honduran customs and border patrol agencies because of the threat
posed by Contra rebels. According to U.S. officials, the Honduran
military intelligence unit has also assumed increased
responsibility for investigating drug trafficking activities. </p>

<p> Narcotics Control Efforts </p>

<p> The government of Honduras has attempted to strengthen its
counternarcotics capabilities. However, it lacks the technical
and financial resources necessary to combat drug trafficking and
faces a number of serious organizational problems. </p>

<p> In April 1994, the Department of State reported that large
cocaine shipments were continuing to transit Honduras, in part
because of several institutional weaknesses. In addition to the
difficulties involved in detecting maritime drug shipments, State
reported that Honduran enforcement efforts were hindered by an
underpaid and insufficiently trained police force, an inadequate <b>judi</b>cial
-system, and Widespread corruption. Law enforcement personnel in
Honduras are paid as little as $60 per month. </p>

<p> Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa were equally as
skeptical about Honduras' capabilities and willingness to
interdict drugs. For example, one U.S. Embassy official believes
the Honduran military, which is in charge of the police, has
little or no knowledge of day-to-day police investigative
activities. Another U.S. Embassy official believes that the
Honduran drug interdiction effort would wither away without U.S.
prodding. </p>

<p> Until recently, law enforcement activities in Honduras had
come under the purview of the military, and, as a result, the
Honduran National Police was an arm of the Ministry of Defense.
Ms action blurred the line between civilian law enforcement
activities and military operations, which had a negative impact
on drug enforcement. According to U.S. officials in Tegucigalpa,
military officials with little or no police training or
experience were traditionally placed in senior positions within
the National Police. U.S. officials are optimistic that this
situation will eventually change as graduates of a 4-year
National Police academy gain seniority and assume positions of
greater responsibility. According to these officials, the
narcotics control units of the National Police are now being
staffed with academy graduates. </p>

<p> In March 1994, Honduras created an independent Public
Ministry, which is to have authority over criminal investigations
and prosecutions. According to State, the ministry will recruit
and train new personnel who win be independent of the military. </p>

<p> A major State Department program in Honduras has been the
establishment of a Joint Information Coordination Center. The
center became operational in 1993 and is staffed by 14 Hondurans
who can query a number of databases (e.g., telephone company
records and vehicle registrations) to investigate
narcotics-related crimes. A State official in Honduras views the
center as a success and said the government of Honduras has made
a commitment to the center's operation. This commitment has been
demonstrated through a fourfold increase in the Honduran
contribution to this State-sponsored project and the government's
decision to staff the center with qualified personnel who are
paid professional salaries. </p>

<p> Conversely, despite U.S. support and training, Honduras'
detector drug dog program has not met expectations and is viewed
by one Embassy official as the weakest link in the U.S. program
in Honduras. According to <b>DEA officials </b>in Honduras,
trained dog handlers have been transferred, and dogs have not
been cared for properly. One U.S. official in Honduras said that
the dogs were <b>confined </b>to small cages for long periods of
time and were generally malnourished and mistreated. This
official uses Ws personal funds to purchase dog food for the
animals. <b>DEA </b>officials believe any future narcotics dog
program in Honduras depends entirely on U.S. willingness to fund
the program on a continuing basis. </p>

<p> Efforts to Control Drug Trafficking Through </p>

<p> Central America </p>

<p> Narcotics Trafficking in Other Central American Countries </p>

<p> All Central American countries have organizations and
programs in place to address illegal narcotics trafficking. These
control mechanisms are modest in scope and have achieved only
limited results. The following provides a brief description of
the drug trafficking problems confronting Belize, Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama; efforts by these countries to
address these problems; and U.S. narcotics control assistance to
these countries. </p>

<p> Belize </p>

<p> Belize is a transshipment staging area for cocaine and
marijuana, which is grown in the northern Guatemala province that
borders Belize. The Department of State reports that Belize's
proximity to Guatemala and Mexico, its dense unpopulated jungle,
extensive seacoast, and unsophisticated infrastructure for
combating drug problems make it a potentially significant
transshipment point for illicit drugs. </p>

<p> U.S. financial support for training, transportation, and
equipment have been instrumental in increasing drug seizures and
drug-related arrests in Belize during recent years. The Belize
Police Force, with U.S. assistance, has formed an investigative
unit that targets drug traffickers who have amassed significant
assets. State reported in April 1994 that Belize customs, working
with the Belize police force, had begun a maritime and land
container search and review program. The Department of State
provided $298,000 in narcotics control assistance to Belize in
fiscal year 1993 and plans to provide $1 1 0,000 in assistance in
fiscal year 1994. During 1993, Belize officials participated in a
State-sponsored training program to strengthen basic law
enforcement skills. The Belize police also conducted a marijuana
eradication program and arrested suspected drug traffickers. A
drug detector dog program was also in place at the Belize
International Airport. </p>

<p> Costa Rica Costa Rica has long been a transit point for
cocaine, and recent seizures indicated that heroin is also being
moved through the country. DEA attributes Costa Rica's extensive
coastline, large number of uncontrolled airstrips, and limited
government resources as factors contributing to the country's
growing use as a drug transshipment Site. DEA estimates that
significant quantities of cocaine transits Costa Rica annually.
In addition to the air movement of cocaine, increased quantities
of the drug are believed to be entering Costa Rica from the
island of San Andres (a possession of Colombia, located off the
eastern coast of Nicaragua) and from the Nicaraguan coast.
According to DEA, both coasts of Costa Rica are used by smuggling
aircraft and vessels, and overland shipments of cocaine are
entering from Panama. In its April 1994 report to Congress, State
reported that 611 kilograms of cocaine had been seized during the
first 1 1 months of 1993 and concluded that Costa Rican law
enforcement agencies could not effectively safeguard the country
against traffickers. According to DEA officials, drugs are
smuggled out of Costa Rica by land along the Inter-American
Highway and by sea in containerized cargoes. These drugs are
destined for the United States. </p>

<p> State's April 1994 report further noted that the Costa Rican
government had modernized its counternarcotics laws, streamlined
narcotics control enforcement, and encouraged demand reduction
activities. The State report stated that effective drug control
efforts in Costa Rica were hampered by a scarcity of resources,
the lack of a fully professional police force, and bottlenecks in
the judicial system. 'Mere is also corruption within the Costa
Rican government. Since Costa Rica has no military force, the
underequipped air and maritime sections of the Ministry of Public
Security conduct limited counternarcotics patrols, but they are
hindered by a lack of ships, aircraft, fuel, and trained
personnel. </p>

<p> In fiscal year 1993, the Department of State provided
$272,000 in narcotics control assistance that focused on training
and supporting Costa Rican drug interdiction forces and
continuing support for a counternarcotics intelligence center,
which has been operational since 1988. An estimated $86,000 in
narcotics control assistance is planned for Costa Rica in fiscal
year l994. </p>

<p> El Salvador </p>

<p> The Department of State reported that traffickers are using
the Inter-American Highway, which passes through El Salvador, to
move significant quantities of cocaine and smaller quantities of
heroin. Salvadoran government officials are concerned that
trafficking aircraft increasingly use their territory to evade
U.S.-supported counternarcotics forces in Guatemala and Mexico.
DOD officials believe the large number of landing strips along El
Salvador's Pacific coast and the lack of radar to monitor air
traffic will attract drug traffickers if interdiction efforts in
Guatemala continue to be successful. In June 1993, nearly 6
metric tons of cocaine were seized in San Salvador-the largest
seizure in El Salvador's history. </p>

<p> In 1990, the government of El Salvador created the Executive
Anti-Narcotics Unit, which, according to the Department of State,
has proven to be effective despite its small size. The
anti-narcotics unit relies on the military for air and maritime
capability. The Executive Anti-Narcotics Unit was incorporated
into the civilian national police in September 1993 and granted
wider investigative authority than was previously authorized. </p>

<p> The United States has provided telecommunications equipment
and vehicles to the anti-narcotics unit, without which it would
have been incapable of operating effectively, according to one
Salvadoran official. In addition, a U.S.-supported canine team
allows Salvadorans to monitor airports, ports, and
border-crossing points for illegal drugs. State's narcotics
assistance program provided El Salvador with $205,000 in
assistance in fiscal year 1993 and plans to provide an estimated
$129,000 in assistance during fiscal year 1994. </p>

<p> Nicaragua </p>

<p> Nicaragua plays a relatively minor role in the transshipment
of cocaine to the United States and Europe. However, as
enforcement efforts intensify elsewhere in the region, drug
smuggling organizations have increased their activities in
Nicaragua. Nicaragua's remote and sparsely populated Caribbean
coastline, access to the Inter-American Highway, and limited
government resources also contribute to the nation's potential
use as a drug transshipment site. According to DEA, cocaine
transiting Nicaragua moves by fishing vessel, cargo vessel,
private and commercial aircraft, and land vehicles. A frequent
method of transshipment along the Caribbean coastline has been
airdrops from low-flying aircraft to waiting speed boats. An
additional trafficking method has been coast hopping, a practice
in which cocaine-laden vessels and aircraft mix with legitimate
traffic and slowly move up the Caribbean coast, stopping to
refuel or buy supplies. </p>

<p> The government has created a part-time civilian coordinator
for narcotics affairs, who may also head a government wide
narcotics commission. In March 1993, the government of Nicaragua
implemented a national police reformation project, which created
three anti-narcotics units designed to combat all forms of drug
trafficking. The anti-narcotics units are divided into airport
activity, national trafficking matters, and international
trafficking matters. According to State, the anti-narcotics units
are severely lacking in resources and have captured small and
medium-size shipments of cocaine transiting the country. </p>

<p> In recent years, State has offered to provide $100,000 in
narcotics control assistance if Nicaragua would establish an
anti-drug force that was not under the control of the
Sandinista-influenced military or police. The government agreed
to create such a force; however, personnel assigned to the new
unit were believed to be tied to the Nicaraguan military, and the
U.S. assistance was withheld. 'Me United States and Nicaragua
agreed in 1994 to reprogram these funds to support a demand
reduction project. </p>

<p> At present, there is neither a DEA office nor a Department of
State narcotics control program in Nicaragua. During the early
months of 1994, the government of Nicaragua made a number of drug
seizures, both on its own and with information provided by DEA.
These seizures and the government of Nicaragua's assumption of a
leadership role in regional drug enforcement conferences has
caused U.S. officials to reconsider their opinion of narcotics
control efforts in Nicaragua. During informal discussions in May
1994, Nicaraguan officials informed U.S. representatives that
they planned to request that the United States establish a DEA
office at the U. S. Embassy in Managua. Due to a lack of funds
and absence of an official request, action on establishing a DEA
office in Managua has been postponed. </p>

<p> Panama </p>

<p> Panama plays a role in international drug trafficking by
being a financial center for laundering drug profits and a major
transshipment point for cocaine, according to DEA. Although
Operation Just Cause disrupted money laundering activities in
December 1989, DEA reports that the disruption was only temporary
and money laundering has resumed. DEA officials in Washington
told us that the continued use of Panama as a money laundering
center and the government of Panama's inability or unwillingness
to curb these operations was the biggest problem currently
confronting international law enforcement officials dealing with
this country. Panamanian agencies responsible for money
laundering control are viewed by State as weak. They do not
coordinate with one another, and their resources are small. </p>

<p> One of Panama's greatest attractions for drug traffickers is
the Colon Free Trade Zone. According to a U.S. official in
Panama, legitimate commercial goods entering the Free Zone are
often disassembled, repackaged, and/or transferred to other
shipping containers. These activities, along with the traffickers
ability to forge shipping documents, makes it all but impossible
for law enforcement officials to monitor the movement of drugs
once they enter the area. According to one U.S. official in
Panama, drug traffickers are sophisticated, and many legitimate
businessmen do not know their operations are being used to move
drugs. Most of the large drug seizures have occurred in the Free
Zone or in port facilities serviced by the Free Zone. </p>

<p> During 1993, drug seizures by the Panamanian Judicial
Technical Police and Customs increased, several combined
U.S./Panamanian maritime interdiction campaigns were staged, and
a new drug detector dog -program was established in the Free
Zone. Overall, seizures of cocaine (5.7 metric tons) decreased
from the record 10 metric tons seized in 1992. </p>

<p> According to DEA, although the government of Panama has
provided limited funding for law enforcement efforts against drug
activities, the national police organizations lack the necessary
training, appropriate salaries and equipment to conduct effective
anti-drug operations.' During fiscal year 1993, the Department of
State provided $1.5 million in narcotics control assistance to
Panama and had budgeted $500,000 for fiscal year 1994. In April
1994, the President was unable to certify that. Panama was
cooperating fully with the United States, or was taking adequate
steps on its own, to achieve full compliance with the goals and
objectives of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.' In an
explanation that accompanied the discussion, the President
indicated that even though the government of Panama had
cooperated with many U.S. drug control efforts, it had not made
significant progress on its own to deter money laundering. This
lack of action made Panama a haven for drug launders and hindered
efforts to bring narcotics traffickers to justice. Although
Panama's law enforcement performance showed improvement, it
remained weak. Citing the need to preserve a cooperative
relationship necessary to operate the Panama Canal and permit the
orderly withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Panama, the
President determined that it was in the &quot;vital national
interest' of the United States to continue assistance to Panama. </p>

<p> 'The needs of Panama's law enforcement agencies for resources
and training to combat drug trafficking and money laundering are
also discussed in an earlier report, The War <u>on Drugs:
Narcotics Control</u> Efforts in Panama (GAO/NSLAD-91-233, July
16, 199 1). </p>

<p> 'Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 196 1, as
amended, sets out requirements for withholding of bilateral
foreign assistance and opposition to multilateral development
assistance to major illicit drug-producing countries and major
drug transit countries. These provisions will not <b>apply </b>in
cases in which, under section 490(b), the President determines
and certifies to Congress that either (1) the country has
cooperated fully during the previous year with the United States
or has taken adequate steps on its own to achieve compliance with
the goals and objectives established by the United Nations
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances or (2) vital national interests of the
United States require support for such assistance. </p>

<p> To curb the increased use of Central America as a staging
area for South American cocaine shipments, the United States
initiated Operation Cadence, a DEA-led interdiction effort, in
May 199 1. Mve U.S. government agencies participate in Operation
Cadence: DEA, DOD, the Department of State, the U.S. Customs
Service, and the U.S. Border Patrol. Operation Cadence involves
(1) developing human intelligence on possible trafficking
flights, (2) using U.S. radar assets to detect and monitor
suspect aircraft leaving South American countries, (3) tracking
those suspect aircraft using specially equipped Customs aircraft
from the time they enter Central American airspace until they
land, (4) arresting traffickers and seizing their cargoes, and
(5) conducting follow-up investigations. The specific roles of
these agencies are listed in table H. 1. </p>

<p> b This amount was for Operation Cadence. </p>

<p> cThis figure includes operation and maintenance of P-3 Orion
detection aircraft and Citation tracking aircraft and does not

<p> DEA DEA supports drug interdiction efforts in the region by
having DEA offices in the Central American countries, except
Nicaragua, and deploying specially trained Operation Cadence
teams. Within the six countries, DEA activities are designed to
help host nations to reduce the supply and flow of drugs and
develop intelligence that will lead to the arrest of traffickers
within the host country and the United States. </p>

<p> To supplement the traditional drug enforcement activities of
DEA agents permanently assigned to the U.S. embassies in Central
America, teams of specially trained interdiction personnel are
deployed to Guatemala for 90-day periods. The multiagency Cadence
teams are composed of approximately 10 DEA special agents as well
as communications specialists, medics, and U.S. Border Patrol
personnel who have received U.S. Army training in such
specialties as air mobile techniques, land navigation, field
medicine, and communications. According to DEA, Operation Cadence
has resulted in the seizure of 28.8 metric tons of cocaine and 16
aircraft since its inception. </p>

<p> Under the Operation Cadence concept, DEA agents and
Guatemalan Treasury Police personnel are dispersed to forward
operation bases located in four geographic regions used by drug
trafficking aircraft and await notification by the U.S. Southern
Command in Panama that an aircraft believed to be carrying
narcotics is en route. Using intelligence data and trafficking
profiles developed through hundreds of such tracks, the U.S.
Southern Command identifies potential trafficking aircraft and
monitors their movement along the Central American isthmus. As
the trafficking aircraft enters Central American airspace,
responsibility for tracking the suspect is passed to specially
equipped tracking aircraft of the U.S. Customs Service, which
directs the Cadence team to the anticipated landing site. The
interdiction teams are transported to the landing sites by
helicopters funded by the Department of State. Operation Cadence
is primarily based in Guatemala, but Cadence teams have assisted
in interdiction operations in Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras. </p>

<p> When Operation Cadence began in 1991, the majority of
trafficking flights transited the Pacific and landed along
Guatemala's Southwestern Pacific coast region. Operation Cadence
initially focused on this area, established its first forward
operating base in the Southwestern town of Retalhuleu, and
deployed two Department of State helicopters and interdiction
personnel to the base. After some initial seizures, U.S.
officials observed that the traffickers began to use different
routes into Guatemala that evaded the sole forward operating
location. One State official in Guatemala told us that it took 6
months to establish a forward operating base but that -it -took
the traffickers only 6 days to get around it. Three additional
forward operating bases have been established, and the response
teams are now able to cover most of Guatemala. </p>

<p> Another change in tactics occurred shortly after the program
was initiated when traffickers changed from delivering drugs
during the daytime to delivering at dusk or night. This change
proved to be effective because (1) the interdiction helicopters
lacked night vision equipment and could not be flown at night and
(2) the interdiction teams would land only if the operation could
be completed and the helicopters returned to the secure forward
operating bases during daylight hours. Night vision equipment was
installed in the Department of State helicopters, and by May
1993, the flight crews and interdiction teams had completed
training in the use of the equipment and night assault
techniques. The first night interdiction operation occurred on
June 2, 1993, and resulted in the seizure of </p>

<p> 1.7 metric tons of cocaine. According to DEA officials,
Operation Cadence has successfully interdicted all six
trafficking aircraft that landed in Guatemala from June 2, 1993,
through March 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Some law enforcement officials believe drug traffickers have
again changed their tactics and are bypassing DOD detection and
monitoring assets that surround the traditional
trafficking-routes out of Colombia and northern South America
According to one U.S. official, a few aircraft that were
undetected by DOD have crashed and, when the crash site was
investigated, the planes were found to be loaded with cocaine.
This official believes that traffickers are now flying smaller
aircraft into the Darian jungle that spans Panama and Colombia.
The drug cargoes are then moved across Panama and either loaded
on tractor trailer trucks, transferred to ocean-going vessels, or
reloaded onto small aircraft and flown northward. These aircraft
fly at low altitudes to avoid radar and are designed to mix with
legitimate air traffic. This technique allows the trafficker to
avoid the air- and sea-based radars that are positioned along the
northern tier of South America. </p>

<p> The Department of The Department of State, through its Bureau
of International Narcotics Matters, has primary responsibility
for developing, implementing, and </p>

<p> State monitoring the U.S. international narcotics control
policy. As part of its drug control effort, State funds programs
in six of the seven Central American countries and maintains an
inter-regional aviation program. At the U.S. embassies in
Guatemala and Panama, State has established Narcotics Affairs
Sections to administer the in-country programs and provide
general oversight for the much smaller programs in Belize, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras. </p>

<p> Assistance to Guatemala U.S. narcotics control objectives in
Guatemala are to (1) reduce narcotics trafficking from and
through Guatemala to the United States, (2) reduce opium
production, (3) develop an effective civilian narcotics law
enforcement agency, and (4) improve Guatemalan public awareness
of the dangers of drug production and use. To achieve these
objectives, State funds four narcotics control projects and
provides aviation support for eradication and drug interdiction
operations. </p>

<p> State's efforts to develop an effective civilian narcotics
law enforcement agency in Guatemala involve the organization,
training, and equipping of several drug interdiction and
eradication control units within the Guatemalan Treasury Police.
The Department has supported the establishment of an
anti-narcotics directorate, a narcotics investigative unit,
manual eradication units, a rapid reaction unit that supports
Operation Cadence, an interdiction force that patrols Guatemala's
inland waterways, two drug canine units, and a Joint Intelligence
Coordinating Center. </p>

<p> In addition to being a major transit country for cocaine,
Guatemala is a producing country for opium and marijuana. To
address this problem, the Department of State supports an aerial
and manual eradication project that eliminated almost 95 percent
of the opium poppy crop and about 500 acres of marijuana in 1993.
The State Department provides herbicides for Department of State
eradication aircraft, ground support equipment, communications
and photographic equipment, and field rations. Similar assistance
is also provided for manual eradication operations. </p>

<p> Another Department of State project in Guatemala is designed
to increase public awareness of the harm caused by drug
production, trafficking, and abuse. The Department of State
program in Guatemala also included $295,000 in fiscal year 1993
to support U.S. and foreign national personnel involved in
program planning, development, monitoring, and evaluation at the
Narcotics Affairs Section in Guatemala City. </p>

<p> State also maintains an aviation unit in Guatemala,
consisting of five aircraft to conduct aerial eradication and
assist in law enforcement efforts; one aircraft to transport
interdiction personnel between field locations; and three
helicopters to conduct aerial eradication, surveillance, and
transport interdiction personnel. Five helicopters had been
assigned to Guatemala before November 1993. </p>

<p> Assistance to Honduras U.S. drug control efforts in Honduras
are aimed at (1) increasing Honduran drug enforcement activities,
(2) promoting government efforts to combat narcotics-related
corruption, (3) urging the government of Honduras to strengthen
laws on asset seizure and money laundering, and (4) pursuing
demand reduction programs. In recent years, State efforts in
Honduras have focused on establishing and outfitting three </p>

<p> counternarcotics task forces, establishing a Joint
Intelligence Coordinating Center, and improving the effectiveness
of the drug dog program. </p>

<p> Drug program oversight and reporting is the responsibility of
a U.S. Embassy officer. General program oversight for State's
programs in Honduras is provided by the Narcotics Affairs Section
in Guatemala City. </p>

<p> DOD DOD supports Operation Cadence and narcotics control
efforts in Central America by detecting and monitoring suspect
aircraft and maritime shipments as they approach and transit the
region, providing equipment and expertise to Operation Cadence
operations, developing targeting packages for interdiction
operations, and assisting the countries of the region in drug
awareness and drug abuse prevention programs. DOD's surveillance
mission supports the U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies
that apprehend suspects and seize their cargo, both in the source
countries where cocaine is produced and in the transit countries
between South America and the United States. </p>

<p> DOD operates a network of airborne, ground-, and sea-based
radar systems to detect and monitor potential drug trafficking
aircraft as they move from South America through the transit
zones of Central America and the Caribbean. Information from
these radars is passed to U.S. law enforcement officials and used
to support the interdiction operations of U.S. and foreign
agencies. </p>

<p> DOD supports in-country interdiction efforts by deploying
various specialists and equipment to the countries of Central
America to assist U.S. law enforcement officials and train host
country counternarcotics personnel. To support U.S. embassy
intelligence needs, DOD has deployed tactical analysis teams to
several embassies in the major drug-producing and transit
countries of Guatemala and Honduras. These teams analyze and
produce intelligence on narcotics traffickers using reports from
agencies such as the Defense Intelligence Agency, DOD, DEA, and
other sources and provide this information to in-country
counternarcotics personnel. They use a sophisticated
communications system that can securely transmit and receive
classified documents, photographs, text, or radar images on a
real-time basis to and from U.S. counternarcotics personnel in
the Western Hemisphere. DOD has also deployed military teams to
Guatemala, Panama, and five South American countries to work with
U.S. Embassy personnel and coordinate and assist in the
development and counternarcotics plans. </p>

<p> Finally, the Defense Intelligence Agency develops targeting
packages for potential interdiction operations and provides
intelligence studies and information on trafficking
organizations. For example, it has developed targeting packages
on many of the numerous landing strips along Guatemala's
southwest coast and written reports on the organization and
interrelationships of trafficking families operating in the Bay
Islands of Honduras. </p>

<p> The U.S. Customs The U.S. Customs Service supports Operation
Cadence and narcotics interdiction efforts in Central America by
deploying detection, monitoring, Service and tracking aircraft
and personnel to the region. Customs also provides some training
to Central American interdiction and inspection personnel. </p>

<p> Customs deploys three Cessna Citation aircraft to track
suspect aircraft once they enter Central American airspace. The
planes, crews, and mechanics are assigned on a temporary
rotational duty basis and are deployed to Panama and Soto Cano
Air Base in Honduras. To supplement the detection and monitoring
activities of the U.S. Southern Command -in Panama, Customs
stations up to three surveillance aircraft on a 90-day basis in
Panama to track suspect aircraft as they leave Colombia. </p>

<p> Surveillance aircraft from Corpus Christi, Texas, also fly
routine sorties over the Gulf of Mexico as they perform their
normal Customs functions. During 1993, Customs conducted several
State-funded training programs for Central American narcotics
control personnel. Examples of this training include detector dog
training and a forthcoming regional interdiction course in El
Salvador, a contraband enforcement course being provided to
Guatemalan personnel, and a course in narcotics security
techniques provided to managers and employees of private carrier
companies in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, and Nicaragua. </p>

<p> The U.S. Coast Guard The U.S. Coast Guard supports narcotics
control efforts in Central America by providing training to
improve the law enforcement skills of indigenous maritime police
forces and by establishing a liaison office to coordinate
maritime and river narcotics control activities. </p>

<p> Scope and Methodology </p>

<p> At the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, Guatemala, we
interviewed the Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission and
responsible officials from the Narcotics Affairs, Political and
Economic Sections, Military Assistance Group, Defense Attache
Office, Tactical Analysis Team, DEA, and DEA'S Operation Cadence
interdiction team. We attended meetings of the Embassy's Country
Team and the Narcotics Affairs Committee. To examine and evaluate
narcotics trafficking and interdiction efforts, we reviewed
documents prepared by U.S. Embassy personnel and supplemented the
information in interviews with U.S. officials. We also visited
the Department of State's aviation facility in Guatemala City and
Operation Cadence's forward operating base in Flores, Guatemala.
To obtain the views of the Guatemalan government, we met with the
Director of Guatemala's Anti-Narcotics Operations Department. </p>

<p> At the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, we interviewed
the Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission and responsible
officials from the Political Section, Military Assistance Group,
Defense Attache Office, Tactical Analysis Team, DEA, and members
Of DEA'S Operation Cadence interdiction team who were deployed to
Honduras at the time of our visit. To examine and evaluate
narcotics trafficking and interdiction efforts, we reviewed
documents prepared by U.S. Embassy personnel. We also visited
Soto Cano Air Base and met with representatives of the U.S.
Southern Command. We were not permitted to meet with the pilots
and crews of the U.S. Customs Service interdiction aircraft
stationed at Soto Cano. To obtain the views of the Honduran
government, we met with the Director of the Honduran National
Police's Joint Information Collection Center. </p>

<p> In Panama, we were briefed by officials of the U.S. Southern
Command. We also met with civilian liaison officers attached to
the Southern Command from the Central Intelligence Agency,
Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, U.S. Coast
Guard, U.S. Customs Service, and DEA. At the U.S. Embassy in
Panama City, Panama, we interviewed the Deputy Chief of Mission
and responsible officials from the Narcotics Affairs Section,
U.S. Customs Service, and DEA. </p>

<h2>Drug Use Measurement </h2>

<h3>Strengths, Limitations, and Recommendations for Improvement </h3>

<p> <b>Statement of Frederick Mulhauser, Assistant Director,
Program Evaluation and Methodology Division</b> </p>

<p> <b>GAO/T-PEMD-94-4</b> </p>

<p> <b>October 5, 1993 </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> United States General Accounting Office </p>

<p> GAO Testimony </p>

<p> Before the Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security,
Committee on Government Operations, </p>

<p> House of Representatives </p>

<p> Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: </p>

<p> I am pleased to respond to your invitation to testify about
the work GAO has conducted for the committee in the area of drug
use measurement.' We examined three nationally prominent drug use
studies: the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), the
High School Senior Survey (HSSS), and the Drug Use Forecasting
(DUF) study of booked arrestees, each cited in the President's
National Drug Control Strategy. </p>

<p> Let me discuss our findings from three perspectives: what the
studies have found, what confidence we should have in those
findings, and how drug use measurement studies could be improved,
with a particular focus on high-risk populations. In brief, all
three studies show a decreasing trend in the overall rate of
marijuana use. Since 1985, NHSDA and HSSS have also estimated a
decreasing trend in the overall use of cocaine. DUF data, on the
other hand, have described an overall stable, high rate of
cocaine use among booked arrestees during the first 4 years of
the study (1987-90). The use patterns for heroin and other
opiates are less clearly identified, due to the problems
experienced in obtaining access to users of these drugs. Thus,
the three studies produce information regularly on marijuana and
cocaine use, but we still do not have adequate prevalence
measures of heroin usage in the United States. This is a serious
problem in light of recent increases in heroin availability and
purity, and decreases in the price charged for this drug. </p>

<p> What confidence can we have in the studies' estimates? We
believe that both NHSDA and HSSS have been important in the
development of national drug control strategies, since they
represent our most highly sophisticated drug prevalence studies
to date. We did, however, find a number of limitations. For
NHSDA, we found exclusion of groups at high risk for drug use,
problematic measurement of heroin and cocaine use, and reliance
on subject self-reports. We found that HSSS excludes dropouts and
absentees, yields questionable estimates of the drug use patterns
of nonwhite populations, does not adequately measure heroin use,
and also relies on subject self-reports. Finally, although DUF
employs an objective drug use detection technique-urinalysis--in
addition to self-reports, the study's results cannot be
generalized either to the booking facilities studied or the
geographic areas specified in DUF publications. DUF also lacks
standardization across study sites, which minimizes comparability
across these sites. In summary, we judge NHSDA and HSSS national
prevalence estimates to be conservative measures of actual drug
use patterns. In addition, our confidence in DUF results is
limited since we cannot determine the extent to which DUF drug
use findings actually characterize the population of booked
arrestees housed in each locality. </p>

<p> What recommendations can we make for improving drug
prevalence measurement? We focused our efforts along two lines of
work: (1) enhancing the NHSDA, HSSS, and DUF studies; and (2)
developing new methods for studying high-risk groups. Promising
methodologies, such as hair analysis, deserve exploration as less
intrusive means than urinalysis to validate self-reports. Hair
analysis can also determine drug use over a more extended period
of time, while urinalysis detection is typically restricted to
the initial 12 to 96 hours following use. Expanding the
subsamples of current surveys and conducting new studies aimed at
hard-to-reach groups should improve the coverage of
underrepresented, high-risk target populations. </p>

<p> Let me now give you the details of our findings and
recommendations, as well as highlight specific implications for
the development of a national drug control strategy. </p>

<p> <u>DRUG USE PATTERNS OF TARGETED GROUPS IN NHSDA, HSSS, AND
DUF</u> </p>

<p> As already noted, each of these surveys reported a decline in
the overall rate of marijuana use. Between 1979 and 1990, the
NHSDA past year rate decreased from 18 to 10 percent, while the
HSSS yearly rate decreased from 51 to 27 percent. During 1987-90,
the DUF booked-arrestee marijuana rate declined from 36 to 19
percent, based on urinalysis test results. </p>

<p> NHSDA and HSSS have demonstrated declines in the overall rate
of cocaine use between 1985 and 1990. The NHSDA yearly rate
decreased from 6 to 3 percent, and the HSSS yearly rate decreased
from 13 to 5 percent. Cocaine use among booked arrestees
participating in the DUF study, however, remained high during the
period 1987 to 1990. In 1987, 46 percent of all those tested by
urinalysis procedures were found to be positive. Three years
later, the rate was still above 40 percent (43 percent). This
points up the need to develop appropriate cocaine treatment
strategies for specific target populations in our national drug
control strategies. </p>

<p> NHSDA has not been a useful tool for tracking heroin use, nor
was it expected to be given that heroin users frequently do not
live in typical household settings. Through 1990, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) judged both the pastmonth and
past-year use estimates to be too imprecise to publish. HSSS
publishes separate heroin and other opiate use rates on an
ongoing basis. For 1979-90, the high school senior rate of
pastyear heroin use remained stable at less than 1 percent; the
rate for other opiate use varied around the 5-percent level. DUF
provides a combined score for heroin and other opiate use, <b>based
</b>on urinalysis testing. During the period of study, 1987-90,
the DUF heroin and other opiate use rate dropped from 14 to 10
percent. </p>

<p> <u>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE THREE STUDIES</u> </p>

<p> <u>National Household Survey on Drug Abuse</u> </p>

<p> Six particular strengths are emphasized in our report: <u>(1)
</u>project management skills; (2) national population coverage;
(3) high screening and interview completion rates; (4) inclusion
of all major illicit drug types, as well as alcohol and tobacco;
(5) statistical determination of drug use patterns and trends;
and (6) use of cognitive laboratory procedures to assess more
effective, user-friendly ways of acquiring drug use data. </p>

<p> Four selected limitations are discussed here in greater
detail because of their implications for drug use measurement and
the development of a national drug control policy. </p>

<p> <u>The Accuracy of Subject Self-Reports</u> </p>

<p> NHSDA findings rely entirely on the honesty of subject self
reports. Recent studies (1985-91) provide mixed evidence
regarding the accuracy of drug use self-reports. Some studies
have confirmed the validity of the self-report method. Others
found particular groups providing inaccurate responses (for
example, arrestees, pregnant females, and discharged clients).
Underreporting of the more socially disapproved drugs has also
been noted. </p>

<p> The accuracy of self-reported responses for household
respondents in NHSDA has never been effectively evaluated,
despite the high price tag associated with the study
(approximately $12 million in 1991). We therefore cannot be sure
of the veracity of subject responses, particularly as related to
the more stigmatized, or socially disapproved, drugs (for
example, heroin and cocaine). </p>

<p> <u>Problems In Heroin Measurement</u> </p>

<p> NHSDA includes few subjects who have indicated use of heroin
either during the past month or during the past year. In part,
this reflects the relatively low prevalence rate of heroin use in
this country. But it is also a function of the fact that heroin
users are frequently not situated in the household environment or
are excluded from the sample because they are transients. In
1990, only 1 Hispanic male, 7 black males, and 13 white males
indicated using heroin in the past year. During the same time
period, there were only 4 Hispanic females, 3 black females, and
4 white females who indicated heroin use. The generalization of
NHSDA results to various subgroups of the population is therefore
impractical given these limited numbers. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, in 1991, 142,000 heroin users were nationally
estimated based on projections from one 79-year-old woman
participating in the survey, and 32 percent of the annual heroin
users were judged to be older than age 60 based on projections
from just seven heroin-using subjects. </p>

<p> Given national concerns about a potential increase in the
heroin use rate, it is imperative that additional data sets be
integrated to track the prevalence and incidence rates of this
drug. Policy planners cannot rely on NHSDA for good documentation
of heroin use. </p>

<p> <u>Problems in Cocaine Measurement</u> </p>

<p> In the 1990 NHSDA, the number of individuals said to be using
cocaine &quot;once a week&quot; or more was estimated at 662,000.
In 1991, this estimate increased to 855,000, indicating a jump of
almost 200,000 weekly cocaine users within a single year. This
sharp increase has been taken as one indicator of the need to
fight a &quot;two-front drug war&quot;: one with casual,
recreational users; the other with more hard-core, frequent
users. However, the 855,000 estimate was subsequently shown to be
incorrect. Due to imputation problems, the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) revised the 1991 user population estimate,
first from 855,000 down to 654,000 and then to 625,000, implying
that the frequency of weekly cocaine users in NHSDA had, in fact,
not risen between 1990 and 1991. obviously, greater quality
control procedures need to be in place to catch errors of such
significant policy relevance. </p>

<p> Questions have also been raised about the validity of
national estimates of &quot;frequent&quot; cocaine users. In
1990, 41 percent of the survey's past-month cocaine users did not
initially indicate use of the drug during this time period. The
contractor subsequently modified their responses to eliminate
contradictory results. However, the procedures for modifying a
subject's response pattern are not believed to be entirely
justifiable. </p>

<p> <u>Frequency of NHSDA Survey Administration</u> </p>

<p> The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 requires that the extent of
alcohol and drug abuse among the general population be assessed
annually. (NIDA had been conducting the NHSDA every 2 to 3 years
previous to 1990.) A yearly data collection strategy is
questionable for three reasons: (1) the 1991 total cost
allocation was sizable, at $11.5 million; (2) prevalence rate
changes have been minimal between survey administrations; and (3)
hard-core, frequent drug users are often not found in the
household environment. </p>

<p> <u>The High School Senior Survey</u> </p>

<p> Five particular strengths are highlighted in our report: </p>

<p> (1) HSSS is managed by a distinguished group of social
scientists at the University of Michigan who have guided the
project since its inception in 1975; (2) a sophisticated design
is utilized to obtain between 15,000 and 19,000 participating
seniors each year, drawn from between 120 and 140 public and
private schools; (3) the refusal rate among available students
has consistently been less than 1 percent; (4) all illicit drug
types, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and steroids, are considered;
and (5), as in NHSDA, statistical tests have been used to
determine whether there have been significant score changes
between survey administrations. </p>

<p> Five limitations potentially affecting the validity of HSSS,
and thereby the development of national drug policy, are
highlighted in our report. </p>

<p> <u>The Accuracy of Subject Self-Reports</u> </p>

<p> Like NHSDA, HSSS has not assessed the accuracy of
selfreported drug use against objective criteria. While the study
investigators provide reasonable self-report correlative evidence
that the findings may be valid, an &quot;honesty&quot; survey
question shows that high school senior lifetime drug use
estimates for marijuana, heroin, and the amphetamines may be
understated. As in the case of NHSDA, objective confirmation of
the accuracy of HSSS is needed. </p>

<p> <u>Exclusion of High School Dropouts</u> </p>

<p> By design, dropouts have not been included in the sampling
frame of HSSS since the inception of the study in 1975. Since
they are thought to have higher rates of drug use than students
in school, this implies some underestimation of drug use rates
among the age cohort of high school seniors. Correction factors
introduced by project officials have not been universally
accepted. In fiscal year 1992, NIDA awarded a 5-year grant to
HSSS investigators to study drug use among dropouts. </p>

<p> <u>Exclusion of School Absentees</u> </p>

<p> The HSSS field staff does not engage in follow-up school
visits because of costs and logistics. As a result, students
absent on the day of the survey administration are excluded from
participation. According to the coprincipal investigators,
absentees constitute approximately 17 to 23 percent of enrolled
students. HSS is therefore missing about one in five students
because of absenteeism. Drug correction factors have been based
on the assumption that absenteeism is a fairly random event and
thus the absentee patterns of those present (at the time of the
survey) represent those who are absent. This assumption, while
plausible, has not been confirmed. </p>

<p> <u>School Nonparticipation and Replacement</u> </p>

<p> The school nonparticipation rate has tended to be between 20
and 40 percent. Since school officials do not indicate school
drug problems as a reason for nonparticipation, the assumption
has been made that no drug bias occurs in the school replacement
process. This conclusion too has never been empirically proven. </p>

<p> <u>Minority Drug Use Estimates</u> </p>

<p> Drug use estimates for nonwhite seniors have traditionally
not been reported on a yearly basis in HSSS press releases and
publications. Nor have safeguard procedures been adopted to
ensure the representativeness of minority groups in the HSSS
survey sample. As a result, annual nonwhite drug use patterns
among high school seniors over the years have remained unclear. </p>

<p> <u>Drug Use Forecasting</u> </p>

<p> Four strengths of DUF are highlighted in our report: (1)
establishment of a much needed drug use data base at the local
level; (2) resort to an objective drug use criteria, rather than
reliance on subject self-reports; (3) high urinalysis
participation rates; and (4) use of a centralized laboratory to
minimize potential specimen test biases. </p>

<p> I will discuss three of the principal DUF limitations in my
testimony today. The full range of significant limitations are
detailed in our report. </p>

<p> <u>Geographic Site Variations</u> </p>

<p> DUF collects self-report interviews and urinalysis specimens
from booked arrestees at central booking facilities. These
participating facilities, however, often serve very different
geographical areas. Some facilities serve an entire city; others
part of a city, a central city plus additional cities, an entire
county, or parts of a county. These differences are not made
clear in DUF publications. Based on annual reports, the
impression is created that drug use findings are generated for
entire cities, when in fact this is not always the case. Criminal
justice planners and decision makers must therefore exercise
caution in using these data for the development of overall city
and county drug policies. </p>

<p> <u>Subject Sampling Procedure</u> </p>

<p> DUF has not been able to demonstrate a representative sample
of booked arrestees either at the central booking facility level
or in the geographic locales highlighted in DUF reports. The
sampling procedures, as described in the DUF procedures manual,
are not being followed closely by all sites. </p>

<p> <u>Privacy in the Interview Situation</u> </p>

<p> Not all facilities use a private office for arrestee
interviews. Subjects have been interviewed in hallways traversed
regularly by police department personnel; in small alcoves, with
a police officer standing guard at the entrance; or through the
bars of a holding cell, in close proximity to other arrestees.
Under such conditions, there is a potential for underreporting
drug use, particularly since arrestees are awaiting arraignment
before a judge. (Though pledges of confidentiality are given,
arrestees may not fully believe them.) Urinalysis rates, however,
should not be affected. </p>

<p> <u>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF DRUG PREVALENCE
ESTIMATES</u> </p>

<p> <u>Enhancing the NHSDA, HSSS, and DUF Studies</u> </p>

<p> In our report, we recommend to the Congress: </p>

<p> -- That part A of title V of the Public Health Service Act be
amended to provide that the Secretary of Health and Human
Services collect survey data only biennially, rather than each
year, on the national prevalence of the various forms of
substance abuse among high school students and among the general
population. But if local or regional indicators portend an
increase in drug use, then the Secretary should have the
authority to initiate new or augment current studies to determine
the nature and degree of the problem. </p>

<p> Implementation of this recommendation can result in an NHSDA
savings of approximately $13 million per year, based on 1993 cost
estimates, if the current methodology is maintained. A portion of
this cost-savings could be usefully applied toward studying the
drug use patterns of those high-risk groups disproportionately
impacting criminal justice and health system resources,
field-testing new methodologies, and validating our current
measures and findings. </p>

<p> We also recommended that the Secretary of Health and Human
Services: </p>

<p> -- Give high priority to validating self-reports of the use
of illicit drugs, particularly focusing on objective techniques
such as hair testing. Hair testing has received publicity both in
the United States and abroad because of its potential to
distinguish the use of illicit drugs in hair specimens for
extended periods of time. At present, we conclude that hair
analysis has sufficient scientific merit to justify its use in
self-report validation field trials. (This should not be
construed to mean that we also support hair analysis in
employment testing and court testimony, for which maximal
precision would be required.) A hair validation study of four
drug types, involving 2,000 subjects, using both a hair screen
and a confirmatory test, would cost approximately $150,000
(including subject payment incentives), a relatively small
allocation compared to the $13 million cost of conducting just
one round of NHSDA. </p>

<p> -- Develop or improve supplementary data sources to more
appropriately determine heroin and cocaine prevalence patterns
and trends. </p>

<p> In 1991, NHSDA was expanded beyond just a household survey to
include the sheltered homeless, civilians on military bases, and
residents of college dormitories. These target populations,
however, do not encompass the totality of heroin and cocaine
users. If we are to more accurately judge the prevalence of
heroin and cocaine use in this country, we must come up with
ingenious ways of identifying and accessing the relevant
population groups (that is, those living in institutional and
noninstitutional quarters and on the streets), as well as devise
ways to prevent double counting (for example, of a homeless
person formerly living in public housing). </p>

<p> -- Incorporate methodological design changes into HSSS so
that nonwhite individuals are adequately sampled. </p>

<p> Nonwhite annual drug use rates have typically not been
discussed in HSSS reports because of methodological study
concerns. We therefore know little about minority drug use rates
at the high school level and their contribution to overall
national drug prevalence patterns. If we are to plan prevention
and treatment strategies aimed at this diverse subgroup, we must
certainly ascertain the nature and extent of their drug use on a
more timely basis. </p>

<p> -- Retain the current design of NHSDA to provide national
estimates only (and not expand the design to provide state-level
estimates of drug use). </p>

<p> Expanding NHSDA to the state level would be too costly, given
other drug area priorities. The Department of Health and Human
Services and NIDA have estimated a cost of about $110 million for
state-level survey expansion. Such an effort would also duplicate
other already existing studies being conducted in multiple
states. </p>

<p> Further, we recommended that the Director of the National
Institute of Justice review the practicality of improving the DUF
design, such as by using a standardized methodology across sites;
and give priority to creating a DUF arrestee data base that can
be generalized to booked arrestees in the geographic areas
surveyed. </p>

<p> The development of generalizable findings requires several
stages of decision making. First, the geographic unit of study
must be clarified. (For example, if cities are the relevant unit,
then county data from outside city boundaries must be excluded.)
Second, central booking facilities must be chosen that adequately
represent a cross section of arrestees being detained in that
geographic unit. (This may involve the selection of one or more
booking facilities.) Third, a sample of arrestees must be
obtained from each booking facility to yield an appropriate cross
section of that facility's arrestees. </p>

<p> <u>Developing New Methods for Studying High-Risk Groups</u> </p>

<p> Since NHSDA and HSSS do not sufficiently measure drug use
among high-risk target groups, supplementary methods must be
conceptualized, field-tested, and implemented if we are to better
understand drug prevalence rates and trends among these groups. </p>

<p> Until recently, only modest efforts were being made in this
area. But momentum is building. We have already discussed NIJ's
pioneering work with booked arrestees. Particularly over the past
3 years, NIDA has been active in sponsoring studies aimed at
identifying, gaining access to, and interviewing individuals at
high risk for substance abuse. The Washington, D.C., Metropolitan
Area Drug Study (DC*MADS) was designed to develop prototype
methodologies in the Washington, D.C., area for replication in
other metropolitan areas. High-risk groups in the study include
the homeless and transient populations, school dropouts, juvenile
and adult offenders, and the institutionalized. NIDA intends to
publish methodological, substantive reports in 1993 describing
the procedures adopted in the field experiments, success levels
achieved, and resultant drug use findings. It is premature at
this time for us to comment on the utility of the various
methodologies for obtaining drug use data from these high-risk
groups. However, transference to other metropolitan areas is
certainly going to be a function of study costs. Budget
submissions in September 1990 to the Office of Management and
Budget for initial study were quite high (for example, for the
homeless and transient study, $883,628; for the school dropout
study, $576,033; and for the adult offender study, $577,550). </p>

<p> NIDA funded a 5-year grant award to the University of
Michigan's HSSS investigators aimed at following up a national
cohort of 8th and 10th graders every 2 years to learn more about
the drug use of school dropouts. It is also too soon to comment
on the effectiveness of this study, given that the award was made
in fiscal year 1992. The direct costs of this study range from
$319,000 in the first year of the grant to $619,000 in the fifth
year. </p>

<p> The Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the Office of
National Drug Control Policy have sought to estimate the number
of hard-core and heavy cocaine users through secondary analyses
of existing data bases. Ethnographic street studies have been
incorporated in high-risk group prevalence estimation efforts, as
have nominative techniques and a wide range of traditional
operations research procedures. These types of studies are still
in their early stages of development with respect to drug use,
requiring much more elaboration and specificity, but are
certainly worthy of continued attention and funding. </p>

<p> To undertake such work on high-risk groups in an orderly,
scientific manner, we recommended that the Secretary of Health
and Human Services </p>

<p> -- conduct a systematic program for the study of drug
prevalence rates among underrepresented, high-risk groups. </p>

<p> It is not sufficient for agencies to engage ad hoc in
singular studies of specific high-risk groups. Given the
impingement of these groups on the health care delivery system,
policymakers and health officials must have comprehensive data
bases from which to plan needed prevention and intervention
strategies. </p>

<p> Mr. Chairman, this concludes my remarks. I would be happy to
answer any questions you or Members of the Subcommittee may have.

Drug-Related Crime </h1>

<p> (Briefing Report, 05/22/95, GAO/GGD-95-159BR) </p>

<p> <img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> GAO provided information on drug courts, a new approach used
to monitor defendants' drug use, treatment, and behavior </p>

<p> GAO found that: in exchange for reduced charges, drug using

their progress through frequent status hearings; drug court
programs vary in length, participant eligibility, funding, and
other practices; as of March 1995, there were at least 37 drug
courts operating nationwide; 33 drug courts have accepted over
20,000 defendants; most drug courts do not accept violent
offenders; drug courts have not been operating long enough to
determine their overall effectiveness; and although the 1994
Crime Act authorized $1 billion to support drug court programs
from fiscal year (FY) 1995 through FY 2000, Congress has proposed
repealing the drug court grant program </p>

<p> LETTER B-260301 May 22, 1995 The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch
Chairman The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr </p>

<p> Ranking Minority Member Committee on the Judiciary United

John Conyers, Jr </p>

<p> Ranking Minority Member Committee on the Judiciary House of
Representatives This briefing report provides information on drug
courts,\1 a new approach used by state and local governments to
address drug-related crime. These courts monitor the treatment
and behavior of drug-using defendants </p>

<p> Title V of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
of 1994 (the 1994 Crime Act) authorizes the award of federal
grants for drug courts. The act requires that we assess the
effectiveness and impact of these grants and report to Congress
by January 1, 1997. To assist Congress in its deliberations on
whether to fund drug courts, we developed this preliminary
report. Specifically, we gathered information on drug courts in
existence prior to the awarding of grants under the 1994 Crime
Act, assessed evaluations of these courts, and reviewed the
Department of Justice's (DOJ) responsibilities and plans for
implementing the federal drug court grant program </p>

<p> During April and on May 11, 1995, we briefed the Committees
on the results of our work </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 Throughout this briefing report, we use the terms drug
courts and drug court programs interchangeably </p>

<p> RESULTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Letter :1 </p>

<p> In response to the deluge of drug cases since the late 1980s
and the cycle of recidivism (rearrest rates) common to drug
offenders, some state and local jurisdictions created drug
courts, the majority of which have been operating since 1993. The
main purpose of drug courts is to use the authority of the court
to reduce crime by changing defendants' drug-using behavior. In
exchange for the possibility of dismissed charges or reduced
sentences, defendants are diverted to drug courts. Judges preside
over drug court proceedings, monitor the progress of defendants
through frequent status hearings, and prescribe sanctions and
rewards as appropriate in collaboration with prosecutors, defense
attorneys, treatment providers, and others. Although there are
basic elements common to many drug court programs, they vary in
terms of participant eligibility, length of the program,
penalties and rewards, and other practices. The courts are
supported by a variety of local, state, federal, and private
funds and participant fees, according to the Drug Court Resource
Center.\2 As of March 1995, there were at least 37 drug courts
operating nationwide, most of which had been fully operational
for at least 9 months. Thirty-three drug courts responding to our
questionnaire reported having accepted over 20,000 defendants, of
whom a third had completed their programs. According to the
Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, none of the
drug courts accept defendants currently charged with a violent
offense, and most do not accept defendants with prior violent
convictions. However, at least one drug court accepts defendants
regardless of prior offenses. (See sect. I for more general
information on drug courts.) We assessed six evaluations of five
drug courts completed as of March 1995. Although some evaluation
results indicated that drug courts may have some beneficial
effects, limitations in their designs and methodologies, as well
as the relative newness of drug courts, precluded firm
conclusions about the overall impact of these programs. The
evaluations showed mixed results in recidivism and other
defendant outcomes. For example, two evaluations showed less
recidivism by drug court defendants. However, three other
evaluations showed no significant differences in recidivism.
Additionally, two evaluations of the same drug court showed
contrasting recidivism results. (See sect. II and app. III for
more information on the evaluations we assessed.) The 1994 Crime
Act authorized the Attorney General to award and administer
discretionary grants for drug court programs. A key requirement
of the act is that violent offenders are prohibited as drug court
participants. The act authorized $1 billion from fiscal years
1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. For fiscal year
1995, $29 million was appropriated. However, Congress has
proposed fiscal year 1995 budget cuts in a pending rescission
bill </p>

<p> In addition, the House has passed legislation repealing the
drug court grant program authorized in the 1994 Crime Act </p>

<p> DOJ expects to award grants beginning in the summer of 1995.
The 1994 Crime Act also authorizes the Attorney General to
provide for a national evaluation of drug courts supported by
federal grants. DOJ expects to complete the evaluation to assess
the impact and effectiveness of drug court grants in about 2
years. (See sect. III for more information.) </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \2 The Bureau of Justice Assistance funds the Drug Court
Resource Center. The Resource Center began operating October 1,
1994, under the direction of The American University in
partnership with the National Center for State Courts and the
National Consortium of Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime
Programs. The Resource Center assists state and local justice
system officials in planning, implementing, managing, and
evaluating drug courts. It also acts as a clearinghouse and
provides technical assistance and other services to jurisdictions
interested in developing or expanding drug courts </p>

<p> OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Letter : </p>

<p> 2 In preparation for our 1997 mandated study, we initiated a
preliminary review of drug court programs. Our objectives were to
determine the number, location, and key elements of drug courts;
the results and validity of evaluations of drug courts; and DOJ's
responsibilities and plans for implementing statutory
requirements for the federal drug court grant program </p>

<p> The Drug Court Resource Center, which is based at The
American University, Washington, D.C., provided us with general
information on drug courts. To obtain more current information,
we sent a questionnaire to 37 drug courts. We received responses
from 33 drug courts as of March 31, 1995. We did not verify the
accuracy of the data provided to us by the Drug Court Resource
Center and drug courts. In addition, we attended a January 1995
national training conference for drug court professionals in Las
Vegas, NV, and visited drug courts in Las Vegas and Washington,
D.C </p>

<p> To determine the results and assess the validity of
evaluations of drug courts, we obtained 11 drug court evaluations
completed as of March 1, 1995, from the Drug Court Resource
Center. These evaluations were done by a variety of sources,
including independent researchers, county officials, and court
representatives. We reviewed them and assessed the evaluative
methodology used and the validity of reported findings. We did
not analyze the reported results of three of them because they
reported outcome data for drug court defendants without any
reference to comparison or control groups. We were unable to
assess the validity of one because it did not include a
description of the methodology used. Two dealt with one drug
court and were assessed as one evaluation because one was a
follow-up to the other and contained the same methodology and
findings </p>

<p> To determine DOJ's responsibilities and plans for
implementing the federal grant program, we met with
representatives of the Office of Justice Programs, DOJ. We held
discussions and reviewed documents regarding their
responsibilities and plans for implementing the federally
supported drug court program. We also obtained drug court funding
information from the Department of Health and Human Services'
Center for Substance Abuse Treatment </p>

<p> Our review was done from January 1995 to April 1995 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Letter :3 </p>

<p> In April 1995, we provided a draft of this report for comment
to the Attorney General and the Project Director of the Drug
Court Resource Center </p>

<p> On April 21, 1995, we discussed the report with the Project
Director of the Drug Court Resource Center. On May 5, 1995, we
also discussed the report with the Deputy Assistant Attorney
General and other officials from DOJ's Office of Justice
Programs. These officials generally agreed with the information
presented in the report and provided comments that we
incorporated as appropriate </p>

<p> DOJ officials said the report was positive, informative, and
will be helpful to drug court professionals. They explained that
there is no universal model for drug courts, and as a result,
each drug court operates differently due to local needs and
conditions. Similarly, the Project Director of the Drug Court
Resource Center said that the information presented in the report
was comprehensive, accurate, and objective </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :3.1 We are sending copies of this briefing report to
other interested congressional committees and Members and the
Attorney General </p>

<p> Copies will also be made available to others upon request </p>

<p> The major contributors to this briefing report are listed in
appendix IV. If you have any questions about this report, please
call me on (202) 512-8777 </p>

Briefing Section I DRUG COURTS
==============================================================
Letter TYPES OF DRUG COURTS
------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> In the late 1980s, state and local criminal courts were
inundated with drug cases. One response to this challenge was the
creation of drug courts, a relatively recent grassroots movement
to deal with drug-related crime and drug-using defendants </p>

<p> According to DOJ, two main types of drug courts have evolved,
those that (1) expedite the processing of drug cases and (2) use
court-monitored drug treatment to attempt to achieve changes in
defendants' drug-using behavior. In addition, some drug courts
combine these two types </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorizes grants for those drug courts
that have programs offering court supervised drug treatment. The
act does not authorize grants for courts designed solely to
expedite the processing of drug cases. This briefing report
provides information on drug treatment courts </p>

<p> Courts offering court-monitored drug treatment are referred
to as &quot;drug treatment courts&quot; or simply &quot;drug
courts.&quot; Although there is no standard definition applicable
to drug treatment courts, the National Association of Drug Court
Professionals\3 defines them as follows: &quot;A Drug Court is a
special court given the responsibility to handle cases involving
less serious drug using-offenders through a supervision and
treatment program. These programs include frequent drug testing,
judicial and probation supervision, drug counseling, treatment,
educational opportunities, and the use of sanctions and
incentives.&quot; One of the first drug courts to employ drug
treatment as an integral part of the processing of drug felonies
is located in Dade County (Miami), FL, and began operations in
June 1989. This court became a model for other jurisdictions that
implemented drug courts </p>

<p> Although drug courts share certain common elements such as
court-monitored treatment, the courts are uniquely designed to
meet local needs and can vary considerably in the way they
operate </p>

<p> Organizationally, drug courts generally are distinct parts of
trial courts </p>

<p> -------------------- \3 </p>

<p> This is the principal organization of professionals involved
in the development of treatment-oriented drug courts. Its members
include judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment service
providers, educators, researchers, and community leaders </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES
------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :5.1 </p>

<p> According to a report provided by the Drug Court Resource
Center, drug courts have generally taken two approaches to
processing cases: (1) deferred prosecution and (2)
postadjudication. In the deferred prosecution approach, shortly
after being charged, defendants waive their right to a speedy
trial and enter a treatment program </p>

<p> Defendants who fail to complete the treatment program have
their charges adjudicated. Defendants who complete the treatment
program are not prosecuted further or have their charges
dismissed. This approach is intended to capitalize on the trauma
of arrest and offers defendants the opportunity to obtain
treatment and avoid the possibility of a felony conviction </p>

<p> In the postadjudication approach, defendants are tried and
convicted, but their sentences are deferred or pronounced and
incarceration is suspended until they complete or withdraw from
the treatment program </p>

<p> This approach provides an incentive for the defendant to
rehabilitate because progress toward rehabilitation is factored
into the sentencing determination </p>

<p> Appendix I presents examples of how cases are processed under
the two drug court approaches </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Letter :6 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter
:6. </p>

<p> 1 According to the Drug Court Resource Center, drug courts
generally accept defendants with substance abuse problems who are
currently charged with drug possession and/or other nonviolent
offenses such as property crimes. Some drug courts accept
defendants who have prior convictions, and others do not </p>

<p> The Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center also
pointed out that drug courts do not accept defendants currently
charged with a violent offense. The Project Director further
commented that most drug courts do not accept defendants with
prior violent offenses </p>

<p> However, at least one drug court accepts defendants
regardless of prior offenses possibly including defendants with
prior convictions for violent crimes. Under the 1994 Crime Act,
federal grants cannot be awarded to any drug court that allows
either current or past violent offenders to participate in its
program </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Letter :7 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :7.1 </p>

<p> According to a DOJ-funded report on the first national drug
court conference,\4 judicial leadership is the foundation on
which the overall drug court approach is most often built. A
jurisdiction's trial court provides the leadership, authority,
and management capacity to enable the drug court to operate. The
drug court is headed by a judge whose role is generally expanded
beyond normal court duties to include active involvement in
monitoring the status of defendants in the treatment program. The
judge's duties may include conducting hearings, reviewing
treatment progress reports, issuing bench warrants, and deciding
who may enter the program and who should be terminated
considering recommendations of prosecutors, public defenders, and
treatment providers </p>

<p> The judiciary alone, however, cannot successfully implement
and operate a drug court, according to the conference report.
Rather, a drug court requires a special collaborative effort
among judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and related
criminal justice agencies along with treatment providers and
other social services and community organizations. This
collaborative effort is based on local needs and the targeted
population being served and may differ considerably among drug
courts </p>

<p> Specifically, drug courts create new and different roles for
prosecutors and defense attorneys. In most drug courts these
players are not adversaries in the traditional sense but rather
are to work in concert with the court for the sole purpose of
helping defendants become drug free. This nonadversarial role is
significant because the court does not arbitrate in the usual
fashion and has the opportunity to address addiction-related
issues. Further, drug courts place the defendant in the unique
role of being held publicly accountable for his or her actions </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG COURT PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :8. </p>

<p> 1 According to the Drug Court Resource Center, in most drug
courts, treatment is designed to usually last at least 1 year and
is administered on an outpatient basis with limited inpatient
treatment as needed to address special detoxification or relapse
situations.\5 These courts operate with the philosophy that
because drug addiction is a disease relapses can occur, and that
the court must respond with progressive sanctions and/or enhance
treatment rather than immediately terminate a participant </p>

<p> The central element of all drug court programs is attendance
at the regularly scheduled status hearings at which the drug
court judge monitors the progress of participants. Monitoring is
based on treatment provider reports on urine test results that
detect drug use, attendance at counseling, etc. The judge
reinforces progress and addresses noncompliance with program
requirements. The primary objective of the status hearing is to
keep the defendant in treatment </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \5 These programs recognize that some individuals will
require a longer period to complete the program </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Letter :9 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :9. </p>

<p> 1 Overall, according to the Drug Court Resource Center,
treatment program requirements are more demanding than the
applicable sanction received through traditional adjudication.
Most drug court programs require that defendants attend status
hearings, participate in counseling sessions, and submit to urine
tests with the goal of becoming drug free. Some programs focus on
special classes of defendants such as women. Many programs also
provide support services such as public health services;
assistance with housing, food, and child care; vocational
training; and job placement </p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :10 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :10. </p>

<p> 1 Treatment services are generally divided into three phases:
(1) detoxification, (2) stabilization, and (3) aftercare. First,
the defendant's physical dependence on drugs is eliminated
through detoxification. Acupuncture is sometimes used as an
adjunct to treatment in the detoxification phase. According to
the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, 9 of 20
drug courts responding to the Center's 1994 survey indicated that
they used acupuncture. Second, the defendant's psychological
craving for the drugs is treated during stabilization. Frequent
group and/or individual counseling sessions are employed during
this phase. And third, aftercare focuses on helping the defendant
obtain education or job training, find a job, and remain drug
free </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :11 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :11. </p>

<p> 1 Sanctions for failing to abide by program rules can include
(1) verbal admonition from the judge; (2) demotion to an earlier
stage of the program; (3) incarceration for several days or
weeks, increasing with the number and severity of the violations;
and (4) more frequent status hearings, treatment sessions, or
urine tests. Many programs also use graduated sanctions,
increasing the severity of the sanction with subsequent
violations of program rules </p>

<p> DOJ also pointed out that most drug courts use sanctions not
to simply punish inappropriate behavior but to augment the
treatment process. For example, many drug courts will place a
defendant in residential treatment if he or she is unable to
achieve satisfactory progress in an outpatient setting. In
addition, many drug courts incarcerate defendants for the purpose
of detoxification rather than detain them for inappropriate
behavior </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :12 (See figure in printed edition.) REASONS FOR
TERMINATING DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :12. </p>

<p> 1 Drug courts use various criteria for ending a defendant's
participation in the program before completion. These may include
a new felony offense; multiple failures to comply with program
requirements, such as not attending status hearings or treatment
sessions; and a pattern of positive urine tests. According to
DOJ, many drug courts do not terminate defendants for a new drug
possession offense </p>

<p> Before terminating a defendant for continuing to use drugs,
drug courts will use an array of treatment services and available
sanctions. There are no uniform standards for the number of
failed urine tests and failures to attend treatment sessions that
result in a participant being terminated that apply to all
programs. Each drug court sets its own standards. Relapses are
expected and the extent to which noncompliance results in
terminations varies from program to program </p>

<p> Generally, the drug court judge makes the decision to
terminate, but the prosecutor or treatment provider can recommend
the termination </p>

<p> Once a defendant is terminated, he or she will be referred
for adjudication or sentencing </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :13 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :13. </p>

<p> 1 Drug courts typically require defendants to complete a
treatment program in order to graduate. Some impose other
conditions defendants must meet after treatment. These could
include remaining drug free and not being arrested for a
specified period of time, paying restitution, being employed
full-time, or performing community service </p>

<p> For example, the Seattle, WA, drug court requires that a
defendant complete all phases of the program to graduate.
However, the Beaumont, TX, drug court requires that, in addition
to completing the treatment program, the defendant maintain
sobriety for a specified time and participate in education and
vocational training and/or be working full-time </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :14 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :14. </p>

<p> 1 In many jurisdictions, completion of the drug court program
leads to a dismissal of charges or cessation of prosecution. In
others, the guilty plea can be stricken, the defendant can be
sentenced to probation in lieu of incarceration, or the
defendant's probation can be shortened </p>

<p> DOJ pointed out that some drug courts will seal all case
records, including arrests, when defendants complete the program.
The sealing of records is particularly significant when
attempting to measure the impact of drug court programs at a
later date </p>

1995, there were at least 37 drug courts operating across the
country.\6 Of these drug courts, 29 had been fully operational
for at least 9 months, and 8 others had been operating for a
lesser period </p>

<p> The number of drug courts steadily increased from 1991 to
1994, with substantial increases since 1993. As of March 1995, 24
jurisdictions were developing drug courts. Another eight
jurisdictions had exhibited interest in starting drug courts by
initiating feasibility studies </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PARTICIPANTS' STATUS AS OF MARCH 1995 </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :17. </p>

<p> 1 Data obtained from 33 of 37 drug courts responding to our
questionnaire showed that since inception of the first drug court
in 1989, 20,421 persons have participated in drug courts. Of
these, 7,235 participants have graduated, and 7,595 are currently
in the programs. The remaining participants did not complete the
programs </p>

<p> Generally, when participants do not complete drug court
programs it is because they were terminated, voluntarily
withdrew, or died </p>

<p> Based on the data received, these totaled 5,591.\7 The number
of participants currently in each of these drug court programs
varied widely, ranging from a low of 1 participant in Santa Ana,
CA, a new drug court,\8 to a high of 1,200 participants in Miami,
FL, one of the oldest drug courts. The median number of
participants in these drug court programs is 105 </p>

<p> It should be noted that many of the drug courts have been
operating for less than a year and would not yet have graduates.
As shown, more than one-third of the total participants are
currently enrolled in drug court programs </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \7 We calculated the number (5,591) of participants not
completing the programs by subtracting the number (7,235) of
graduates and the number (7,595) of participants currently in the
programs from the total number (20,421) of participants in the
programs since their inception </p>

<p> \8 At the time of our review, Orange County, CA, had filed
for bankruptcy and curtailed resources for its drug court </p>

<p> FUNDING SOURCES
-----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :18 (See figure in printed edition.) According to the Drug
Court Resource Center Project Director, drug courts generally
piece together funding from a variety of sources </p>

<p> Information reported to the Drug Court Resource Center by 15
drug courts showed that these sources included local taxes and
surcharges, state alcohol and drug agency funds, private
foundation monies, participant fees, and federal grants </p>

<p> Some drug courts have developed innovative funding
approaches. For example, a drug court judge from Orange County,
CA, told us that when the county filed for bankruptcy, it cut
back services necessary for the drug court operation. The judge
said that he was forming a nonprofit corporation to try to
provide funding for the drug court outside of the bankruptcy
proceedings </p>

<p> Until the 1994 Crime Act, there was no federal grant program
specifically designed for drug courts. However, some drug courts
have received federal grants and technical assistance from the
Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance
Abuse Treatment (CSAT) and DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance
(BJA) </p>

<p> According to CSAT, it has provided or plans to provide an
estimated $15 million in assistance to some drug courts. Of the
$15 million, about $6 million is for a drug court demonstration
project for the District of Columbia Superior Court </p>

<p> BJA could not provide us with complete information on DOJ
grants used in support of drug courts. According to a BJA
official, &quot;drug courts&quot; was not a specific grant
category that grantees could designate for funding. However, this
official commented that BJA is aware that DOJ grant funds
provided under other grant categories such as &quot;corrections
options&quot; have been used in support of drug courts, and that
three drug courts had received $2.5 million from the Corrections
Options program. </p>

<p> Letter :19 (See figure in printed edition.) PARTICIPANT FEES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :19. </p>

<p> 1 We obtained data (based on our questionnaire and
information provided by the Drug Court Resource Center) from 34
drug courts on fees charged to participants in drug court
programs. Twenty-three of the 34 drug courts reported that they
charged fees, and 11 reported that they did not. Insufficient
data on fee amounts actually collected precluded us from
determining the extent to which drug courts relied on participant
fees as a funding source </p>

<p> Of the 23 drug courts charging participant fees, the amounts
charged for the total cost of treatment ranged from $20 to
$2,500. One drug court reported charging fees on a sliding scale
from $60 to $300 for treatment based on a defendant's ability to
pay, while another reported charging on a sliding scale from $500
to $2,500. At least nine courts responded that they charged fees
ranging from $200 to $350 </p>

<p> Several drug courts reported applying participant fees to
counseling and treatment costs, drug testing costs, and other
program expenses </p>

<p> In addition, DOJ commented that many treatment providers
believe participant fees are a useful therapeutic tool and should
be charged regardless of the extent to which fees are needed to
cover program costs </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :20 (See figure in printed edition.) COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :20. </p>

<p> 1 Drug courts have reported information to the Drug Court
Resource Center on savings that they believe their programs have
achieved in the costs of court and other criminal justice system
operations </p>

<p> One of the larger categories of savings reported by drug
courts was jail costs avoided, i.e., the estimated costs of
incarcerating a typical drug court defendant that would be
expected to incur if he/she were not participating in a drug
court program. One court estimated savings of $5,400 per drug
court participant, and another estimated savings of $2,566 to
$5,185 </p>

<p> Another drug court claimed a savings of $2 million over a
3-year period resulting from drug court participants spending
fewer days in custody and the consequent ability of the county to
rent unused jail cells to other law enforcement agencies. Still
another drug court estimated it had saved about $875,500 in jail
costs for its program but did not specify the time frame </p>

<p> The National Association of Drug Court Professionals noted
that drug court programs are much less costly than the
incarceration of drug-using offenders. The Association reported
that incarceration of drug-using offenders ranges from $20,000 to
$50,000 annually, and the cost to build a prison cell is $80,000
to $90,000. It also said that drug courts cost less than $1,500
annually for each offender </p>

<p> Some drug courts identified savings such as reduced caseloads
of other trial judges not in the drug court program. In addition,
some drug courts claimed savings in court-appointed attorney
fees, reduced probation office caseloads, and costs of
prosecution, arrests, and police overtime </p>

<p> We did not verify this information, and further analysis of
all drug court costs is essential to fully understanding the
benefits of these programs </p>

<p> Briefing Section II EVALUATIONS OF DRUG COURTS </p>

<p>
==============================================================
Letter DO DRUG COURTS MAKE A DIFFERENCE? </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :21 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> In evaluating the effectiveness of drug courts, the basic
question is: Do drug courts make a difference? Specifically, do
defendants who successfully complete drug court programs exhibit
reduced recidivism, decreased drug use, and other socially
beneficial effects as a result of participating in drug court
programs when compared to their counterparts, i.e., control
groups who were not exposed to the same drug court treatment?
Based on evaluations we reviewed, drug courts generally may have
some beneficial effects. However, because of the nature of the
study designs and the short periods of time elapsed between
treatment and measurement of outcomes (drug courts are relatively
new), firm conclusions cannot be drawn about the effects of drug
courts </p>

<p> It is both difficult and costly to conduct program
evaluations that can measure program effects. Although the
strongest design involves assembling and randomly assigning
defendants to control groups (comparing drug courts versus
traditional courts, for example), such studies raise serious
logistical and ethical issues. Additionally, according to the
Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, control
groups cannot be used properly unless a drug court is originally
designed to define such groups </p>

<p> An alternative approach is to design studies allowing the
researcher to create comparable groups from existing programs,
through the use of various analytical techniques. However, even
such studies are often made more difficult by the fact that
existing programs change over time, resulting in individuals at
the end of the study period being exposed to different treatments
than those at the beginning </p>

<p> Also, different locations of the same program may have very
different implementation needs, making it more difficult to
compare such programs </p>

<p> GAO ASSESSED DRUG COURT EVALUATIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :22 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations that compared performance
outcomes for drug court defendants to the experiences of other
defendants, i.e., previous divertees or unsuccessful drug court
defendants or defendants who had never been in a drug court. In
order to determine whether a drug court has an impact on its
participants, an evaluation should compare outcomes of drug court
defendants to those of other groups of similar defendants who are
not in drug courts </p>

<p> The six evaluations covered five drug courts and varied
considerably in terms of the study designs, types of outcomes
measured, and scope of analyses performed on the available
information. Our assessment indicates that the evaluations
differed particularly in terms of the validity of the designs,
which determine the extent to which the reader is able to draw
conclusions from any findings. Of the six studies: two studies
had fairly strong designs; of these, one provided some evidence
of an effect of the drug court program, and the other study's
results were too preliminary to draw any conclusions; two studies
had designs with more serious problems; of these, one suggested
possible effects of the program, and the other was inconclusive;
and two studies had design weaknesses that prevented any
conclusions about the effects of the program </p>

<p> The major outcome measure used, in five of the six
evaluations, was recidivism (rearrest rates). To a lesser degree,
recidivism-related measures were also used, such as length of
time before rearrest and days spent in custody for felony
offenses. We focused on these measures in this report because
they provided the strongest evidence for the long-term effect of
the drug court programs, even though other measures were used in
these studies </p>

<p> EVALUATION OUTCOMES </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :23 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> Two of the six evaluations were well-designed. However, the
results in terms of recidivism outcomes were mixed. One of the
evaluations showed that drug court defendants had significantly
lower rearrest rates than defendants not in drug court, and that
they spent fewer days in custody for felony offenses (app. III,
evaluation 1). This evaluation also showed that drug court
defendants had a lower rate of failures-to-appear for required
court hearings than did other defendants. However, the other
evaluation, with preliminary information only, showed no
significant difference so far in rearrest rates between drug
court defendants and defendants who were not in the drug court
(app. III, evaluation 2) </p>

<p> Although these evaluations have strong study designs and one
indicates some beneficial effects on defendants resulting from
the drug court programs, the evidence does not permit firm
conclusions about the effects of the drug courts studied.
Additionally, for one of the evaluations, insufficient time had
elapsed to provide firmer evidence of program effect </p>

<p> Of the next two evaluations, both of the same drug court, one
provided some suggestive evidence of program effect. It showed
lower recidivism by drug court defendants and longer time before
rearrest (app. III, evaluation 3). The other generally showed no
difference in recidivism rates (app. III, evaluation 4). Design
problems made it difficult to attribute these findings to the
programs. There are too many potential differences between the
drug court participants and the groups to which they were
compared to develop strong conclusions </p>

<p> The final two evaluations did not provide reliable evidence
concerning the effects of the programs. One showed no substantial
difference in recidivism between drug court defendants and
defendants who left the drug court (app. III, evaluation 5). The
other evaluation measured defendants' drug abstinence and
failure-to-appear rates and showed positive results for drug
court defendants as compared to defendants terminated from the
drug court (app. III, evaluation 6). Because the study design did
not control for a number of factors, such as motivation and
susceptibility to treatment, these evaluations do not permit
conclusions to be drawn about the effects of the programs </p>

<p> Appendix III contains further information on each of these
evaluations </p>

<p> Briefing Section III FEDERAL DRUG COURT GRANT PROGRAM </p>

<p>
============================================================== </p>

<p> Letter THE 1994 CRIME ACT </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :24 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> THE 1994 CRIME ACT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :24. </p>

<p> 1 Beginning in fiscal year 1995, DOJ may provide
jurisdictions with drug court grants. Title V of the Violent
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law
103-322) authorizes the Attorney General to award discretionary
drug court grants to states, units of local government, Indian
tribal governments, and state and local courts. Grants may be
awarded to drug court programs when a judge continuously
supervises the progress of nonviolent offenders with substance
abuse problems </p>

<p> The act requires the Attorney General to issue regulations to
ensure that jurisdictions receiving drug court grants to support
their programs do not allow violent offenders to participate. It
defines a violent offender as a person who is charged with or
convicted of an offense involving a firearm, dangerous weapon,
death, serious bodily injury, or force; or who has one or more
prior convictions for a violent felony crime </p>

<p> Drug court programs must also integrate a number of judicial
sanctions and treatment services. Specifically, the act requires
programs to include (1) mandatory periodic testing for the use of
addictive substances; (2) substance abuse treatment; (3)
diversion, probation, or other supervised releases with the
possibility of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration when
participants do not comply with program requirements or fail to
show satisfactory progress; and (4) program and aftercare
services, such as relapse prevention, health care, education,
vocational training, job placement, housing placement, and child
care </p>

<p> Letter :25 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :25.1 </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized a total of $1 billion for
fiscal years 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs.
Although the act authorized $100 million for fiscal year 1995,
DOJ's fiscal year 1995 Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-317)
included only $29 million for the drug court program. However,
Congress has proposed fiscal year 1995 budget cuts for the drug
court program. On March 16, 1995, the House passed H.R. 1158, the
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1995, which rescinds
$27.75 million for the drug court program. During its
consideration of H.R. 1158, the Senate reduced the rescission to
$17.1 million. On April 6, 1995, the Senate passed its version of
the bill and requested a conference with the House </p>

<p> The House and Senate conferees began May 3, 1995, to try to
reconcile the separate provisions of the bill </p>

<p> The President's fiscal year 1996 budget requests $150 million
for drug court grants. However, H.R. 667 (The Violent Crime
Incarceration Act of 1995) passed by the House of Representatives
on February 10, 1995, would amend Title V of the 1994 Crime Act
and in doing so would repeal the 1994 Crime Act's drug court
discretionary grant provisions. On February 22, 1995, H.R. 667
was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary </p>

<p> DOJ'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :26 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> DOJ recognizes that no single model exists for an effective
drug court. Consequently, DOJ plans to maintain flexibility in
awarding grants to programs that use a variety of approaches to
coordinate drug treatment and persuade offenders to abstain from
drugs with the goal of becoming drug free. In addition, given the
great diversity in the structure and operation of state and local
courts and criminal justice systems, DOJ plans to allow
jurisdictions to tailor local initiatives to best suit their
needs and local conditions </p>

<p> DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has overall
responsibility for the new federal drug court program, including
policy setting. To carry out this responsibility, OJP has hired
an acting director and policy analyst to staff its Drug Court
Program Office. In addition, BJA, an office of OJP, recently
established a Drug Court Program Office to manage and monitor
drug court program grants, according to an OJP official. BJA has
hired four people to staff this office </p>

<p> Since November 1994, OJP and BJA staffs have worked together
to develop program guidelines and application materials.\10
Currently, these staffs are considering the most appropriate and
effective ways of providing technical assistance to federally
supported drug courts, operating drug courts, and related federal
projects to be funded with other fiscal year 1995 resources. The
level and source of funding to support this technical assistance
is also under review </p>

<p> OJP's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is responsible for
funding a national evaluation of drug court program impacts. This
evaluation will assess whether federally supported drug court
programs have helped their participants to break the cycle of
substance abuse and crime. It will also assess the
cost-effectiveness of these programs </p>

<p> NIJ is also responsible for ensuring that drug court programs
use part of their grants to conduct process evaluations. These
are aimed at determining, among other things, if the drug court
is achieving its objectives, if it was implemented as originally
intended, and whether major changes are appropriate. They will
also examine how drug courts affect the rest of the court system
and other elements of the criminal justice system </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :27 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> FISCAL YEAR 1995 DRUG COURT GRANT PROGRAM </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :27. </p>

<p> 1 If Congress does not rescind the fiscal year 1995
appropriation, DOJ plans to award grants for planning,
implementing, and improving or enhancing drug court programs.
Eligible applicants may apply only for one type of grant.
Assuming no rescission is enacted, of the $29 million
appropriated for fiscal year 1995, DOJ plans to award up to 100
planning grants for not more than $35,000 each to jurisdictions
interested in establishing drug courts, 10 implementation grants
for not more than $1 million each to jurisdictions that have
identified their target populations and case processing
procedures, 3 additional implementation grants for not more than
$2 million to larger jurisdictions with populations exceeding 1
million, and 20 improvement and enhancement grants for not more
than $1 million to jurisdictions that have already established
drug courts </p>

<p> Federal grants for each drug court program will be 75 percent
of program costs. The grantees will be required to provide cash
to fund the remaining 25 percent </p>

<p> Applications are due by May 23, 1995. Then, OJP and BJA
staffs will focus on screening and processing qualified
applications for potential grant awards, pending final
congressional action on the fiscal year 1995 budget rescission.
If the current deadline for filing drug court applications does
not change, the first grants are expected to be awarded in the
summer of 1995 </p>

<p> EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Letter :28 (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> Evaluating effectiveness is a critical element of the federal
drug court program. The 1994 Crime Act authorizes the Attorney
General to carry out or make arrangements for evaluations of
programs that receive discretionary program grants. The act also
mandates us to study and assess the effectiveness and impact of
these discretionary grants and report to the Congress by January
1, 1997 </p>

<p> OJP program guidelines require recipients of drug court
grants to cooperate with a national evaluation team. The
evaluation will be aimed at measuring program impact primarily
through the use of the following criteria: reduction in
recidivism rates of program participants, maintenance of
acceptable treatment completion rates, decreased participant drug
use, and maintenance of a cost-effective program </p>

<p> NIJ is responsible for overseeing the national evaluation.
The evaluation will focus on treatment and its impact and is
expected to take at least 2 years to complete. At the time of our
review, NIJ was developing the solicitation for proposals to
conduct the evaluation </p>

<p> Program guidelines also require each drug court grant
recipient to conduct process evaluations of their programs. For
these evaluations, grantees are expected to collect descriptive
information on the role of drug court players, potential eligible
population, and participant program characteristics. Grantees
will also be asked to collect information on program procedures
used to identify and screen eligible offenders, accept and assess
offenders, respond to relapses, manage and monitor cases, and
discharge and refer participants </p>

<p> OUTCOMES REPORTED IN AND GAO'S ASSESSMENT OF EVALUATIONS OF
FIVE DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> ========================================================= </p>

<p> Appendix III EVALUATION 1: F.I.R.S.T </p>

<p> OAKLAND </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:1 TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:1.0.1 Drug use defendants granted admission to a
diversion program </p>

<p> Admission requirements changed during the course of the study
</p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN \ </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:1.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 110 defendants in a program with a similar
group of 110 defendants in a different program a year earlier </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:1.0.3 </p>

<p> Drug court participants referred in January and February of
1991; earlier group referred in January 1990 through March of
1990. The report contained a 3-year follow-up study </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:1.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Felony rearrests: Drug court defendants had a lower
average rate of felony rearrests per defendants (0.75) than had
previous divertees (1.33) </p>

<p> (2)Days in custody for felony offenses: Drug court
defendants, on average, spent fewer days in custody per defendant
(44) than had previous divertees (78) </p>

<p> (3)Bench warrants: Drug court defendants, on average, had
fewer bench warrants issued for failures to appear at court
hearings (0.67) than had previous divertees (1.1) </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:1.0.5 </p>

<p> There were some questions concerning the comparability of the
two groups, as well as the eligibility requirements for the two
programs </p>

<p> (The report stated that eligibility requirements were relaxed
for the drug court program participants in order to obtain a
broader group for comparative purposes.) In spite of these
concerns, the evaluation suggested some fairly strong evidence of
program success after 3 years </p>

<p> EVALUATION 2: MARICOPA COUNTY </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:2 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:2.0.1 </p>

<p> Offenders sentenced to probation for first-time drug
possession convictions </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:2.0.2 </p>

<p> Random assignment to four groups: (1)No drug testing,
frequent visits (n=approximately 154) </p>

<p> (2)Monthly random drug testing, occasional visits
(n=approximately 154) </p>

<p> (3)Biweekly scheduled drug testing, limited visits
(n=approximately 154) </p>

<p> (4)Drug court, with testing and treatment supervised by a
probation officer (n=177) </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:2.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in program between March 1992 and April 1993.
Current data reported only preliminary findings after 6 months </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:2.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: No statistically significant differences
(16.95 percent for the drug court group vs. 15.37 percent for
others) </p>

<p> (2)Rates of technical probation violations: Drug court group
had lower rates than those of others (7.9 percent vs. 11.9
percent) </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:2.0.5 </p>

<p> Although the evaluation design was quite strong, the results
were preliminary; insufficient time had elapsed to provide a firm
indication of program effect. Future comparisons may be
complicated by the fact that the drug court sample had lower
rates of reported history of prior marijuana use. Otherwise, the
control groups (groups 1-3) were quite similar to the drug court
group (group 4) </p>

<p> EVALUATION 3: DADE COUNTY (GOLDKAMP AND WEILAND) </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:3 TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:3.0.1 </p>

<p> Persons arrested for 2nd and 3rd degree drug-related felonies
</p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:3.0.2 </p>

<p> Five key groups:\11 (1)Persons admitted to drug court program
(n=326) </p>

<p> (2)Sample of felony drug defendants in same period not
eligible because of more serious drug-related offenses (n=199) </p>

<p> (3)Sample of nondrug felony defendants in same period (n=185)
</p>

<p> (4)Sample of felony drug defendants in period several years
earlier (n=302) </p>

<p> (5)Sample of felony nondrug defendants in period several
years earlier (n=536) </p>

<p> In addition, the evaluation compared persons completing the
drug court program with those failing to complete </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \11 An additional sample of offenders could not reliably be
used as a control group because they were exposed to the drug
court program </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:3.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in groups 1-3 had charges filed in August 1990
and September 1990. Charges for groups 4-5 were filed in the
summer of 1987. Data report results after 18 month follow-up </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:3.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: Drug court defendants were rearrested at a
statistically significant lower rate (33 percent, vs. 40 percent
to 53 percent for other groups) </p>

<p> (2)Time before rearrest: Drug court defendants had
statistically significant longer time before rearrest (median of
235 days, vs. 52 to 115 days for other groups) </p>

<p> (3)Rearrests and treatment completion: Rearrest rates were
associated with failure to complete the treatment program </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:3.0.5 </p>

<p> The results suggested an effect of the program. However, the
study design was unable to make the comparison with offenders in
the same situation with similarly serious drug offenses;
therefore, the results must be interpreted cautiously. In
particular, the drug court sample had fewer prior arrests than
had the other comparison groups, and the key group of felony drug
defendants used for comparative purposes were not eligible for
the drug court program because of the seriousness of their
charges or prior records </p>

<p> The comparisons between those completing and failing to
complete the program must also be viewed with caution, due to
possible motivational and other differences between the groups </p>

<p> In commenting on a draft of this report, DOJ officials noted
that this study had a strong design with carefully drawn
comparison groups. We agree that the study's design was generally
strong </p>

<p> However, as we state in this report, there were some
potentially important differences in prior arrest rates between
the groups, and the study was not able to compare similarly
situated drug defendants in a roughly similar time period.
Therefore, as we noted, the study's results should be interpreted
cautiously </p>

<p> EVALUATION 4: </p>

<p> DADE COUNTY (SMITH, DAVIS AND GORETSKY) </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:4 TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:4.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants with no prior convictions charged with a drug
possession offense, admitting to a drug problem for which they
wanted treatment </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:4.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 318 defendants assigned to the drug court with
a sample of 99 narcotics cases in early 1988. In addition, a
group of drug court defendants who were accepted into the drug
court program were compared on rearrest rates </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:4.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants were assigned to the drug court in January 1990
through March 1990. The comparison group was charged between
January 1988 and March 1988 </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:4.0.4 (1) </p>

<p> Rearrest rates: There was no statistically significant
difference in the rate of felony rearrests after 1 year between
those assigned to drug court (32 percent) and the comparison
group of defendants charged 2 years earlier (33 percent). Those
defendants accepted by the drug court did have lower rates of
rearrest (15 percent), but the authors noted that these
individuals constituted &quot;a highly select group . . . least
disposed to commit new crimes.&quot; The rearrest results in this
evaluation differed from those in the other evaluation of Dade
County (evaluation 3) </p>

<p> (2)Sentencing dispositions: There were statistically
significant differences in dispositions between those assigned to
drug court and the comparison group of earlier defendants. Those
assigned to drug court were more likely not to face further
prosecution and less likely to serve probation or short jail
terms </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:4.0.5 </p>

<p> There were concerns about the comparability of the
participants in the various groups. In particular, the finding of
lower rearrest rates for program participants should be viewed
cautiously in light of the selectivity of admission to the
program. As a result, there were strong reservations about the
results reported </p>

<p> DOJ officials, in commenting on a draft of this report,
indicated that this study had several flaws. They pointed out
that the study was done when this drug court was less than 10
months old. They further noted that information on successful
drug court participants was not available for evaluation because
the participants' records were sealed. We concur with these
comments </p>

<p> EVALUATION 5: BROWARD COUNTY (TERRY) </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:5 TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:5.0.1 </p>

<p> First-time offenders arrested for possession or purchase of
cocaine </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:5.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 392 defendants completing or remaining in the
drug court program with 241 defendants not completing the drug
court program </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:5.0.3 Participants entered the program from July
1991 through June 1992 </p>

<p> Study results were reported for October 1993 </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:5.0.4 </p>

<p> Rearrests: Persons remaining in the program committed
felonies at a slightly lower rate than did those leaving the
program (7.7 percent vs. 12.0 percent). (Cases dismissed were not
included in these comparisons.) No differences occurred in
comparing the proportions having committed misdemeanors (4.1
percent for persons remaining in the program vs. 5.0 percent for
those leaving the program) </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:5.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to draw any conclusions about the effect of the program </p>

<p> EVALUATION 6: MULTNOMAH COUNTY </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:6 TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:6.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants arrested for possession of any illegal substance
for personal use </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:6.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 105 defendants graduating from the drug court
program with 78 defendants who terminated unsuccessfully </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:6.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants entered the program on or before August 1, 1992,
and graduated or terminated unsuccessfully on or before April 1,
1994 </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:6.0.4 </p>

<p> Graduates had lower rates of bench warrants for failure to
appear, went slightly longer before the first bench warrant was
issued, and had a lower percentage of positive urine tests than
those who terminated unsuccessfully. However, the report did not
indicate whether these figures referred to prior histories or
follow-up information after program completion </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Appendix III:6.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to draw any conclusions about the effect of the program </p>
