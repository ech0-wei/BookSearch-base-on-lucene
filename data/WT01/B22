<p><b>HELD DECEMBER 5, 1938 <br>
in the UNITED STATES Bureau of Internal Revenue Building (Room
3003)<br>
Washington D. C.<br>
Part 2</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Commissioner Anslinger:<br>
</b>I assume the press will be after us. The Treasury Department
has not as yet publicly announced this meeting. The Department
will do this subsequently. I hope therefore, that none of you
will be drawn into discussions with reporters until the meeting
is concluded. The Treasury Department will issue a statement on
the meeting. I want all of you to freely express your opinions on
every phase of the subject under discussion; and if you differ on
any point, we hope you will not hesitate to present your side of
the picture.<br>
I want to give you a brief review of what took place at Geneva,
Switzerland, last spring at a meeting of the Sub-Committee on
Cannabis, of the Advisory Committee on traffic in opium and other
dangerous drugs of the League of Nations. I think this a fitting
way to open the Conference. It will illustrate the international
significance of the Cannabis problem and show the current status
of some of the excellent work that is being done by other nations
on the question.<br>
This work I think was very important, and I want to give you the
reports of the experts of the various countries which will give
you an idea as to the points on which the authorities still
remain in doubt. </p>

<p>The Secretariat of the League referred to various points
submitted to the Experts in a questionnaire drawn up for their
use in January, l936, and used as a basis for the Sub-Committees
work. He described the research work being undertaken. The
Sub-Committee endeavored to indicate on what phases of the
Marihuana problem agreement exists, and on what points there is a
divergence of views which has formed the subject of exchange of
information between the Experts whether on chemical and
agricultural questions, or on the medical and pathological
questions. </p>

<p>Since the Advisory Committee's last session, Mr. J. V.
Collins, Government Analyst, Ceylon, on January 12, l938,
notified the Committee of his acceptance of the Advisory
Committee's invitation to act as an Expert on Cannabis in place
of the late Dr. Symons. The Committee received important
documents from two of its Experts, Dr. Bouquet and Dr. de
Myttenaere.Dr. Bouquet has for many years done a vast amount of
work on Cannabis. He is the Inspector of Pharmacies in Tunis. </p>

<p>Dr. Bouquet submitted reports on the following points: </p>

<p>I Vegetable products wrongly designated as hemp. </p>

<p>II Microscopic examination of samples of Cannabis. </p>

<p>III Physiologically active resin in the staminate Cannabis
plant. </p>

<p>IV New variety of Cannabis. </p>

<p>V Influence of drought on the growth of Cannabis. </p>

<p>VI Medical uses of Cannabis and drugs with a Cannabis base. </p>

<p>VII Use of animal charcoal. </p>

<p>VIII Dr. James C. Munch's Reaction. </p>

<p>IX Is light petroleum the only solvent of the active element
of Cannabis and its preparations? </p>

<p>X Addiction by certain solanaceae. </p>

<p>Then the report is supplemented by Dr. Bouquet regarding the
following points: </p>

<p>I Are the light petroleum extracts of Cannabis the only ones
that are physiologically active? </p>

<p>II Observations on document O.C.1542 (z) (Report on the
research conducted by the Treasury Department of the United
States of America, in cooperation with the Department of
Agriculture, in connection with studies on the chemical
identification of Cannabis Indica (Cannabis Sativa). </p>

<p>III Identification test for Cannabis resin, proposed by Dr. de
Myttenaere.<br>
</p>

<p>IV Method of identifying resin, proposed by Dr. H. J. Wollner.
</p>

<p>V Procedure for experiments. </p>

<p>VI Observations on the causes of Cannabis addiction in North
Africa. </p>

<p>Dr. de Myttenaere submitted to the Secretariat a supplement to
the third note on Indian hemp, and a fourth note on Indian hemp,
including a study of the published work which has appeared since
May, 1937, giving observations of Mr. Wollner's experiments in
the United States. Apart from these contributions from Experts of
the Sub-Committee on Cannabis, the Secretariat received a ÒStudy
of the Chemical Identification of Marihuana (Cannabis
Indica)&quot; by Dr. Rafael Plasencia, Government Chemist of
Cuba, and a reply concerning the same subject from the United
Kingdon Representative. It also received information regarding
experiments on the chemical identification of Cannabis indica
communicated by the United States Government. This is the report
covering the investigation conducted by the Treasury Department
in cooperation with the Department's Agriculture. </p>

<p>The United Kingdom also submitted to the Secretariat a
communication concerning the question as to whether Cannabis
stalks used commercially for the production of fibre still
contained resin. That point was also discussed. </p>

<p>As to the American documents, we usually summarize all work
that has been done on Cannabis, incorporate it into one document
and submit it to the League of Nations. </p>

<p>As to Dr. Plasencia's experiment; he has followed up Beam's
experiments and elaborated a new method which he states is
absolutely and specifically suitable for Cannabis and constant
for all the varieties tested, even Merck's extract of Cannabis
indica with which Beam's reaction gave no result. </p>

<p>Our Government has submitted observations on this paper. </p>

<p>The United Kingdom Representative also transmitted an opinion
by the Government Chemist who suggests certain modifications in
this method. These modifications consist of an attempt to
separate the substances responsible for the characteristic color
in Beam's test on the assumption that it is a phenol. </p>

<p>All of these documents are available in the United States
Treasury Department for anyone who would like to study them. It
would seem that Dr. de Myttenaere and Mr. Wollner have different
opinions on the point as to whether light petroleum is the best
solvent for Cannabis. Dr. de Myttenaere considers that so far as
is known at present, light petroleum is the best solvent for the
extraction of the active principles of Cannabis, and hence the
only one suitable for Beam's test; and he has carried out
experiments as to whether ethyl acetate should be substituted, or
is preferable as a solvent for petroleum ether. </p>

<p>In the report there is also given the list of vegetable
products wrongfully designated as hemp, We have a little trouble
with that in this country, as it is frequently designated as
Cannabis, New Zealand hemp, hemp of the Americas, Bombay hemp,
African hemp, etc. </p>

<p>It has been found that these were all wrong designators used
by various persons interested in the problem. </p>

<p>NOTE.--Until very recently. the definition of Cannabis sativa
(marihuana) was based upon the traditional conception that the
active principle of the drug, technically known as cannabinol or
cannabinone, is present only in the female or pistillate plant
and present there only in the flowering tops. Since the
development of more refined chemical tests, it has been
discovered that the active principle is contained in the leaves
of the pistillate plant as well as the leaves of the staminate
plant. This brought about the advisability of makihg the
definition all inclusive in laws for control of the drug found in
the male as well as the female plant. It will therefore be
necessary to change the definition in the League of Nations
Treaty of 1925. </p>

<p>Dr. Bouquet, while investigating this question, found that it
always has been acknowledged that intoxicating resin could be
obtained from male Cannabis plants but in such small quantities
that for practical purposes this source of production is not
utilized at present. He realized, however, that it might become
worthwhile for traffickers to turn their attention to it, and
recommended that the free handling of the vegetative parts of
both male and female Cannabis plants should be prohibited. That
work was started in America by the laboratory of Parke-Davis some
years ago. </p>

<p>Then the question of the production of the fibre, the
condition of development, depending on the meterological factors
of the crop area was discussed. In this respect differences have
been noted between the height of the plant, and the length,
consistency and toughness of the textile fibres. </p>

<p>The growing conditions of the plant also affect the output of
its resin, which depends directly on the degree of temperature;
on the dryness of the soil; and probably on the amount of
sunshine encountered. In the annual report for Turkey for 1937,
there is brought to the attention of the Committee data
concerning a variety of Cannabis sativa having long stalks. It is
grown for industrial purposes in various parts of Anatolia; the
fibre is used for manufacturing ropes and sacks; and its resin
content is so slight it could not be used for the extraction of a
narcotic drug. </p>

<p>That seems to be the answer to our prayers, if true. As to the
psychical and psychopathic effects of Cannabis, the literature on
this phase of the subject tends to confirm the analysis as to the
psychic effects of hashish made as long ago as 1845 by Dr. Moreau
de Tours in his book, which incidentally is still the standard
work on the subject. Also, Dr. Brottaux in his book on Hashish
published in 1934, which I think is considered a veritable
&quot;bible&quot; on the subject today, has followed up and in
the main confirmed Dr. Moreau's analysis. </p>

<p>Then there was discussed the relation between Cannabis and
insanity. There was reference to the work of Dhunsiboy, the
Director of one of the Hospitals for Insane in India in which he
points out that the prolonged use of Indian hemp leads to
insanity. </p>

<p>The work of Dr. Bouquet was discussed; and also the work of
the British Indian hemp Commission which carried out an inquiry
in 1893 and 1894 into the relationship of Indian hemp and lunacy.
Colonel Chopra did some work in India which was discussed. He
found that in India a special form of mental disease classed as
toxic insanity had direct relation to the excessive use of hemp
drugs. All of these experts laid stress on &quot;excessive
use.&quot; </p>

<p>Then there was a proposal discussed to authorize the sale of
ganja to the Indian population in Burma.As you probably know, in
India. the Government maintains a Monopoly, and various narcotic
products are sold across the counter tax-paid. The League of
Nations wanted to point out to the Committee the various points
that were raised in connection with the proposal to sell hemp. </p>

<p>To meet the allegation concerning the increase in insanity due
to the use of ganja, a table prepared by the Inspector General of
Civil Hospitals in Burma has been added showing that as far as
the mental hospital at Tagadale was concerned, the percentage of
mental cases attributable to the use of ganja and its derivatives
varied during the years between 1928 and 1937 from 0.87 to 4.35;
and that in 1936, out of a total of 296 admissions there were ten
such cases, the corresponding figures for 1937 being 356 and ten
respectively. </p>

<p>The Sub-Committee was urged to examine the still-controversial
question of the relationship between addiction to hemp drugs and
the spread of insanity. </p>

<p>The work of Dr. Stringaris on Hashish was discussed. He is an
authority on insanity due to the use of Hashish in Russia. He
maintains that a further increase can be expected in the ravages
caused by Hashish in Asiatic Russia. </p>

<p>Then the question of the relationship between the abuse of
narcotic drugs and alcoholism arose. It is still a mixed
question, and considerable recommendations were furnished.In
Algeria, Dr. Bouquet has noted that Heroin addicts were recruited
from the Hashish addicts, and Dr. Stringaris in Asiatic Russia
has found that to be the case there also. </p>

<p>In conclusion the Secretariat pointed out that, as a result of
concurrent investigations, progress has been made on chemical
studies and research, while fresh information has been gathered
in other spheres; at the same time, certain points still require
clarification, especially in connection with the physiological,
psychological, and psychopathic effects of Cannabis and with the
relationships between Hashish-addiction and insanity, and between
Cannabis-addiction and crime. </p>

<p>After considering all of the recommendations furnished by the
League of Nations, the Sub-Committee then made the following
report, which is very pertinent in the light of the points we
want to discuss here. </p>

<p>&quot;In discussion of the matter before it, the Sub-Committee
divided consideration of the subject as follows: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Commercial uses of Cannabis </li>
    <li>Medical uses of Cannabis </li>
    <li>Effects of the abuse of Cannabis </li>
    <li>Methods of detecting the presence of Cannabis </li>
    <li>Legal definition of the term &quot;Cannabis.&quot; </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>The discussions developed the fact that the Committee
        still lacks complete information concerning the
        commercial uses of Cannabis. The Sub-Committee would
        welcome further information concerning the physiological,
        psychological and psychopathic effects of abusive use of
        Cannabis and the relation between Cannabis-addiction and
        crime. </li>
    <li>Dr. Bouquet pointed out that percentages of resin content
        in the hemp plant raised in different countries should be
        ascertained with a view to deciding whether it is
        necessary to prohibit or merely to control the
        cultivation of Cannabis for industrial purposes. The
        value of the Beam test for detecting the presence of
        Cannabis appears to have been confirmed by a further
        series of experiments, the results of which are before
        the Committee, including those attained by the employment
        of several different modifications of that text. Dr. de
        Myttenaere said that his experience enabled him to state
        that the Beam alkaline reaction and its modifications
        indicated the chief element in the various components of
        Cannabis resin which was the cause of Hashish addiction,
        i.e.the alcoholic group. Dr. Bouquet informed the
        Sub-Committee that a test based upon new principles had
        recently been devised which will form the subject of a
        thesis to be presented by Messrs. Duquenois and Hassan
        Negm Mustapha at the University of Strasbourg in July,
        1938, a brief description of which will be circulated to
        the Opium Advisory Committee. </li>
    <li>The question of modifying the incomplete definition of
        Indian hemp in the Geneva Convention of 1925 was
        discussed, but no definite conclusion was arrived at. It
        appeared upon examination that such modification would
        affect not only Article 1 of the Convention, but also
        Articles 4 and 11 and would necessarily involve
        complicated adjustments in the Convention itself. It was
        therefore decided to postpone further consideration of
        this matter until the next session of this Sub-Committee
        when it is hoped that more time will be available for the
        work. </li>
    <li>Up to the present time, the work of the Sub-Committee has
        consisted almost entirely of collecting information in
        regard to the various phases of the Cannabis problem,
        and, until the Sub-Committee has before it more data than
        it has at present, it would scarcely be considered
        advisable to undertake definite recommendations.&quot; </li>
    <li>We would like to take inventory of our research and see
        what is needed. </li>
    <li>The Federal Government did not get into this picture
        until after all 48 states had adopted legislation
        controlling Marihuana in greater or less degree. The
        Marihuana Tax Act went into effect a little over a year
        ago, and since that time we have destroyed some 16,000
        acres of the plant throughout the various States; most of
        it in the Middle West. About l,000 violators have been
        arrested by the Federal Government. </li>
    <li>I am not trying to sell this book, but I want to call
        your attention to the work on &quot;Marihuana'a written
        by Dr. Robert P. Walton, Professor of Chemistry,
        University of Mississippi, with a foreword by Dr. Geller
        who is a distinguished pharmacologist connected with the
        University of Chicago.I would like to start with the
        agricultural phases of this problem, which will also
        include the industrial and economic phases.I am therefore
        going to call on Dr. Wright of the University of
        Wisconsin and ask him to discuss some of the questions
        that seem to be troubling us. <br>
    </li>

<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. WRIGHT</h1>

<p><b>Professor of Agronomy University of Wisconsin<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. WRIGHT: Gentlemen, let me say to you in the first place
that <br>
while I am connected with the University of Wisconsin, so far as
the hemp <br>
work is concerned, the hemp being Marihuana, I am working as an
agent and <br>
in cooperation with the Bureau of Plant Industry here in
Washington. <br>
I had better assume that you are about the agricultural side like
I am <br>
about chemistry, that you do not know very much about it.
Therefore, <br>
suppose I sketch briefly the practical every day procedure by
which hemp <br>
is handled in the United States and Canada, not mentioning
anything about <br>
the European situation, and as Dr. Robinson is going to review
something <br>
about the history of hemp, I will leave that out entirely.<br>
In the United States hemp is an annual crop produced from seed <br>
planted each year, planted in the Spring the same as small grains
are <br>
planted, the same as corn is planted.<br>
It has been grown during recent years almost exclusively in very
few <br>
sections; Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.<br>
It is planted en masse thickly as small grain, in other words, it
is <br>
drilled in.<br>
It is planted on very good soil in order to be a profitable
production. <br>
It is a crop limited to good soil<br>
<br>
18<br>
<br>
for profitable production most every where in the world, and it
is seeded <br>
about a bushel to the acre on soil, prepared as for small grain. <br>
After it is planted, there is nothing left to be done except to
wait <br>
for it to be harvested, and it is harvested in the latter part of
August, <br>
throughout September, and sometimes extending into October
depending on <br>
the section of the United States or Canada.<br>
The seed is usually produced in Kentucky, and in the North
American <br>
Continent, very rarely any other place. In the sections where it
is grown <br>
for fibre or industrial uses, seed is not produced.<br>
The usual, or arbitrary way of determining when to harvest a crop
is <br>
when it is well in blossom, we will say rather late blossom when
the <br>
pollen is being fairly cleared, depending from that time on how <br>
circumstances work out, but that is when it is begun.<br>
It is generally harvested now by special machinery which has been
<br>
developed during the last few years. It is cut and spread in
swaths of even <br>
length. It is left in the stuble, spread out for retting.<br>
Now, the exact procedure varies in different sections of the
country. <br>
This retting period, that is the period when the so-called fibre
portion of <br>
the stem is released<br>
<br>
19<br>
<br>
from the woody portion, varies from two weeks to, in certain
cases, two <br>
months.<br>
After it has reached that stage where the fibre can be removed
from <br>
the straw by being dressed, it is gathered and bound in bundles
and <br>
shocked. Then it is put in stacks, usually in hemp mills or
processing <br>
plants.<br>
From these stacks it is sent to the dryer, and dried to what is <br>
commonly called in the trade bone-dry condition and which would
mean 8 <br>
or 9 or 10% moisture.<br>
Then it is crushed by the breaking process, that is the fiber is <br>
separated by the usual process called scutching, and it is
divided into two <br>
kinds of fibre, one the long stretch, and the other tangled, and
then it is <br>
inserted in bales.<br>
That, I believe, is the agricultural procedure of the handling of
the <br>
hemp.<br>
There is a little variation in Kentucky because of the weather <br>
conditions. It is not retted immediately, but shocked until later
in the <br>
season when the retting conditioning can be done.<br>
In the northern part of the country, it is spread on the ground
and the <br>
retting is done immediately.<br>
Now, I want to avoid going into the acreage and that phase of the
<br>
work for Dr. Robinson is going to cover that.<br>
<br>
20<br>
<br>
I would like to inject this thought here for I am sure it will do
no <br>
harm, and that is that hemp has been an American industry ever
since <br>
Colonial times It is not a large industry. It has had its ups and
downs, but <br>
it has been an American industry since Colonial times, and it is
one of the <br>
oldest crops that we have in the United States.<br>
It is used, as you know, from an industrial stand-point for
textile <br>
purposes, and to a minor extent for other purposes and Dr.
Robinson will <br>
develop that.<br>
Now, there might be perhaps some questions right now. One or two <br>
other items I want to take up before I am through.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Go right ahead.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: You know I might not have another chance to say <br>
anything<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You will be given a chance. Go right <br>
ahead, Dr. Wright.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I was just wanted to throw this into the pot, and
that <br>
is, of course, that we who work with the commercial producers,
and the <br>
industry naturally collectively, and I suppose we are justifiable
in that, <br>
our prejudices are on that side. I do not think we would be human
if we <br>
were not, and I do not claim to be other than human. We have a
small <br>
industry in the United States that<br>
<br>
21<br>
<br>
has had its ups and downs over a long period of time. We still
produce <br>
commercial hemp and fibre. Those in the industry are naturally
concerned. <br>
They have a stake in that they have what little they have
invested in the <br>
business. <br>
They are not concerned about this last law because I believe they
<br>
were given a very square deal in the national legislation on the
matter. <br>
What they are concerned about is the public position, that
indefinite <br>
intangible thing, public feeling about growing hemp at all. <br>
They have already been subjected to some rather embarrassing <br>
situations. <br>
Now, just suppose that as a result of the agitation, warranted or
<br>
not, and there are probably two views on that, and I am open to
both <br>
views, the extensive publicity that has been given in the hemp
states, <br>
particularly Wisconsin where there is much agitation, that some
kind of a <br>
legislation will come up to put out or eradicate the production
of hemp <br>
under the Weed Control Department or the Legislature
appropriating money <br>
to do it. <br>
I will not bother you long on that, but I just want to mention
that <br>
and show what problem we will be called on to face. Those men
have <br>
managed to keep their mouths<br>
<br>
22<br>
shut and have expressed no views concerning Marihuana in public,
for we <br>
feel we are not in a position to do so, and we would like to be
sure of our <br>
ground before doing it.<br>
Of course, having worked with eradication procedures and <br>
eradication programs, unless you would convince us otherwise we
would <br>
oppose the eradication program in Wisconsin as we see it now with
the <br>
immense cost and the things of that sort.<br>
Now comes the other phase of it. We have been trying, in
cooperation <br>
with the Bureau of Plant Industry, and Dr. Robinson and the
Division of <br>
Pharmacy of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Link who is head
of the <br>
Bio-Chemistry Department of the University of Wisconsin to begin
a study <br>
of Cannabis in relation to hemp as a crop. <br>
Without going into details, I think I have told you my story for
the <br>
present.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We thank you very much, Doctor. Before <br>
we go on to Dr. Robinson, I think there were various points
brought up that <br>
our conferees would like to discuss.<br>
There is one point about commercial hemp. We did not make a
survey <br>
in your State, but we did make a survey in the State of
Minnesota, and <br>
some of the hemp that was harvested in 1934 is still on the
ground. <br>
<br>
23<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: That is right.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is giving us a great deal of
difficulty. <br>
The farmers up in Minnesota in some of the sections have been
subjected <br>
to various promotion schemes. Due to the existence of stacks of
the old <br>
1934 and 1935 crop of harvested hemp in Southern Minnesota, which
is a <br>
menace to society in that it has been used by traffickers, we
have <br>
arrested a gang who took a truck load of this Marihuana into New
York.<br>
I will say that the farmers up there have been cooperating with
us <br>
100%. If they see anybody around that section who looks like a
trafficker, <br>
they bring out their old shot guns, and he is soon disposed of.
We have very <br>
little trouble from the farmers up there.<br>
It is said that every stack contains a plentiful supply for
smoking <br>
purposes.<br>
Allegations have been made that if it was on the ground three
years <br>
there would not be any resin left. Mr. Wollner can tell you how
much resin <br>
some of the experts reported after Marihuana had been lying on
the ground <br>
three years. It seems that the traffickers can find it. Our own
chemists <br>
have found it.<br>
We feel that the farmer is entitled to a reasonable return for
these <br>
old crops. He planted the crop in goodfaith; he has no desire to
violate the <br>
law, and we have<br>
<br>
24<br>
<br>
been assured that the removal of the harvested crops is very
desirable. It <br>
is a very difficult situation.<br>
Have you any observations to make, or any discussion on the <br>
question?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: As to thw commercial procedure, tha plant is spread
<br>
out on the land, and left there until the stalks are retted, and
some of the <br>
leaves are gone. It is shocked and taken into the hemp mill. The
grower is <br>
uncertain as to where he stands, and whether the leaves that are <br>
associated with the straw are in the legal sense Marihuana,
referring, of <br>
course, to that particular clause in the law which refers to dry
stalks.<br>
Now this is done as follows: the straw is left on the land in the
<br>
stubble for varying times, as I say, from two weeks or longer
during this <br>
retting process. It is subject to the action of rains and
bleaching and <br>
decomposition with the various effects of bacteria and fungi, but
when it <br>
is taken in, it still retains a trace of the leaves. That is what
affects the <br>
folks up there in Minnesota.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I notice the term &quot;hurds&quot;
referred to.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: That is the non-fibrous material crushed and taken
away <br>
from the fibrous. It is the residue. It<br>
<br>
25<br>
<br>
would be the same as shives in flax.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I am afraid to say that the experiment with
Minnesota <br>
hemp is rather inconclusive. As I understand it the hemp was
bundled <br>
before it had been permitted to ret for an extended period of
time.<br>
It may be we will find that if the hemp is permitted to ret
before it <br>
is stacked, a further decomposition of the drug will ensue.
However, we do <br>
know that the Minnesota hemp of 1934 is active.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It would be active.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER. It is active but whether the activity was retained
by <br>
improper handling of the hemp, I don't know. As I understand it
they were <br>
advised to bunch their hemp before it was retted.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It was never rotted or retted. The plan of handling
in <br>
Minnesota was unauthorized. In other words, it was contrary to
the usual <br>
procedure. They put the green hemp or the semi-green hemp in a
bundle, <br>
and at a later stage it would be known in the trade as green
hemp. That <br>
was never used for textile purposes. It was not suitable for
textile <br>
purposes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then, Dr. Wright, your opinion is that if
<br>
harvested properly most of the leaves avould remain on the ground
and not <br>
adhere to the stalks?<br>
<br>
26<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I will be perfectly frank in telling you that will
vary in <br>
seasonal conditions, and so we are much concerned about that.
There are <br>
leaves left. As to the condition of those leaves, we don't know.
They are <br>
left, and there is no use in denying that. There are considerable
left on the <br>
straw. There are not a great deal, but there are leaves left. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then prompt harvesting would reduce this <br>
danger we are now confronted with? <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It would.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: What about the hemp stacked green in Kentucky; <br>
doesn't that mold more than that left on the ground?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Hemp is left in the shock in Kentucky. You will
correct <br>
me Dr. Robinson, if I'm wrong, because it has been fifteen years
since I <br>
was down there, but it is my impression that it is shocked. It is
first <br>
spread and allowed to wilt on the ground.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Then there is no molding?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: If properly handled there will be no molding. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: From our point of view that would be improper <br>
handling; there would be no decomposition of the resin.<br>
<br>
27<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: The general weathering we would get would be during <br>
the curing stage.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: How long, about, does that take?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Now, after it is shocked, cured and stacked, later it
is <br>
spread on the land again and retted.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: But, during this period, of course, it would be in <br>
excellent condition for smoking, - that is, relatively dry in the
stack.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: From the time it is cut until it is rotted, whatever <br>
leaves there are should be suitable for Marihuana.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: While we have not found in New York State a large <br>
agricultural growth, we do find that the largest part of our
growth, <br>
instead of being on good soil, is on poor soil.<br>
For the past two years when I have been looking for wild growth,
I <br>
have found it in dumps or soil that has a high content of ashes
or cinders, <br>
and I have found it trying to grow it in my own garden but the
growth does <br>
not begin to compare with that of the cinder growth, and as a
matter of <br>
fact we have found that most recently the wild growth seeks that
kind of <br>
soil.<br>
That does not prove anything, of course, except we have probably <br>
most of our wild growth coming from ashes<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
and cinders and public dumps. This did strike me very forcibly,
and what <br>
struck me more forcibly was that we had some of the biggest
growths in <br>
Brooklyn where it was almost a clear cinder dump.<br>
Our experience in New York State so far has not produced anyone
who <br>
desired to be licensed as a cultivator.<br>
I think some of that might be offset if the public was assured
that <br>
the cultivator would have to be licensed, after proper
investigation, and <br>
that definite qualifications exist to establish control.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: As to your first statement about hemp growing on <br>
cinder beds, wild hemp, - it is not a fibrous hemp. As all of you
who are <br>
familMWith the middle west know, you will find blocks that were <br>
formerly even cinder beds, but fibrous hemp will not grow there. <br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: The point I was chiefly interested in was the public <br>
interest, where it was grown, whether being produced by chance or
design.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: We are hopeful we can clarify this situation. Since <br>
legislation may be introduced to eradicate or to bring pressure
upon the <br>
legitimate producer, I appreciate your suggestion. I think it is
a good one.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We have also in New York State given some
consideration <br>
to definite measures for removal, but so far we have operated
under <br>
difficulties acting under nuisance laws. Under the Public Health
laws in <br>
New York, we can fix a penalty for maintaining a public nuisance.
We have <br>
in a few instances removed Marihuana from private property where
the <br>
owner wouldn't undertake it himself, and then assessed a lien
against the <br>
property within the Public Health law on the ground that we have
removed <br>
a public nuisance.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It might be construed to apply to Marihuana under our
<br>
Public Health regulations in Wisconsin. I do not know whether it
has been <br>
discussed or not.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Robinson, we would like to hear from <br>
you.<br>

<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. B. B. ROBINSON<br>
</h1>

<p><b>BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. ROBINSON: If fibres produced from plants were ranked in <br>
accordance with their world production in tonnage, hemp would
occupy a <br>
position of probably third or fourth. It would be surpassed by
cotton and <br>
jute produced in India, and in some years by flax. That gives you
some idea <br>
of where it stands in relative importance.<br>
Dr. Wright mentioned a matter that many of you are familiar with,
the <br>
fact of the importance that hemp played in our earlier Colonial
days <br>
before the introduction of the cotton gin.<br>
The culture of hemp in the United States, I might say has
decreased <br>
because of the cheap competitive fibres which are produced by
cheap labor <br>
in foreign countries, and it is because of this cheapness that
they are <br>
substituted for hemp in many cases, and not because of the fact
that they <br>
have characteristics that are better than hemp for cordage or
textile <br>
purposes.<br>
The average world production between the years 1930 and 1954 for <br>
hemp was about 750,000 tons. And now, during that same period in
the <br>
United States in this small industry we have produced about 500
tons. The <br>
world production was produced mainly by Russia where I think 56%
of the <br>
fibre is produced, followed by Italy, Yugoslavia, Rumania as
other <br>
producing countries, During the past year or two we imported for
domestic <br>
consumption about 700 to 800 tons a year, so our total
consumption, <br>
including domestically produced fibre, and imported fibre runs
about from <br>
1500 to 2000 tons.<br>
Now, many of you here may wonder why such a small industry as
that <br>
should be favored to continue on, particularly in the light of
the <br>
detrimental character of certain parts of the plant used
illegally. <br>
In the first place the United States is dependent upon the
foreign production of fibres other than cotton. The United States
<br>
imports annually about 300,000 tons of fibre used for cordage and
textile <br>
purposes. The estimated value last year was about $35,000,000.
That does <br>
not include some importations of India twine.<br>
I do not mean to infer that if hemp were grown in this country,
it <br>
could substitute for all of this 300,000 tons imported, but it is
the <br>
principal fibre which we can get in the United atates, which
could be <br>
substituted in many cases if conditions arose to make it
necessary. <br>
The United States, is very thoroughly taken care of at present in
<br>
reference to supplying our own needs on this cordage fibre.<br>
Another argument for the hemp industry is the adaptability of the
<br>
hemp plant to various regions of the country and because of
suitability for <br>
mechanical handling, and these are some of the reasons why the
office <br>
with which I am connected in the Department of Agriculture is
interested <br>
in seeing this small nucleus of hemp industry continued each year
until it <br>
is capable of supporting itself under economic conditions. I am
speaking <br>
more of the industry in Wisconsin rather than the promotional
attempts to <br>
grow hemp in Minnesota which one might speak of an unorthodox <br>
processing. But this industry we have is capable at the present
time of supporting itself if public opinion does not force it to
be <br>
shut doan, or additional restrictions hamper it.<br>
So, this industry could be benefited we naturally think, if this <br>
Marihuana stigma could be removed. However, the Wisconsin
operators are <br>
not opposed to adjust themselves to the conditions and are very
much <br>
interested in trying to overcome this drug problem.<br>
A couple of years ago when this problem was brought to the front <br>
more vividly than in the past, the Department of Agriculture was
naturally <br>
interested in it, and the main way we could see to combat it was
as to <br>
how to get around it [sic]. Naturally there might be less
restriction on the <br>
production of hemp in this country if we could prove that in
certain <br>
sections of the country, because of climatic conditions, the drug
was not <br>
active, or if we could possibly get plants of varieties that lack
the drug, <br>
which is probably an Utopian view, or that had it in low
concentration. <br>
As a result we cooperated with the Bureau of Narcotics, in
setting <br>
up some experiments. The Bureau of Narcotics has conducted all of
the <br>
chemical work, and Dr. Marchett later on will speak of these
tests. I do not <br>
want to go too much into his field. But, we have attempted under
this cooperative work to remove or reduce the resinous substance
from <br>
commercial hemp.<br>
You gentlemen who are chemists and pharmacologists can assist the
<br>
Agricultural program by furnishing the Agriculture Department
some <br>
working tools or some tests by which we can tell the presence or
absence <br>
of this drug, or its activity. It may be said that I am throwing
it all on the <br>
chemists. I am not trying to do that, but we do need something to
work <br>
with.<br>
So far we naturally have resorted to the Beam tests, the <br>
significance of which we do not know with certainty, but in the
work we <br>
undertook last year, it was the only simple tool which we could
work <br>
with.<br>
Now last summer out at Arlington farm close by, we planted a
field <br>
in which there were 98 small plots of hemp that were set up in <br>
conformity with the statistical method of analysis of variances
by a man <br>
named Fisher.<br>
We obtained statistically significant differences between the <br>
varieties using the alkaline but did not obtain it using the acid
test. The <br>
question may arise, then, as to which is the most accurate of the
tests in <br>
measuring the presence or absence of the drug.<br>
In reference to that, the question of the region of the hemp may
play <br>
some importance. The native home of hemp is supposedly in central
Asia, Ñand the hemp of Chinese origin which <br>
has been distributed throughout the world has practically always
been <br>
used for fibre purposes.<br>
The hemp that has come from India has been of the narcotic type
and <br>
has not been cultivated generally for fibre. It has been
cultivated for the <br>
drug. I wish I knew the history of this a little better, but from
what I have <br>
been able to learn from others, hemp does not appear to
constitute a <br>
narcotic problem in China. That is of a fibrous variety, and
there is a great <br>
difference between that hemp and the hemp that came from India. <br>
With reference to our test at Arlington, the narcotic chemists <br>
selected samples at three different periods for the acid and
alkaline test. <br>
We got a difference, mathematically significant between those
tests. That <br>
is, the first sampling which I think was in the early part of
June, was <br>
different from the later two samplings in that it was lower in
that <br>
characteristic of activity, the numbers they gave on the Beam
test.<br>
Actually, the last test was a little lower than the middle test,
but it <br>
was not significantly lower.<br>
We arranged 8 different fertilizer treatments for the various
plots <br>
and found that the fertilizer used had no effect on the strength
or <br>
incidence either the acid or alkaline test.<br>
Because of the fertilizer result it would appear that soil vs.
variations <br>
that occurred probably did not produce any differences or that
the soil does <br>
not play a part.<br>
With reference to climate, so far we have not made a test for we
have <br>
only had the work at Arlington. But we plan next summer, if
things go well at <br>
Arlington, to conduct a test in Wisconsin. We have some
cooperative agents in <br>
Mississippi and we thought we could get a test farm there. It has
been <br>
suggested that we try to get one other region, Arizona or New
Mexico, or out <br>
in that section. So far, we have not made arrangements, but, if
we could get <br>
these various locations in the United States, then we could have
a set-up <br>
whereby we could evolute [sic] climatic conditions in reference
to certain <br>
tests, the Beam test or some other one if you can furnish it.
These are the <br>
results which we have obtained so far in the agricultural program
to get away <br>
from this drug.<br>
There have been several reasons I have not brought out as to why
we <br>
thought we could get somewhere. We know by handling the plants
that some <br>
of them are very resinous, and some are not.<br>
So, we are receptive to the work you men will do to give us some
means <br>
of testing our plants so as to allow us to produce agriculturally
some results which we hope will help the industry.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Thank you very muckh Dr. Robinson. You <br>
recall what I said about the Turkish annual report for the year
1937 in <br>
which it is said that Cannabis sativa with long stalks is grown
for <br>
industrial purposes in various parts of Anatolia; that the fibre
is used for <br>
the manufacture of ropes and sacks, and its resin content is so
slight that <br>
it could not be used for the extraction of a narcotic drug. It
might be <br>
interesting to get some Turkish seed. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: We have not had a great deal of success as regards <br>
those statements. We obtained some seed submitted by Dr. Bouquet
and I <br>
believe Dr. Robinson planted some of them, without any success. <br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: We planted them under favorable conditions last <br>
spring. Roughly we may have gotten in the field 200 or 300
plants, and <br>
after our first Beam test it was estimated we had about 100 left.
About <br>
the first of August, I came back from a trip to the west, and we
el-<br>
iminated about two-thirds of the remainder leaving only about 40.
I have <br>
harvested about 20 of these one-half were males, and we sent 10
from <br>
that collection over to Dr. Matchett to run an alkaline Beam test
on. I was<br>
able to obtain out of that .about one-third negative and the rest
positive.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Was the amount of resin in these plants comparable
to <br>
that in other plants?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: In harvesting these plants, we merely stripped the <br>
seed in the field to keep the birds from getting it and I would
say that the <br>
African plant was more resinous than the Manchurian plant. It may
be that <br>
the African plant was later in maturing, but still, by comparison
with the <br>
Manchurian plant, it had more resin. My hand was simply caked
with resin <br>
in stripping the plant for the seed.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: The Indian Government report for 1934 <br>
shows that where they did not have this type of hemp all of the
resin was <br>
imported from Central Asia.<br>
It is stated that the hemp cultivated in Europe does not carry
the <br>
intoxicating properties of Indian hemp. While it is believed that
the <br>
European hemp does not contain as much resin as is to be found in
hemp <br>
usually produced in Asia, the production of the active resin is
particularly <br>
variable, and there are some times great differences in quantity
depending <br>
on the altitude of the place of cultivation.<br>
Are there any questions that you care to ask, Dr. Robinson?<br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: I would like to ask if you made any experiments <br>
artificially in the new varieties by radiation?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: We had a program for a number of years on hemp, and
<br>
my predecessor, Mr. Dewey, who unfortunately could not be here
this <br>
morning, reached retirement age three years ago, and our hemp
program <br>
was interrupted.<br>
So far we have not gone into that, but to some extent we have <br>
considered it. These other methods we have approached seemed to
have <br>
possibilities of results if the tests mean anything.<br>
I think this next spring, we should be able to plant these
negative <br>
seeds we have, and those which have tested negative three
different times <br>
and have been pollinated by plants in three different tests, and
we should <br>
be able to give the chemists something definite to test.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: It is my recollection, when Mr. Dewey made a test of
the <br>
original plants growing in Arlington back in 1922, we found
different <br>
physiological portents in the male and the female but, at that
time, Mr. <br>
Dewey had seed he had obtained from various parts of the world,
and it is <br>
my impression that after about three years of cultivation at
Arlington, the <br>
growth characteristics of all of these plants tended to the same
type. In <br>
other words, they all tended to hemp of a certain height, Ñas I
say that occurred <br>
after three years of cultivation.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: I think that more or less that result is obtained. <br>
Professor Wright who may have had a little closer touch with the
problem <br>
could answer you better. Wouldn't that be your opinion, Professor
Wright?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Yes, under the method used of applying open
pollinating, <br>
that was the tendency as far as our observation went,Ñthat they
were <br>
more or less alike.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: In reference to that, these stalks of hemp we
obtained <br>
last year from these various sources, have all been isolated, so
they have <br>
not been cross pollinated.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH I do not know where Mr. Young of Florence, South
Carolina, <br>
got his idea for the raising of Cannabis for a medicinal purpose
-<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: He got it from Mr. Dewey.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: There was a material decrease in the material before
he <br>
finally abandoned that project.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: I do not know how he obtained it all, or that he <br>
obtained it all from Mr. Dewey, but as I recall, he did.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: There is one other question, and that is as to the
method <br>
by which the seeds themselves were obtained,-is that of any
interest to you?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes, Dr. Wright, can you give us
something <br>
on the that?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Commercial seed used for commercial planting?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I do not have any notes on that. The seed are grown
from <br>
plants cultivated principally for seed; I mean the ordinary hemp
which has <br>
been planted for seed similar to corn. It is planted in rows, all
harvested <br>
by hand, and put in large shocks like those in Kentucky. It is
harvested in <br>
the latter part of September or the first of October in the
section in <br>
which it is grown. Then the shocks are dumped over on large
canvasses, <br>
smoothed out on the ground, and the stubble removed and beat out
with <br>
sticks in the old fashioned method. This is the only place in the
United <br>
States producing this commercially.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Isn't most of the seed planted here produced in <br>
foreign countries?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I do not get the question.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Aren't most of the seeds produced in foreign <br>
countries?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Most of the seed produced for Commercial purposes
originated in China, central China or towards the south part of
China and was carried here for cultivation. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I believe what Dr. Matchett means is the commercial <br>
crop that is grown for instance in Wisconsin, does that originate
from <br>
seed grown in Kentucky, or the Far East?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: All of the hemp planted in the United States for <br>
commercial purposes comes from Kentucky. That is, all of the
legitimate <br>
hemp comes from seed grown in Kentucky. Does that answer the
question? <br>
DR. MATCHETT: Yes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Matchett, you have been collaborating
<br>
with Dr. Robinson in these experiments at Arlington. Can you tell
us what <br>
results you obtained? Dr. Robinson has told us quite a lot about
the <br>
results, but I think you can probably elaborate upon them.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: First of all I might state we made these tests in
the <br>
manner that was published by us last year, and in the treatment
we <br>
divided the tests into six categories, according to the depth of
color that <br>
we obtained, beginning with zero for negative plants. These
plants which, <br>
gave us only traces of color, which we felt should not be
overlooked, but <br>
which we also felt would not constitute wholly satisfactory <br>
identification of the plant, were designated number one.<br>
<br>
Those plants characterized as 2, gave strong responses,
definitely <br>
positive, and those as 3, 4, and 5 responded with increasing
intensity in <br>
that order.<br>
<br>
Briefly we found on variety No. 1, a Rumanian variety 97.5% of
the <br>
plants tested would have been satisfactorily identified by the
Beam test. <br>
That is assuming for the moment the single test would be
sufficient, <br>
which I believe is generally understood not to be so.<br>
<br>
Variety No. 2, another Rumanian variety, gave us 100%.<br>
<br>
Variety No. 3, the third Rumanian variety, 87% of satisfactory <br>
response.<br>
<br>
Variety No. 5, Manchuria, 22.9% satisfactory response. <br>
<br>
Variety No. 6, Chinese, 13.8% satisfactory. <br>
<br>
Variety No. 9, Italian, 98.1%<br>
<br>
There is a very decided difference between the Chinese, and <br>
Manchurian varieties on the one hand and the Rumanian and Italian
<br>
varieties on the other.<br>
<br>
Now there were some very interesting things in reference to the <br>
differences between the three test periods.<br>
<br>
It is true that there was one rather decided change, particularly
in <br>
the second test, but there was not as significant difference
between the <br>
number of negative plants, nor was the difference worked with
reference <br>
to category No. l.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing was where we had many in category 2 in the <br>
first testing, in the next testing a considerable increase
appeared in <br>
category 4, with a corresponding decrease in category 2.<br>
<br>
The actual number of negative plants was not significantly <br>
different. I believe the first test gave us 36, the second test
32, and the <br>
third test 40.<br>
<br>
During the course of our activities we found that molding had no <br>
apparent effect on one alkaline test response of either negative
or <br>
positive plants. We permitted them to mold in a. very moist place
for a <br>
period of five weeks. There was no change in the Beam test.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I want to ask Dr. Wright a question. In <br>
harvesting the plant, Doctor, we understand that the farmer
usually <br>
harvests it before the resin reaches its highest stage. Is that
true?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I will say yes, not knowing when the highest stage of
<br>
the resin is reached myself, but from what I could gather from
talking to <br>
Mr. Wollner and Dr. Link and those most familiar with the
subject. It is cut <br>
in the mid-blossom stage, and from what I understand the plants
are <br>
usually expected to have a high content of resin at that time. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our eradication program, 16,000 acres <br>
have been gone over, and as I understand it we will also have to
go over <br>
that same acreage during the coming year, and probably the third
year. Do <br>
you know how long that seed will remain dormant in the soil? <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I can only give you some guess on that. It is quite <br>
variable, and how long the seed will remain in the soil is simply
my guess. <br>
If it is harvested the first year, before pollination occurs I
would expect <br>
that to handle the situation under most circumstances. I am
basing that on <br>
practical observation and experience, but if there is a
repetition and the <br>
plant does become a volunteer plant, if the same process as
followed for <br>
two years we could expect almost complete eradication. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What seed could replace the hemp seed as <br>
bird food? There is a lot of growth throughout the country due to
the <br>
casting about of bird seed. Now, however we require sterilization
of hemp <br>
seed. We have not reached the 100% point in sterilization but the
seed <br>
people tell us they should sell the seed in 5% mixtures; but even
5%, <br>
mixtures if the seed is not properly sterilized, might produce
some wild <br>
growth. Have you any suggestions on that?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I believe that these gentlemen here from the animal <br>
biology department might be better able to judge of that than I
am.<br>
<br>
DR., COUCH: As a matter of fact, I do not know anything on that
point, <br>
and we have not gone into it at all. I am extremely interested
however.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think there should be some discussion <br>
as to the relative activities between the male and the female
plants.<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: May I ask a question of Dr. Robinson? As I understand
it, <br>
the average production is about 500 tons a year. Is that 500 tons
of fibre?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: Yes. This past summer, we had 1300 acres of hemp <br>
produced commercially in this country, and it has been running
about that <br>
acreage with the exception that in 1934 and 1935 this acreage
appeared in <br>
Minnesota, and in 1936 and 1937 we had a big acreages in
Illinois, but <br>
those were acreages planted, you might say, for other purposes
than the <br>
ordinary use, for there was an idea of producing fibre as a
substitute for a <br>
wool and various things of that nature. Those industries that
attempted to <br>
do that, for one reason or another, have dropped by the wayside,
and 1000 <br>
to 1500 acres is the normal hemp production each year in the
United <br>
States.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Professor Wright, you heard Commissioner Anslinger's
<br>
question for information on the relationship between male and
female <br>
plants. You are undoubtedly aware of most of the discussions in
the past <br>
years on the subject of Marihuana, and that it has centered
around the <br>
female plant. As a matter of fact, I believe the United States <br>
Pharmacopoeia refers to the flowering type of the female plant,
and it is <br>
stated that Marihuana comes mostly from the female plant. I
wonder <br>
whether historically that might not have arisen from the fact
that <br>
possibly the male plant flowered at an earlier period than the
female <br>
plant in the growth of the plant itself, and at the time of
harvesting by <br>
force of circumstance they were limited to harvesting female
tops. <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Not actually knowing it, I could not say, of course,
but I <br>
am sure that is the answer. In the male plant the leaves drop off
long <br>
before, the female plant, and when the traffickers have reached
the plant <br>
the leaves have practically all gone from the male, but the
females are <br>
luxuriant.<br>
<br>
MR. LEVINE: Is there any distinction between the fiber of males
and <br>
females?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: You see, in fibre, they are cut at an early stage
when the <br>
female plants are just forming the bud, and the male plants just
shedding the pollen.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Then the male plant would grow as tall as the female
<br>
plant.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Yes, they do usually reach the same height.<br>
MR. WOLLNER. When produced for fibre, the plant does not reach
the <br>
height we experienced in Arlington.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It has reached its full height when cut for fibre.
You <br>
planted it in rows, too, which would add to the height.<br>
<br>
MR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Professor Wright a question as
to <br>
whether or not there was any quantity of Cannabis raised in this
country <br>
for commercial drug purposes.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I cannot answer that question.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: Undoubtedly there are others here who could furnish
<br>
that information. I do not know of a single case where any of it
has been <br>
furnished companies for that purpose, but I think there are
companies that <br>
get it for that purpose.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: There was a concern that grew it in Indianapolis
several <br>
years ago for their own purposes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Most of the pharmaceutical houses before <br>
enactment of Federal Marihuana Legislation obtained their
Cannabis supply from the Middle West. There was relatively little
importation of Cannabis for medical purposes.<br>
<br>
DR. COUCH: In the Food and Drug Administration, we occasionally
see <br>
a questionnaire sent to the importers more or less of the patent
medicine <br>
type, and also some well known pharmaceutical houses where
cannabis is <br>
still found in the formula for certain products. Under the Pure
Food and <br>
Drug Act, we have some requirements on that, and we are informed
what <br>
the source of it is, whether gotten in this country or through
importation.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think the stocks of some of the larger <br>
houses who are still putting this out are sufficient to carry
them over for <br>
a considerable period of time. Some of the firms transferred or
sold their <br>
product to other houses, but I know of a number of occasions
where raw <br>
material was obtained in this country for the local trade.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I have been informed by Doctors that they did get a <br>
considerable amount of their prepared processed material from
Mexico. I <br>
was wondering if there was any processing plant in Mexico.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I did not know they imported it for <br>
medical uses from Mexico.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Many of the commercial manufacturers have grown it,
but <br>
because of the extreme variability of the potency of the material
they <br>
were growing themselves, they attempted to import it from Madras
or <br>
Bombay. But the material imported was often weaker than that
grown in <br>
this country. So the next step was to purchase from Mr. Young at <br>
Charleston, South Carolina, or the general neighborhood of
Lexington, <br>
Kentucky, or Nantou, Illinois. But, those sources folded up
within the last <br>
ten years and there has not been any substantial production of
material in <br>
the United States since then. I tested most of the material grown
in this <br>
country that has been offered.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I suppose that seed came from Kentucky, <br>
which in turn came from China.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: That is true, but I have tested material grown in the <br>
United States commercially that was more potent in its
physiological <br>
aspects than that imported from India.<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: I think that came about as a result of the interest
that <br>
developed in the production of it during the war, or just before
we got into <br>
the war, because at that time I was in the field myself and grew
it com-<br>
mercially for four or five years in Virginia from that same stock
of seed <br>
that Young used in South Carolina, and which was obtained from
the Bureau of Plant Industry. I do not know whether he got it
from Dewey or not.<br>
<br>
The plan we adopted was to cull out as much as possible the tall <br>
plants for purely commercial reasons. We could not get so much
material <br>
from the tall plants. In other words, bushy plants grew up six
and seven <br>
feet high, giving much more drug than those that grew up taller
but not so <br>
bushy, When we considered it the proper time, you would grab hold
of it. It <br>
felt like a sponge. We collected enough material then to produce
a drug <br>
very much more potent than any imported material that came into
the <br>
country.<br>
<br>
It was our experience that it really did not make much difference
<br>
where the hemp came from, after it had been grown here and become
<br>
acclimated to our conditions you could select bushy plants from
it, and it <br>
was just as potent. It did not make any difference where it came
from. We <br>
used to cull our plants, particularly the male plants. I used to
think it did <br>
not have much effect, but be that as it may, that was what we
did. I do not <br>
think we could have ever used the male plants anyway for, in
stripping, <br>
the amount of material obtained was so small.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How did you strip the plant?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: It was a very easy process. It was done by women, and
<br>
they used gloves. In all of the years we were producing that
material as far as we knew, there never was a case of where
anybody used it for illegitimate purposes. In fact at that time,
I do <br>
not think there was any Marihuana used. But, it did not pay us to
go on.<br>
<br>
I think a great deal of the Cannabis sold in the drug trade came
from <br>
the wild materials that grew in the Middle West and one of the
largest <br>
dealers in drugs handled that crop. I knew him very well, and he
told me at <br>
the time.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: What further preparation was there after stripping <br>
for medicinal purposes?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: We just baled it and sold it.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: Any other processing necessary?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: In the manufacturing of medicinals, it has to be <br>
extracted usually with alcohol end concentrated down to a solid
extract. <br>
There was no attempt, and I do not think there has been any
attempt made, <br>
to separate for commercial purposes the active principle, for
even with <br>
all of the work done, we do not know what it is.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Did you find, Mr. Fuller, in your growth of the
plant <br>
commercially, that arid seasons or drier seasons would increase,
or <br>
produce an increased quantity of resin?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: I do not think we noticed any difference. Now, I was
in <br>
that portion of Virginia very near to Washington on the first
plateau, six <br>
or eight miles out, and some of those summers were very dry. We
would <br>
get sometimes six weeks without rain, and it did not seem to
affect the <br>
yield at all. One season, I recall particularly, there was a
great deal of <br>
rain, and the crop was just about the same.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I would like to offer this thought to the Department
of <br>
Agriculture. The statement is invariably made by people in Europe
and the <br>
Far East and Near East that the amount of resin produced by a
plant is in a <br>
measure proportionate to the rainfall, and the less rainfall the
more resin. <br>
I wonder whether we are actually dealing with the question of the
<br>
variation in the amount of resin produced as against the amount
of resin <br>
exuded. That is to say, isn't it possible as a result of a
condition, all that <br>
happens is the plant structure, so to speak, shrinks to
evaporation and <br>
greater amount of resin appears on the surface, but the absolute
quantity <br>
contained by the flowering tops and the leaves is the same ?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: I think your point is well taken, and it was my <br>
intention to go into some of those points in those tests
throughout the United States. We collected material over at
Arlington Farm last summer at various stages for the purpose of <br>
making a microtome test of these little pockets. So far we have
not had <br>
time to do very much on that, and there are gentlemen here who
have done <br>
more. We actually found those pockets present in pants two weeks
old and <br>
on varying specimens which we have in our office. We want back to
plants <br>
that were less [than] three weeks old and we found there hashish
material. <br>
Now in older plants in some of the specimens we have of Indian
hemp, it <br>
seemed to be exuded from the cells all over the surface, and I
imagine in <br>
such plants as that, if it exuded if you touched it, much more
would come <br>
off than if it had not exuded. Is that what you mean, certain
climatic <br>
conditions would cause cells to erupt, and the viscosity of the
exudate <br>
would be such that it would spread.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I am thinking in terms of opium or the poppy. You
can <br>
get opium from the pod without scarifying, and the thought struck
me, in <br>
the case of Cannabis, since the leaf is always extracted in this
country, <br>
and since in the past the process has been of rubbing it from the
outside, <br>
in the East, they get more resin than we do, due to the fact that
more has <br>
exuded but not more produced.<br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: There is another factor involved in the question
about <br>
rainfall, and the formation of resin, and that is perhaps the
production of <br>
resin would depend upon the amount of sunshine, and the more
rainfall, the <br>
less sunshine. In tomato plants for example, the Department of <br>
Agriculture has done a great deal of experimentation as to
foliage, and [it] <br>
has been shown that the quantity of foliage depends greatly upon
the <br>
duration of sunshine the plant has received.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I had not thought of that. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: Some plants require a great deal of sunshine. <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: May I ask you this question, - I was interested in
the <br>
fact that you selected the bushy plant believing it more
profitable to do <br>
that. <br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Did you have any observations at all to indicate they
<br>
were more potent or more satisfactory to the purchaser than the
more <br>
slender plants; have you any reason to believe there is a
difference <br>
between the two?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: No, I do not think there is any difference, for the
green <br>
leaf from the male plant yields resin, and as far as we could
determine, <br>
the resin was just as potent as the female. You do not get so
much per plant. That was <br>
what we were interested in, but, as far as quality is concerned,
I do not <br>
think there was any difference.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: And now, Gentlemen, if we have no more <br>
questions on the agricultural phase of the problem we will
proceed to a <br>
little more controversial subject. The pharmacological phase. I
would like <br>
to have Dr. Munch give us a little history of the pharmacology of
<br>
Marihuana.<br>

<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES C. MUNCH</h1>

<p><b>PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOLOGY , TEMPLE UNIVERSITY</b></p>

<hr>

<p>DR. MUNCH: So far as the external effects are concerned of the
fluid extract of Cannabis, the effects are hyperesthesia,
fomication, and cold extremities. These cause increase in
intensity. It is not local. <br>
<br>
So far as the gastro-intestinal tract is concerned, there is no
effect upon the taste. There is a tendency towards an increase in
thirst and appetite, and large doses will cause nausea, emesis,
vomiting, and the drugs produced diarrhea or constipation.<br>
</p>

<p>So far as the effect on the brain, I am only going into that
to this extent, to say that in connection with USPVIII which was
thirty years ago we were interested in knowing whether the
American grown plant could be used as well as that which had been
imported from India. The study made by the American Drug
Manufacturers Association and by others at that time led the USP
official Committee to the stand that either the Indian or the
American grown material would be comparable for medicinal
purposes so long as it was tested and found to have a certain
physiological effect, and from a number of bio-tests that were
made in which the material was administered to dogs, there were
three different effects produced, one <br>
effect being to cause the dog to sway from side to side, and back
and forth, and finally not to be able to stand erect at all. It
was then that satisfactory material was produced which would
produce such a response.<br>
</p>

<p>When it became necessary to prepare revised standards for
world use of the Cannabis, we standardized the standards. First,
we obtained material from various manufacturers in this country
representing the ordinary strength or potency of the product and
then many of these <br>
manufacturers told me of the material of ten or twenty or thirty
years before, and they gave me the products or materials which
were of the same commercial strength as they have always been
marketing.<br>
<br>
Then through various means, we obtained drugs and standardized
those products, that is thirteen different products of this
series of drugs. Those products were then mixed, and constituted
the USP fluid extract of Cannabis, which was officially
recognized in USP X.<br>
<br>
Then as to the method of bio-assay. Contrary to much of the
published literature we find that dogs vary as greatly in their
response as do humans. On. some 500 dogs I have used, fully
one-half were very insensitive, and were discarded immediately.
The nervous type or short-haired dog is usually a satisfactory
animal but not necessarily the best.<br>
</p>

<p>Going back to the pharmacological action, so far as the
causes, and effect on circulation, a small dose causes rapid
beating of the heart which may be followed by less than normal.
The blood pressure is usually unchanged, or there is a slight
fall.<br>
<br>
So far as the blood is concerned, there is a definite increase in
the hypoglycemiacal content. At the same time, there is a
definite increase in the blood sugar. Enormous doses have
produced death by cardiac failure, but the doses were 100 to 200
times doses, which produced a tremendous physiological effect.<br>
<br>
If smoked, there is a tendency to choking or coughing, and all
doses tend to decrease the respiratory needs. So far as the
muscles are concerned, the muscles show a definite confusion, and
with very large doses there are shown flexor spasms. But not with
a therapeutic dose.<br>
<br>
So far as the pupils of the eyes themselves, there is a very
definite contraction of the conjunctiva, and usually but not
always a dilation of the pupil.<br>
<br>
So far as the effect on the glands, there is probably a double
diuretical effect. There is a question, and the production of the
diuretic effect is unsettled.<br>
<br>
It has been reported there is a sexually stimulating effect. Some
say it does and some say it does not exist.<br>
<br>
So far as antidotes are concerned the thought is, if it has been
swallowed, the administration of an emetic, caffeine or acid
drinks in general.<br>
<br>
So far as the habituation is concerned, it has been claimed and
denied, and so far as elimination is concerned, I have not been
able to detect it in the urine. So, I do not believe the active
principle is eliminated by urine.<br>
<br>
In the general pharmacopoeia developed by O'Shaunessy in 1843,
which reached its peak ten or fifteen years later, it was
clinically recommended for all sorts of diseases and later found
worthless. <br>
<br>
There is a definite decrease in the central Indian drug which
stimulated further work done by Casparis and others, after which
it appears to have gone into innocuous desuetude until it began
to be criminally exploited, which led to the present burst of
study. <br>
<br>
Pharmacology is right I think, when it is said it does not have
the same effect, or one effect on the brain, and I may be
sticking my head out when I make a suggested answer that the
cause of the awful intoxication is largely due to the difference
in the rate of absorption, whether the material is smoked or
given by solution or in capsules and taken into the stomach, or
given rectally, and also the susceptibility on the brain, because
in many instances we have given the same material to humans or
dogs. Some of the animals it has shown no effect upon, others it
has shown an enormous effect with the same dose. So far as
animals are concerned, we have made a comparative study and find
that dogs and rabbits have proven most suitable for quantitative
assays but none can be relied on for qualitative accuracy, that
is 10 to 12%. That is a complete<br>
change from what I said in my book,1 but it is possible, by
running from 14 to 20 bio-assay, to obtain results accurate
within plus or minus 11 to 20%. But, it never has been done
commercially and can only be done in connection with research.<br>
<br>
Through what channels does the active principle find its way into
the nerve centers? I should say through the blood. So far as the
effect on the blood pressure, I have attempted to cover those
reflex changes. It has been stated and denied that there are
significant lesions in the brain of humans. Dogs I have used for
some years, in some instances showed certain types of brain
changes. Whether those are connected with Cannabis, I do not
know. I am trying to complete <br>
that now and perhaps within the next five years I can answer the
question.<br>
Regarding the other questions, I would rather refer those to Dr.
Bromberg.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Before we enter into a general
discussion, I would like to call on Dr. Loewe of Cornell
University to give us a statement on the bio-assay method.<br>

<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. S. LOEWE<br>
</h1>

<p><b>PHARMACOLOGIST <br>
CORNELL UNIVERSITY MEDICAL COLLEGE<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. LOEWE: The bio-assay, in my opinion, is the point where
the pharmacologist has to enter this manifold picture at which we
arrive in this conference for a very significant reason.<br>
<br>
The reason is that all the manifold aspects of Marihuana are
focused around and makes the existence of an active principle in
this drug, active principles which are chemically not known, and
as long as an active principle is not chemically known, it can
only be determined from its <br>
action, that is, biologically, which can only be by bio-assay. <br>
<br>
Dr. Munch has thoroughly depicted the many aspects of the
pharmacological action of Marihuana. That is what we can call the
pharmacological spectrum of this drug, But it must be emphasized,
that the spectrum of the drug as such and not on one certain
active principle <br>
necessarily, for nobody knows the active principle, and nobody
ever knows whether there is only one active principle or more
than one active principle.<br>
<br>
It can be assumed from the beginning that there is more than one
active principle but this must not necessarily concern the
Marihuana interests, because the problem is narrowed to that
active principle among possibly many active principles which
produces the narcotic or &quot;dope&quot; action in humans.<br>
<br>
Even with respect to this point, of course, we are not one
hundred percent sure that this is the action of one principle or
more than one.<br>
<br>
Quantitative bio-assay of the active principle of Marihuana, of
course, tends or aims to determine that one active principle or a
complex of active principles, which is interesting from the human
point of view, the narcotic principle. May I mention right here
that as long as we do not know how many active principles there
are, we have to assume primarily that every action is carried by
a separate active principle, and with this assumption, may I
speak for the definite ataxia principle, which is the principle
which can be bio-assayed in the drug which produces the main
action stored in the dog. There is another action in the drug,
which I may call the depressant action, the cataleptic action,
and then there is the anesthetic principle which can be studied
in the rabbit, using the depression of the corneal reflex. The
depressant action in the mouse, manifested by prolonging the
hypnotic action, is an action which I have observed and used to
bio-assay this one active principle.<br>
</p>

<p>Now, bio-assay has to start, therefore, with this, which one
of these actions is preferable for the Marihuana problem for
studying the narcotic principle, important for humans?<br>
<br>
We have much evidence that the ataxia action is fairly well
related to the narcotic action.<br>
<br>
In detail, there is not much to say. Walton has elaborated the
previous effects and experiences of the bio-assay of the drug in
a fairly good manner. There are details, and certainly it is
necessary to bio-assay a large number of animals due to the
individual natures and non- <br>
susceptibility which complicates the actions, and action can only
be compared in one and the same animal, and only for comparison
in a single animal, and the consequence is that a large group of
animals has to be used.<br>
<br>
The mode of administration has been emphasized by Dr. Munch. I
would prefer and do prefer, for bio-assay, intravenous
administration because the Marihuana action has a very long
period of latency without the means of elimination from the
system, so that the results seem to be <br>
fairly well comparable.<br>
<br>
Now, I am of the opinion, just like Dr. Munch has emphasized,
that the bio-assay method of the drug is not definitely
eliminated. I have the impression that the method will result in
fairly good accuracy, but it is an accuracy of plus or minus 15
or 20%, and which will suffice, I suppose, for the period in
which bio-assay is necessary.<br>
<br>
It is the unfortunate situation of the pharmacologist that in
certain periods of development of active principles he is
available for the purpose, and in a certain sense he is the man
charged with the entire problem. But, his unfortunate situation
is that just when he has developed this method and applied it, it
is always finally inherent that he is out of the picture for, as
soon as the chemist comes into the picture, and the bio-assay is
not any more necessary, the pharmacologist can be dropped. If I
may mention this at random, all of these points of view are true
also as to the chemical test. Before the chemist has developed
the active principle, the chemical method of <br>
identification of much or great importance to the country, and
they may be of much or less importance for identifying the active
principles than are the bio-assay methods, but only after the
discovery of the active principle and its chemical properties,
the problem of the chemical test, the importance of the Beam test
can become clear.<br>
I know of another example where a greater activity of a certain
drug was found, and the drug was not white but yellow, and this,
of course, introduced many beliefs that yellow colors and
opticals would be an easy expedient for getting a quantitative
activity. So, there was developed a number of tests for this
drug, going into this problem, but finally it turned out what
general color of the narcotic or commodity was and the reason for
the high activity of the drug.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Well, Doctor, we are going to have the
chemists confer among themselves, and they will then give us some
of their views. I think we can reserve the general discussion for
the afternoon.<br>
<br>
We will now hear from Dr. Walter Bromberg, Senior Psychiatrist of
the Department of Hospitals, City of New York.<br>

<h2>STATEMENT OF DR. WALTER BROMBERG<br>
</h2>

<p><b>SENIOR PSYCHIATRIST <br>
DEPARTMENT OF HOSPITALS, CITY OF NEW YORK.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. BROMBERG: To start with, my interest in this Marihuana
problem began in 1933 when I reported at Bellevue Hospital a
group of 11 cases of mental reactions induced by smoking
Marihuana and I reviewed the literature and medical knowledge at
that time. Also, the experience which I obtained was at the
Psychiatric Clinic of the Court of General Sessions <br>
over a period of six years. Persons showing overt mental symptoms
were brought to the hospital by interested relatives and
occasionally on a magistrate's order. For that reason, the vast
majority of Marihuana smokers did not reach the hospital. Cases
which came before the Clinic had passed through the Court of
General Sessions and had been arraigned, indicted and convicted
of a felony.<br>
<br>
There has been considerable literature on the intoxication and
insanity-producing effect of Cannabis, in papers from Asia,
Europe, and the United States. To sum up this material concisely,
it can be said that the several types of syndromes recognized
fall into three groups: (a) <br>
intoxication, (b) toxic psychosis with or without admixture of
other types of mental reactions (schizophrenia, manic-depressive)
and (c) according to Eastern European and Asiatic observers,
chronic dementia and deterioration following prolonged use of the
drug. Apparently this latter type of deteriorating process has
not been observed in American clinics.<br>
<br>
Our experience with mental conditions following Marihuana
indicate to us that there are two categories of mental reaction.
The following classification is suggested:<br>
<br>
Acute intoxication (Marihuana Psychosis) Containing sensory,
motor and subjective elements, lasting hours to several days,
often with anxiety or hysterical reactions, and panic states and
depressions of transient nature.<br>
Toxic Psychoses (a) in which there are many admixtures of
disturbed sensorlum, delusional and emotional reactions amounting
to psychosis, but with the common characteristic toxic signs and
(b) functional psychoses of a typical variety, initiated by
Marihuana or colored by Marihuana in their symptomatology, but
which continue in the form of the underlying psychosis. In these
cases Marihuana represents an incipient stage in the psychosis,
apparently.<br>
<br>
There were 14 cases of Acute Intoxication and 17 of Toxic
psychosis. <br>
<br>
The point at which the line is drawn between acute intoxicating
due to Marihuana and psychosis due to Marihuana depends on the
degree and severity of the symptoms. Acute intoxications, induced
by smoking one to four cigarettes, bring about after an interval
varying from one-half to five hours in the individual one or all
of the following symptoms: an increase in motor activity, a
feeling of excitement, mental confusion, disorientation, crowding
of perception, elementary visual illusions and hallucinations,
euphoria and talkativeness. In addition to these symptoms,
numerous subjective experiences occur, such as increased speed of
thought processes, a feeling of intellectual brilliance, change
in time perception, various somatic feelings, dizziness, hunger,
a feeling of swelling of the head, lightness of the extremities,
a sensation of walking on air, lengthening of the limbs and
sexual illusions. More often sex excitement consists in the fact
that the possible sexual objects in his environment become
extraordinarily desirable. There is abundant evidence in our
clinical and experimental material to show that the stimulus for
sexual <br>
interest and activity derives from the aesthetic enhancement of
objects in the environment. It is not so much a matter of
increased potency on the part of the user as increased reaction
to sexual fantasies and illusions. One of our patients said:
&quot;I saw black and white women lying in bed with legs
separated, as if expecting men . . . some women in the park with
nothing on, doing nasty dances, moving their hips. I chased after
them.&quot; Others state women appear amazingly beautiful.
Another patient said: &quot;In the subway I felt very sexy. I
wanted to touch every woman that passed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The speeded-up physical motility has its counterpart in rapid
speech. There is a feeling on the part of the individual that he
is witty, even brilliant; his ideas flow quickly and words come
readily to the tongue. Conclusions and answers seem to come to
mind ready-formed and surprisingly clear, without the effort of
thinking. This feelings of clarity is, of course, spurious.
Actually the productions of the intoxicant are hard to follow,
for when he wishes to explain what he has thought there is only
confusion. The rapid flow of ideas gives a subjective impression
of brilliance of thought and observation. The sense of increased
speed of thinking apparently has an effect on memory - hence the
confusion that appears on trying to recall what was thought
during the intoxication.<br>
<br>
The smoker finds it pleasant to be with others and to impart his
experiences to them. This is reflected in the fact that Marihuana
is ordinarily smoked at parties or in groups. It is felt that
this need for a social setting is a reaction to an inner anxiety
arising from the threat of bodily destruction implied in somatic
illusions induced by Marihuana In the ordinary case of smoking
Marihuana, especially with one who is used to the drug, this
threat becomes converted to euphoria which develops to
uncontrollable fits of laughter. Nevertheless inquiry shows that
almost every smoker is aware of definite uneasiness at the outset
of the intoxication. The description from smokers in Harlem and
from experimental subjects agrees on this point. In the words of
a user of two years' standing, initiates &quot;shrink together,
feel tight inside and get <br>
frightened.&quot; After they smoke it more than once, the reality
of these frightening somatic illusions becomes less. In
occasional instances, and these are the cases which are apt to
come to medical attention, the fear of death, of insanity, of
bodily deformity and of bodily dissolution are startling. These
patients are tense, nervous, frightened, they may develop a state
of panic. Often <br>
suicide or assaultive acts are the result of these emotional
states. The anxiety state is so common in patients admitted to
the hospital for uncomplicated Marihuana psychosis, that it can
be considered part of the intoxication syndrome.<br>
<br>
Notes taken on experimental subjects who were psychologically
trained illustrate these points:<br>
<br>
Subject l. Two cigarettes were smoked within 40 minutes.
Immediately after the second a feeling of lightness in vertex of
head was felt. Head was expanding; there was a feeling of mild
excitement. Now the head felt heavy and there was a definite
feeling of lengthening in the legs <br>
and a tension in the back muscles of the thigh. Head felt
alternately light and heavy. There was a sensation as though the
top of the head were lifted with about four inch increase in
height, accompanied by optic images of skulls and skeletons.
Feeling of the arms rising up in the air. <br>
Subject was aware of a feeling of confusion. Suddenly he saw
images of legs and arms in a dissecting room which were
terrifying. <br>
</p>

<p>Subject 2. &quot;I felt a little euphoric at first, but with
the first draw my heart feels faster, my eyes a little heavier. I
feel myself perspiring all over, and shaking. I can feel a slight
dizziness. I feel weak; the dizziness has left and I am
perspiring (Asked to walk around the room. Refuses to do <br>
so and becomes negativistic). On looking back I remembered that I
had sexual thoughts during the time of the experiment. Time seems
to pass in a peculiar way, there being a combination of fastness
and slowness. I took my first inhalation a few minutes after 9
and when I looked at the clock and saw it was 10 after 9. I was
very much surprised because it seemed like hours. The whole
experiment seems now as if it lasted much longer than it did.
Walking home I walked slowly in front of oncoming cars and felt a
sense of recklessness connected with not being able to walk
faster and not caring.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is remarkable how much anxiety is developed when one looks for
experimental subjects among laymen. The drug is popularly
supposed to release aggressive and sexual impulses beyond the
point of control; it is also regarded as being habit-forming. The
legendary history and social connotation of hashish smoking may
help to develop in those who have had no experience with the
drug, a series of anxieties masking sexual fantasies and
aggressive impulses. This has come almost to the point of mass
hysteria. Some public officials are unwilling to allow the use of
Marihuana cigarettes for experimentation purposes, on the ground
that it may be &quot;immoral,&quot; tending to foster the
development of drug addiction among the public. This frequent
anxiety concerning Cannabis may have as its source the feeling of
dissolution and other somatic changes induced in smokers which is
communicated somehow to the non-smoking public.<br>
<br>
In clinical material as indicated, Marihuana effects may range
from mild intoxications to transitory psychoses which require
psychiatric aid. The effects vary and not all the symptoms occur
in every case. Illustrative of the Marihuana psychosis with
anxiety reactions, and somatic sensory distortions:<br>
A 31 year old white man, admitted March 27, 1934, with a history
of having smoked just one cigarette. On admission the patient was
depressed, retarded, apprehensive. He admitted smoking Marihuana.
Was oriented and memory showed no defects. Physical examination
was negative. The patient states, &quot;My hand began to feel
blue all of a sudden. I felt like laughing and I felt funny in my
head. it was the queerest feeling I ever had. I felt like I was
kind of fainting away like. I sweat and then I'd get kind of
chilly. I got the scare of my life. I thought I was going to die
and everything else. I knew what was happening all the time. I
thought my hands were beginning to get blue. My throat began to
get kind of dry. It was a little better than getting drunk. I did
not want to step down from the curbÑit seemed to be so high. I
was sitting down and was afraid to get up.&quot; Patient improved
and on the second day was less apprehensive, was pleasant and
cheerful. He was discharged as recovered, after two days.<br>
<br>
This case demonstrates visual illusions, which recall the
megalopsia (perceiving objects larger than they are), and more
common micropsia, which has been reported experimentally and
clinically. It is this type of illusion, induced by hashish, that
may have been the basis for the story of Aladdin who saw the
tremendous genie emerge from his lamp spout in the Arabian
Nights' tale.<br>
<br>
A 32 year old Irish-American, admitted September 17, 1937, with a
history of smoking Marihuana cigarettes two hours prior to
admission. He felt dizzy, wanted to commit suicide by jumping out
of windows, bumping head on the wall, floor, etc. On admission
was uneasy, apprehensive, impulsive. Said, &quot;I feel sick. I'm
going through hell. I saw trucks coming at me getting larger and
I wanted to open the door of the cab and jump out.&quot; He was
discharged as improved in his own custody about 12 hours after
admission. <br>
<br>
A common type of intoxication is indicated in the following case:
<br>
<br>
A 38 year old Negro, admitted April 13, 1934, with history that
he had run out of the house poorly clad and that he had smoked
&quot;artificial&quot; cigarettes. He was confused on admission,
was dazed in appearance and disoriented. He described a lightness
of the head, dizziness and seeing <br>
star-shaped figures before his eyes after smoking a
&quot;doped&quot; cigarette. He was apprehensive on examination.
On the second or third day after admission, apprehension had
disappeared and he was discharged as recovered, being clear,
composed, but unable to account for his earlier excitement.<br>
<br>
It is not uncommon to find the history of admixture of other
drugs or alcohol in Cannabis intoxication. Frequently alcohol
intensifies the Cannabis symptomatology.<br>
<br>
A 27 year old man of old American stock, admitted on June 18,
1933, at his own request. He had been a chronic alcoholic and
displayed definite evidences of psychopathic makeup; had marked
inferiority because of his eyes and body structure. On admission
he appeared to be apprehensive, a little excited, spoke
coherently and relevantly. His experiences were rather clearly
set forth--&quot;I was down on the water-front. A fellow gave me
an Egyptian cigarette to smoke . . . it was hashish. About an
hour afterwards I began to see things. I'd see things flying in
the air. This made me laugh and I'd laugh at things not worth
laughing at. Then I began to see green and other colors flowing
before my eyes. Then things got black. I imagined people were <br>
following me and I screamed in my hotel and got kicked out. I
still see red lines in front of my eyes and other different
colors all stuck together. <br>
</p>

<p>Then I began to hear bells that would get fainter and fainter
and then start again. Imagined someone was after me all evening.
I thought I heard footsteps and saw people ducking in and out of
doorways behind. me. At the time I said to myself maybe it all
affect my eyes. I seen a big splotch in front of me Ñ it was
scarletÑ very bright, exceptionally bright. It contracted, then
faded away. I knew all the time it was due to hashish.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second group comprises cases of toxic psychosis due to or
initiated by Cannabis. There may be other toxic agents present,
as alcohol, other drugs, infective or other endogenous elements.
Disordered sensorium, excitement and agitation, retardation,
blocking with emotional rigidity, hallucinations, sensations of
somatic change, delusional experiences may appear in the toxic
psychosis. The psychosis lasts from weeks to months. Often the
mental picture crystallizes out into a schizophrenic or manic
depressive psychosis after several weeks or months (see
paradigm). At the onset of the illness what can be considered
characteristic Cannabis symptom- <br>
atology is discernible. As the underlying functional psychosis
develops, the toxic elements recede.<br>
A boy of 16, admitted February 27, 1934, with statement from the
family that for two months he had been depressed, apprehensive,
worried, scratching his hands in a nervous manner, prayed
constantly. He complained that somebody read his thoughts. On
admission was well <br>
developed and showed no physical signs. Patient was agitated,
depressed, talked constantly in a bizarre manner about the devil
influencing him, etc. Said: &quot;I felt lightly when I was
walking - as if I weighed only 10 pounds. I felt like running my
whole body was light. I felt like jumping. As if I was walking on
air. I felt happy. Then I saw yellow lights all around me. I saw
blue and green too. The colors were more bright than usual. There
are just masses of colors - sometimes I see a black cross with
everything red behind it. That means there is a God. He is
helping me. The devil knows the evil thoughts in me.&quot; This
agitated condition improved and patient was discharged about 3
weeks after admission as a psychosis due to drugs; acute
hallucinatory <br>
episode.<br>
<br>
Patient was readmitted August 1st of that year with a picture of
a depression with schizoid features. On this admission there were
no evidences whatever of the sensory illusions and somatic
feelings that he had previously when he smoked Marihuana. He was
transferred to the state hospital, where he remained four years,
being diagnosed as Paranoid Schizophrenia with Catatonic
Features. There he was restless and overactive. He had a marked
push of speech, expressed ideas of reference and religious
delusions and was manneristic. Said: &quot;I figured the devil
was trying to pull me away from God so I cut a cross on my arm.
Physically I am the same, but mentally I am another person. ...I
feel that people influence me by touching me - like injecting
dope.&quot; Later he was manneristic, grimaced, was untidy,
repeated practically all questions asked, answered briefly and
usually vaguely and would say, &quot;I don' know exactly,&quot;
or &quot;I don't know.&quot; He remained dull, apathetic,
indifferent and mute until the present time.<br>
<br>
The personality factor is of undoubted importance in this group
of individuals. After the toxic state passed off in these
patients in whom the intoxication reaches deeply enough into the
personality, a basic psychotic state developed. At times, the
toxic features are in the background, the personality reactions
being pre-dominant. What the inner relationship is <br>
between Cannabis and the onset of a functional psychotic state is
not always clear. From our observation, the inner reaction to
somatic sensation seems to be vital. Such reactions consisted of
panic states which disappeared as soon as the stimulus (effects
of the drug) faded. It <br>
is generally known in psychopathology that when the perception of
our own bodily sensations is disturbed we are liable to be
profoundly affected psychologically. Disturbances in perception
of the body-model (Korperschema), which is built up of
kinesthetic, tactile, visual and other <br>
stimuli, and integrated into the core of the personality, elicit
some type of reaction. Such disturbances act as a blow to the
ego, invoking defensive reactions of anxiety, apprehension,
projection, etc., which approach or are schizophrenic in their
clinical manifestations. The following case illustrates these
points:<br>
<br>
A 20 year-old colored man admitted February 22, 1936. He is said
by his mother to have been &quot;nervous&quot; for some time,
said he wanted to die, wanted to kill himself. Prior to admission
his mother caught him with a bottle of lysol. He had been
depressed and despondent. He was a boy of superior intelligence
as measured by the Army Alpha test. On admission he stated that
he used Marihuana for several months and during this time he had
heard people talking about him They said' &quot;Oh, what an ugly
boy. How mean-looking he is.&quot; For four months, August to
October, 1935, he smoked three to four cigarettes a day until he
began to feel ill. At first Marihuana made him happy. Then he
felt that he made a peculiar noise in his throat; ate once a day;
was unable to sleep; and experienced auditory hallucinations. The
hallucinations started four months ago and increased gradually.
He thought his face was changing. He looked thin, mean, and ugly;
he became self-conscious. He felt that every-one in the
neighborhood knew it. He stated at times he seemed speeded up,
but his mind was keenly alert with the development of the ideas
of reference, he became self-reproachful, apprehensive and
fearful.<br>
<br>
He was then transferred to a state hospital on March 13, 1936,
where he stated his hallucinations had disappeared and his
emotional reaction improved. After three months he was discharged
to his home; within five months he was readmitted to Bellevue
Hospital, where he had gone in a state of panic, and from where
he was re-committed to a state hospital. He was tense, uneasy,
still retained ideas of reference, acted oddly at home apparently
in response to his delusions. Diagnosis on second admission to
State Hospital was Dementia Praecox Paranoid Type, which was made
about two years after the onset of the original illness.<br>
<br>
Some cases showed the manic-depressive reactions, but these were
in the minority. It is perhaps to be expected that
schizophrenic-like psychoses are more common because individuals
who take to drugs have some deep inadequacy to start with. The
cyclothymic personality is less prone to require the drug.<br>
<br>
A man of 28 who was brought to the hospital by his mother on
February 13, 1938, with the history that he had been smoking
reefers for some time. A year ago he had an episode, was not
hospitalized and improved from it. On admission patient was
confused, restless, apprehen-<br>
sive. He engaged in violent daydreamings. At times he appeared to
be reacting to hallucinations. He said he &quot;had a big
head.&quot; He became talkative, euphoric, elated and overactive
after a day or so. He said: &quot;The best thing for me to do is.
. . you look fine. I've got to look like you . I know what it is
. . . when a Buick and a Packard get together.&quot; His speech
was distinctly flighty, his behavior panicky; was constantly
restless. Would cry, sing, talk.<br>
<br>
He was transferred to a state hospital on February 24, 1938.
There his condition persisted and he became somewhat depressed,
but showed promise of recovery a few months after admission.
Diagnosis at State Hospital was Manic Depressive Psychosis, Manic
Type. <br>
<br>
Mixed reactions merge with the toxic psychoses. These reactions
vary clinically, some occurring in chronic alcoholics, some in
schizophrenics and some in psychopathic personalities, and in all
of them Marihuana usage was a factor. It can be clearly seen that
aside from the direct toxic effect of the drug, the personality
of the patient plays a tremendous role in psychotic states
following Marihuana usage. <br>
<br>
A Cuban, age 34, who was admitted on March 6, 1938, to Bellevue
Hospital. He had been taking Marihuana for one and a half years.
He had jumped in front of a south-bound subway train without
injury. He was very depressed, dull, lackadaisical, despondent in
attitude. <br>
</p>

<p>He was definitely under productive but still strongly
suicidal. He described taking one cigarette every day of
Marihuana for a year and a half because it took his worries away.
For some time he had been conscious that people were looking at
him He feels that his body is heavy all the <br>
time. Sometimes he hears deceased persons talking to him. He sees
lights at times. At times he sees a photograph of a strange
person. <br>
<br>
His friend corroborated the history, stating that he had been in
this depressed condition for 3-4 years. He had a work-house
sentence for 2-3 months for Marihuana. He was transferred to a
state hospital March 18, 1938. At that time he was dull,
preoccupied, but lost his hallucinatory and delusional trends.
The State Hospital diagnosed him as Schizophrenia, Hebephrenic
Type (?) and he was released after two months.<br>
</p>

<p>In some cases the drug makes relatively little difference in
the content of the psychosis. It is for the clinician to
determine how much Marihuana influences the clinical picture. In
South Africa, where dagga (equivalent of Marihuana) smoking is
very widespread, a diagnosis of Marihuana psychosis is made in
any &quot;toxic psychosis where there are very good grounds for
assuming addiction to dagga smoking.&quot; It is felt that there
should be more exact criteria, as we outlined above, for a
diagnosis of Marihuana psychosis, by which we mean the presence
of disordered <br>
sensorium, characteristic colored visual hallucinations, time
changes, subjective and somatic feelings. One is apt to
over-estimate the place of Marihuana in the causation of a
psychotic picture. <br>
</p>

<p>A white man of 28, admitted January 23, 1938, to Bellevue
Hospital with a history that he was in a state hospital in
Arizona for 3 months about two years ago and one in Indiana for 9
months four years ago. &quot;I was smoking this Marihuana weed
(at time of admission to State Hospital in <br>
Arizona). I ran around the desert for a time, ran out nights and
one day knocked on a door and told a woman I was Dillinger. I
tried to see how much water I could walk in. I was just like
hypnotized and walking in my sleep. Sometimes I feel like
something's controlling me. Sometimes I feel just like I'm
talking to somebody with my mouth closed. I just ask them a <br>
question with my brain and they answer. Sometimes it's a man,
sometimes it's a woman's voice; it just works in my temple. I
think it's imagination. It's just like a dream. People stare at
me. Sometimes I see different colors. I had that years ago - just
like a light coming towards me; it's not a light, it's an arc.
His effect was flat and he was dejected and slow-speaking. Showed
<br>
blocking and evasiveness on. sex experiences. Had ideas of
reference and persecutory ideas.<br>
<br>
He was transferred to a state hospital, where he was noted as
being preoccupied, under productive and somewhat dissociated. He
stated that he had some sort of seizures that were not really
fits, but that when he had them if he had a sword he would not
mind cutting everybody's head off. He also believed if anybody
got killed near the place where he worked he would be blamed for
it. Said that when he looks in bright lights he sees visions like
all sorts of different colors, blues, whites, and these seem to
blind him. A diagnosis was made of Dementia Praecox, Paranoid
Type, and he was still in State Hospital after five months.<br>
<br>
In psychopathic personalities, those with deep inferiorities, use
of drugs is a method of supporting the ego. In these cases
Marihuana does not always produce the desirable effect.
Apparently it is not strong enough to affect the problems which
have involved deeper layers of the personality. Such individuals
adopt heroin or morphine very soon after a short experience with
Marihuana. The experience of drug addicts seen at the Court of
General Sessions confirms this. Persons addicted to heroin,
morphine, cocaine or opium never return to Cannabis. Such <br>
individuals are admittedly psychopathic in that they need an
increment of drug to make their lives tolerable, In the next
case, the use of Cannabis represented the attempt of the patient
to overcome his sexual inadequacy. In this respect the social
psychology of the drug is a factor, since Marihuana is popularly
supposed to free sexual inhibitions.<br>
<br>
A white man, age 23, admitted to Bellevue Hospital on March 31,
1938, with a history that he felt unworthy and thought he had a
venereal disease. He held ideas of infidelity against his wife
and was assaultive. Threw a four month old baby across a room. He
turned gas jets on. On <br>
admission he was rambling, talkative, evasive, depressed,
self-absorbed and had somatic complaints. He said: 'I was
sentenced to the Workhouse for 4 months for smoking Marihuana. I
knew then I was not satisfying my wife and I thought it might
help. A year ago some friends gave me the weed, I smoked several.
I felt calm and liked to listen to music - very happy -
exhilarating feeling - that's all.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the hospital he was talkative, discussed his problem in detail
and showed some depression, which improved. The infidelity ideas
and his sexual inadequacies concerned him most. He was
transferred to a state hospital with a diagnosis of Psychosis
with Psychopathic Personality; Cannabis usage a factor.<br>
<br>
Often Cannabis intoxication represents a stage in the incipiency
of a psychosis. The patient who is developing a functional
psychosis strives in the incipient stage to overcome the
unconsciously perceived difficulties. In this sense Marihuana
usage represents a healthy reaction tendency, even though the
mechanism may be unknown to the patient. The next case
illustrated this problem. A boy who had made a successful
adjustment on a moderate level of social attainment began to show
schizoid behavior shortly after the usage of Marihuana. The
process continued to a psychotic state. What role did the drug
play? Could the psychosis have begun without the drug? Was the
use of Cannabis the patient's attempt to cure his developing
psychosis? These are problems needing careful judgment and study
and wide clinical experience.<br>
<br>
A young Negro, 20, admitted October 2, 1936 to Bellevue Hospital
with a history of having been dull, indifferent for some time.
Insisted upon keeping the windows closed, would not leave the
house, but denied he heard voices. Would masturbate openly and
made sign with fingers, and actions were decidedly peculiar.
Mother states she caught him. smoking a sweet-smelling cigarette
with a white man and soon after got a history from his playmates
that he had been smoking Marihuana cigarettes for a long time.<br>
<br>
Observation in the hospital confirmed his withdrawn, retarded
attitude. Psychometric gave an IQ. of 75 with rating of
Borderline to Dull Normal Intelligence. Was pre-occupied on ward;
difficult to obtain his attention; evasive; offered many excuses
for closing window and putting <br>
out lights. About 10 days after admission he appeared a little
more alert and cheerful. He was discharged in custody of mother
as Incipient Schizophrenia (?) or Psychoneurosis, Reactive State,
on October 13, 1936.<br>
</p>

<p>He was readmitted a year later, October 15, 1937. At that time
mother gave a statement that for past year, since he left
hospital, he had been dull, staying in the house in a &quot;deep
study.&quot; He seems to listen; does not say anything'. At one
time he beat up an old man in the house who, he <br>
said, called him names. Prior to admission he had attacked a
woman for no apparent reason. Sleeps day and night. Often looks
as if he is in a dream, Changed personality reactions for more
than a year. For two weeks distinctly worse.<br>
<br>
On admission he was sluggish, dull and lethargic, spoke in a
quiet, low voice, showed empty affect, but was intact in
intellectual functions, memory, comprehension, orientation. He
was transferred to the State Hospital on October 20, 1937, where
he was evasive and dull. He showed no interest in the
surroundings and did not mingle with the other patients. He
expressed mild ideas of persecution and of electricity, was
evasive and suspicious. He said some people called him bad names
across the street. Believes that an attempt was made to harm him.
&quot;I sometimes have a funny feeling in my legs
(electricity).&quot; Their diagnostic impression included the
possibility of Dementias-Praecox, Paranoid Type.<br>
<br>
Gradually he acquired an interest and socialized with other
patients. At all times he was neat and tidy in personal
appearance and habits. He improved after five months and was
ready for parole.<br>
<br>
Now, so much for the psychopathic. We now come to the
criminology. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I thought we would cover that in another
subject.<br>
<br>
We will now adjourn for lunch and come back at 1:30.<br>
<br>
(Thereupon at 12:20 o'clock p.m., a recess was declared, the
conference to resume discussions at 1:30 p.m.)<br>

<p> AFTERNOON SESSION.<br>
<br>
The conference was resumed at 1:30 o'clock p.m., pursuant to the <br>
taking of a recess at noon.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Gentlemen, the Conference will be in <br>
order. We may very well start with the general discussion on the <br>
pharmacological phases of the problem, and you can direct your
questions <br>
to Dr. Munch, Dr. Loewe, or Dr. Bromberg.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, I would like to ask you, in respect to
the <br>
statement made by Dr. Walton that Cannabis has been used as a
relief <br>
during labor in the Far East, are you familiar with that general
picture?<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Yes. I think that the product that is actually used
there is <br>
not Cannabis itself, but one of these peculiar mixtures of datura
and <br>
opium and hashish and other things.<br>
<br>
Some of the reports refer to the women smoking the cigarettes for
a <br>
period in labor, but they are not in agreement with the
information I have <br>
gotten from the Mexicans or out in Nevada, for example, where
they have <br>
tried it and found it of no value.<br>
<br>
On the isolated tissues the solutions of the drug have no effect,
or <br>
have a very mild, quieting action.<br>
<br>
If I remove the alcohol, they have little effect,<br>
<br>
90<br>
<br>
which means that the active principle is not sufficiently soluble
in water <br>
to produce an action. So that I do not believe the action is very
definitely <br>
therapeutic. It is more psychological, I believe, than it is
physiological. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Who is Willis? One of them refers to the fact that <br>
Willis recommends its use in tedious labor where the patient is
restless.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Let me look at my copy of this book. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: It is on page 156.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Did you say &quot;Willis&quot;, Mr. Wollner?<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes. On page 156, &quot;EFFECTS DURING LABOR&quot;.
It starts <br>
out, &quot;Willis recommended&quot;.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Willis has written a book on obstetrics and
gynecology, <br>
but I cannot give you the reference to it right now.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: All right.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: But he is one of the authors in that field. However,
the <br>
work I was referring to more particularly was done by Watt (?)
and <br>
Breyer-Brandwijh, which [sic] I believe is the co-author of the
publication <br>
on poisonous plants in South Africa.<br>
I have had correspondence with Watt along that line.<br>
<br>
91<br>
<br>
He refers to it in the last paragraph there after South Africa. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The reason I ask you that question is because of Dr.
<br>
Bromberg's remarks, which I interpreted as being indicative of
the <br>
production of a hypersensitivity. Am I wrong in that, Dr.
Bromberg? <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: A hypersensitivity?<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: On the part of an individual who uses Marihuana;
that <br>
is, an increased agility.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: The effects I refer to are on a motor activity. You
<br>
refer to those, I presume? <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: By which we mean the promptness to move either <br>
aimlessly or purposefully; that is, in acute intoxication the
smoker is apt <br>
to dance around and move or wave his arms, or go through
movements that <br>
are more rapid than he would move ordinarily; move his chair,
knock it <br>
across the room, talk to people, show a general output of
activity. <br>
<br>
Many of those prisoners whom I have contacted state that they <br>
rather slow up or would rather be quiet during this period. There
are two <br>
effects, in other words.<br>
<br>
The hyperactivity is not universal. The great, ex-<br>
<br>
92<br>
<br>
treme activity results in assault, throwing people around. This
is similar <br>
to what you see in certain types of alcohol intoxication,
so-called <br>
pathological intoxication, where a few drinks set a man off into
a <br>
rampage, breaking things, throwing things around, and fighting. <br>
I think maybe men come in on that more than women because of the <br>
basic physiological pattern. They are more active anyhow. This
refers to <br>
women, does it not? <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: Certainly the effects are not uniform and cannot be
<br>
counterbalanced.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, regarding these 31 admissions <br>
out of 100,000, I think it would be interesting to know just what
period <br>
they cover. Are they of recent origin, or are they scattered
pretty well <br>
throughout the years?<br>
The reason that I bring that up is that the mental hospital at
Burma <br>
showed, with the increased illicit traffic in Marihuana, the
total <br>
admissions of insanity cases rose from .87 to 4.35%. I am
wondering <br>
whether we can expect an increase in such cases, and also whether
these <br>
31 cases are more or less of recent origin.<br>
<br>
93<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: I can answer that by saying that the admissions <br>
already in the past four years of this type of Marihuana insanity
is almost <br>
twice that which it was during the first four years of our
observation, <br>
that is, three years of our observation period.<br>
Of course, you can realize that many other cases go to private <br>
hospitals which pass off without regulatory medical treatment,
and there <br>
are other factors so great that I would not put much reliance on
these <br>
figures. I merely give them to you as true data so far as we have
available.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have been getting some reports from <br>
various sections of the country showing cases of alleged insanity
due to <br>
Marihuana which have been brought to light.<br>
For instance, there were interesting developments in a case in <br>
Findlay, Ohio, concerning a fifteen-year-old boy who showed signs
of <br>
being insane.<br>
When asked about his condition he made statements that he had
been <br>
smoking cigarettes, and an investigation developed the
information that <br>
there were two defendants, who were brothers, who were in charge
of a <br>
playground, and they had been selling drugs that is, Marihuana
cigarettes, <br>
to boys around there; and we found about sixteen pounds concealed
above a <br>
garage owned by them. These fellows had<br>
<br>
94<br>
<br>
stopped selling the drug, because they noticed signs of the boys
acting <br>
queer, and they became frightened. They were particularly alarmed
<br>
because of what they thought was an unusual appetite for the
drug. <br>
We have a questionnaire whereby we ask Marihuana users involved
in <br>
our cases, all sorts of questions. As a matter of fact, I would
like now to <br>
revise that questionnaire, after what I have heard here.<br>
One-fourth of those users when asked what effect the drug has on <br>
them, say, &quot;It gives me a good appetite.&quot; &quot;The
first cigarette makes me <br>
feel hungry.&quot; They become hungry after they smoke, have a
heavy and <br>
exceptionally good appetite. That is their answer without
prompting. Yet <br>
that question does not appear in the questionnaire.<br>
We ask them --- of course, we have to take their word for what
they <br>
say --- whether they notice any permanent physical or mental
effects, and <br>
they make statements which confirm the opinions of Dr. Munch and
Dr. <br>
Bromberg. The answers are:<br>
&quot;I believe it has affected my nerves.&quot;<br>
&quot;I can not keep my mind on one thing long enough to think
clearly.&quot;<br>
&quot;Loss of memory&quot;; &quot;Very bad on nerves&quot;;
&quot;Produces twisted thoughts&quot;; <br>
&quot;Affects my brain&quot;; &quot;Dulls my head.&quot;<br>
<br>
95<br>
<br>
&quot;Causes me to become deaf&quot;.<br>
&quot;I think IÔm more intelligent.&quot;<br>
&quot;Makes me tired&quot;. &quot;Hard to think&quot;
&quot;Headache and weakness&quot;. <br>
&quot;Seemingly dulls senses&quot;; and so on. <br>
Then the question is asked: &quot;What effects do you obtain from
<br>
smoking Marihuana?&quot; I think most of the answers confirm what
has been <br>
said about the distortion of space, time, vision and hearing. <br>
The auditory sensibilities are affected.<br>
We are running into a great deal of cases which have to do with <br>
illicit traffic among musicians.<br>
The next question is, &quot;Have you acquired tolerance?&quot;
Quite a number <br>
of the users have developed a craving for Marihuana. Some of them
stop <br>
after smoking few cigarettes, and there is no sign here that they
increase <br>
the number that they smoke in a day.<br>
Some of them vary between one cigarette and twenty cigarettes a <br>
day. Others have smoked it once; some have smoked it for ten
years. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I was wondering whether it would not be better, <br>
unless there are other specific questions, to postpone this
portion of the <br>
Conference, which relates to bio-assay, which pertains to a
chemist, <br>
because all of those questions are related, and go on with the
rest of<br>
<br>
96<br>
<br>
the program.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: All right, unless there are questions. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, do you wish to say some thing?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Among other things, I have tried Marihuana's action on
a <br>
monkey, and I went to it with great hopes because I thought
really that the <br>
psychic action would come out in this patient.<br>
The observations were that the monkey reacts like the dog, and is
<br>
one more of the few laboratory species which really show the
ataxia <br>
action.<br>
The other observation was that the monkey required higher doses
per <br>
kilogram body weight than the dog, which was somewhat unexpected,
and <br>
that all of the lower doses to which I have climbed up through
the ratio of <br>
higher doses did not show anything which indicated a psychic
action. <br>
The monkeys do not show this type of abnormality which occurs in <br>
Dr. Bromberg's material.<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What is the relation in the dosage per kilogram of <br>
weight of dog and human being?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: The dog dosage per kilogram of weight and the human <br>
being per kilogram of weight, are fairly<br>
<br>
97<br>
<br>
close. The higher doses used in humans are capable of showing the
<br>
slightest ataxia symptoms, which would point to the fact that the
dosage <br>
is almost the same.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: This ataxia is never apparent in humans at all? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: I have no experience; I never saw it. <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: I never saw it either.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Have you any observations about ataxia symptoms <br>
comparable to those in dogs as to humans?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: No; but I have never seen a large enough quantity, <br>
certainly not the tincture or the fluid extract.<br>
<br>
Dr. Munch can perhaps answer that.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: I have given doses up to twice that re-cognized, but I
have <br>
not noticed ataxia in students.<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: There is one factor which, of course, is important,
and it <br>
is a fact which we notice from tobacco smoking, and that is that
the <br>
dosage in the form of the cigarette is probably high enough to
produce <br>
great ataxic symptoms in humans by way of the administration of
inhala-<br>
tion.<br>
<br>
DR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Dr. Bromberg, clinically,
whether <br>
there is a direct physiological addiction to this; that is, are
withdrawal <br>
symptoms produced or do<br>
<br>
98<br>
<br>
you think it is purely a psychic addiction?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: My idea of habituation on this matter is different,
and <br>
there happen to be several, and we should have the thing
clarified. <br>
Habituation must rest on three cases, two of them being habit <br>
forming.<br>
The first are the symptoms appearing of withdrawal of the habit <br>
forming drug.<br>
The second is that the patient develops tolerance. <br>
The third is that because he needs more drug he gets the pleasure
of <br>
addiction, and all medicine agrees that there must be withdrawal.
<br>
A morphine addict becomes intolerant of withdrawal. He has <br>
abdominal pains and various symptoms. When morphine is given he
feels <br>
better. And that is the basis of a well known treatment.<br>
Secondly, there are the people who take increasing doses to feel <br>
well. Those two are well acknowledged criteria.<br>
In the New York County jail, the physician in charge thinks he
sees <br>
withdrawal symptoms, but the offenders are not allowed to discuss
the <br>
offense with anyone except counsel. They say they did smoke it,
or they <br>
did not. You do not know whether the symptoms are tied up with
the<br>
<br>
99<br>
<br>
drug.<br>
<br>
So, I dare say that there are no clear withdrawal symptoms. The <br>
thing is not settled. Patients come in after being cut off
without the drug.<br>
The third is addiction of pleasure-loving, and in that category
comes <br>
smoking and colorful music and things of that nature. You can say
that one <br>
has to have pleasure after he becomes addicted to luxury, and
that can be <br>
looked upon as a valid psychiatric observation.<br>
So I would stop there and say that we can say that in the absence
of <br>
other evidence, that it is essentially hedonistic addiction.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, you mentioned in your experiment on dogs <br>
that you had injected some of these extracts, but, nevertheless,
in most of <br>
the experiments that had been previously done, I gather, the drug
had been <br>
taken orally. Of course, we know the stuff is smoked.<br>
Your introduction of injection as a method of administration
raises <br>
the question in my mind as to whether we might, at some future
date, <br>
anticipate the use of that on humans, in this way? Is there any
possibility <br>
of this sort? Similar to that which obtains in heroin, for
example? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Only after the isolation in pure form<br>
<br>
100<br>
<br>
I would say, because, at the present time, by use. of the
extracts it <br>
will not be an element in the whole picture to introduce it by
intravenous <br>
injection. It has to be injected in alcohol solution, and a
slight injection <br>
introduces a bad local infection, pain, and so on.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Why were you impelled to use it as an injection as a
<br>
method of administration, rather than giving it to your dogs
orally, Dr. <br>
Loewe?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: It goes faster. In view of the long period of latency,
it is <br>
much more convenient to use it intravenously injected, because
the peak <br>
of the curve is reached sooner.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Would you conclude from that that on dogs, for <br>
example, as a medium for standardization, that they are not as
radically <br>
different when the stuff is in-jected as compared to when it is <br>
administered orally?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Probably that is true, but only to an inconsiderable <br>
extent. In a slighter extent the variations have been reported by
various <br>
examinators [sic] after oral administration.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Will you recommend it as the preferred procedure for
<br>
bio-assay.<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: I am not sure that I should give the preference to the
<br>
intravenous way. I have to collect more<br>
<br>
101<br>
<br>
experiences.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Are the effects otherwise identical? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Identical.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The curve is more rapid; I mean you achieve the peak
of <br>
the curve more rapidly. <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Comparatively more rapidly. Beginning after only
twenty <br>
minutes, and reaching the peak after half an hour or an hour. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Your experiments with mice were continued under the <br>
same circumstances?<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: No. As to mice, they were injected orally only.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We can now go on to the sociological <br>
phases.<br>
In 88 users there were 86 males and only 2 females. I do not know
if <br>
that holds true generally. We might have got off the rails on the
selection, <br>
but that is what those figures show.<br>
There were 47 white, 20 colored, 15 Latin Americans. The age, of <br>
course, is much younger than among opium users. Most of the users
were <br>
between 17 and 35. The greatest number was between 21 and 25. <br>
I believe that was true of a survey made in New York City of the <br>
users.<br>
<br>
102<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We had 100 arrests there between January 1st and <br>
October 1st that ran: 99 Negro, 60 white, and 1 yellow; and the
nativity, <br>
(and this nativity includes New York City and up-state New York:)
5 <br>
Mexican, 1 Chinese, 32 Puerto Rican, 2 Greek:, some from South
America, <br>
Cuba, Panama, and other places with 130 native born.<br>
Then, in addition, I have 12 other cases, which to me were more <br>
interesting, because those persons who were held for crimes other
than <br>
possession, and they ran such as unlawful entry, 3 for grand
larceny, in <br>
addition to their possession; 1 for grand larceny, who admits he
is a user.<br>
Of course, the other possessor cases probably were users, but
they <br>
are charged with possession. One with felonious assault with a
pistol and <br>
possession; One, exposure of person; one felonious assault, both
users; and <br>
another, felonious assault with possession; and one a wayward
minor who <br>
admits, in addition to using Marihuana, that he is using heroin;
one with <br>
assault and robbery, and one who was a policy peddler. They were
held on <br>
other charges, rather than on mere possession charges.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What is the distribution in sexes, there, Mr. Smith?
<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I have not the age nor sex distribution on those.<br>
<br>
103<br>
<br>
In at least four cases up-state we can show a definite connection
<br>
with prostitution. In one we had a good report, not proven, but a
good <br>
report that the Negro who was in possession was also running a
school, <br>
teaching youngsters how to smoke Marihuana. Actually, we are not
certain <br>
about the facts as to that, but that is the report that has been
current <br>
with that individual. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Do you have anything on occupations <br>
of the users? <br>
MR. SMITH: We have four as musicians, two as farmers, and those <br>
two farmers were actually growing Marihuana on their farms. <br>
Many of them state &quot;unemployed&quot;. But where most of
those that <br>
report unemployed are laborers, they usually are associated with <br>
prostitution, policy, and some of the allied types of minor grade
crimes.<br>
Prostitution, to me, seemed the most evident connection.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our 88, the occupation runs anywhere <br>
from bartender to unemployed. There are probably 50 different <br>
occupations, musicians are second to laborers,-of the 88.<br>
<br>
The rest were distributed throughout the various<br>
<br>
104<br>
<br>
occupations.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I can give you a breakdown on that section. I have it
here <br>
in another portion of my data.<br>
There were 5 women arrested as sellers, and 8 women arrested for <br>
possession, and 147 males arrested for possession, and 7 for
selling. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: About 10 per cent. <br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our geographical distribution, we show
<br>
the larger number of these around New York; a few in the New
England <br>
areas; a few in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, several in the
Middle <br>
Atlantic States, about 5 in the South, Kentucky and Tennessee,
four; <br>
Michigan-Ohio, 13, Michigan-Ohio is second to New York.<br>
And then they string out through the rest of the States, with <br>
California probably third.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: In States with equal population ratios, as to the <br>
metropolitan district, as against up-state New York, our arrests
for <br>
Marihuana violations in the State, excluding New York City, are
about 10 <br>
per cent; 15 cases, actually, against 160.<br>
They probably will vary, though, as to the development of <br>
prosecution and apprehension, as in the various up-state cities
they are <br>
just beginning to realize in the<br>
<br>
105<br>
<br>
last year that Marihuana is a problem, and the figures for 1938
will be <br>
higher than 1937. I expect 1939 will again be higher in up-state
New York, <br>
so that that ratio of about 10 percent should rise.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Bromberg, you were about to start on <br>
the sociological phases. Will you give us the benefit of your
views on <br>
that?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: The material that I have collected comes from the <br>
Court of General Sessions. This is the criminal court of New York
City.<br>
Our material is limited to New York County, although it must be <br>
remembered that the courts clientele comes from many sections of
the <br>
country.<br>
We must also note that there are many racial types in our
material. <br>
This is important, because the British investigators have noted
in India <br>
that Cannabis does not bring out the motor excitement or
hysterical <br>
symptoms among Anglo-Saxon users that occurs among natives. There
are <br>
several other difficulties in selecting reliable material, one
being the <br>
dependence on statements from prisoners without opportunity for <br>
objective tests or other corroborative checks, as in the case of
other <br>
drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine.<br>
During the routine interviews of some 17,000 offend-<br>
<br>
106<br>
<br>
ers during six and a half years, we have come across several
hundred who <br>
have had direct experience with Cannabis. Their testimony checks
with <br>
experimental results and clinical experiences in regard to <br>
symptomatology of intoxication, the absence of true addiction,
and the <br>
negative connection with major crime. Especially is this
noteworthy <br>
among sexual offenders, and in cases of assault or murder.<br>
The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press, that <br>
crime is caused by Marihuana addiction, demand careful scrutiny. <br>
The cases analyzed in this study cover a period of more than six <br>
years, from 1932 to 1938. Out of over 16,000 prisoners in this
six-year <br>
period, 200 offenders were convicted of drug charges or found to
be users <br>
of drugs, although convicted of other charges, in the Court of
General <br>
Sessions.<br>
Cases of possession for sale are handled in the Court of General <br>
Sessions which has jurisdiction over felonies. There is no
distinction <br>
made in the indictment in the Court of General Sessions as to the
nature <br>
of the drug sold.<br>
<br>
Of this group of 200 drug offenders, 67 were indicated to be
users of <br>
Marihuana in any degree and for any duration of time whether
convicted of <br>
the crime of selling Marihuana or another crime.<br>
<br>
107<br>
<br>
The remaining 133 offenders were morphine or heroin users.<br>
It is important to note that the only measure of Marihuana usage
is <br>
the statement of the offender. Since statements of use are
conceived by <br>
them to be prejudicial to their interests in court, we meet
evasion and <br>
denial fairly consistently.<br>
Our most reliable source of information is from those not
arrested <br>
for traffic in drugs and questioned in the routine course of
psychiatric <br>
study.<br>
Now, this leaves out thousands of smokers who were never
arrested, <br>
people who were never arrested, and people that we deal with who
were <br>
arrested for major crimes, including the one of selling drugs.
Those people <br>
were all questioned about Marihuana.<br>
Those who were arrested for selling drugs, specifically
Marihuana, <br>
were questioned as to the use of it. Some of those admitted using
it, and <br>
some did not.<br>
All the criminological material that we have has to be taken with
a <br>
very large dose of salt, and they are either convicted by the
time we see <br>
them, or about to be, and are still frightened, and want to keep
their fair <br>
records clean.<br>
The only useful record which we have in which we can<br>
<br>
108<br>
<br>
throw out and include material as it sounds reasonable to us, and
it is <br>
checked, so far as the use of the sociological aspects of it, and
the effect <br>
of it, and so forth, so that in the General Sessions of Criminal
Court the <br>
87 cases of Marihuana users consisted of 21 whites (native born
and <br>
European extraction), 23 Negroes, 20 Puerto Ricans (some of whom
are <br>
considered to be racial mixtures), 2 Mexicans, and one Negro and
Indian <br>
mixture.<br>
Of the 67 studied, 46 were convicted of possession and sale of <br>
drugs, and 21 other charges. Among the 21 cases convicted of
crimes other <br>
than the possession of and sale of drugs, were eight charges of
burglary, <br>
five of grand larceny, three of robbery, two of assault, one each
of petit <br>
larceny, forgery, and first degree murder, and none of sexual
offenses. <br>
Burglary, grand larceny, and robbery, then, account for 16 of the
21 cases. <br>
There were but two sex cases of any description in the history of
the <br>
Marihuana cases, in both of which sodomy occurred as previous
offenses. <br>
In three cases, the individuals were what might be called
constant users <br>
of Marihuana. One of these had commenced to use the Marihuana
three <br>
years previous to the current conviction; another, with a sixteen
year <br>
record, indicated Marihuana, had been used for fifteen years; the
third <br>
referred to his use of Marihuana as<br>
<br>
109<br>
<br>
&quot;several yearsÓ duration. None of the offenders reported
any lasting <br>
effects from Marihuana. Interrogations as to the habit-forming
nature of <br>
Marihuana were all answered in the negative by the prisoners. <br>
So that in the General Sessions of Criminal Court the 67 people
who <br>
were offenders were involved in selling Marihuana or gave some
history of <br>
using it. Most of those people had previous charges, not
including drugs, as <br>
to being criminals of other types. The largest proportion were
not drug <br>
users.<br>
The next largest number had no previous connection with the 67. <br>
Fifty had never been arrested for taking any drugs. This was
their first <br>
contact with the court. These were all special cases in the
Special <br>
Sessions Court, which deals with misdemeanors and other cases. <br>
Here, there were 202 cases. Thirteen were there on the first
charge <br>
of any kind, that being a Marihuana charge. Those things do not
mean very <br>
much to me, as they simply give a certain picture, a picture of
people <br>
being picked up and brought in for using Marihuana, and there is
not a very <br>
heavy weighted criminal record behind them. Drug users are not
Marihuana <br>
users in the main.<br>
In the Court of Special Sessions in the same picture, in the same
<br>
six-year period, of approximately 75,000 in-<br>
<br>
110<br>
<br>
dictments for all crimes, there were 6,000 convictions for
possession and <br>
use of drugs. Since neither the law, the district attorney, nor
the police <br>
department make any distinction between the several kinds of
narcotics, <br>
their arraignments or indictments, in Special Sessions as well as
General <br>
Sessions, there were no figures from which to estimate the number
of <br>
Marihuana users as distinguished from the number of users of
other drugs. <br>
We therefore adopted a system of sampling the 6,000 cases in
order to <br>
arrive at an approximate estimation of the total number of
Marihuana users <br>
who came into conflict with the law. In this sampling, we
examined the <br>
records of l,500 cases, or 25 per cent of the total of 6,000. Of
these, 135 <br>
were Marihuana charges. From this, it was estimated that about
540 cases, <br>
or 9 per cent of all drug cases coming to Special Sessions over a
period of <br>
six years, were users of Marihuana. <br>
Analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found that 93 had no <br>
previous record; 8 had a previous drug charge or charges, only; 5
had <br>
previous charges, including drugs; and 29 had records not
including drug <br>
charges. Among those with longer records, that is, from four to
seven <br>
previous arrests, none showed progression in crime from drugs to
other <br>
crimes.<br>
<br>
111<br>
<br>
In considering all the Marihuana cases in both General Sessions <br>
and Special Sessions Courts, a total of 202 convictions, it is an
impressive <br>
fact that only 30 offenders had been arrested before for drug
charges. This <br>
does not argue very strongly for Marihuana as a drug that
initiates criminal <br>
careers. <br>
Where there is a series of crimes committed by one individual,
our <br>
records show that he passes from other forms of crime to the use
of drugs. <br>
Thus, in only three cases out of our series of 67, in which an
arrest <br>
associated with Marihuana was recorded, did the criminal career
start with <br>
the use of Marihuana, and in 7 cases out of 67 criminal activity
started <br>
with other drugs. Ninety per cent of the group is accounted for
by those who <br>
(1) have no criminal record except as drug users, and (2) have a
previous <br>
record from which they turned to drugs This leaves a small
minority of <br>
offenders whose criminal careers started with drugs and went on
to other <br>
crimes like larceny, assault, and so on. As measured by the
succession of <br>
arrests and convictions in the General Sessions cases (our only
method of <br>
estimation), it can be said that drugs generally do not initiate
criminal <br>
careers. Similarly, in Special Sessions, only 8 had previous
charges of <br>
drugs, and 3.7 per cent has previous charges of drugs and other <br>
<br>
112<br>
<br>
petty crimes. In the vast majority of cases in this group of 135,
then, <br>
earlier usage did not apparently predispose these offenders to
crime, even <br>
that of drug usage. Whether the first offender Marihuana cases go
on to <br>
major crime can only be ascertained by referring to the findings
of the <br>
General Sessions Courts. The expectancy of major crimes following
the use <br>
of Cannabis, then, is small, according to our experiences<br>
The problem of habituation of Cannabis is one of grave importance
<br>
According to the statements of confirmed heroin or morphine
addicts, <br>
Marihuana is not a habit-forming drug. Naturally, where it is
used in <br>
conjunction with heroin, morphine or cocaine another problem
presents <br>
itself.<br>
Occasionally, an astute drug peddler will adulterate Marihuana <br>
cigarettes with morphine or heroin in order to retain his
clientele. Care <br>
must be exercised in evaluating the question of Marihuana
habituation, so <br>
that we are not dealing with this type of adulterated Cannabis. <br>
<br>
The medical diagnosis of habituation depends on the accepted
criteria <br>
of acquired tolerance and after-effect upon withdrawal of the
drug. <br>
Regarding the subject of tolerance, users of Marihuana examined
in the <br>
clinic universally state that an increase in dosage is not neces-
<br>
<br>
113<br>
<br>
sary to achieve the desired effect as time goes on.<br>
The increase in cigarette consumption, sometimes noted, is simply
<br>
related to how often and how long the smoker wants to experience
these <br>
effects.<br>
As to the question of withdrawal symptoms, cases have never, to
the <br>
knowledge of the writer, been observed systematically in an
environment <br>
where control of the drug can be exercised. Although of secondary
value in <br>
deciding the problem of habituation, it should be noticed that
experience <br>
with experimental subjects indicates that after usage of the drug
and its <br>
cessation no withdrawal symptoms are reported.<br>
<br>
It has not been possible to observe satisfactorily Marihuana
users <br>
upon their entrance into custody to establish their behavior
after cessation <br>
of usage. For one thing, the law does not allow questioning of a
defendant <br>
prior to trial regarding his charge. The history of the offense
cannot be <br>
discussed except with counsel, but an offender can be questioned
in the <br>
course of medical treatment. The fact that Marihuana cases do not
request <br>
medical treatment upon their incarceration argues for the absence
of <br>
withdrawal symptoms.<br>
As is well known, morphine, opium, etc., users become violently
ill <br>
upon being taken in custody, away from the<br>
<br>
114<br>
<br>
source of their drug, and are vociferous in their demands for
treatment.<br>
Nevertheless, the wide discrepancies between the reports of other
<br>
jurisdictions and ours in the question of addiction to Cannabis
demands a <br>
serious attempt to establish the facts in the case.<br>
Up to March 26, 1938, Cannabis was classed as a habit-forming
drug <br>
in Section 1751 of the Penal Code, based on Public Health Law,
Article 22, <br>
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. Due to difficulty in this Court in
proving it to <br>
be a habit-forming drug (case of People vs. Williams), the Law
Revision <br>
Commission, appointed by the New York State Legislature, was
requested <br>
to amend the Penal Code to read &quot;narcotic&quot; rather than
&quot;habit-forming&quot; <br>
drug.<br>
From a legal point of view, therefore, the problem of whether it
is <br>
habit-forming or not is not vital in this and many other States,
since its <br>
use as a narcotic by un-authorized persons is an offense.<br>
The writer believes it highly desirable and important that a <br>
Commission be appointed to examine the matter scientifically as
was <br>
done in the case of narcosan and other reputed drug cures in 1921
at the <br>
Bellevue Psychopathic Hospital under Commissioner Patterson of
the <br>
Department of Correction.<br>
<br>
115<br>
<br>
The most that one can say on the basis of ascertainable facts is
that <br>
prolonged Marihuana usage constitutes a &quot;sensual&quot;
addiction, in that the <br>
user wishes to experience again and again the ecstatic sensations
and <br>
feelings which the drug produces. <br>
Unlike morphine addiction, which is biochemically as well as <br>
psychologically determined, prolonged Marihuana usage is
essentially in the <br>
services of the hedonistic elements of the personality. <br>
Those are the main conclusions I have developed from that.<br>
Then we took the cases of the Marihuana users and tried to break <br>
those down. It indicates that no murderers were found among this
group of <br>
67, not one murder committed in these six or seven years by a
Marihuana <br>
user.<br>
There were no sex cases among these 67. We have, however, seven <br>
hundred odd sex cases, from first degree rape down to
exhibitionism, and in <br>
the course of the six or seven years not one of them was a
Marihuana user, <br>
according to history or physical examination.<br>
At the time of our examination, two of them had sex cases in
their <br>
history some years before. One was sodomy, and the other some
other type <br>
of offense.<br>
Of all of these people, only three called themselves<br>
<br>
116<br>
<br>
constant users. One for three years and twelve months, and the
others <br>
nine months.<br>
There is one other point which I would like to mention and that
is <br>
the case of a man named Joseph Ogden who is reported among others
in Mr. <br>
Merrill's paper as having been an addict.<br>
I saw him and spent some time with him. He was a psychopathic <br>
individual. I think he had been in the State hospital at
Lexington, and had <br>
had several other arrests. But nothing in his history indicated
Marihuana. <br>
In other words, the newspaper accounts must be discounted. The
fact of <br>
the matter was that he had not even been a drug addict, but was a
<br>
homosexualist. The offender was murdered by him and shoved into a
trunk. <br>
I do not know whether he disarticulated his arms or not, but he
sent the <br>
trunk to the express station, and they saw blood oozing out of
it, and <br>
picked him up.<br>
He told the story rather frankly. It was a horrible crime. I
think <br>
Marihuana was innocent of that. I am sure of that, because I have
been able <br>
to check that very carefully.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have observed two cases of sex <br>
crimes where we have been able to prove the connection with
Marihuana. <br>
<br>
117<br>
<br>
A boy named Perez, in Baltimore raped a ten-year-old girl, and of
<br>
course he blamed it on Marihuana.<br>
It so happened that, just a year before that, Perez had been
picked up <br>
by the Baltimore police for the sale of 2,500 grains of Cannabis,
and got <br>
three months in jail. This sex offense happened the following
year.<br>
And there is another case down in Corpus Christi that we have
been <br>
able to establish, where an oil worker with a good reputation,
obtained and <br>
smoked a cigarette, after which he raped his young daughter.<br>
Those are two cases that I know of in which we have proof.<br>
In the case of Perez, we do not know what else might have been
wrong <br>
with him, but he was definitely a user and a seller of Marihuana.
<br>
I believe that Mr. Smith has had a great deal of experience up
through <br>
New York State.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We have had one case in the last two or three months, <br>
which has been of great interest to the Motor Vehicle Department.
A <br>
youngster in Mount Kisco, close to New York City, was involved in
an <br>
automobile accident in that village by hitting three parked cars
during the <br>
evening. When he was apprehended by the police, he literally tore
the <br>
officer's blouse from his shoulder,<br>
<br>
118<br>
<br>
and he had great difficulty in subduing him. <br>
During the evening, they first thought it was alcohol, but later
the <br>
youngster admitted having used a &quot;reefer&quot;. From the
information we <br>
obtained from him, we apprehended an individual who was growing
it, and I <br>
think we picked up about six pounds. <br>
We had another case farther up-state, not as well established,
but <br>
apparently pretty well shown, of the inability of the automobile
driver to <br>
perceive distance and speed. <br>
So that factor will be of considerable interest to those
interested in <br>
traffic control. <br>
Because of that recent case in White Plains, we have had some
inquiry <br>
from the State Motor Vehicle Department, and they arc
considering, I <br>
believe, the advisability of revoking the licenses of operators
who can be <br>
shown to be users of Marihuana, in the same fashion that we are
now able <br>
to do after showing evidence of narcotism. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that in your State law now?<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: No, sir, it is not in our State law now.<br>
In fact, I do not know if it was decided that we could get away
with <br>
it, but through the Motor Vehicle Department we could, as one of
the <br>
requirements in the matter of<br>
<br>
119<br>
<br>
ability on the questionnaire in New York up-state you have to
state whether <br>
or not you use narcotic drugs.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Marihuana users, when arrested, want to <br>
fight.<br>
Their motor impulses seem to be working It takes, sometimes, four
or <br>
five officers to subdue a man, and they sometimes wreck the
living <br>
quarters in doing so.<br>
We do not have anything like that in arresting opium users.<br>
The agents proceed very cautiously when arresting a Marihuana
user.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: It conflicts with alcohol which seem to be the worst
cases <br>
yet, and we have had a few cases who used both. Those are perhaps
the few <br>
that you have run across. Then, of course, we have those who have
just been <br>
on the reefer alone.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER, I have noticed a tendency towards more <br>
gunplay among Marihuana users than among opium users.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Than among opium users?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes. And there has been some gun play. <br>
The first case that we arrested under the Marihuana Act, (I
happened <br>
to have been present in the Denver court<br>
<br>
120<br>
<br>
when they brought this fellow up before the judge.) had been a
user for a <br>
number of years. He was only 23 years old, but many of his
arrests were for <br>
assault.<br>
I have noticed that many of these violators have a record of
assault. <br>
In Wilmington, Delaware, there was the case of John Rhodes, who <br>
attacked an officer with a knife and was shot and killed
resisting arrest.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I have four out of twelve in one city where the
charges, in <br>
addition to possession, are assault.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In many cases, particularly around Ohio, <br>
the officers are called in cases of disturbance and they find a
Marihuana <br>
user with some stuff on him.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: A chap I talked to told me that the use of gin came in
very <br>
particularly with the use of a reefer. Is that true with opium?
Do Marihuana <br>
users tend to take gin along with smoking of the reefer?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not know about that. We have not run
<br>
into that.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: The point I am asking could be that the alcohol there
would <br>
tend to increase the solubility of any material that has been
swallowed, <br>
and, therefore, they would get greater effect under such
conditions than if <br>
they. had not taken the alcohol.<br>
<br>
121<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT One of the Internal Revenue officials, formerly in <br>
Texas, has told us that down there persons use alcohol and
Marihuana <br>
together, and where they were very wild it took four or five
officers to <br>
bring a man in. He attributed that to the combined effect rather
than the <br>
effect of either one.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Still, there is a good deal of fancy on the part of
some <br>
officers, whose experience with Marihuana is new.<br>
I have had some experience with one or two sheriffs. I know of
one <br>
who recently employed the services of two other sheriffs and four
deputy <br>
sheriffs to secure the arrest of a farmer on a farm where the
material was <br>
growing.<br>
Any youngster, 18 or 19 years old, could have gone there and done
it <br>
alone. This was because of the first experience of those officers
with it. I <br>
think the men were anxious to capitalize on the possible
publicity which <br>
might attend the arrest. So that sometimes you run up against
that problem, <br>
where they report that it is necessary for a number of them to
subdue an <br>
individual. That may be an effort to make it appear a more
serious type of <br>
crime.<br>
So that I think we have to put our tongues in our<br>
<br>
122<br>
<br>
cheeks as to this, also.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: This story came from Deputy Commissioner Berkshire,
<br>
of the Alcohol Tax Unit.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We did have in White Plains this additional situation:
The <br>
fact appeared there that with children of high school age with
good <br>
financial and social background, that two of those individuals,
who were in <br>
difficulties there, stated that the smoking of reefers had become
a part of <br>
the initiation in certain clubs or school fraternities.<br>
<br>
That probably is a little bit unusual, as an incident, but that
has been <br>
definitely reported in that vicinity. <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Where was that?<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: That was in White Plains, New York.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Did you not arrest a youngster sixteen <br>
years old for selling?<br>
<br>
Mr.. SMITH: Yes, sir. There were two youngsters of excellent <br>
background, and fine social connections. That was probably a
larger factor, <br>
as compared to anything else, I think, and that was that they
probably had <br>
too much financial and social backing. That may be more true in
that <br>
particular county than in other counties in that State.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You mentioned a case of a<br>
<br>
123<br>
<br>
young man using Marihuana and heroin.<br>
<br>
MR. WITH: Yes, sir. That was in New York City. <br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What had he used first, do you know?<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I do not know. That, I extracted from the Police <br>
Department records last Tuesday, but I did .not have time to go
back and get <br>
the individual cards, and I doubt very much whether the
information which <br>
appears in the police cards will show that.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have not run into many peddlers of <br>
heroin who also handle Marihuana, and we have not run into many
users of <br>
Marihuana who are also heroin users. However, as Dr. Bouquet
points out, in <br>
Tunis there is a tendency to switch from Marihuana to heroin. <br>
Have you run into any cases like that, Doctor? <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: I have seen many drug addicts, who have, once or <br>
twice, they say, tried Marihuana, and have dropped it, because it
was not <br>
strong enough. Most true addicts start with heroin or opium.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Do you not think that that might be more the
association <br>
with individuals than the association with the drug?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: Perhaps. And there is one other fact, and that is
that <br>
alcohol and Marihuana have a more potent<br>
<br>
124<br>
<br>
effect than alcohol alone.<br>
I had a case where a man started smoking Marihuana. The seller <br>
introduced heroin, he noticed the effect, and he became a user,
but, of <br>
course, that was not through any choice.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: As to this question of using alcohol with
<br>
Marihuana, I recall a case in Indiana where a man was arrested
who had an <br>
infusion of the drug in alcohol. How do they do that? Drink it
and smoke a <br>
cigarette?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: No. I think it is a sociological matter. He uses
the gin <br>
with it, or otherwise, and it depends on the amount of money and
the <br>
locality, and they smoke, and it represents having some fun, the
effect <br>
which they look for.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I wonder how much can be deduced from the present <br>
figures in the matter of crime, in view of the fact that these
figures <br>
represent a static picture whereas the entire Marihuana picture,
so far as I <br>
know, is on an up-curve.<br>
Have you noticed any tendencies that are not static over a period
of <br>
years Dr. Bromberg?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: That is a very good question, because the alcohol
thing <br>
depends on the relationship between the two.<br>
<br>
125<br>
<br>
But I have been in contact with the court for about five years,
and the <br>
number of Marihuana peddlers has not increased, but the number of
<br>
Marihuana users we do not know about.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: In what order, would you say?<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: It is impossible to say. These are only
approximations, <br>
I admit. It all depends on the police activities.<br>
They make a drive, and the figures go up. They forget about it,
and <br>
there are no figures.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are there any questions as to this phase
of <br>
the problem?<br>
I must say that we are still sort of groping as to a lot of those
<br>
questions.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: May I intrude there, just as a matter of difference in
mind, <br>
as to any sort of figure representing the total number of users
of <br>
Marihuana? I mean, has anybody said anything as to the number of
heroine <br>
users being the same as the opium addicts, or less or more, or as
to the <br>
Marihuana?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is impossible to say. The eradication
of <br>
16,000 acres of Marihuana during the past year means nothing as
to <br>
numbers of users. We are sure it was never meant for the illicit
traffic. <br>
Probably<br>
<br>
126<br>
<br>
15,000 of the 16,000 acres was wild growth.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: You mean additional acreage than that which had <br>
humans on it?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have arrested over 1,000. The Bureau
of <br>
Prisons is a little concerned about that, because it is causing a
definite <br>
increase in their jails.<br>
Puerto Rico is starting to send a lot of these sellers and users
to jail, <br>
which they did not do before. There has been a tremendous
up-grade in <br>
apprehensions.<br>
I do not recall just what the arrests have been by states
throughout <br>
the country. These are Federal arrests. State arrests are
probably over that <br>
figure.<br>
I should say that the 16,000 acres represent only a drop in the
bucket, <br>
because I know in one State there are 300,000 acres of the wild
growth. We <br>
have a job here on eradication that is just stupendous.<br>
Fortunately, a lot of this acreage that is discovered we hear
about <br>
through people who do not tell anybody else about it.<br>
The illicit trafficker is looking for growth. I cannot understand
why <br>
the New York trafficker had to go out to Minnesota and strip some
of those <br>
hemp fields.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: We had two instances where the material was either <br>
reported to be, or actually was, of western<br>
<br>
127<br>
<br>
growth, and they were getting a higher price than was paid
apparently for <br>
New York grown. Whether that was bona fide, as to the material
from New <br>
York State, or as to the material from Minnesota, I do not know,
or whether <br>
it was a question of price boosting as to the New York sales
prices, we still <br>
do not know.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think within a couple of blocks from <br>
where Dr. Munch lives you can walk into as much [as] fifty acres
that has <br>
not been destroyed.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: They went over about 300 acres of that this year and
ran <br>
out of C.C.C. men and then stopped.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: That is a tremendous problem with us. We <br>
have used many of the agencies of the Government, the W.P.A. has
helped, <br>
and other agencies. We have discouraged all of these well-meaning
people <br>
throughout the country who want to use Boy Scouts in the removal
of' <br>
Marihuana.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: We have had considerable cooperation through Admiral <br>
Foote, and the Automobile Vehicle Department of our State.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: May I ask Dr. Bromberg whether or not his contacts
with <br>
these patients show whether or not there is any indication of
whether <br>
these cigarettes used were tobacco which had been adulterated
with <br>
Marihuana?<br>
<br>
128<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: My source of information is the Police Department,
and <br>
the cigarettes that they have gathered up are filled definitely
with <br>
Marihuana, and no other compound.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I would like to ask Dr. Bromberg, or anybody else who
has <br>
had experience as to the likelihood of development of perversion.
<br>
Has anybody had any experience on that?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Kolb, have you run into anything on <br>
that? <br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: No, sir. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How many of these users have you in <br>
Lexington?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: There are about one hundred patients who have used it <br>
occasionally, but they are mostly opium and heroin users. <br>
About twenty-five have used nothing but Marihuana alone. <br>
But, just as Dr. Bromberg has stated they use it occasionally,
just to <br>
see if it is another drug that they need.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are these Marihuana users, as such, a <br>
younger group than your opium smokers?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Most of the time.<br>
<br>
129<br>
<br>
For instance, we had a man from Puerto Rico, about fifty years
old, <br>
who had been a judge, and who said it was a political plot that
he should <br>
get four years. I do not know how politics came into it.<br>
He said, &quot;Well, they are trying to get rid of me.&quot;<br>
He never had any criminal record. That seemed to be a rather
strong <br>
sentence for users.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have noticed the tendency in Puerto <br>
Rico, even with heroin users, to give them five years for use
only.<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Yes, they give them a very severe sentence.<br>
The district attorney wrote me and wanted to take it up with
judge <br>
Cooper. I told him that, from the stand-point of rehabilitation,
it was a <br>
rather harmful matter to put a man in prison for four years. He
is liable to <br>
learn a lot of things in prison and then go out and hate society
and use them <br>
against society.<br>
It is my idea that users should get one year, and especially the
fellow <br>
who does not have a criminal record.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not think the courts here are being
too <br>
severe.<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB' No, they are not.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: They are giving the seller<br>
<br>
130<br>
<br>
a great deal more than the user, on the average. <br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Of course.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What does your investigation represent as to these <br>
twenty-five users of Marihuana alone, as compared to those who
use other <br>
drugs other than Marihuana?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Of course, we get them after they have stopped using
the <br>
drug, and after they have escaped the acute effects of the drugs,
There is <br>
only one psychiatric case, which we are not quite sure of, that
has been due <br>
to using the Marihuana drug.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I am going to ask an awfully unfair question.<br>
What percentage of these people would have been in jail if they
had <br>
not smoked Marihuana? <br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: Well, very few of them.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: They would hot have been in jail?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: That applies to a great many users of drugs.<br>
A great many of them have done other things, particularly
thievery, or <br>
other slippery types of work. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Are they slightly impaired?<br>
<br>
DR. KOLB: They are slightly impaired, partly due to the
psychiatric <br>
condition, and to the distress of needing the drug.<br>
<br>
131<br>
<br>
There are very few violent types of crime with the opium addict. <br>
Our experience with the Marihuana addicts is not enough to give
an <br>
answer. I rather think that with the alcoholic-Marihuana user,
that he <br>
would become a type of drug addict that would cause many crimes. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: There was a case in Canada, Mr.
Lancaster, <br>
there a Marihuana user had withdrawal symptoms similar to those
of an <br>
opium user.<br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Yes, sir. That was the boy who was picked up and
had <br>
used Marihuana for a long time. He was out of work, had no
continual <br>
employment.<br>
He tried to smoke Marihuana, rather liked it, and after several
months <br>
of usage, he was jailed, and kept there for about a week.<br>
His case was remanded, and he reported feeling tingling pains and
<br>
needles in the hands and feet, and he was greatly upset and
pleaded for a <br>
narcotic again. He was suffering with an imparity of that order.
I do not <br>
think it was tried to see whether giving him Marihuana should
relieve that <br>
case or not.<br>
The general impression is that there is no great suffering, and
if they <br>
are relieved from it after the first five days, naturally they
want it again, <br>
but they do<br>
<br>
132<br>
<br>
not break down if they do not get it.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Bromberg, have you come across any occasion of <br>
drinking Marihuana in the form of tea extract, or something of
that sort? <br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: No.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: Is there any evidence of it being used in Canada? On
any <br>
convictions, have you had any evidence of it ?<br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Not there, no. No, sir, so far there have been no <br>
samples submitted to us as yet.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: None that I know of.<br>
But I understand they do mix them, mix it with sweets, in
northern <br>
Africa.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: There have been one or two reports that they do mix it
in <br>
California.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: For your ears, I can tell you, Mr. Smith, that all
of the <br>
chemists are sitting on the edge of their seats, worrying about
that <br>
happening<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: And there is a question as to the toxic effects which
could <br>
be present.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: And there may not be any way in which we can examine
<br>
it. We are hoping that they do not guess that gasoline will
extract it.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Is it true that that is a common form<br>
<br>
133<br>
<br>
in the Far East?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: No, not in The Far East, but in the Near <br>
East. <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: In the Near East, yes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We seem to have covered the sociological <br>
phases, so far as we are able to and I am going to turn the choir
over, at <br>
this point, to Dr. Wollner, who will proceed with the chemical
phases. <br>
This is where most of the spade work has got to be done, anyway. <br>
<br>
STATEMENT OF MR.. H. J. WOLLNER, <br>
CONSULTING CHEMIST, TREASURY DEPARTMENT<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The problem is not yet resolved. We are not yet in a
<br>
position to know exactly what it is we are looking for, and,
within four <br>
walls, I am perfectly frank to admit that al]. the chemists I
have met, who <br>
are interested in this field, are at a complete loss when asked
to prophesy <br>
the character of the narcotic principle, which we are going to
eventually <br>
disclose.<br>
The situation is as bad in the chemical literature as it is in
all of the <br>
other phrases.<br>
I should certainly be within the reasonable bounds of correctness
<br>
when I say that ninety percent of the stuff that has been written
on the <br>
chemical end of Can-<br>
<br>
134<br>
<br>
nabis is absolutely wrong, and, of the other ten percent, at
least two-thirds <br>
of it is of no consequence.<br>
That ninety per cent has had, however, to be dealt with, and
chemists <br>
all over the world have been interested in Cannabis, and in the
past few <br>
years have spent a goodly portion of their time upsetting a lot
of this <br>
shibboleth and tradition which has been set up, probably a
thousand years, <br>
so as to clear the ground and to be able to proceed in a more
orderly <br>
fashion.<br>
<br>
In this work the evidence, by force of circumstance, compels us
to <br>
turn to the pharmacologist for guidance.<br>
<br>
As Dr. Loewe ably expressed before, since we have no test in the <br>
chemical laboratories for indicating the presence or absence of
the <br>
narcotic principle, every bit of the exploratory work of
consequence that <br>
has been engaged upon had to be paralleled with work in the field
of bio-<br>
assay.<br>
<br>
The chemical problem is so obvious that it does not require much <br>
delineation.<br>
<br>
Chemists, enforcement administrative chemists, are interested in <br>
two things. First, and immediately, they want to know how to find
and <br>
detect the presence of Cannabis sativa, or any of its products
that are <br>
narcotic in character.<br>
<br>
In other words, most enforcement officers will make<br>
<br>
135<br>
<br>
a seizure in some form, solid or liquid, and the question asked
is, &quot;Is this <br>
Marihuana?&quot; And no satisfactory technique for answering such
a question <br>
obtains today.<br>
That does not say that in most of the cases that come before the <br>
chemists they are not in a definite position to make a definite
statement, <br>
that before them the substance is definitely Cannabis sativa, but
they can <br>
not do it as definitely as in the case of morphine, opium, and
heroin.<br>
The second question they would like answered is,<br>
&quot;What is the narcotic principle, or what are the narcotic
principles <br>
present?&quot;<br>
That question is not one of enforcement so much as of general <br>
administration.<br>
The Commissioner of Narcotics has the problem of deciding, at
times, <br>
what regulations shall be invoked in respect to an industry or an
<br>
agricultural phase of this problem.<br>
The question arises, how long shall we have to wait before the
resin <br>
is decomposed, during the rotting process, for example, and the
only way I <br>
would know how to answer that question is to know how long that
principle <br>
will exist during that rotting exhibition. Of course, we do not
know. We can <br>
not answer that question.<br>
The question arises, can recommendations be made to<br>
<br>
<br>
136<br>
<br>
exempt the use of certain portions of the plant and certain
industrial <br>
directions, as far as governmental regulation is concerned, be
given by <br>
virtue of the fact that they are harmless. No statement can he
made on that <br>
score.<br>
So, it becomes important, from an administrative point of view,
for <br>
administrative chemists, associated with the carrying out of the
Marihuana <br>
Act, to have a more competent picture of the drug, as competent
as obtains <br>
at the present time in respect to the poppy and its secretion,
opium, and its <br>
products, morphine, heroin, codeine, and so on.<br>
This drug, peculiarly enough, has withstood competent attack for
an <br>
extensive period of time.<br>
Before the laws were passed controlling the opium picture,
chemists <br>
were able to supply a fairly excellent background, against which
such <br>
legislation and regulations might have been and were in fact
predicated. <br>
But, in the case of Marihuana, there is no such background. It is
just a <br>
fog; without question the psychiatrists and bioassayists and
agricultural <br>
people know far more about Cannabis than do the chemists.<br>
So far as knowing anything about the plant, today, is concerned,
all <br>
they can tell you is that such and such<br>
<br>
137<br>
<br>
a product is not a narcotic, such and such a product is
non-narcotic, and <br>
they are trying to shrink the residue further and further, but
they have not <br>
touched it.<br>
Of great assistance in clarifying the issue has been the work <br>
undertaken by Dr. Blatt, in reviewing the literature.<br>
Dr. Blatt has prepared a paper consisting of a critical review of
the <br>
literature on narcotics, published in the journal of the
Washington Academy <br>
of Sciences on the 15th of November. I have a number of copies of
the paper <br>
here, and also a chart setting forth the general character of the
critique, so <br>
that a person who is a technical man can get a picture of the
thing.<br>
I am going to ask that only these people who have a working <br>
knowledge of chemical symbology receive them, and we will try to
get <br>
enough copies to mail them out to you later.<br>
I am going to ask Dr. Blatt if he will be so kind as to offer a
picture of <br>
his survey as to the chemical constituents of Cannabis Sativa. <br>

<h1><a name="OLE_LINK1">STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. BLATT, </a></h1>

<p><b>HOWARD UNIVERSITY.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. BLATT: That will not take very long, because as Mr.
Wollner has said, we are only dealing with two thirds of ten
percent of the material. Very briefly, the story is, you can take
Cannabis and extract it with one of several solvents, or
combinations of solvents and obtain a physiologically active
extract. The only successful technique that has been applied to
that so far has been a distillation process, and through the
distillation you can get out of it three substances, which I will
simply name and pass on. <br>
One of them is a paraffin hydrocarbon known as nonacosane, that
is, physiologically, inactive. <br>
If you do a distillation, you get a definite distillate, and all
chemists who have worked with Cannabis know it as red oil.
Unfortunately, it also was known as Cannabinol, and that has been
the cause of much trouble. <br>
This red oil looks a good bit like a lubricating oil of a rather
poor quality, a semi-solid material at room temperature. That
material we will simply call narcotic-active by a physiological
test. The real nasty principle about the situation is that that
material behaves as if it were a chemical substance, and there
have been three different formulas proposed for it. <br>
One of the formulas has Cot so far as two individuals having
agreed upon it. Then the hitch comes. In about forty years, three
English workers succeeded in preparing and isolating one <br>
pure chemical substance from this red oil. <br>
They called that Cannabinol, and the one individual substance
derived from it is also called Cannabinol. For thirty years,
nobody following them was ever able to get this pure Cannabinol.<br>
So, we went ahead and worked with Cannabinol, and assumed that we
were working with the pure substance. Then, roughly about eight
years ago, the pure chemical individual, pure <br>
Cannabinol, again was secured for the second time, and apparently
it can be repeated.<br>
Pure Cannabinol is the fourth chemical substance to be gotten out
of Cannabis, and it is the fourth one to be lacking in narcotic
activity. It is toxic, however, and it is quite possible that
some of the activity of Cannabinol, some of this complex activity
that has been referred to during the morning, is due to pure
Cannabinol as a chemical individual.<br>
The chemical structure of pure Cannabinol has been fairly well
worked out. It is not definitely settled. We do not need to go
into that There is one more thing that should be pointed out, and
that is the fact that for thirty years perfectly competent
chemists have taken this red oil, distilled, and worked with it
as if a pure chemical. It not only gives analytical values of
resin, but they are <br>
even more complex. You can carry out the chemical reactions with
this. So, let us refer to red oil as the crude Cannabinol; and
the chemical individual as pure Cannabinol. You can run chemical
reactions. You can reduce an acetylate and the products you get
out are still analyzable for the proper derivatives of crude
Cannabinol. That is, where everybody has gone <br>
haywire.<br>
There is one ray of hope, and a pretty definite one, as to the
confusion of a mixture which was taken to be a definite chemical
substance, and that is why progress has been so slow, and that is
the fact that we have no way quantitatively of following the
definite reaction of the chemical principle.<br>
The one ray of hope I mention is the fact that you can take red
oil, crude Cannabinol, remove one-fourth, which is inactive as
pure Cannabinol, and the residual three-fourths still retains
chemical activity. There is where the work begins. That is as far
as has been gotten chemically. <br>
There is just one more point here. As far as I have been able to
find, and I received corroboration at noon, there not only is no
correlation, or no correlation has been made, so far as I can
find. out, between the various color reactions for Cannabis and
the narcotic activity, and I was told at noon that, not only had
there been none made, but it was because there definitely is
none. So we can not fail to follow the activity as to this color
test.<br>
I may be getting off in deep water, but that is the apparent
final analysis. There is one more thing, and that will finish it
up. <br>
I hope not many people will be misled by the principle that the
active principle of Cannabis is Cannabinol. You will find it even
there. The active fraction which you will find, which is more or
less of a mixture, is called Cannabinol.<br>
You can find a chemical substance which is not active. I think
that covers it.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I think that adds oils to the fire. <br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Is there an active substance there? <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I will take your word for it, and Bromberg's on the
basis of his research in New York It leads us pretty much to
where we started. I think if all the research work done so far
were dumped together by a group of chemists, or if they started
out today on this investigation, that they would be exactly the
same as they are now inside of six months; that is, all of the
information which we have, which is very little, could be
accumulated in six months. <br>
Recognizing that situation, the Treasury two years ago undertook
to lay the basis for a competent attack on the problem. We did
not know what that would consist of, but we knew sound,
fundamental, reproducible information and data had to be
obtained. <br>
The first thing we did was to contact the Department of
Agriculture, and with their cooperation, there was planted a plot
at Arlington Farms over here, last summer, and the summer before,
where the plant was observed in its various stages of growth, and
which furnished us all of the <br>
criteria the literature offered us in the past. As I mentioned
earlier, about ninety percent of all of it was thrown out. The
report of the first year's investigation was published in the
journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association. I have a
number of copies here, if there are any technical men who have
not soon that report. <br>
An equivalent report is being prepared at the present time on the
basis of this summer's work.<br>
We have obtained several tons of Marihuana. We have extracted or
are extracting huge quantities of that material, in an effort to
provide a satisfactory amount on the basis of which a <br>
broad attack on the problem may be predicated.<br>
Dr. Matchett is in charge of the Treasury's own immediate attack
on the problem, and I believe he has some information which he
can lay before you this afternoon. Is that correct, Dr. Matchett?

<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN R. MATCHETT, <br>
</h1>

<p><b>TREASURY DEPARTMENT. <br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. MATCHETT: The problem is clarified a little bit by
recognizing that there are two distinct phases involved, the
first of which must be pretty well finished before the second can
begin. <br>
First of all, there is the separation of the active principle
from other material, and second, the characterization of it.
Before a competent separation can be undertaken, we must be in
possession of suitable assay methods. <br>
We, of course, are interested in those manifestations of
Marihuana that lead to the effects, which have led in turn, to
the passage of the Act We are not sure, I take it, whether the
substance produces ataxia in the dog, or sleep in the mouse, or
corneal(?) anesthesia in the rabbit is the <br>
same as the one in which we are interested.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, something must be adopted, and by common consent, a
dog assay, with all its faults, has been the method of choice. It
seems obvious that these various principles, if more than one
exists, will be each characterized on its own merits.<br>
In considering this phase of it, also, it must not be forgotten
that any one of the effects may be combinations, and any of the
effects that we are able to measure may possibly be combined
effects, of which the bad effect of the drug itself may be only
one. <br>
With that so disposed of, it is possible to recognize that
certain characteristics of the so-called resin are fairly well
defined already, although I think we must recognize that the
resin itself is variable, and to what extent, we are not yet able
to say very definitely. As Dr. Blatt said, there have been
certain individuals isolated in pure form, of which the most
important are Cannabinol and the hydrocarbon nonacosame.<br>
There is also present definitely in the resin a substance that
responds to the alkaline Beam test.<br>
There are still other substances among all those responsible for
the psychological and physiological activity; of such there may
be one or more. <br>
<br>
And finally, there are those volatile oils, in which there is no
tremendous interest other than to dispose of them before being
able to isolate the drug.<br>
Now, little or nothing is known of the nature of the active
substance. All attacks on the problem have, thus far, broadly
speaking, produced negative results. The thing, in any event, is
not an alkaloid, because we are not able to extract it into acid
solutions from solvents, nor does it contain any nitrogen. It is
not an acid, since it does not extract into alkaline solution.
And it has not been shown to contain any carbonyl groups because
it does not form any derivatives with the common reagents for
such.<br>
</p>

<p>There is evidence on the other hand that it forms esters and
that it is an aromatic substance, the latter from the refractive
index of the most active fraction. From that it would appear to
be a phenolic compound. The substance is thermostable under
rather rigorous conditions, but it is <br>
quickly destroyed in the presence of oxygen. It is also quite
likely that it is unsaturated since reduction by hydrogen is
possible. <br>
But all those, unfortunately, are properties of the active
mixtures that Dr. Blatt referred to, rather than of any chemical
individual. They are all of some assistance though, in
considering methods by which the problem may be attacked.<br>
Now, only distillation in a rather high vacuum has been of any
assistance thus far in fractionating the mixture, known as
Cannabis resin. The volatile oils are so separated with relative
ease. The substance responsible for the acid Beam test, whatever
it may be, is removed, the acid test no longer appearing in the
distillate. The hydrocarbon which does appear in the distillate
can be removed by crystallization from alcohol or some other
solvent, and pure Cannabinol can <br>
be removed as a crystalline acetate or paranitry benzoate. As Dr.
Blatt pointed out, this point is where the trail ends at present,
with the exception of a brief note indicating that it is
definitely possible to find physiological effects in the material
remaining after Cannabinol has been removed.<br>
It is at that point that we purpose ultimately to actually begin.
The former distillation has been carried out at pressures
anywhere from atmospheric down to a reported pressure of about
five-one thousandths of a millimeter.<br>
From the character of the work in which this was reported it
would appear that the reported pressures must be taken with a
grain of salt. No essential difference however has appeared <br>
in the products of fractionation. The material, as you may be
aware, is an exceedingly difficult material to work with, a heavy
tar-like oil, and it does not lend itself readily to distillation
by any means. We have considered that at this point it might be
preferable to resort to molecular distillation in an effort to
obtain a more competent separation. If this hope be realized, a
number of avenues of attack are opened or re-opened. That is,
among other things the action of solvents may be reinvestigated,
and of particular interest will be the action of solvents at low
temperatures. Then there are possibilities of preferential
adsorption, and also it may be possible to prepare crystalline
derivatives. They fail to appear from treatment of the present
mixtures.<br>
Now, the molecular distillation outfit that we have chosen for
this work is of the static type, rather than the cyclic still
with which you are probably more familiar, because the higher
boiling fractions of this material are so viscous that they
probably would not cycle with in that <br>
still without special precautions to maintain a high temperature.
<br>
</p>

<p>The original material has been distilled before passing it
into the molecular still in a flash apparatus that operates under
a good vacuum. This is necessary since the crude oil is
particularly prone to spit in the molecular still and ruin the
distillation. More specifically, the process that we are
following is extraction from the plant material with cold
alcohol, alcohol being chosen as a solvent rather than petroleum
ether, on account of fire hazard. This process is <br>
followed by a liquid extraction from the alcohol by pentane,
which does away with a lot of water soluble material, and tarry
material of a nondescript character.<br>
We have not yet thoroughly satisfied ourselves that all of the
active material is extracted by pentane, but we believe we have
every reason to think it is.<br>
Then the pentane, which incidentally, extracts quite a little
alcohol, is removed, and the alcohol is also removed. The
material is then passed through the flash process that I referred
to a moment ago, and the distillate from here is placed in the
molecular still. That is the point which the investigation has
reached at this particular moment.<br>
</p>

<p>Now, it is expected to divide the oil into about ten fractions
in the stills, then to remove Cannabinol as the acetate and the
hydrocarbon by precipitation from a suitable solvent, and then to
refractions, to the remaining material. The work from that point,
of course, all depend upon the results of the fractionations, and
can not be very definitely foreseen, other than that <br>
those processes, to which I referred a moment ago, will be
applied. Now, it would have been possible to have attacked
certain phases of the problem along a number of other lines, a
few of which I will suggest in conclusion. The first would be a
characterization of those volatile oils, <br>
which have been referred to, and which would be of interest from
a purely chemical point of view. They are separated with relative
ease, by steam distillation, for example. No one, of course, has
been very much interested in them, and that line of attack has
not been followed.<br>
Again, someone might become interested in the substance which
responds to the acid Beam test. It can be removed from a solution
in petroleum either by means of alkali, and presumably would be
isolated with relatively little difficulty, but experience shows
that resins so prepared <br>
are not physiologically active, hence little interest is attached
to that substance.<br>
</p>

<p>A third possible line of attack would have been in connection
with the Beam test itself. The development of the color is due to
a product resulting from oxidation of some substance which is
present In the resin. This substance is soluble in aqueous
alkali, and is precipitated by acid. It can be readily extracted
from acid solution. It, of course, is not actually the substance
which responds to the alkaline Beam test, but it would be of
great interest from the purely scientific point of view.<br>
</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: I would like to make a couple of announcements.
Those of you who are not particularly interested in the chemical
attack here may find this part of the program a little arduous,
and I want you to understand that you are at liberty to leave and
interrupt if you want <br>
to, as I think this part of the program might be a little obtuse
at certain points.<br>
Dr. Blatt has just indicated that there are some errors in the
material which he distributed on the critical review. Do you want
to indicate those?<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: There is one error in the literature, for example on
page 469 in the middle of the page are three formulas, just one
the paragraph beginning in the middle of those formulas. <br>
There is a carbon atom, a &quot;C&quot;, a single line to an
oxygen &quot;0&quot;, and that should be a double line to make it
conform to the other two. Then, on that flow sheet, on the
left-hand half of the page, the second of those errors reads
&quot;dihydrogenation with sulphur,&quot; and that should be
&quot;dehydrogenation&quot;, and not &quot;dihydrogenation&quot;.
<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: As you gathered, Dr. Matchett's attack there is
directed at the heart of the problem; that is to say, the
isolation and characterization of the extreme number of active
principles. I indicated at the beginning that there is another
phase of the problem, and that was identification. We at this
time do not know whether the chemical attack is destined to
determine the active principle in one year or sixty years.<br>
</p>

<p>The Treasury has issued a little manual of identification,
consisting largely of photographs, and it is being distributed.
In this country we are mostly dealing with the drug in its plant
form, and in this manual they are showing the separate parts of
plants, and so on, and it is helpful in that <br>
direction. I am going to ask Mr. Levine to give us a picture of
the Beam test.<br>

<h1>STATEMENT OF MR. LEVINE,</h1>

<p><b>CHEMIST, BUREAU OF NARCOTICS.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MR. LEVINE: The Beam test seems to be the most widely used
chemical test for the identification of Marihuana, and was first
introduced by Dr. W. Beam, of the Wellcome Tropical Research
Laboratory, of Khartoum. The alkaline test in 1911 and the acid
Beam test in 1915 have come to be accepted as specific for
Marihuana, although a lot of samples have <br>
failed to respond. Workers in Europe and north Africa have used
it and tried it on a large <br>
number of plant materials. In general it is agreed that no other
material responds <br>
characteristically to the test.<br>
It has been attacked by some chemists, notably Trolle and Rende,
who said they obtained the Beam test on a mixture of drugs
consisting of ginger, coriander, licorice, nutmeg, and several
other things. Other workers, notably Fahamy and Keiy in Egypt,
and Papavassiliou and Liberato, in Greece, applied the test to
these materials, both individually and in the mixture, and failed
to get a positive response to any of them.<br>
As I stated before, a large number of authentic samples of
Marihuana failed to respond to the Beam test, or gave a very
slightly dirty purple color, which might be mistaken for just a <br>
dirty color. So a number of modifications of the Beam test have
been introduced to try to improve the results obtained in the
test. <br>
One of the steps taken to improve the test was the use of
adsorbent charcoal to remove chlorophyll from the solution of the
resin. This was reported independently by Fahamy and Keiy,
Bouquet, and by the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory.<br>
One of the tests developed in the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory
is the ethyl acetate test. Ethyl acetate is used as a solvent,
because it is a good solvent for the resin, it has a low boiling
point, hence is easily evaporated and it can be treated with
activated charcoal, which removes most of the chlorophyll, and
other substances, which would interfere with color development,
but takes out very little of the material responsible for the
Beam test.<br>
In carrying out the test, a sample of Marihuana is extracted with
a portion of ethyl acetate. The solvent is treated for a few
seconds with darco or norite and filtered.<br>
The filtrate is divided between two porcelain dishes and
evaporated on a steam bath before a fan. To one of the dishes is
added several drops of the alkaline Beam reagent, and to the <br>
other, several drops of the acid Beam reagent. In a large number
of tests, no samples which were negative to this modification
were found to be positive by the original Beam test, or any of <br>
a number of other modifications. It seems, therefore, that this
is the most satisfactory modification of the Beam test.<br>
Dr. Bouquet, in Tunis, has developed two amyl alcohol tests, one
of which uses charcoal, and the other does not. His test consists
of grinding a sample of Marihuana with potassium Hydroxide, and
then adding a portion of alcohol, mixing thoroughly, and
filtering, whereupon a purple color appears in the filtrate. <br>
Then, to a portion of this filtrate he adds about a ten-fold
volume of water, and extracts with one cc. of amyl alcohol. The
purple color is extracted into the amyl alcohol.<br>
In his test involving the use of charcoal, he adds a small amount
of animal charcoal to the mixture of the alcohol, KOH, and
Marihuana, presumably to remove chlorophyll, and then lets it
stand for two hours before filtering.<br>
<br>
The resultant filtrate is free of chlorophyll, and the tests
obtained are better. We have found that his test, involving the
use of charcoal, works better with activated charcoal, such as
norit or Darco than with the animal charcoal prescribed.<br>
Also, we find that we get results by filtering immediately after
the addition of charcoal, instead of letting the mixture stand
for two hours. We have not found any case of failure to respond
upon immediate filtration, which would respond after standing. <br>
Another modification which we have developed in our laboratory,
and which may be considered a modification of the Bouquet test,
is probably most convenient of the modifications to run, because
it involves the least manipulation. It consists merely of shaking
for a few seconds the sample of Marihuana with a two percent
alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide. <br>
Add to this is an amount of activated charcoal equal in weight to
the Marihuana. The mixture is shaken for a few seconds, and
filtered immediately. The filtrate is purple and on dilution with
water, the purple colored substance may be extracted by amyl
alcohol. <br>
Other modifications of the technique have been proposed by Dr.
Myttanaere, Viehoever, Placencias and others.<br>
<br>
As I said before, a large number of plants fail to respond to any
of these modifications of the Beam tests. We have followed the
appearance of the Beam test in plants with regard to age, parts
of plant, and variety. In regard to age, some plants three inches
tall have been found to <br>
respond to the Beam test. Some plants, at all states of growth,
up to their decadence, respond.<br>
Many male plants, which are all withered, and consist of nothing
but a skeleton with a few dried flowers sticking to the top still
respond to the alkaline Beam test.<br>
As far as an individual plant goes, the order of response is best
in the top, both with the male and female plants, followed by the
upper leaves, lower leaves, upper twigs, upper stalk, lower
twigs, and lower stalk. In other words, as you go up towards the
top of the plant you get the best response.<br>
Where the top responds very strongly, you generally get a weak
response in the skin of the lower stalk. If the tops respond very
weakly, the upper leaves will probably be negative, or just give
a trace of response. We have never been able to get any response
at all from the pith or roots of the plant.<br>
<br>
This last summer we tested six varieties of hemp, as Dr. Robinson
indicated this morning. Three of them were Roumanian varieties;
one of them was Italian, one, Manchurian; and one of Chinese
origin. Of the three Roumanian varieties, about a percent could
be positively identified by the alkaline Beam test, as Dr.
Natchett pointed out this morning. The other three gave a trace
of response to the test. The Italian variety was very close to
this, having about 98 percent <br>
attainable by the Beam test. Of the Manchurian and Chinese, only
about 20 to 50 percent could be positively identified, and of
these, practically none of the tests were as strong as the tests
obtained from the Roumanian and Italian varieties. The largest
number of the plants were absolutely negative, or showed merely
faint trances of response, which we would not consider to be
suitable for identification if the plants were unknown.<br>
We studied the effect of heating the plants towards response to
the alkaline Beam test. We found that heating parts of the plant
at 100 degrees with air blowing over them for up to five hours
did not have any harmful effects on the material response for the
alkaline Beam test.<br>
In fact, some of the plants showed better response after heating
than before. Although some workers in Europe say in no case
should the extract be heated. over 50 degrees Centigrade.<br>
However, heating the plant at 150 degrees under the same
conditions did prove to have a deleterious effect. Another
treatment we tried was permitting the plant to mold. We subjected
the tops of some of the plants, both negative and positive, to
molding, in a very moist atmosphere, for a period of about five
weeks. After this period, the whole plant was covered with slimy
mold. Response to the alkaline Beam test was as good as it was
originally. <br>
Some negative plants which were molded remained negative after
the molding period.<br>
Oxidization is an essential part of the Beam test. Beam, in his
original article, pointed out that if the tests be applied in the
absence of air, a dirty brown color will result instead of the
purple color. We have taken up some of the resin in alcohol, and
added an equal volume of 2 per <br>
cent alcoholic KOH solution. The resultant solution was
colorless, but on passing oxygen through it, the characteristic
purple color developed. <br>
Shaking the solution with charcoal had the same effect.
Presumably this is because oxidization is effected by the oxygen
adsorbed on the charcoal. Oxidation must be done in alkaline
solution. Charcoal plays a dual role in the test. In the case of
the ethyl acetate test the effect is merely to <br>
remove extraneous matter, since no oxidation is effected in this
solution.<br>
In certain solvents, such as petroleum ether, the activated
charcoal will entirely remove from solution the material
responsible for the Beam test, while animal charcoal does this to
a much smaller extent. In fact, animal charcoal may be used in
petroleum ether, although its effect as a <br>
cleaning agent is not very large.<br>
The second role of charcoal is that of an oxidizing agent. The
oxygen adsorbed on activated charcoal is effective in producing
the necessary oxidation of the material responsible for the
alkaline Beam test. Animal charcoal is effective to a very much
smaller extent, and is <br>
therefore unsatisfactory for use in this process.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I think we will have a recess now for about five
minutes before we resume.<br>
<br>
(A short recess was taken, after which the proceedings were
resumed as follows:)<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Now, after that rather exhaustive treatise on the
Beam test, I would like to have Mr. Benjamin tell us something
about this so-called Duquenois test.<br>
The reason time is being given on these tests is this: Every so
often a new test is obtained, and this is the experience in every
phase of chemical activity, and until several months or years
have been put in on it, everyone gets highly enthusiastic about
it.<br>
Efforts are made to introduce it as witness material in court,
and the first thing you know you run into a situation where you
are yourself out on a peninsula and you can not possibly get
back. <br>
We have asked the Treasury Department not to employ any tests
unless they are absolutely tests on a theory of so-called
triangulation, so that when our men go to court to testify on a
seizure that their evidence is sound.<br>
<br>
Mr. Benjamin, will you tell us briefly about the Duquenois test
and what our experience has been with that.<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: I think this was proposed in the early part of
1938. Reagent number 1 is an alcoholic solution with vanillin and
acetaldehyde. The second reagent is concentrated hydrochloric
acid; The technique consists of extracting hemp with petroleum
ether and <br>
driving off the solvent by heat.<br>
One then takes one cc. of the alcoholic reagent, adds it to the
residue, and into the solution thus prepared, puts two c.c.Õs of
concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
There is a change in color from green to slate blue to violet
blue. Now, since we have had this, we have tested approximately
165 substances, including some of the alkaloids, the essential
oils, C. D. alcohols, everything I could get my hands on that
might show up with this reagent.<br>
So far, not one sample of hemp has failed to respond to this
test. When I say &quot;hemp&quot; I am referring to solid
extracts, fluid extracts, and ether available preparations. They
all show positive.<br>
Certain essential oils when treated by the test procedure ran
through the same changes as the hemp, namely, oil of bay, geranyl
acetate, rhodinyl acetate, and one or two others.<br>
There was also a compound known as Denol, that gave practically
the same reaction as hemp. That is used in C. D. alcohols. I do
not know exactly what it is composed of, but I think a mixture of
higher alcohols and ketones.<br>
<br>
MR. SCHICKTANZ: Yes, higher alcohols.<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: I must emphasize the fact that not one sample of
Cannabis or fluid extract of Cannabis or solid extract has failed
so far.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Would you recommend the test as an eliminative test
for hemp; that is to say, hemp would have to give a positive test
of the Duquenois agent in order to be considered hemp, and then
proceed? <br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: Yes.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: To apply another test to see whether it is another
substance?<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: I think the fact that ia the Duquenois test for
Cannabis fails to respond, then one should hesitate to call the
sample Cannabis.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: That is predicated---<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: (Interposing) On the 165. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, you have had some experience with some
other tests, which we do not think very much of.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: That is fine. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What is your experience with that test?<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: I started about three or four years ago with the
method developed by an official in the British pharmacopoeia for
ergot, using paradimethyl amino benzaldehyde. The results I
obtained I then dropped, because I got busy on something else,
but I have had occasion this last spring to review and finish up
that work, which was reported at Madison and the American
Pharmaceutical Association. The manuscript is in the hands of the
editor of the American <br>
Pharmaceutical Association, and ought to be out next month.<br>
In it I tried various modifications and found the 2-1/2 per cent
solution of paradimethyl amino benzaldehyde in 65 per cent
sulphuric acid, or in 65 per cent phosphoric acid, which is my
principal reagent. The material to be tested is shaken with 10
parts, or approximately 10 parts, of low boiling petroleum ether,
(below 40 degrees Centigrade) which has been redistilled and a
half part of MerckÕs activated charcoal or norit, or any other
U. S. P., activated carbon for five or ten minutes, then
filtered. The filtrate is evaporated, and the reagent applied to
the residue. The direct application of the reagent causes
charring, or does not cause anything, according to how much
material has been removed. But on the addition of a drop of water
there is an immediate development of a blue color, shifting
toward the violet end of the spectrum, <br>
and disappearing within two seconds or two hours, depending on
how much material is present. <br>
Ergot gives a blue color similar to that of Cannabis, but the
color shift is toward the red. The red is much slower than with
that of Cannabis, and it persists for several days.<br>
I went to two neighborhood drug stores, and got ten or eleven
materials out of their prescription department, and sent them
through the same tests. Many of them gave no color. Others gave
colors of some sort. But, to make a long story short, none of
them gave the same type of <br>
color as the blue shift that I obtained with Cannabis. I have
tried about 50 samples of Cannabis, so far, and every one of
those gave the same reaction. <br>
While my eye is not too good, still there is a symmetric trend
between the potency on dogs and the degree of color developed
here. By degree I mean intensity and duration, considering them
together. But a product stronger on the dog has given me a
stronger color. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Matchett, what is your experience with that
Ghamrawy test? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: We found too many other substances, which we regard
as giving colors too similar to that given to Cannabis, to have
any value in the hands [of] anyone not very definitely expert in
the use of it. Even in such hands it is our judgment that colors
given tobacco and certain other substances were still too near
the color given by Cannabis for use in the case of extracts. Of
course, where we have a plant to look at, we realize a different
situation exists.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Even with tobacco? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Tobacco was very close. <br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Is that right? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: This was not used with charcoal. <br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: If I do not use charcoal, I get inconclusive results
along that line. <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: I am coming 'to that. It was our experience that
the U.S.P. activated charcoal would remove either the hemp or
tobacco test substance from petroleum ether. The result being
that the test in hemp was about the same as it was in tobacco. I
will ask Mr. Benjamin if that is a correct statement.<br>
</p>

<p>MR. BENJAMIN: That is correct. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Lancaster, have you had any experience with
these tests in Canada?<br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. [sic] Wollner. Some years ago our
interest was aroused as to whether or not Canadian Cannabis would
be at all active. As some of you know, the plant <br>
thrives in all climates. We have it in all altitudes. There are
no cultivated plants. But some years ago we wanted to satisfy
ourselves about the activity of the Canadian produced Cannabis.
Some was grown in western Canada for windbreak purposes, that is
the only economic function it had with us. After applying the
alkaline Beam test, as put out from Geneva we obtained positive
reactions, and the pharmacologists tried it on dogs and we found
it responded, so we concluded that some of the Canadian Cannabis
was active.<br>
From the standpoint of the administration of the Narcotic Act,
our interest is entirely limited to the illicit traffic, and it
is confined to the reefer or cigarette, where we have the
advantage of a physical. diagnosis, rather than chemical.<br>
The chemical work on this we intend to follow up as of extreme
importance, because it is difficult to predict to what extent the
extracts may come into use. There is a possibility of developing
a non-reactive type of plant, but it is not of an immediate
concern, although there again conditions of world trade and
combined complications might become such that Canada might be
asked to take up that problem again. Who knows?<br>
So we can not afford to lose interest in these chemical phases of
the testing.<br>
<br>
Our experience with the Beam test has been that it is somewhat
erratic, and does not always give the equivalent results in the
hands of different operators, for some reason. Of course, there
again, we have run some of our tests on plants where we know we
have had them in storage for some years. It is rather puzzling
there is no reaction there.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: No reaction? <br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: On prolonged storage. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Under what conditions was that hemp stored? <br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: In a large glass stopped bottle. However, we have
to check that again, because of the results of this vegetation
which remained an open field, which is another puzzle.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: That is where we all find ourselves at the moment.
What I would like to hear from the group is something in the way
of suggestions as to how this problem can be most competently
attacked. What is to be done? The problem is not a simple one,
although there is no indication as to its complexity. I say it is
not a simple problem, because if material has not been advanced
after several thousand years of experience there must be some
barrier there. <br>
Is there any technique which should be considered which has not
been considered?<br>
Dr. Hibben, have you any suggestions along this line?<br>
</p>

<p>DR. HIBBEN: That is rather a difficult question. I think we
are proceeding correctly.<br>
I think the first thing that has to be done is developing an
adequate method for determining the content of the active
principle, and until such a method is developed, there is not
going to be very much room for improvement.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The only difficulty has been that this problem has
been very much the problem of peeling an onion--the more you
peel, apparently the more peels you can take off, until you peel
away the onion and then there is nothing left.<br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: That is quite true. But I do not think there has been
any comprehensive, systematic work done on the problem, by an
adequate chemical staff, under adequate direction.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The first thing seems to be to find the active
principle. That is a different proposition.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Has any work been done on the chlorophyl of the leaf? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: All the work we know of is what you have done.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: The only thought I have is, if the chlorophyll of
Marihuana happens to be different from all other chlorophylls in
the universe, it can be identified microscopically.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Hibben, you have run some microscopic tests on
Cannabis direct for the chlorophyll. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: I did not look for chlorophyll. I say that is very
desirable, but I say they would be very doubtful on the
chlorophyll alone. <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Of course, there are some points about that. <br>
<br>
MR. VALAER: The chemistry of opium was very uncertain for a long,
long time. We had a crude mass to work with, and gradually they
pulled out one hundred pieces or more. I believe, after all, we
have not been interested in this more than about two years. I
believe the chemical crude resin Marihuana will work out in the
same way. We have two stills upstairs. We have a good many people
working on it in extracts and various ways, even now in this
brief time.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Couch, do you have anything to offer?<br>
<br>
DR. COUCH: I would like to say that this problem is in no more
desperate condition than a great many other problems in which a
solution has not been reached. They all present this picture
before the real work is done in solving it which makes it all
seem extremely baffling. <br>
It is very curious that by plugging along and keeping infernally
at it, that one of these days the problem is solved almost before
it is realized, and it seems to me that the lines that have been
projected here and the lines that have been followed are exactly
those that should be followed, and will, in the course of time,
lead to the solution of the problem; I mean the information that
you desire to have. There is one thing that occurs to me that has
not been mentioned, and <br>
that is if any work has been done upon the smoke from Marihuana,
as the smoke is physiologically active. <br>
It may be different from the resin taken by mouth or injected
into the veins. That is another matter. But it seems to me that
there is something there that might be developed as a test for
identity.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I think Dr. Hershfield did something on that
chlorophyll work which he did two years ago.<br>
<br>
DR. COUCH: Of course, along that line is also the possibility of
reaction from the protein. It simply rests on the possibility and
probability that that is, of course, the leafy tissue, and the
extract probably would not serve.<br>
The leafy portion would contain some protein. That with a water
extract or salt extract of the plant itself, in a very short time
would get positive results, one away or the other. The difficulty
there is there may be present some protein that is also present
in another plant. That difficulty arises, but the precipitation
reactions are amazingly specific and amazingly direct. When one
goes from one animal tissue to another he has to wash his hands
extremely carefully as he changes over from one to another, so as
not to spoil the test in the next tissue. There is that sort of
delicacy. I simply offer that as a test. I presume there has
already been a lot of thought discounted on that subject.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I do not know of that test. Dr. Loewe? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: If I may bring up the encroachment which is in doubt,
it has been known thousands and thousands of years that sex cells
contain an active principle. However, it has taken up to this
century to get hold of those active principles, and the reason
was not the difficulty with respect to chemistry, but the
difficulty was that there was no test for the active principle
only as an active principle, and no chemical tests were given.<br>
This is the same situation in Cannabis with one exception, and we
know the physiological test for the active principle is given. It
is much more easily accessible. This biological test is much more
easily accessible, so there is a test, and the thing which has
not yet been done, at least not <br>
yet systematically enough, is to dovetail the identification of
the active principle by its active nature by a biological test. I
think this specific picture of the dovetail work gives
immediately <br>
the solution, unless somebody is inclined to drop the whole
thing. But I again remember that same situation in the female
hormone and the male hormone, which involves just this one
property to give a beautiful color reaction. However, it did not
take more than five years after finding the right test and using
the right test in the right way from the first isolation of the
principle. I think this is the way prescribed.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Do you know of any experiments, Dr. Loewe, that have
been performed on the smoke itself? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: No.<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: I know of where they took the Marihuana smoke and
passed it through solvents.<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Through chloroform? <br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: No, through water. <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE Water, rather than chloroform?<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: Yes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: There is a great deal of work being done
at the present time with respect to the use of opium smoke. A
paper has just been prepared by someone in a laboratory in
London, which has just been issued. Are you familiar with Dr.
Nicholls? <br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. Nicholls was mentioned in connection with
the research today.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that the same Nicholls who is on the
Opium Assay Committee?<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: I was going to say very much the same thing as Dr.
Loewe said; that is, that I can not see any reason for being
discouraged as far as chemistry is concerned. Now, you have got a
perfectly good point of attack. The amazing thing about this
whole problem is that nothing has been done with the exception of
this one matter in 1932, when it was established that crude
Cannabinol behaves like a pure substance, and the customary high
vacuum distillation technique fails to separate it into its
constituents. The work has been apparently dropped from that time
on. The surprising thing is that someone has not jumped into
that. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Of course, there has been no commercial demand in
that respect, .and that is one of the reasons for that.<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: It is difficult to get hold of the material. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: If you want to get something on spectroscopic
methods, when these chemists leave the point where there are
spectroscopic methods for determination and for determining the
structure, they would aid greatly in facilitating this problem.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: It would aid greatly.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: We would like to ask Dr. Hibben if there are not
some such methods which may be correlated to the bioassay? The
essential or volatile oils come out of this material very
readily. It can be narrowed down to relatively few compounds. If
we knew, separately, the spectra of these various materials,
would it not help to follow the separations at that stage of
operations? <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: Yes, I think it would. You can start in by that
procedure on hormones.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: And I believe also carotenoids. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: As the fractionation goes further and further, the
number of bioassays increases almost without limit, and that is
one reason we were particularly interested in it. Also, the
quantitative phase has to be considered. <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: But, as an economic matter, and the rational method is
to proceed in an economical way, which can be done by carefully
choosing fractions to test.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: I do not believe we could quarrel about that.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Doctor, there is the other thought, and that is that
we have not been picking on any of the prisoners lately.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, we are not dealing with the same
problem as opium, where we can take the addict to a hospital at
Lexington and go through all of the experiments. There is a
little danger that this drug might affect a man permanently. He
might do something which we may be sorry for later. I think that
must be given serious thought.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Dr. Wollner, I will not be very long now, but I just
want to clarify a point, and it would seem from reports and other
information that the tests are rather indicative of hemp rather
than of the active principle.<br>
<br>
I am saying that for this reason: We would like to be in a
position to approach the development of strains that were free
from the active principle, Now, until we have a test it seems to
be that we can not do anything. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes, and no.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I will say it is possible that one of these tests may
be useful from a breeding standpoint, but it seems to me it is
working entirely on a guess, It would seem to me that any
approach would be resolving the strains in pure breeding alone.
In other words, approach the inbreeding situation in a hybrid
manner; that is the approach we want, but it would seem to me
that all we could do at this state would be to develop those
lines at random.<br>
<br>
In other words, set up as many facilities as we could for pure
breeding lines. Any individual plant that would be tested would
be very indefinite as to what its progeny would be, and it would
seem to me that that is more or less a blind approach; shall I
say a lick in the dark; and we would have to develop as many as
we could. We can do that, develop as many lines as possible, like
in Prussic acid in Sudan grass.<br>
</p>

<p>My point is, and I am mentioning it to you chemists, that we
can get nowhere without a test of consequence. We might be lucky.
About ten thousand chances to one, we might be lucky until we
have a test. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: In the last analysis, you are unquestionably correct
about that. Really, before significant progress can be made by
the agricultural people, we will have to provide you with a
formula. Before we adjourn, I would like to invite any of the
visiting friends present to come upstairs for a few minutes and
see our laboratory set-up for tackling this job, the molecular
stills, and extraction equipment, and I am quite sure you will
enjoy it. <br>
<br>
And I want to really express my appreciation and thanks for your
kind cooperation in helping to clarify these issues.<br>
<br>
(Whereupon, at 5:10 o'clock p.m., the Conference was adjourned
sine die.) </p>

<p> <b>Natural History 96(12) {Dec. 1987} &quot;How Carthage Lost
the Sea,&quot;</b> concerning the wreck of a 3rd century B.C.
Carthaginian shipwreck discovered off the town of Marsala in
western Sicily. Author Honor Frost notes (pp. 61-63): </p>

<p> The most surprising discovery, however, was the stems of a
grass whose yellow color stood out among the dunnage (the layer
of branches that protected the bottom of the hull from ballast
stones). There was so much of this plant material that we could
do no more than bag random samples for analysis at the Jodrell
Laboratory, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew...after excavating two
basketfuls of them, we made a special request for their
identification. The answer was, probably Cannabis sativa. The
doubt was due to the decay of the minute hairs that would have
differentiated these stems from two other plants: hops and
stinging nettles. Given the choice, I accept cannabis: baskets of
stinging nettles seem improbable and there is no record of Punic
hop cultivation, whereas Herodotus, writing in the fifth century
B.C., already refers to cannabis smoking. </p>

<p> Caroline T. Miller suggested in a follow-up letter
(&quot;Letters&quot;, _Natural History_ 97(7) {July 1988}) that
the cannabis found was likely the remains of extra sails/rigging
material (since hemp was a commonly-used material for this
purpose). This was refuted in an editor's note (ibid.) wherein
was noted: </p>

<p> According to Honor Frost...rope was found on the ship, but
all of it was made, not from hemp, but from a type of grass. The
two small baskets of cannabis on board would not have been
suitable or sufficient for rope making. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Bhang (cannabis) and charas (hash) were first used in India
in rituals honoring the god Siva, who gave cannabis to mankind. </p>

<p> Contrary to popular belief, American Indians did not use
cannabis or it's derivatives, rather, they smoked a distinctive
blend of tobacco and other selected leaves and bark commonly
called kinnikinnik. </p>

<p> 1 part tobacco </p>

<p> 1 part sumac leaves </p>

<p> seasoned with the inner bark of either a willow or dogwood
tree. </p>

<p> The word 'tobacco' actually means 'pipe'. Europeans mistook
it to mean the pipes contents. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> 'They also have a tree,' the ancient text reads, 'which bears
the strangest produce. When they are met together in companies
they throw some of it upon the fire round which they are sitting,
and presently, by the mere smell of the fumes which it gives out
in burning, they grow drunk, as the Greeks do with wine. More of
the fruit is then throw on the fire, and, their drunkenness
increasing, they often jump up and begin to dance and sing. Such
is the account which I have heard of these people.' </p>

<p> This excerpt, taken from Herodotus' account of a certain
Scythian tribe, was written in the fifth century B.C. </p>

<p> Today, many archeologists and anthropologists believe it was
Indian hemp or cannabis sativa that Herodotus called 'the
strangest produce'. </p>

<p> <b>From Licit &amp; Illicit Drugs, by Consumer Reports, p.
403:</b> </p>

<p> ...In 1762, &quot;Virginia awarded bounties for hemp culture
and manufacture, and imposed penalties upon those who did not
produce it.&quot; </p>

<p> George Washington was growing hemp at Mount Vernon three
years later--presumably for its fiber, though it has been argued
that Washington was also concerned to increase the medicinal or
intoxicating potency of his marijuana plants.* </p>

<p> The asterisk footnote: </p>

<p> * The argument depends on a curious tradition, which may or
may not be sound, that the quality or quantity of marijuana resin
(hashish) is enhanced if the male and female plants are separated
*before* the females are pollinated. There can be no doubt that
Washington separated the males and the females. Two entries in
his diary supply the evidence: </p>

<p> May 12-13 1765: &quot;Sowed Hemp at Muddy hole by
Swamp.&quot; </p>

<p> August 7, 1765: &quot;--began to seperate (sic) the Male from
the Female Hemp at Do--rather too late.&quot; </p>

<p> George Andrews has argued, in <b>The Book of Grass: An
Anthology of Indian Hemp</b> (1967), that Washington's August 7
diary entry &quot;clearly indicates that he was cultivating the
plant for medicinal purposes as well for its fiber.&quot; [7] He
might have separated the males from the females to get better
fiber, Andrew concedes--but his phrase &quot;rather too
late&quot; suggests that he wanted to complete the separation
*before the female plants were fertilized*--and this was a
practice related to drug potency rather than to fiber culture. </p>

<p> &quot;Coffee houses in England became the centres for a
certain intelligentsia and social set. There was so much argument
and discussion in the houses that spies returned to King Charles
with black stories of the seditious nature of those places. He
was advised, and attempted to have them closed. One year there
was a royal order to that effect, but within 11 days it was
withdrawn because lawyers pointed out that it curbed the basic
rights of man. The King then countered with a heavy tax on the
drink sold publicly, which resulted in a situation like some
other similar governmental prohibitions, tremendous ingenuity
being expended to reduce the tax burden and still allow coffee
for the houses.&quot; </p>

<h4>The First American Anti-Drug Law </h4>

<p> The first American anti-drug law was an 1875 San Francisco
ordinance which outlawed the smoking of opium in opium dens. It
was passed because of the fears that Chinese men were luring
white women to their &quot;ruin&quot; in opium dens. Cultural
studies of the time showed that opium dens occupied a place in
Chinese culture roughly comparable to the position that saloons
occupied in white culture. That is, most patrons went to them on
the weekends, partook of the intoxicants and went back to their
work the following Monday, with no apparent interference in their
work. There were opium addicts, of course, but, on balance, the
addiction problem didn't seem to be any worse than addiction
problems with alcohol. The usage patterns in general seemed to be
comparable to the usage patterns of alcohol. </p>

<p> The real source of the prejudice against opium smoking was
the racial prejudice against the Chinese. Opium smoking was a
peculiarly Chinese custom. White people took their own fair share
of opium in concoctions such as laudunum and any number of other
over the counter drugs, in liquid, powder, or pill form. It was
only the smoking of opium which was outlawed because that was
associated with the Chinese. History records that, like most of
the drug laws to follow it, the ordinance was massively
unsuccessful. </p>

<p> The San Francisco ordinance was followed by Federal
legislation in 1888 aimed at keeping the Chinese out of the opium
trade and placing certain restrictions on smoking opium. Again,
the laws were directed specifically at racial groups and the
perceived habits of those racial groups, not the drug itself.
Under these laws, there were no restrictions on whites engaged in
the opium trade. </p>

<p> Racial prejudice at the time ran to levels which would be
difficult to imagine today. One of the newspapers of the time
records the story of a group of white men who got drunk and got
in an argument over whether Chinese and Indians (Native
Americans) were really the same race. To test their theory, they
captured a Chinese man and a Native American and took them both
to the river and threw them in. The Chinese man drowned, while
the Native American swam to shore and escaped. On that basis,
they concluded that they were not of the same race. The newspaper
did not mention that anyone was punished as a result of the
incident. </p>

<hr>

<p> &quot;A few plants such as the potato, tomato, poppy and hemp
seem to have the power of growing with equal luxuriance under
almost any climatic condition, changing or modifying some
important function as if to adapt themselves to the altered
circumstance. As remarked, hemp is perhaps the most notable
example of this; hence, it produces a valuable fibre in Europe,
while showing little or no tendency to produce the narcotic
principle which in Asia constitutes its chief value. &quot; </p>

<p> <b>The Racial Roots of our Drug Laws</b> </p>

<p> COCAINE: </p>

<p> One article in the New York Times even went so far as to say
that cocaine made blacks shoot better, that it would
&quot;increase, rather than interfere with good marksmanship...
The record of the 'cocaine nigger' near Asheville, who dropped
five men dead in their tracks, using only one cartridge for each,
offers evidence that is sufficiently convincing.&quot;(1) A
Literary Digest article claimed that &quot;most of the attacks
upon white women of the South are the direct result of the
cocaine-crazed Negro brain.&quot;(2) When Coca-Cola removed
cocaine from their drink, it was not out of concern for their
customers' health. It was to please their Southern market, which
&quot;feared blacks getting cocaine in any form.&quot;(3) The
racism went beyond blacks. When &quot;every Jew peddler in the
South carries the stuff,&quot;(4) inciting blacks to rape white
women, what choice did we have but prohibition? </p>

<p> HEROIN </p>

<p> Labor organizations played a big role in anti-Oriental
feeling. The leader of the AFL was particularly fond of bringing
up fears of Chinese opium peddlers raping young American boys and
girls: </p>

<p> According to Hill, &quot;Gompers [Samuel Gompers, President
of the American Federation of Labor 1886-1924, except for one
year] conjures up a terrible picture of how the Chinese entice
little white boys and girls into becoming 'opium fiends.'
Condemned to spend their days in the back of laundry rooms, these
tiny lost souls would yield up their virgin bodies to their
maniacal yellow captors. &quot;What other crimes were committed
in those dark fetid places,&quot; Gompers writes, &quot;when
these little innocent victims of the Chinamen's wiles were under
the influence of the drug, are almost too horrible to imagine...
There are hundreds, aye, thousands, of our American girls and
boys who have acquired this deathly habit and are doomed,
hopelessly doomed, beyond the shadow of redemption.&quot;(5) </p>

<p> Some of the original laws are particularly telling. In 1887,
Congress forbade *Chinese* to import opium, but not Americans. In
1890, they extended this law to allow opium manufacture only to
Americans. In 1909, they banned *smoking* opium.(9) Smoking the
drug (rather than drinking it) was considered
&quot;Chinese&quot;. </p>

<p> In 1901, Congress forbade the sale of opium and alcohol
&quot;to aboriginal tribes and uncivilized races&quot;, and later
extended this to include &quot;uncivilized elements in America
itself and in its territories, such as Indians, Alaskans, the
inhabitants of Hawaii, railroad workers, and immigrants at ports
of entry.&quot;(7) </p>

<p> In 1902, an American Pharmaceutical Association report said,
&quot;If the Chinaman cannot get along without his 'dope,' we can
get along without him.&quot;(8) </p>

<p> In Idaho, they took a separate route towards protecting
Whites from Chinese: In their 1887 statute, they explicitly made
it illegal for &quot;any white person&quot; to frequent a house
where opium was smoked.(10) </p>

<p> Oregon's legislators were quite honest: &quot;Smoking opium
is not our vice, and therefore, it may be that this legislation
proceeds more from a desire to vex and annoy the 'Heathen
Chinese' in this respect than to protect the people from the evil
habit.&quot;(12) </p>

<p> Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,
continued this campaign well into the twentieth century, accusing
Red China of planning a &quot;long range dope-and-dialectic
assault on America and its leaders&quot;.(11) </p>

<p> MARIJUANA </p>

<p> Marijuana prohibition started in the Southwest, where
&quot;the dirty greasers grow&quot;, as sung by soldiers under
General Pershing.(13) A Texas police captain summed up the
problem: under marijuana, Mexicans became &quot;very violent,
especially when they become angry and will attack an officer even
if a gun is drawn on him. They seem to have no fear, I have also
noted that under the influence of this weed they have enormous
strength and that it will take several men to handle one man
while under ordinary circumstances one man could handle him with
ease.&quot;(14) </p>

<p> According to the Butte Montana Standard, in 1927, &quot;When
some beet field peon takes a few traces of this stuff... he
thinks he has just been elected president of Mexico, so he starts
out to execute all his political enemies.&quot;(15) </p>

<p> The American Coalition, an anti-foreigner group, stated
&quot;Marihuana, perhaps now the most insidious of our narcotics,
is a direct by-product of unrestricted Mexican immigration.
Easily grown, it has been asserted that it has recently been
planted between rows in a California penitentiary garden. Mexican
peddlers have been caught distributing sample marihuana cigarets
to school children. Bills for our quota against Mexico have been
blocked mysteriously in every Congress since the 1924 Quota Act.
Our nation has more than enough laborers.&quot;(16) </p>

<p> According to the Missionary Educator Movement, &quot;The use
of marihuana is not uncommon in the colonies of the lower class
of Mexican immigrants. This is a native drug made from what is
sometimes called the 'crazy weed.' The effects are high
exhilaration and intoxication, followed by extreme depression and
broken nerves. [Police] officers and Mexicans both ascribe many
of the moral irregularities of Mexicans to the effects of
marihuana.&quot;(17) </p>

<p> The very name marihuana was introduced at this time to make
it sound Mexican--some interests didn't even realize that
marihuana and hemp were the same plant. Lobbyists for the
birdseed industry, for example, arrived with barely enough time
to get an exemption, because they hadn't realized that marihuana
was what they were putting in their seed(18), and Eric
Partridge's Dictionary of Slang says &quot;hemp&quot; is a slang
word for marijuana, since &quot;it resembles that
plant&quot;.&quot; </p>

<h4>The Outlawing of Hemp </h4>

<p> In the ensuing story, one name stands above all the others in
importance. That name is Harry Anslinger. More than any other
single person, Harry Anslinger is responsible for our marijuana
laws and much of our drug policy today. In order to properly
understand the reasons for our drug laws as they are today, it is
necessary to understand the motives and the evidence behind
Anslinger's campaign for the drug laws. Listed below are some
excerpts from a few of the better books on this subject. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>reprinted from &quot;Marijuana in America: a scientific
confrontation&quot;</b> </p>

<p> by Dr. William D. Drake Jr. </p>

<p> Harry Anslinger was placed in charge of the treasury
department's finger-in-the-dike operation to halt liquor
smuggling in 1926. in 1926, not by coincidence, the first
anti-marijuana stories began to appear in mass-circulation
newspapers, and the yellow press had a lot of fun trying out
marijuana's front-page possibilities. the first successful
anti-marijuana campaign in the country, was waged by the morning
and evening papers of New Orleans. While the editors of these
papers did hedge their bets with the sure fire winner of racism,
the central point of their stories was that all them niggers had
found a new way to get at your (white) kids, and the secret
weapon they used was stuff called muggles (marijuana slang name).
</p>

<p> Whether or not the treasury department simulated the first
scare stories is a moot point. what did happen is that as a
result of the &quot;anti-muggles&quot; drive, local legislation
was passed swiftly in New Orleans. Interestingly enough, it was
legislation which equated marijuana, in terms of penalties, with
rape &amp; murder, the two crimes most feared &amp; fantasized at
the time by whites in their non-relations with blacks. </p>

<p> Moreover, Harry Anslinger &amp; the anti-alcohol police
bureaus, without authorization and exceeding their statutory
authority, began circularizing sympathetic newspaper reprints of
such stories. as anti-marijuana press campaigns spread, more
&amp; more local legislation was enacted to protect the
citizenry. By the time that prohibition drew to a close, an
awareness of the new drug menace had been generated among the
people, and the Treasury responded in 1930 by creating a special
Bureau of Narcotics. Harry Anslinger was appointed as
commissioner. </p>

<p> With a commendable sense of tidiness, the narcotics bureau
under Anslinger moved through the thirties reprinting articles
here, giving out insider interviews there, ALL aimed toward the
elevation of marijuana into a narcotic. This seems to have been
motivated by the fact that there were not enough people who were
into cocaine or opiates to give the bureau the kind of business
it needed to expand its budget and influence. It was the same
sort of game which Hoover played with the communist menace in the
forties &amp; fifties, and with crime in the streets in the
sixties, to expand his F.B.I. operations. but the tactics of the
narcotics bureau, while superficially crude, displayed a subtle
understanding of the workings of the federal system which is the
hallmark of talented bureaucrats in the search for power &amp;
security. Rather than expose their backsides by lobbying directly
in Congress for anti-marijuana legislation--an approach which
could be looked upon as a power grab by their jealous competitors
among federal agencies--the narcotics bureau simply stimulated
the growth of a tangled web of local level anti-marijuana
legislation, and then, about 1935, began pointing out the need
for unifying legislation on the federal level. Within two years
the bureau was home free: The Marijuana Tax Stamp Act of 1937, a
piece of unifying legislation if there ever was one, was passed
virtually unopposed by Congress. </p>

<p> After this move, Harry Anslinger continued his career until
his retirement grabbing more and more Washington power and
status. prior to his death many years later, he was also seen as
a prime mover in Joe McCarthy's similar power grab campaign
against the communists in America's workplace. At one point
McCarthy credited Anslingers style and background as an
inspirational force behind McCarthy's own political climb. </p>

<p> <b>THE ANSLINGER ERA (c) Copyright 1983 by Peter Stafford</b>
A year of considerable importance to this history is 1930, when
Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon appointed his niece's cousin
Commissioner of the newly created U.S. Narcotics Bureau. Harry J.
Anslinger reigned as Commissioner for three decades. Anslinger
was to the inhibition of _Cannabis_ use what Andrew Comstock had
at the turn of the century been to the inhibition of American
sexual freedom. Although not particularly concerned about
marijuana when he took office, he soon became obsessed with
&quot;the evils&quot; of this weed, seeing a curse for humanity
in the leaves and flowers of the _Cannabis_ plant. </p>

<p> Fear about this largely unknown substance had already been
stirred up, especially in the southwestern states, where it was
used mainly by blacks and Mexicans. Prohibitions against
nonmedical usage had been enacted in California (1915), Texas
(1919), Louisiana (1924), and New York (1927). In the mid-1930s,
Anslinger did his best to escalate the fear into hysteria.
Drawing on his experience as a journalist with a stacatto,
sensationalist style, he came out with &quot;Marihuana, the
Assassin of Youth,&quot; the first in a series of articles and
books recounting the horrors committed under the weed's
influence: murder, suicide, seduction of schoolchildren by
&quot;friendly strangers.&quot; (All of his examples have since
been refuted.) </p>

<p> Once Anslinger got going, he showed little interest as
Commissioner in any news about the drug unless it could be worked
into his atrocity file on &quot;the Killer Drug,&quot; which he
claimed was &quot;a powerful narcotic in which lurks Murder!
Insanity! Death!&quot; The nation's papers loved it. By 1937,
forty-six of the forty-eight states had banned marijuana. </p>

<p> Anslinger abandoned his earlier hopes for federal
prohibition, because even he had come to doubt the
constitutionality of such a law. Someone suggested that the U.S.
might impose a &quot;transfer tax&quot; to be collected by the
U.S. Treasury. Nonpayment of the tax would constitute a felony.
In the ensuing congressional hearings, the Narcotics Bureau took
a firm line; Anslinger even told legislators, &quot;You smoke a
joint and you're likely to kill your brother.&quot; In all of the
testimony, only one person raised any substantive objection to
the Anslinger proposal. Dr. William Woodward, a legislative
counsel for the American Medical Association, argued that
_Cannabis_ in medical preparations had not been abused and that
the new provisions would cause hardship for doctors. He was
quickly hooted down. House hearings concluded with no significant
changes in the proposed bill, which then sailed through the
Senate. In August 1937, FDR, who had come into office on a
platform of repealing Prohibition, signed the Marihuana Tax Act.
In addition to imposing the tax requirement, the law also
declared _Cannabis_ a narcotic. The new penalties for its use or
distribution were five to twenty years for a first offense, ten
to forty for a second. </p>

<p> ... </p>

<p> After retiring from the Narcotics Bureau, the indefatigable
Anslinger went on to head the American delegation to the U.N.
concerned with drug use. By 1961, he managed in this capacity to
get sixty nations to sign a &quot;Uniform Drug Convention,&quot;
which pledged to end _Cannabis_ use within twenty-five years.
Signing nations can, however, drop out by request. Shortly after,
serious efforts to legalize marijuana usage got underway in the
West. </p>

<h4>Harry Anslinger &amp; the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 </h4>

<p> <b>cited in a NIDA publication</b> </p>

<hr>

<p> &quot;...For Anslinger, the moral entrepreneur, 1936 should
have been a year of victory. In EVERY state the marihuana menace
was subjected to statutory control. But for Anslinger, the
bureaucrat, 1936 seems to have been another year of defeat. His
budgetary appropriation remained near a low point that had not
been seen in over a decade, which to some extent reflected the
general economic conditions of the time.... </p>

<p> &quot;Again in 1937 Anslinger, the moralist, would be
expected first to convince the general public that marihuana use
was evil and immoral, while Anslinger, the bureaucrat, would be
more concerned with attaining passage of legislation which would
increase the Bureau's powers and then proceed to generate
environmental support for these powers. In fact, the latter
occured. The great bulk of Bureau-inspired publicity came after
the Act, not before. </p>

<p> &quot;Faced with a steadily decreasing budget, the Bureau
responded as any organization might react: it tried to appear
more necessary, and it tried to increase its scope of operations.
As a result of this response, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was
passed.&quot; <cite>The FBN and marihuana -- Dickson, Bureaucracy

<p> <b>Marijuana--Assassin of Youth.</b> </p>

<p> <b>by H. J. Anslinger U.S. Commissioner of Narcotics. first
published by &quot;the American Magazine&quot; in 1937.</b> </p>

<p> Not long ago the body of a young girl lay crushed on the
sidewalk after a plunge from a Chicago apartment window. Everyone
called it suicide, but actually it was murder. the killer was a
narcotic known to America as marijuana, and to history as
hashish. Used in the form of cigarettes, it is comparatively new
to the United States and as dangerous as a coiled rattlesnake.
How many murders, suicides, and maniacal deeds it causes each
year, especially among the young, can only be conjectured. In
numerous communities it thrives almost unmolested, largely
because of official ignorance of its effects. Marijuana is the
unknown quantity among narcotics. no one knows, when he smokes
it, whether he will become a philosopher, a joyous reveler, a mad
insensate, or a murderer. The young girl's story is typical. she
had heard the whisper which has gone the rounds of American youth
about a new thrill, a cigarette with a &quot;real kick&quot;
which gave wonderful reactions and no harmful aftereffects. With
some friends she experimented at an evening smoking party. The
results were weird. Some of the party went into paroxysms of
laughter, others of mediocre musical ability became almost
expert; the piano dinned constantly. Still others found
themselves discussing weighty problems with remarkable clarity.
The girl danced without fatigue throughout a night of
inexplicable exhilaration. Other parties followed, finally there
came a gathering at a time when the girl was behind in her
studies and greatly worried. Suddenly, as she was smoking, the
thought of a solution to her school problems came. Without
hesitancy she walked to a window and leaped to her death. Thus
madly can marijuana &quot;solve&quot; one's difficulties. </p>

<p> It gives few warnings of what it intends to do to the human
brain. Last year a young marijuana addict was hanged in Baltimore
for criminal assault on a ten year old girl. In Chicago, two
marijuana smoking boys murdered a policeman. In Florida, police
found a youth staggering about in a human slaughterhouse. With an
ax he had killed his father, mother, two brothers, and a sister.
He had no recollection of having committed this multiple crime.
Ordinarily a sane, rather quiet young man, he had become crazed
from smoking marijuana. In at least two dozen comparatively
recent cases of murder or degenerate sex attacks, marijuana
proved to be a contributing cause. In Ohio a gang of seven
marijuana addicts, all less than 20, were caught after a series
of 38 holdups. the boys story was typical of conditions in many
cities. One of them said they first learned about
&quot;reefers&quot; in high school, buying the cigarettes at
hamburger stands, and from peddlers who hung around the school.
He told of &quot;booth joints&quot; where you could get a
marijuana cigarette and a sandwich for a quarter, and of the
shabby apartments of women who provided the cigarettes and rooms
where boys and girls might smoke them together. His recollection
of the crimes he had committed was hazy. &quot;when you get to
'floating', it's hard to keep track of things. If I had killed
somebody on one of those jobs, I'd never had known it. Sometimes
it was over before I realized that I'd been out of my room.&quot;
It is the useless destruction of the youth which is so
heartbreaking to all of us who labor in the field of narcotics
suppression. </p>

<h4>World War II - Hemp for Victory </h4>

<p> Despite the fact that production of hemp (marijuana) had been
effectively outlawed in 1937, when World War II came along, the
Government suddenly discovered they needed it for basics such as
rope for suchs, and other cordage purposes. As a result, they
encouraged farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) in industrial
quantities and even granted them exemption from military duty if
they did. To encourage farmers to grow hemp (marijuana), the
Department of Agriculture produced a film titled &quot;Hemp For
Victory.&quot; This film will soon be coming to these pages in
the form of still frames of each of the significant scenes, and
the full text of the narration. </p>

<p> The LaGuardia Commission </p>

<p> The studies leading to the La Guardia Report in New York in
the early 1940s recorded nine psychotic outbreaks, of varying
duration, among a sample of 200 studied intensely. Most of these
were found to be cases of already psychotic personalities, and
one of the psychiatrists involved in the study wrote, in 1942,
'Marijuana will not produce a psychosis de novo in a
well-integrated stable person.' </p>

<p> The team who observed New York's marijuana smokers for the
period found them to be a rather passive, peaceful, and friendly
group, distinctly not prone to violence (though above average
perpetrators of petty crimes). </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>This session is going to be about the history of the
non-medical use of drugs. Let me say that, because this is going
to be a story, that I think it will interest you quite a bit. The
topic is the history of the non-medical use of drugs and I think
you ought to know what my credentials are for talking about this
topic. As you may know, before I taught at the University of
Southern California, I taught at the University of Virginia for
fifteen years, from 1968 to 1981. In that time period, the very
first major piece that I wrote was a piece entitled, &quot;The
Forbidden Fruit and the Tree of Knowledge - The Legal History of
Marihuana in the United States&quot;. I wrote it with Professor
Richard Bonnie, still of the faculty of the University of
Virginia. It was published in the Virginia Law Review in October
of 1970 and I must say that our piece was the Virginia Law Review
in October of 1970. The piece was 450 pages long. It got a ton of
national attention because no one had ever done the legal history
of marijuana before. As a result of that, Professor Bonnie was
named the Deputy Director of the National Commission on Marihuana
and Drug Abuse and I was a consultant to that commission. </p>

<p>As a result of Richard's two year executive directorship of
the National Commission in 1971 and 1972 he and I were given
access to both the open and the closed files of what was then
called the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, what had
historically been called the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and what
today is called the Drug Enforcement Agency. Based upon our
access to those files, both open and closed, we wrote a book
called &quot;The Marihuana Conviction- The Legal History of Drugs
in the United States&quot; and that book went through six
printings at the University of Virginia press before being sold
out primarily in sales to my friends at the FBI over the years.
It is based upon that work that I bring you this story. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Situation in 1900</b> </p>

<p>If you are interested in the non-medical use of drugs in this
country, the time to go back to is 1900, and in some ways the
most important thing I am going to say to you guys I will say
first. That is, that in 1900 there were far more people addicted
to drugs in this country than there are today. Depending upon
whose judgment, or whose assessment, you accept there were
between two and five percent of the entire adult population of
the United States addicted to drugs in 1900. </p>

<p>Now, there were two principal causes of this dramatic level of
drug addiction at the turn of the century. The first cause was
the use of morphine and its various derivatives in legitimate
medical operations. You know as late as 1900, particularly in
areas where medical resources were scarce it was not at all
uncommon for you to say, let's say you would have appendicitis,
you would go into the hospital, and you would get morphine as a
pain killer during the operation, you would be given morphine
further after the operation and you would come out of the
hospital with no appendix but addicted to morphine. </p>

<p>The use of morphine in battlefield operations during the Civil
War was so extensive that, by 1880, so many Union veterans were
addicted to morphine that the popular press referred to
morphinism as the &quot;soldier's disease&quot;. Now I will say,
being from Virginia as I am, that the Confederate veterans didn't
have any problems about being addicted to morphine because the
South was too poor to have any, and therefore battlefield
operations on the Confederate Army were simply done by chopping
off the relevant limb while they drank a little whiskey. But the
Northern troops heavily found themselves, as the result of
battlefield operations and the use of morphine, addicted to
morphine.<br>
</p>

<p>Now, the other fact that I think that is so interesting about
drug addiction at the turn of the century, as opposed to today is
who the addicts were, because they were the exact opposite of who
you would think most likely to be an addict today. If I were to
ask you in terms of statistical groups who is most likely to be
involved with drugs today, you would say a young person, a male,
who lives in the city and who may be a minority group member.
That is the exact opposite of who was most likely to be addicted
to drugs at the turn of the century. </p>

<p>In terms of statistical groups, who was most likely to be
addicted to drugs at the turn of the century? A rural living,
middle-aged white woman. The use of morphine in medical
operations does not explain the much higher incidence of drug
addiction among women. What does is the second cause of the high
level of addiction at the turn of the century -- the growth and
development of what we now call the &quot;patent medicine&quot;
industry. </p>

<p>I think some of you, maybe from watching Westerns on TV if
nothing else are aware that, again, as late as 1900, in areas,
particularly rural areas where medical resources were scarce, it
was typical for itinerant salesmen, not themselves doctors, to
cruise around the countryside offering potions and elixirs of all
sorts advertised in the most flamboyant kinds of terms.
&quot;Doctor Smith's Oil, Good for What Ails You&quot;, or
&quot;Doctor Smith's Oil, Good for Man or Beast.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, what the purveyors of these medicines did not tell their
purchasers, was that later, when these patent medicines were
tested, many of them proved to be up to fifty percent morphine by
volume. </p>

<p>Now, what that meant, as I have always thought, was the most
significant thing about the high morphine content in patent
medicines was it meant they tended to live up to their
advertising. Because no matter what is wrong with you, or your
beast, you are going to feel a whole lot better after a couple of
slugs of an elixir that is fifty percent morphine. So there was
this tendency to think &quot;Wow! This stuff works.&quot; Down
you could go to the general store and get more of it and it could
be sold to you directly over the counter. </p>

<p>Now, for reasons that we weren't able to full research, but
for reasons, I think, probably associated with the role of women
rural societies then patent medicines were much more appealing to
women than to men and account for the much higher incidence of
drug addiction in 1900 among women than among men. </p>

<p>If you want to see a relatively current portrayal of a woman
addicted to patent medicine you might think of Eugene O'Neil's
play &quot;A Long Day's Journey Into Night&quot;. The mother
figure there, the one that was played by Katherine Hepburn in the
movies was addicted to patent medicines. </p>

<p>In any event, the use of morphine in medical operations and
the sale of patent medicines accounted for a dramatic level of
addiction. Again, between two and five percent of the entire
adult population of the United States was addicted to drugs as
late as 1900. </p>

<p>Now if my first point is that there was a lot more addiction
in 1900 than there is today and that the people who were addicted
are quite a different group than the group we would be thinking
of today, my next point would be that if you look at drug
addiction in 1900, what's the number one way in which it is
different than drug addiction today? Answer: Almost all addiction
at the turn of the century was accidental. </p>

<p>People became involved with drugs they did not know that they
were taking, that they did not know the impact of. The first
point, then, is that there was more drug addiction than there is
now and most of it was accidental. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Pure Food and Drug Act</b> </p>

<p>Then the single law which has done the most in this country to
reduce the level of drug addiction is none of the criminal laws
we have ever passed. The single law that reduced drug addiction
the most was the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. </p>

<p>The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 did three things: </p>

<p>1). It created the Food and Drug Administration in Washington
that must approve all foods and drugs meant for human
consumption. The very first impact of that was that the patent
medicines were not approved for human consumption once they were
tested. </p>

<p>2) The Pure Food and Drug Act said that certain drugs could
only be sold on prescription. </p>

<p>3) The Pure Food and Drug Act, (and you know, this is still
true today, go look in your medicine chest) requires that any
drug that can be potentially habit-forming say so on it's label.
&quot;Warning -- May be habit forming.&quot; </p>

<p>The labeling requirements, the prescription requirements, and
the refusal to approve the patent medicines basically put the
patent medicine business out of business and reduced that
dramatic source of accidental addiction. The Pure Food and Drug
Act of 1906, not a criminal law, did more to reduce the level of
addiction than any other single statute we have passed in all of
the times from then to now. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Harrison Act</b> </p>

<p>The very first criminal law at the Federal level in this
country to criminalize the non-medical use of drugs came in 1914.
It was called the Harrison Act and there are only three things
about the Harrison Act that we need to focus on today. </p>

<p>Number one is the date. Did you hear the date, 1914? Some of
you may have come this morning thinking that we have used the
criminal law to deal with the non-medical use of drugs since the
beginning of the Republic or something. That is not true. The
entire experiment of using the criminal sanction to deal with the
non-medical use of drugs really began in this country in 1914
with the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>The second interesting thing about the Harrison Act was the
drugs to which it applied, because it applied to almost none of
the drugs we would be concerned about today. The Harrison Act
applied to opium, morphine and its various derivatives, and the
derivatives of the coca leaf like cocaine. No mention anywhere
there of amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana, hashish,
hallucinogenic drugs of any kind. The Harrison Act applied only
to opium, morphine and its various derivatives and derivatives of
the coca leaf like cocaine. </p>

<p>The third and most interesting thing for you all as judges
about the Harrison Act was its structure, because the structure
of this law was very peculiar and became the model for every
single piece of Federal legislation from 1914 right straight
through 1969. And what was that model? </p>

<p>It was called the Harrison Tax Act. You know, the drafters of
the Harrison Act said very clearly on the floor of Congress what
it was they wanted to achieve. They had two goals. They wanted to
regulate the medical use of these drugs and they wanted to
criminalize the non-medical use of these drugs. They had one
problem. Look at the date -- 1914. 1914 was probably the high
water mark of the constitutional doctrine we today call
&quot;states' rights&quot; and, therefore, it was widely thought
Congress did not have the power, number one, to regulate a
particular profession, and number two, that Congress did not have
the power to pass what was, and is still known, as a general
criminal law. That's why there were so few Federal Crimes until
very recently. </p>

<p>In the face of possible Constitutional opposition to what they
wanted to do, the people in Congress who supported the Harrison
Act came up with a novel idea. That is, they would masquerade
this whole thing as though it were a tax. To show you how it
worked, can I use some hypothetical figures to show you how this
alleged tax worked? </p>

<p>There were two taxes. The first (and again, these figures
aren't accurate but they will do to show the idea) tax was paid
by doctors. It was a dollar a year and the doctors, in exchange
for paying that one dollar tax, got a stamp from the Government
that allowed them to prescribe these drugs for their patients so
long as they followed the regulations in the statute. Do you see
that by the payment of that one dollar tax, we have the doctors
regulated? The doctors have to follow the regulations in the
statute. </p>

<p>And there was a second tax. (and again, these are hypothetical
figures but they will show you how it worked.) was a tax of a
thousand dollars of every single non-medical exchange of every
one of these drugs. Well, since nobody was going to pay a
thousand dollars in tax to exchange something which, in 1914,
even in large quantities was worth about five dollars, the second
tax wasn't a tax either, it was a criminal prohibition. Now just
to be sure you guys understand this, and I am sure you do, but
just to make sure, let's say that in 1915 somebody was found,
let's say, in possession of an ounce of cocaine out here on the
street. What would be the Federal crime? Not possession of
cocaine, or possession of a controlled substance. What was the
crime? Tax evasion. </p>

<p>And do you see what a wicked web that is going to be? As a
quick preview, where then are we going to put the law enforcement
arm for the criminalization of drugs for over forty years -- in
what department? The Treasury Department. Why, we are just out
there collecting taxes and I will show you how that works in a
minute. </p>

<p>If you understand that taxing scheme then you understand why
the national marijuana prohibition of 1937 was called the
Marihuana Tax Act. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Early State Marijuana Laws</b> </p>

<p>But before we get to that next big piece of Federal
legislation, the marihuana prohibition of 1937, I would like to
take a little detour, if I may, into an analysis of the early
state marijuana laws passed in this country from 1915 to 1937. </p>

<p>Let me pause to tell you this. When Professor Bonnie and I set
out to try to track the legal history of marijuana in this
country, we were shocked that nobody had ever done that work
before. And, secondly, the few people who had even conjectured
about it went back to the 1937 Federal Act and said &quot;Well,
there's the beginning of it.&quot; No. If you go back to 1937,
that fails to take account of the fact that, in the period from
1915 to 1937, some 27 states passed criminal laws against the use
of marijuana. What Professor Bonnie and I did was, unique to our
work, to go back to the legislative records in those states and
back to the newspapers in the state capitols at the time these
laws were passed to try to find out what motivated these 27
states to enact criminal laws against the use of marijuana. What
we found was that the 27 states divided into three groups by
explanation. </p>

<p>The first group of states to have marijuana laws in that part
of the century were Rocky Mountain and southwestern states. By
that, I mean Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana. You didn't
have to go anywhere but to the legislative records to find out
what had motivated those marijuana laws. The only thing you need
to know to understand the early marijuana laws in the southwest
and Rocky Mountain areas of this country is to know, that in the
period just after 1914, into all of those areas was a substantial
migration of Mexicans. They had come across the border in search
of better economic conditions, they worked heavily as rural
laborers, beet field workers, cotton pickers, things of that
sort. And with them, they had brought marijuana. </p>

<p>Basically, none of the white people in these states knew
anything about marijuana, and I make a distinction between white
people and Mexicans to reflect a distinction that any legislator
in one of these states at the time would have made. And all you
had to do to find out what motivated the marijuana laws in the
Rocky mountain and southwestern states was to go to the
legislative records themselves. Probably the best single
statement was the statement of a proponent of Texas first
marijuana law. He said on the floor of the Texas Senate, and I
quote, &quot;All Mexicans are crazy, and this stuff (referring to
marijuana) is what makes them crazy.&quot; Or, as the proponent
of Montana's first marijuana law said, (and imagine this on the
floor of the state legislature) and I quote, &quot;Give one of
these Mexican beet field workers a couple of puffs on a marijuana
cigarette and he thinks he is in the bullring at Barcelona.&quot;
</p>

<p>Well, there it was, you didn't have to look another foot as
you went from state to state right on the floor of the state
legislature. And so what was the genesis for the early state
marijuana laws in the Rocky Mountain and southwestern areas of
this country? It wasn't hostility to the drug, it was hostility
to the newly arrived Mexican community that used it.<br>
</p>

<p>A second group of states that had criminal laws against the
use of marijuana were in the Northeast, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, New York -- had one and then repealed it and then had one
again -- New Jersey. Well, clearly no hypothesis about Mexican
immigration will explain the genesis of those laws because, as
you know, the Northeast has never had, still doesn't really, any
substantial Mexican-American population. So we had to dig a
little deeper to find the genesis of those laws. We had to go not
only to the legislative records but to the newspapers in the
state capitols at the time these laws were passed and what we
found, in the early marijuana laws in the Northeast, we labeled
the &quot;fear of substitution.&quot; If I may, let me paraphrase
an editorial from the New York Times in 1919 so we will get
exactly the flavor of this fear of substitution. </p>

<p>The New York Times in an editorial in 1919 said, &quot;No one
here in New York uses this drug marijuana. We have only just
heard about it from down in the Southwest,&quot; and here comes
the substitution. &quot;But,&quot; said the New York Times,
&quot;we had better prohibit its use before it gets here.
Otherwise&quot; -- here's the substitution concept -- &quot;all
the heroin and hard narcotics addicts cut off from their drug by
the Harrison Act and all the alcohol drinkers cut off from their
drug by 1919 alcohol Prohibition will substitute this new and
unknown drug marijuana for the drugs they used to use.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, from state to state, on the theory that this newly
encountered drug marijuana would be substituted by the hard
narcotics addicts or by the alcohol drinkers for their previous
drug that had been prohibited, state to state this fear of
substitution carried, and that accounted for 26 of the 27 states
-- that is, either the anti-Mexican sentiment in the Southwest
and Rocky Mountain areas or fear of substitution in the
Northeast. That accounted for 26 of the 27 states, and there was
only one state left over. It was the most important state for us
because it was the first state ever to enact a criminal law
against the use of marijuana and it was the state of Utah. </p>

<p>Now, if you have been hearing this story and you have been
playing along with me, you think &quot;Oh, wait a minute,
Whitebread, Utah fits exactly with Colorado, Montana, -- it must
have been the Mexicans.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, that's what I thought at first. But we went and did a
careful study of the actual immigration pattern and found, to our
surprise, that Utah didn't have then, and doesn't have now, a
really substantial Mexican-American population. So it had to be
something else. </p>

<p>Come on folks, if it had to be something else, what do you
think it might have been? Are you thinking what I was thinking --
that it must have had something to do with the single thing which
makes Utah unique in American history -- its association with the
Mormon church.<br>
</p>

<p>With help from some people in Salt Lake City, associated with
the Mormon Church and the Mormon National Tabernacle in
Washington -- with their help and a lot of work we found out what
the genesis was of the first marihuana law in this country. Yes,
it was directly connected to the history of Utah and Mormonism
and it went like this.<br>
</p>

<p>I think that a lot of you know that, in its earliest days, the
Mormon church permitted its male members to have more than one
wife -- polygamy. Do you all know that in 1876, in a case called
Reynolds against the United States, the United States Supreme
Court said that Mormons were free to believe what they wanted,
but they were not free to practice polygamy in this country.
Well, who do you think enforced that ruling of the Supreme Court
in 1876? At the end of the line, who enforces all rulings of the
Supreme Court? Answer: the state and local police. And who were
they in Utah then? All Mormons, and so nothing happened for many
years. Those who wanted to live polygamously continued to do so. </p>

<p>In 1910, the Mormon Church in synod in Salt Lake City decreed
polygamy to be a religious mistake and it was banned as a matter
of the Mormon religion. Once that happened, there was a crackdown
on people who wanted to live in what they called &quot;the
traditional way&quot;. So, just after 1910, a fairly large number
of Mormons left the state of Utah, and indeed left the United
States altogether and moved into northwest Mexico. They wrote a
lot about what they wanted to accomplish in Mexico. They wanted
to set up communities where they were basically going to convert
the Indians, the Mexicans, and what they referred to as &quot;the
heathen&quot; in the neighborhood to Mormonism. </p>

<p>By 1914, they had had very little luck with the heathen, but
our research shows now beyond question that the heathen had a
little luck with them. What happened apparently -- now some of
you who may be members of the church, you know that there are
still substantial Mormon communities in northwest Mexico -- was
that, by and large most of the Mormons were not happy there, the
religion had not done well there, they didn't feel comfortable
there, they wanted to go back to Utah where there friends were
and after 1914 did. </p>

<p>And with them, the Indians had given them marijuana. Now once
you get somebody back in Utah with the marijuana it all becomes
very easy, doesn't it? You know that the Mormon Church has always
been opposed to the use of euphoriants of any kind. So, somebody
saw them with the marijuana, and in August of 1915 the Church,
meeting again in synod in Salt Lake City decreed the use of
marijuana contrary to the Mormon religion and then -- and this is
how things were in Utah in those days -- in October of 1915, the
state legislature met and enacted every religious prohibition as
a criminal law and we had the first criminal law in this
country's history against the use of marijuana. </p>

<p>That digression into the early state marijuana laws aside, we
will now get back on the Federal track, the year is 1937 and we
get the national marijuana prohibition -- the Marihuana Tax Act <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937</b> </p>

<p>Now, first again, does everybody see the date, 1937? You may
have thought that we have had a national marijuana prohibition
for a very long time. Frankly, we haven't. </p>

<p>The marijuana prohibition is part and parcel of that era which
is now being rejected rather generally -- the New Deal era in
Washington in the late 30s.<br>
</p>

<p>Number two, you know, don't you, that whenever Congress is
going to pass a law, they hold hearings. And you have seen these
hearings. The hearings can be extremely voluminous, they go on
and on, they have days and days of hearings. Well, may I say,
that the hearings on the national marijuana prohibition were very
brief indeed. The hearings on the national marijuana prohibition
lasted one hour, on each of two mornings and since the hearings
were so brief I can tell you almost exactly what was said to
support the national marijuana prohibition. </p>

<p>Now, in doing this one at the FBI Academy, I didn't tell them
this story, but I am going to tell you this story. You want to
know how brief the hearings were on the national marijuana
prohibition? <br>
</p>

<p>When we asked at the Library of Congress for a copy of the
hearings, to the shock of the Library of Congress, none could be
found. We went &quot;What?&quot; It took them four months to
finally honor our request because -- are you ready for this? --
the hearings were so brief that the volume had slid down inside
the side shelf of the bookcase and was so thin it had slid right
down to the bottom inside the bookshelf. That's how brief they
were. Are you ready for this? They had to break the bookshelf
open because it had slid down inside. </p>

<p>There were three bodies of testimony at the hearings on the
national marijuana prohibition. <br>
</p>

<p>The first testimony came from Commissioner Harry Anslinger,
the newly named Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
Now, I think some of you know that in the late 20s and early 30s
in this country there were two Federal police agencies created,
the FBI and the FBN -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. <br>
</p>

<p>In our book, I talk at great length about how different the
history of these two organizations really are. But, the two
organizations, the FBI and the FBN had some surface similarities
and one of them was that a single individual headed each of them
for a very long time. In the case of the FBI, it was J. Edgar
Hoover, and in the case of the FBN it was Harry Anslinger, who
was the Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930
until 1962.<br>
</p>

<p>Commissioner Anslinger gave the Government testimony and I
will quote him directly. By the way, he was not working from a
text that he had written. He was working from a text that had
been written for him by a District Attorney in New Orleans, a guy
named Stanley. Reading directly from Mr. Stanley's work,
Commissioner Anslinger told the Congressmen at the hearings, and
I quote, &quot;Marihuana is an addictive drug which produces in
its users insanity, criminality, and death.&quot; That was the
Government testimony to support the marijuana prohibition from
the Commissioner. </p>

<p>The next body of testimony -- remember all of this took a
total of two hours -- uh .. You understand what the idea was,
don't you? The idea was to prohibit the cultivation of hemp in
America. You all know, because there has been some initiative
here in California, that hemp has other uses than its euphoriant
use. For one, hemp has always been used to make rope. Number two,
the resins of the hemp plant are used as bases for paints and
varnishes. And, finally, the seeds of the hemp plant are widely
used in bird seed. Since these industries were going to be
affected the next body of testimony came from the industrial
spokesmen who represented these industries. </p>

<p>The first person was the rope guy. The rope guy told a
fascinating story -- it really is fascinating -- the growth of a
hemp to make rope was a principle cash crop right where I am
from, Northern Virginia and Southern Maryland at the time of the
Revolutionary War. But, said the rope guy, by about 1820 it got
cheaper to import the hemp we needed to make rope from the Far
East and so now in 1937 we don't grow any more hemp to make rope
in this country -- it isn't needed anymore. </p>

<p>If you heard that story, there are two things about it that I
found fascinating. Number one, it explains the long-standing
rumor that our forefathers had something to do with marijuana.
Yes, they did -- they grew it. Hemp was the principal crop at
Mount Vernon. It was a secondary crop at Monticello. Now, of
course, in our research we did not find any evidence that any of
our forefathers had used the hemp plant for euphoriant purposes,
but they did grow it. </p>

<p>The second part of that story that, to me is even more
interesting is -- did you see the date again - 1937? What did the
rope guy say? We can get all the hemp we need to make rope from
the Far East, we don't grow it hear anymore because we don't need
to. </p>

<p>Five years later, 1942, we are cut off from our sources of
hemp in the Far East. We need a lot of hemp to outfit our ships
for World War II, rope for the ships, and therefore, the Federal
Government, as some of you know, went into the business of
growing hemp on gigantic farms throughout the Midwest and the
South to make rope to outfit the ships for World War II. </p>

<p>So, even to this day, if you are from the Midwest you will
always meet the people who say, &quot;Gosh, hemp grows all along
the railroad tracks.&quot; Well, it does. Why? Because these huge
farms existed all during World War II. </p>

<p>But, the rope people didn't care. The paint and varnish people
said &quot;We can use something else.&quot; And, of the
industrial spokesmen, only the birdseed people balked. The
birdseed people were the ones who balked and the birdseed person
was asked, &quot;Couldn't you use some other seed?&quot; </p>

<p>These are all, by the way, direct quotes from the hearings.
The answer the birdseed guy gave was, &quot;No, Congressman, we
couldn't. We have never found another seed that makes a birds
coat so lustrous or makes them sing so much.&quot; </p>

<p>So, on the ground that the birdseed people needed it -- did
you know that the birdseed people both got and kept an exemption
from the Marihuana Tax Act right through this very day for
so-called &quot;denatured seeds&quot;? </p>

<p>In any event, there was Anslinger's testimony, there was the
industrial testimony -- there was only one body of testimony left
at these brief hearings and it was medical. There were two pieces
of medical evidence introduced with regard to the marijuana
prohibition. <br>
</p>

<p>The first came from a pharmacologist at Temple University who
claimed that he had injected the active ingredient in marihuana
into the brains of 300 dogs, and two of those dogs had died. When
asked by the Congressmen, and I quote, &quot;Doctor, did you
choose dogs for the similarity of their reactions to that of
humans?&quot; The answer of the pharmacologist was, &quot;I
wouldn't know, I am not a dog psychologist.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>Well, the active ingredient in marijuana was first synthesized
in a laboratory in Holland after World War II. So what it was
this pharmacologist injected into these dogs we will never know,
but it almost certainly was not the active ingredient in
marijuana. <br>
</p>

<p>The other piece of medical testimony came from a man named Dr.
William C. Woodward. Dr. Woodward was both a lawyer and a doctor
and he was Chief Counsel to the American Medical Association. Dr.
Woodward came to testify at the behest of the American Medical
Association saying, and I quote, &quot;The American Medical
Association knows of no evidence that marihuana is a dangerous
drug.&quot; </p>

<p>What's amazing is not whether that's true or not. What's
amazing is what the Congressmen then said to him. Immediately
upon his saying, and I quote again, &quot;The American Medical
Association knows of no evidence that marihuana is a dangerous
drug.&quot;, one of the Congressmen said, &quot;Doctor, if you
can't say something good about what we are trying to do, why
don't you go home?&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>That's an exact quote. The next Congressman said,
&quot;Doctor, if you haven't got something better to say than
that, we are sick of hearing you.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, the interesting question for us is not about the medical
evidence. The most fascinating question is: why was this legal
counsel to the most prestigious group of doctors in the United
States treated in such a high-handed way? And the answer makes a
principle thesis of my work -- and that is -- you've seen it,
you've been living it the last ten years. The history of drugs in
this country perfectly mirrors the history of this country. </p>

<p>So look at the date -- 1937 -- what's going on in this
country? Well, a lot of things, but the number one thing was
that, in 1936, President Franklin Roosevelt was reelected in the
largest landslide election in this country's history till then.
He brought with him two Democrats for every Republican, all, or
almost all of them pledged to that package of economic and social
reform legislation we today call the New Deal. </p>

<p>And, did you know that the American Medical Association, from
1932, straight through 1937, had systematically opposed every
single piece of New Deal legislation. So that, by 1937, this
committee, heavily made up of New Deal Democrats is simply sick
of hearing them: &quot;Doctor, if you can't say something good
about what we are trying to do, why don't you go home?&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>So, over the objection of the American Medical Association,
the bill passed out of committee and on to the floor of Congress.
Now, some of you may think that the debate on the floor of
Congress was more extensive on the marijuana prohibition. It
wasn't. It lasted one minute and thirty-two seconds by my count
and, as such, I will give it to you verbatim.<br>
</p>

<p>The entire debate on the national marijuana prohibition was as
follows -- and, by the way, if you had grown up in Washington, DC
as I had you would appreciate this date. Are you ready? The bill
was brought on to the floor of the House of Representatives --
there never was any Senate debate on it not one word -- 5:45
Friday afternoon, August 20. Now, in pre-air-conditioning
Washington, who was on the floor of the House? Who was on the
floor of the House? Not very many people. </p>

<p>Speaker Sam Rayburn called for the bill to be passed on
&quot;tellers&quot;. Does everyone know &quot;tellers&quot;? Did
you know that for the vast bulk of legislation in this country,
there is not a recorded vote. It is simply, more people walk past
this point than walk past that point and it passes -- it's called
&quot;tellers&quot;. They were getting ready to pass this thing
on tellers without discussion and without a recorded vote when
one of the few Republicans left in Congress, a guy from upstate
New York, stood up and asked two questions, which constituted the
entire debate on the national marijuana prohibition. </p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Speaker, what is this bill about?&quot; </p>

<p>To which Speaker Rayburn replied, &quot;I don't know. It has
something to do with a thing called marihuana. I think it's a
narcotic of some kind.&quot; </p>

<p>Undaunted, the guy from Upstate New York asked a second
question, which was as important to the Republicans as it was
unimportant to the Democrats. &quot;Mr. Speaker, does the
American Medical Association support this bill?&quot; </p>

<p>In one of the most remarkable things I have ever found in any
research, a guy who was on the committee, and who later went on
to become a Supreme Court Justice, stood up and -- do you
remember? The AMA guy was named William C. Woodward -- a member
of the committee who had supported the bill leaped to his feet
and he said, &quot;Their Doctor Wentworth came down here. They
support this bill 100 percent.&quot; It wasn't true, but it was
good enough for the Republicans. They sat down and the bill
passed on tellers, without a recorded vote. </p>

<p>In the Senate there never was any debate or a recorded vote,
and the bill went to President Roosevelt's desk and he signed it
and we had the national marijuana prohibition. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1938 to 1951</b> </p>

<p>Now, the next step in our story is the period from 1938 to
1951. I have three stories to tell you about 1938 to 1951. </p>

<p>The first of them. Immediately after the passage of the
national marijuana prohibition, Commissioner Anslinger decided to
hold a conference of all the people who knew something about
marijuana -- a big national conference. He invited forty-two
people to this conference. As part our research for the book, we
found the exact transcript of this conference. Ready? </p>

<p>The first morning of the conference of the forty-two people
that Commissioner Anslinger invited to talk about marijuana, 39
of them got up and said some version of &quot;Gee, Commissioner
Anslinger, I don't know why you asked me to this conference, I
don't know anything about marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>That left three people. Dr. Woodward and his assistant -- you
know what they thought. </p>

<p>That left one person -- the pharmacologist from Temple
University -- the guy with the dogs. </p>

<p>And what do you think happened as a result of that conference?
Commissioner Anslinger named the pharmacologist from Temple
University the Official Expert of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
about marijuana, a position the guy held until 1962. Now, the
irony of trying to find out what the drug did after it had been
prohibited -- finding out that only one person agrees with you --
and naming him the Official Expert, speaks for itself. </p>

<p>The next story from this time period was a particular favorite
of the police groups to whom I spoke at the FBI Academy, because
it is a law enforcement story. </p>

<p>After national marijuana prohibition was passed, Commissioner
Anslinger found out, or got reports, that certain people were
violating the national marijuana prohibition and using marijuana
and, unfortunately for them, they fell into an identifiable
occupational group. Who were flouting the marijuana prohibition?
Jazz musicians. And so, in 1947, Commissioner Anslinger sent out
a letter, I quote it verbatim, &quot;Dear Agent So-and-so, Please
prepare all cases in your jurisdiction involving musicians in
violation of the marijuana laws. We will have a great national
round-up arrest of all such persons on a single day. I will let
you know what day.&quot; </p>

<p>That letter went out on, I think, October 24, 1947. The
responses by the resident agents were all in the file. My
favorite -- at the bottom line, there wasn't a single resident
agent who didn't have reservations about this idea -- came from
the Hollywood agent. This is the exact letter of the FBN agent in
charge in Hollywood. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Commissioner Anslinger, </p>

<p>I have your letter of October 24. Please be advised that the
musical community here in Hollywood are unionized and very tight
we have been unable to get an informant inside it. So, at the
present time, we have no cases involving musicians in violation
of the marihuana laws.&quot; </p>

<p>For the next year and a half, Commissioner Anslinger got those
kinds of letters. He never acknowledged any of the problems that
the agents said they were having with this idea and always wrote
them back the same letter. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Agent so-and-so, </p>

<p>Glad to hear you are working hard to give effect to my
directive of October 24, 1947. We will (and he always underlined
the word 'will') have a great national round-up arrest of
musicians in violation of the marijuana laws all on a single day.
Don't worry, I will let you know what day.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>This went on -- and, of course, you know that some jazz
musicians were, in fact, arrested in the late 40's -- this all
went on until it ended just the way it began -- with something
that Anslinger said. I don't see anybody in here really old
enough to appreciate this point, but Commissioner Anslinger was
testifying before a Senate Committee in 1948. He was saying,
&quot;I need more agents.&quot; And, of course, the Senators
asked him why. </p>

<p>&quot;Because there are people out there violating the
marijuana laws.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, you know what the Senators asked -- &quot;Who?&quot; </p>

<p>And in a moment that every Government employee should avoid
like the plague, Anslinger first said, &quot;Musicians.&quot; But
then he looked up at that Senate committee and he gave them a
little piece of his heart and said the single line which provoked
the most response in this country's history about the non-medical
use of drugs. Anslinger said, &quot;And I don't mean good
musicians, I mean jazz musicians.&quot; </p>

<p>Friends, there is no way to tell you what a torrent ensued.
Within 24 hours, 76 newspaper editorials slammed him, including
special editions the then booming trade press of the jazz music
industry. With three days, the Department of the Treasury had
received fifteen thousand letters. bunches of them were still in
bags when I got there -- never been opened at all. I opened a
few. Here was a typical one, and it was darling. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Commissioner Anslinger, </p>

<p>I applaud your efforts to rid America of the scourge of
narcotics addiction. If you are as ill-informed about that as you
are about music, however, you will never succeed.&quot; </p>

<p>One of the things that we had access to that really was fun
was the Commissioner's own appointment book for all of his years.
And, five days after he says &quot;I don't mean good musicians, I
mean jazz musicians.&quot; there is a notation: 10 AM --
appointment with the Secretary of the Treasury.&quot; Well, I
don't know what happened at that appointment, but from that
appointment on, no mention is ever made again of the great
national round-up arrest of musicians in violation of the
marijuana laws all on a single day, much to the delight of the
agents who never had any heart for it in the first place.<br>
</p>

<p>The final story from this period is my favorite story from
this period, by far, and, again, there is simply nobody here who
is really old enough to appreciate this story. You know, if you
talk to your parents -- that's the generation we really need to
talk to -- people who were adults during the late 30's and 40's.
And you talk to them about marijuana in particular you would be
amazed at the amazing reputation that marijuana has among the
generation ahead of you as to what it does to its users. </p>

<p>In the late 30's and early 40's marihuana was routinely
referred to as &quot;the killer drug&quot;, &quot;the assassin of
youth&quot;. You all know &quot;reefer madness&quot;, right?
Where did these extraordinary stories that circulated in this
country about what marijuana would do to its users come from? </p>

<p>The conventional wisdom is that Anslinger put them over on
Americans in his effort to compete with Hoover for
empire-building, etc. I have to say, in some fairness, that one
of the things that our research did, in some sense, was to
rehabilitate Commissioner Anslinger. Yes, there was some of that
but, basically, it wasn't just that Anslinger was trying to dupe
people. </p>

<p>The terrific reputation that marijuana got in the late 30s and
early 40s stemmed from something Anslinger had said. Does
everybody remember what Anslinger said about the drug?
&quot;Marihuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users
insanity, criminality, and death.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, this time the magic word -- come along lawyers out
there, where's the magic word? -- Insanity. Marihuana use, said
the Government, would produce insanity. </p>

<p>And, sure enough, in the late 30s and early 40s, in five
really flamboyant murder trials, the defendant's sole defense was
that he -- or, in the most famous of them, she -- was not guilty
by reason of insanity for having used marijuana prior to the
commission of the crime. </p>

<p>All right, it's time to take you guys back to class here. If
you are going to put on an insanity defense, what do you need?
You need two things, don't you? Number one, you need an Expert
Witness. </p>

<p>Where, oh where, in this story, are we going to find an expert
witness? Here it comes -- sure enough -- the guy from Temple
University -- the guy with the dogs. I promise you, you are not
going to believe this. </p>

<p>In the most famous of these trials, what happened was two
women jumped on a Newark, New Jersey bus and shot and killed and
robbed the bus driver. They put on the marijuana insanity
defense. The defense called the pharmacologist, and of course,
you know how to do this now, you put the expert on, you say
&quot;Doctor, did you do all of this experimentation and so
on?&quot; You qualify your expert. &quot;Did you write all about
it?&quot; &quot;Yes, and I did the dogs&quot; and now he is an
expert. Now you ask him what? You ask the doctor &quot;What have
you done with the drug?&quot; And he said, and I quote,
&quot;I've experimented with the dogs, I have written something
about it and&quot; -- are you ready -- &quot;I have used the drug
myself.&quot; </p>

<p>What do you ask him next? &quot;Doctor, when you used the
drug, what happened?&quot; </p>

<p>With all the press present at this flamboyant murder trial in
Newark New Jersey, in 1938, the pharmacologist said, and I quote,
in response to the question &quot;When you used the drug, what
happened?&quot;, his exact response was: &quot;After two puffs on
a marijuana cigarette, I was turned into a bat.&quot; </p>

<p>He wasn't done yet. He testified that he flew around the room
for fifteen minutes and then found himself at the bottom of a
two-hundred-foot high ink well </p>

<p>Well, friends, that sells a lot of papers. What do you think
the Newark Star Ledger headlines the next day, October 12, 1938?
&quot;Killer Drug Turns Doctor to Bat!&quot; </p>

<p>What else do we need to put on an insanity defense? We need
the defendant's testimony -- himself or herself. OK, you put
defendant on the stand, what do you ask? &quot;What happened on
the night of . .&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I used marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And then what happened?&quot; </p>

<p>And, if the defendant wants to get off, what is he or she
going to say? &quot;It made me crazy.&quot; </p>

<p>You know what the women testified? In Newark they testified,
and I quote, &quot;After two puffs on a marijuana cigarette my
incisor teeth grew six inches long and dripped with blood.&quot; </p>

<p>This was the craziest business you ever saw. Every one of
these so-called marijuana insanity defenses were successful. </p>

<p>The one in New York was just outlandish. Two police officers
were shot and killed in cold blood. The defendant puts on the
marijuana insanity defense and, in that case, there was never
even any testimony that the defendant had even used marijuana.
The testimony in the New York case was that, from the time the
bag of marijuana came into his room it gave off &quot;homicidal
vibrations&quot;, so he started killing dogs, cats, and
ultimately two police officers. </p>

<p>Commissioner Anslinger, sitting in Washington, seeing these
marijuana insanity defenses, one after another successful, he
writes to the pharmacologist from Temple University and says,
&quot;If you don't stop testifying for the defense in these
matters, we are going to revoke your status as the Official
Expert of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.&quot; He didn't want
to lose his status, so he stopped testifying, nobody else would
testify that marijuana had turned them into a bat, and so these
insanity defenses were over but not before marijuana had gotten
quite a reputation, indeed. </p>

<p>The next step -- and now we are going to move very quickly
here -- in 1951. We get a whole new drug law called the Boggs Act
and it is important to us for only two reasons. </p>

<p>Number one, it reflects what I am going to call the formula
for drug legislation in this country. Here is the formula. The
formula really is always the same, think about it in our
lifetime. </p>

<p>The formula is that someone, and by the way, that someone is
usually the media, perceive an increase in drug use. What's the
answer? The answer in the history of this country is always the
same -- a new criminal law with harsher penalties in every single
offense category. </p>

<p>Where did the perception come from this time? Well, if you
have ever seen movies from this time period like High School
Confidential, the perception was that kids in high school were
starting to use drugs. What's the answer? The answer is always
the same. The Boggs Act of 1951 quadrupled the penalties in every
single offense category and, by the way, the Boggs Act had a
whole new rationale for the marijuana prohibition. </p>

<p>Do you remember the old rationale -- that marijuana was an
addictive drug which caused in its users insanity, criminality,
and death? Just before Anslinger was to testify on the Boggs Act,
the doctor who ran for the Government the Lexington, Kentucky
narcotics rehabilitation clinic testified ahead of Anslinger and
testified that the medical community knew that marijuana wasn't
an addictive drug,. It doesn't produce death, or insanity, and
instead of producing criminality, it probably produces passivity,
said the doctor. </p>

<p>Who was the next witness? Anslinger. And, if you see, that the
rug had been pulled out from under everything he had said in the
1937 hearings to support the marijuana prohibition. In what I
call a really slick Federal shuffle -- Anslinger, you know, had
been bitten bad enough by what he said, he didn't want that again
-- he said, the doctor is right, marijuana -- he always believed,
by the way, that there was something in marijuana which produced
criminality -- is not an addictive drug, it doesn't produce
insanity or death but it is &quot;the certain first step on the
road to heroin addiction.&quot; And the notion that marijuana was
the stepping stone to heroin became, in 1951, the sole rationale
for the national marijuana prohibition. It was the first time
that marijuana was lumped with all the other drugs and not
treated separately, and we multiply the penalties in every
offense category. </p>

<p>By the way, I told you that the history of drug legislation
reflects the history of the country. 1951, what's going on? The
Korean War, the Cold War. It didn't take the press a minute to
see this perceived use in drug use among high school kids as our
&quot;foreign enemies&quot;, using drugs to subvert the American
young. In our book, we have ten or fifteen great political
cartoons. My favorite is a guy with a big Fu Man Chu (mustache)
labeled &quot;Oriental Communism.&quot; He has a big needle
marked &quot;Dope&quot; and he has the American kids lying down
-- &quot;Free World&quot; it is marked. There it was -- that our
foreign enemies were going to use drugs to subvert the American
young. What did we do? We passed a new law that increased the
penalties in every offense category by a factor of four. </p>

<p>Well, now once you buy it, the ball is going to roll like
crazy. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1956 and the Daniel Act</b> </p>

<p>1956, we get another new drug law, called the Daniel Act,
named for Senator Price Daniel of Texas. It is important to us
for only two reasons. One, it perfectly reflects the formula
again. What is the formula? Somebody perceives an increase in
drug use in this country and the answer is always a new criminal
law with harsher penalties in every offense category. </p>

<p>Where did the perception in 1956 come from that there was an
increase in drug use? Answer: Anybody remember 1956? In 1956, we
had the first set ever of televised Senate hearings. And whose
hearings were they? They were the hearings of Senator Estes
Kefauver of Tennessee about organized crime in America. </p>

<p>These hearings, which everybody watched on their little sets
showed two things that we all know today, but it sure made their
socks roll up and down then. Number one, there is organized crime
in America and number two, it makes all its money selling drugs.
There it was, that was all the perception we needed. We passed
the Daniel Act which increased the penalties in every offense
category, that had just been increased times four -- times eight.
</p>

<p>With the passage of each of these acts, the states passed
little Boggs acts, and little Daniel acts, so that in the period
1958 to 1969, in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Virginia was
typical, the most heavily penalized crime in the Commonwealth was
possession of marijuana, or any other drug. </p>

<p>It led to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years, no
part of which you were eligible for parole or probation, and as
to no part of it were you eligible for a suspended sentence. </p>

<p>Just to show you where it was, in the same time period first
degree murder in Virginia had a mandatory minimum sentence of
fifteen years. Rape, a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.
Possession of marijuana -- not to mention sales of marijuana with
its mandatory minimum of forty years -- mandatory minimum of
twenty years. </p>

<p>That is the situation in 1969 when we have a new drug law, the
first one in this country's history that does not follow the
formula. It is the 1969 Dangerous Substances Act. For he first
time in this country's history, we have a perception of an
increase in drug use during the Sixties, but instead of raising
the penalties, we lower them. And, further, in the Dangerous
Substances Act of 1969, for the first time we finally abandon the
so-called &quot;taxing&quot; mythology. </p>

<p>In the 1969 Act, what the Federal law does is, it takes all
the drugs we know -- if you can't fill in this next blank, you
are in trouble -- except two -- which two? Which two are never
going to be mentioned? Nicotine and alcohol. But, other than
nicotine and alcohol -- every other drug. </p>

<p>By the way, I tried this with the FBI for twenty years and
they wouldn't listen, and you won't listen either but, I am going
to try. If you are going to go out and talk about drugs and
whatever you are going to do with drugs, will you please discard
the entirely antiquated and erroneous word &quot;narcotics.&quot;
Narcotics are drugs that put people to sleep. Almost all of the
drugs that we are interested in today don't do that. </p>

<p>So, in 1969, the Dangerous Substances Act gave up the effort
to define what are narcotic drugs. What the 1969 act did, and
what most state laws still do, is to classify all drugs except
nicotine and alcohol by two criteria. What is the drug's medical
use? And, what is the drug's potential for abuse? </p>

<p>We put all the drugs, by those two criteria, in schedules, and
then we tie the penalties for possession, possession with intent
to sell, sale, and sale to a minor to the schedule of the drug in
question. Now, again, I am no good at this anymore, I have not
kept up with the drug laws, I don't know who is in what schedule,
and many states have abandoned the schedule but, to give you a
flavor of it: The first schedule, Schedule One Drugs were drugs
that had little or no medical use and a high potential for abuse.
What's going to go in there? LSD, marijuana, hashish, they are
all in Schedule One -- little or no medical use and a high
potential for abuse. </p>

<p>Then you get some medical use, high potential for abuse --
what do you want there? Barbiturates, amphetamines,. </p>

<p>Then we are going to get what? High medical use and high
potential for abuse. Morphine, codeine. Codeine is the best one
because codeine is in almost every single prescription cough
medicine and it is addictive as can be. </p>

<p>Then you go on down and get the antibiotics -- high medical
use, almost no potential for abuse, and there you are. </p>

<p>Once you schedule your drugs, you then tie the penalties for
the drugs to the schedule and then, because in 1969 they wanted
to reduce the marijuana penalties they had to deal with marijuana
separately and did so. </p>

<p>But the 1969 act important for two reasons again: One, we
abandoned the taxing mythology and; two, it was the first law in
this country's history that, instead of raising the penalties in
every offense category, lowered them. </p>

<p>Well, then you know what happened. We get the War on Drugs.
You know how it all went down. We got perceptions in the 80s that
there was an increase in drug use, a great dramatic decision to
declare war on drugs and, predominantly, war on drug users. </p>

<p>What I want to say to you is this, and this is where I think
some of you are going to be a little surprised. You know as much
about that process as I do. You watched it. You saw how we had
one law after another, raising the penalties so that as late as
1990, thirty percent of the minority group population of the City
of Baltimore who are male and between 20 and 29 are under court
supervision for drugs. Thirty percent, that's the number you are
looking for. </p>

<p>The War on Drugs, a very interesting war, because why? It was
cheap to fight. It was cheap to fight at first -- why? You heard
me in the &quot;Recent Decisions&quot; talk. What was last year's
big moment, and the year before? The change in cheap and easy
forfeiture. Criminal forfeiture was used to make this a costless
war. That is, easy forfeiture from those who were caught allowed
us to pay for the war in that way. I think we are going to have
some real questions about whether people want to pay for the war
on drugs through their taxes because now the Court has made
forfeiture much, much more difficult in their overall concern for
property rights. </p>

<p>But here is what I think may surprise some of you. You guys
know as much about the War on Drugs as I do. I didn't come hear
to talk, or to harangue, or to give you any opinions on that
point. I think it speaks for itself. It is a failure and I think
it will be judged as a failure. What I wanted to bring you
instead was, instead of talking about that that everybody is
talking about -- and you guys will ultimately resolve it and you
guys are the ones who are seeing all the drug cases, day in and
day out, and always will, until this changes. But, what I thought
I could bring you was the part of the story you hadn't heard --
how we got to where we were when the War on Drugs was declared.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Conclusion - The Issue of Prohibition </b></p>

<p>And one other thing I want to do with you this morning, and
that's this -- I want to say one thing. To tell you the real
truth, my interest isn't in drugs, or in the criminalization of
drugs although I think we should abolish the criminal penalties
for drugs, and deal with it as the Europeans do in a medical way,
but who cares? That's an opinion.<br>
</p>

<p>What interests me though, isn't drugs. What interests me is
that larger issue, and the reason that I wrote the piece, and the
reason they were my tenure pieces, I am interested in a much
larger issue, and that is the idea of Prohibition -- the use of
criminal law to criminalize conduct that a large number of us
seem to want to engage in. <br>
</p>

<p>And, for my purposes, -- now, Professor Bonnie went on to be
associated with NIDA and with all kinds of drug-related
organizations and continues to be interested in the drug laws --
I am not. My interest is in criminal prohibitions and, for my
purposes, as a criminal law scholar, we could have used any
prohibition -- alcohol prohibition, the prohibition against
gambling that exists still in many states. How about the
prohibition in England from 1840 to 1880 against the drinking of
gin? Not drinking, just gin -- got it? We could have used any of
these prohibitions. We didn't. We chose the marijuana prohibition
because the story had never been told -- and it is an amazing
story.<br>
</p>

<p>We could have used any of these prohibitions. We could have
used the alcohol prohibition. The reason we didn't is because so
much good stuff has been written about it. And are you aware of
this? That every single -- you know how fashionable it is to
think that scholars can never agree? -- Don't you believe that --
Every single person who has ever written seriously about the
national alcohol prohibition agrees on why it collapsed. Why? </p>

<p>Because it violated that iron law of Prohibitions. What is the
iron law of Prohibitions? Prohibitions are always enacted by US,
to govern the conduct of THEM. Do you have me? Take the alcohol
prohibition. Every single person who has ever written about it
agrees on why it collapsed. </p>

<p>Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who
were not themselves, opposed to drinking. Do you have me? What?
The right answer to that one is Huh? Want to hear it again? </p>

<p>Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who
were not themselves, opposed to drinking. Want to see it? </p>

<p>Let me give you an example, 1919. You are a Republican in
upstate New York. Whether you drink, or you don't, you are for
the alcohol prohibition because it will close the licensed
saloons in the City of New York which you view to be the corrupt
patronage and power base of the Democratic Party in New York. So
almost every Republican in New York was in favor of national
alcohol prohibition. And, as soon as it passed, what do you think
they said? &quot;Well, what do you know? Success. Let's have a
drink.&quot; That's what they thought, &quot;let's have a
drink.&quot; &quot;Let's drink to this.&quot; A great success,
you see. </p>

<p>Do you understand me? Huge numbers of people in this country
were in favor of national alcohol prohibition who were not
themselves opposed to drinking. </p>

<p>I just want to go back to the prohibition against the drinking
of gin. How could a country prohibit just the drinking of gin,
not the drinking of anything else for forty years? Answer: The
rich people drank whiskey and the poor people drank what? -- gin.
Do you see it? </p>

<p>Let's try the gambling prohibition. You know when I came to
Virginia, this was a very lively issue, the gambling prohibition.
By the way, I think it's a lively issue in California. Are you
ready for it?<br>
</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the rhetoric that goes around the gambling
prohibition? You know what it is. Look, we have had a good time.
We have been together yesterday, we have been together today, I
have known a lot of you guys for ages. How about after the talk,
we have a minute or two, let's go on up to your room and we will
play a little nickel, dime, quarter poker. Want to play some
poker this afternoon? Why not? It's a nice thing to do.<br>
</p>

<p>Would we be outraged if the California State Police came
barreling through the door and arrested us for violation of
California's prohibition on gambling? Of course we would.
Because, who is not supposed to gamble? Oh, you know who is not
supposed to gamble -- them poor people, that's who. My God, they
will spend the milk money. They don't know how to control it.
They can't handle it. But us? We know what we are doing.<br>
</p>

<p>That's it. Every criminal prohibition has that same touch to
it, doesn't it? It is enacted by US and it always regulates the
conduct of THEM. And so, if you understand that is the name of
the game, you don't have to ask me, or any of the other people
which prohibitions will be abolished and which ones won't because
you will always know. The iron law of prohibitions -- all of them
-- is that they are passed by an identifiable US to control the
conduct of an identifiable THEM. <br>
</p>

<p>And a prohibition is absolutely done for when it does what?
Comes back and bothers US. If, at any time, in any way, that
prohibition comes back and bothers us, we will get rid of it for
sure, every doggone time. Look at the alcohol prohibition if you
want a quick example. As long as it is only THEM --- you know,
them criminals, them crazy people, them young people, them
minority group members --- we are fine. But any prohibition that
comes back and bothers US is done for.<br>
</p>

<p>Let's just try the marijuana prohibition as a quick one. Who
do you think was arrested 650,000 strong two years ago for
violation of the marijuana laws? Do you think it was all minority
group members? Nope. It was not. It was some very identifiable
children of US -- children of the middle class. You don't have to
answer my opinion. No prohibition will stand -- ever-- when it
comes back and penalizes our children -- the children of US who
enacted it. And in fact, do you have any real doubt about that?
Do you know what a fabulous sociological study we will be if we
become the first society in the history of the world to penalize
the sons and daughters of the wealthy class? Unheard of. </p>

<p>And so, yeah, we will continue the War on Drugs for a while
until everybody sees its patent bankruptcy. But, let me say that
I am not confident that good sense will prevail. Why? Because we
love this idea of prohibition. We really do. We love it in this
country. And so I will tell you what I predict. You will always
know which ones are going out and which ones are coming in. And,
can't you see the one coming right over the hill? Well, folks, we
are going to have a new prohibition because we love this idea
that we can solve difficult medical, economic, and social
problems by the simple enactment of a criminal law. We adore
this, and of course, you judges work it out, we have solved our
problem. Do you have it? Our problem is over with the enactment
of the law. You and the cops work it out, but we have solved our
problem. </p>

<p>Here comes the new one? What's it going to be? No, it won't be
guns, this one starts easy. This one is the Surgeon General has
what? --Determined -- not &quot;we want a little more checking it
out&quot;, not &quot;we need a few more studies&quot;, not
&quot;reasonable people disagree&quot; -- &quot;The Surgeon
General has determined that the smoking of cigarettes will kill
you.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, all you need, and here is my formula, for a new
prohibition every time is what? We need an intractable,
difficult, social, economic, or medical problem. But that is not
enough. There has to be another thing. It has to divide by class
--- by social or economic class, between US and THEM. </p>

<p>And so, here it comes. ' </p>

<p>You know the Federal Government has been spending a lot of
money since 1968 trying to persuade us not to smoke. And, indeed,
the absolute numbers on smoking have declined very little. But,
you know who has quit smoking, don't you? In gigantic numbers?
The college-educated, that's who. The college-educated, that's
who doesn't smoke. Who are they? Tomorrow's what? Movers and
kickers, that's who. Tomorrow's movers and kickers don't smoke.
Who does smoke? Oh, you know who smokes out of all proportion to
their numbers in the society -- it is the people standing in your
criminal courtrooms, that's who. Who are they? Tomorrow's moved
and kicked, that's who. </p>

<p>And, there it is friends, once it divides between the movers
and kickers and the moved and kicked it is all over and it will
be all over very shortly. </p>

<p>It starts with &quot;You know, they shouldn't smoke, they are
killing themselves.&quot; Then it turns, as it has -- you see the
ads out here -- &quot;They shouldn't smoke, they are killing
us.&quot; And pretty soon, that class division will happen, we
will have the legislatures full of tomorrow's movers and kickers
and they are going to say just what they are going to say any
time now. &quot;You know, this has just gotta stop, and we got an
answer for it.&quot; We are going to have a criminal statute that
forbids the manufacture, sale, or possession of tobacco
cigarettes, or tobacco products period. </p>

<p>You know that the cigarette companies are expecting it. What
have they been doing? They have been shifting all of their
operations out of the United States and diversifying like crazy.
Where are they going to sell their cigarettes? In China, that's
where. And they are already moving, because they see it and I see
it. </p>

<p>Ready? What are we going to have? You know what we are going
to have. One day -- when's it gonna happen, ten years, fifteen?
-- some legislator will get up and, just as though it had never
been said before, &quot;You know we gotta solve this smoking
problem and I got a solution -- a criminal prohibition against
the manufacture, sale, or possession of tobacco cigarettes.&quot;
And then you know what happens. Then everybody who did want a
cigarette here today, if there is anyone here who smokes, you are
going to have to hide in the bathroom. And cigarettes are no
longer going to be three dollars a pack, they are going to be
three dollars a piece. And who's going to sell them to you? Who
will always sell them to you? The people who will sell you
anything -- organized crime. You got the concept, we will go
through the whole darn thing again because I am telling you this
country is hooked on the notion of prohibition. </p>

<p>Let me conclude, and again this is my prediction -- I will
tell you I don't think it is subject to opinion. Just look at it.
Just take a look at what has happened now and what will happen. I
will tell you how inexorable it is. If we get together here in
the year 2005, I will bet you that it is as likely as not that
the possession of marijuana may not be criminal in this state.
But the manufacture, sale, and possession of tobacco will be, and
why? Because we love this idea of prohibitions, we can't live
without them. They are our very favorite thing because we know
how to solve difficult, social, economic, and medical problems --
a new criminal law with harsher penalties in every category for
everybody.<br>

<p><b>THE HISTORY OF LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER OPIUM, COCAINE, AND
THEIR DERIVATIVES</b> </p>

<p><b>by</b> </p>

<p><b>David F. Musto, MD</b> </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> <br>
</h1>

<p>Legislative control over dangerous drugs may be dated from
attempts in the nineteenth century to prevent acute poisoning by
certain substances that might be purchased in ignorance of their
lethal potential or might be too easily available to would-be
suicides. Opium was being sold in a crude form containing about
10 percent morphine, as well as in concoctions derived from crude
opium: paregoric, laudanum, and a solution in acetic acid known
as &quot;black drop.&quot; Morphine had been isolated from opium
in 1805 by the German pharmacist, F. W. Serturner, but production
of the powerful active ingredient of opium on a large scale was
delayed until the 1830s.1 From that time onward, in factories in
Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, morphine was
produced in great quantities. Thus when in 1868, Great Britain
came to enact pharmacy laws to control dangerous substances,
&quot;opium and all preparations of opium or of poppies&quot; was
listed alongside such substances as oxalic acid as commodities
that could not be sold without being labeled &quot;poison.&quot;'
</p>

<p>The Pharmacy Act of 1868 is an important symbol of legislative
control in a Western country. The act was not the most strict
among nations; perhaps the Prussian regulations were stricter and
more comprehensive, but establishment by the British of some
limitation on the availability of dangerous drugs-drugs that
would eventually become more serious a problem for society as
addictive agents than as tools for suicide-was a policy also
followed by other European nations. It had an apparently
discouraging effect on the per capita consumption of opium,
opiates, and cocaine in the late nineteenth century and
contributed to the low level of British consumption (at least
compared to the American) right up to the 1960s.3 </p>

<p>The experience of the United States stands in contrast to
Britain's. The Pharmacy Act of 1868 was regulated in large part
by the organized association of pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical
Society (established 1841). In order to retail, dispense, or
compound &quot;poisons,&quot; or to assume the title of chemist,
druggist, pharmacist, or dispensing druggist or chemist, the
individual had to be registered by the Pharmaceutical Society. As
well as being the testing and registering body, the Society was
also given the initial responsibility for adding new drugs to the
poison list. Thus the law, which ultimately would be enforced in
British courts, was monitored by local members of the
Pharmaceutical Society as a tool in competition with unregistered
druggists, grocers, and anyone else who might attempt to purvey
these drugs to the public. </p>

<p>While the act presumably aided the public health by having
dangerous drugs sold or dispensed by individuals knowledgeable
about their qualities, it was also a convenient aid to the trade
of registered pharmacists. Although the drugs could be obtained
with no specific restraint on the amount or frequency of sale,
the bottles had to be labeled &quot;poison.&quot; A stricter
category of substances also required that the purchaser be an
acquaintance of the pharmacist or someone the pharmacist knew.
This list included arsenic and &quot;strychnine and all poisonous
alkaloids and their salts.&quot; The impact of this modest
obstacle to the acquirement of dangerous drugs should not be
underestimated. Further, the self-interest that would motivate
registered pharmacists to monitor breaches of the law provided an
unpaid, but interested, drug enforcement cadre scattered
throughout Great Britain. &quot;Patent medicines&quot; were
excepted from these controls, and this led to a campaign against
them later in the century, but the pure forms of the drugs, e.g.,
morphine suitable for injection, were restricted in availability
from the time of the Pharmacy Act onward.' In the United States,
throughout the nineteenth century, both medicine and pharmacy
remained essentially unorganized, although there were some
physicians and pharmacists attempting to organize their
professions. The American Medical Association, which was founded
in 1847 and which we now might think of as the dominant medical
organization, was a small and nationally unrepresentative group
until about World War 1.5 The American Pharmaceutical
Association, founded four years later, grew slowly and, like the
AMA, lacked the authority to license practitioners. The pharmacy
establishment was divided sharply among drug manufacturers,
wholesalers, and retailers, whose divergent interests the APhA
tried to coordinate, but each segment of the profession came to
work through its own organization: the National Wholesale
Druggists' Association (1882), the National Association of Retail
Druggists (1898), and many other groups.6 There was no national
group for the health professions to which government could turn
for regulation, even if the American constitutional system had
permitted such an arrangement. </p>

<p>Licensing of pharmacists and physicians, which was the central
government's responsibility in European nations, was, in the
United States, a power reserved to each individual state. In the
era of Andrew Jackson, any form of licensing that appeared to
give a monopoly to the educated was attacked as a contradiction
of American democratic ideals. State after state repealed the
medical licensing laws adopted in earlier days. Practical
concerns also supported repeal: Legislators preferred to leave it
to the patients to decide which of the many competing theories of
medicine was the best. Instead of moving toward a national system
of licensing for health professionals, therefore, individual
states were deregulating the professions. American medical
schools were similarly unregulated, and many flourished-some no
better than diploma mills. The states did not begin
reestablishment of medical licensing until the 1880s, and even
then the movement was spotty, with a wide range of standards.'
Pharmacists, also seeking to raise standards and limit
competition, likewise fought at the state level for licensing,
since the U.S. Constitution placed in the hands of states the
regulation of the health professions. Although some requirements
for labeling of over-the counter medicines would come with the
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as an exercise of the federal
right to regulate interstate commerce, in general, the nineteenth
and early twentieth century interpretation of the Constitution
favored a strict division between state and federal powers. </p>

<p>The status of legislative control of dangerous drugs during
the nineteenth century may be summed up as follows: The United
States had no practical control over the health professions, no
representative national health organizations to aid the
government in drafting regulations, and no controls on the
labeling, composition, or advertising of compounds that might
contain opiates or cocaine. The United States not only proclaimed
a free marketplace, it practiced this philosophy with regard to
narcotics in a manner unrestrained at every level of preparation
and consumption. </p>

<p>Through a slower pace of professional development, the United
States also lagged behind Britain and other European countries in
establishing broadly based organizations representing the
nation's physicians or pharmacists to which the central
government could turn for regulation. Second, the form of
government adopted in the United States, a federation of partly
independent states, was a conscious attempt to prevent
establishment of an all-powerful central government
characteristic of Europe. In the nineteenth century, this
remarkably successful form of government entailed each state
making its own regulation if it wished to; the result was an
array of controls that varied from one state to another. In fact,
states made little attempt to control addictive drugs until quite
late in the last century, and those efforts did not prove very
effective. </p>

<p>During the first part of the nineteenth century, the amount of
opiates used in the United States may have been comparable to
that used in Britain, where some areas, notably the fen counties,
had a fairly large per capita consumption. Inhabitants there
often took a dose of laudanum or some form of opium daily to keep
away the fevers associated with the marshlands.8 More generally,
parents reputedly purchased one or another form of opium to rub
on the gums of teething infants or to spoon-feed a child to
induce sleep so that the mother without provision for child care
could work in the local factory. These accounts are anecdotal,
but recent historical studies do suggest that the taking of some
form of opium for pain, sleep, or to ward off illness was not
uncommon. The occasional death of an infant from an overdose of
opium or the suicide of an adult by means of opium prompted
parliamentary interest in the distribution and labeling of the
drug. In large measure, the 1868 Pharmacy Act was the result. One
should note however, that through the provisions of the act and
the designation of the Pharmaceutical Society as the most
responsible body, the pharmacists also achieved some control over
the profession and a lead on the other health professions. A
somewhat similar victory for U.S. pharmacy would be found in the
details of the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1914.9 </p>

<p>In nineteenth-century America, the unimpeded importation of
opium and the free economy in opiates do give an advantage to the
historian, for estimates of per capita consumption are more
reliable when there are few restrictions on the importation,
sale, and consumption of a product. Because the growth of poppies
within the country and preparation of opium from them seem to
have been a minor contributor to American use, the import
statistics, begun in 1840 and continued to the present day, are
reliable as a guide to domestic consumption until the Harrison
Act of 1914. Certainly the minimum level and the trend can be
observed. After the Harrison Act, these statistics grew less
reliable, for smuggling becomes a more uncertain variable, but we
can say that at least during the nineteenth century the annual
per capita consumption rose steadily from about 12 grains in 1840
(an average single dose being one grain) until the mid-1890s,
when it reached 52 grains annually per capita. Then statistics
show that average individual consumption gradually subsided up to
1914, by which time the per capita rate had fallen back to the
level of about 1880.&quot; In Great Britain, the per capita
consumption declined during the latter half of the nineteenth
century.&quot; During that same period, opium use in the United
States rose dramatically. The peak of opiate addiction in the
United States occurred about the turn of the century, when the
number probably was close to 250,000 in a population of 76
million, a rate so far never equaled or exceeded. 12 Heroin had
been introduced into the pharmacy in 1898 and had contrasting
impacts in Britain and the United States. In New York City, the
addiction capital of the United States, heroin became the drug of
choice for recreational addicts, and the number of addicts was
measured in the tens of thousands by 1920. In Britain, the
addiction rate for heroin addicts by 1920 was minuscule. 13 Of
course, the use of drugs is determined by many factors, but I
would like to suggest that the contrast in easy availability of
narcotics in America and Britain-created by political and social
factors removed from considerations of addiction-underlay the
strikingly different rates of addiction each country experienced
well into this century. The rise in addiction with which we are
more familiar, that of the 1950s and more recently, appears to be
associated with additional factors that will be discussed later. </p>

<p>Americans have something to learn from their earlier and
extensive consumption of opiates, including heroin, and also
massive consumption of cocaine, which occurred before World War
I. This era is forgotten. We commonly act as if the heroin
&quot;epidemic&quot; of the 1960s or the current cocaine
&quot;epidemic&quot; is a new phenomenon in the United States,
that the widespread use of a drug implies that legalization or
&quot;decriminalization&quot; is the only reasonable response.
The history of attempts at legislative control in the United
States suggests that other courses may be effective and that
these alternatives to legalization appear to have reduced
enormous opiate and cocaine consumption in the United States
earlier in this century. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider
these early efforts at narcotic limitation if we are to approach
contemporary policy issues with an appreciation of the range of
policy options that reduce or encourage ingestion of these
substances. For in spite of the great difference in addiction
rates between the United States and Great Britain in 1920, the
United States did reduce its addiction rate to a relatively small
number. On the other hand, the low heroin addiction rate in Great
Britain prior to the 1950s did not prove a protection against
drug problems in that nation, although the level of use in
Britain has not reached the proportions to which we are
accustomed in the United States. Clearly the social and legal
factors affecting drug use are complex, and there is no single
influence that determines a particular level of drug use and
abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER OPIUM AND OPIATES TO 1914</b>
</p>

<p>The role of opium and its derivatives in the United States can
be traced independently from cocaine until 1914, when these
substances were linked together as &quot;narcotics&quot; through
the Harrison Act. Technically, only the opiates are narcotics,
that is, sleep-inducing, and they all have different effects.
Nevertheless, most dangerous drugs, including cannabis, were
grouped under the rubric &quot;narcotics&quot; from at least the
1920s until the 1960s. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, opium was available in many forms derived
from crude opium long before the nineteenth century. In America,
the two developments that spurred both consumption and concern
about opium were (1) the isolation of morphine and its injection
into the body with hypodermic syringes and (2) the introduction
of smoking opium, which had been brought to the United States
mainly by a feared minority, Chinese laborers imported to help
build western railroads. The much greater ease of addiction
through use of morphine compared to the more dilute forms
employed previously focused attention on the drug, medical
practitioners, and modern technology in the form of the
hypodermic syringe. </p>

<p>Consumption of opium in the United States rose steadily before
and after the Civil War. There had been complaints before the war
about &quot;opium drunkards&quot; by such prominent and
progressive physicians as Oliver Wendell Holmes, but in the
second half of the century, physicians, as well as the general
public, widely deplored opium and morphine addiction. To be
addicted to morphine was to harbor a shameful secret to be hidden
from others at whatever cost, a point illustrated in Eugene
O'Neill's moving play about his own family, Long Day's Journey
into Night. Written in his later years, it was based on his
mother's addiction by a thoughtless physician, and the pain of
this memory had remained so great that O'Neill would not permit
the play's production during his lifetime. The leading American
surgeon and the first professor of surgery at The Johns Hopkins
Hospital, William Stewart Halsted, was a morphine addict for the
last several decades of his life. His secret was kept hidden
carefully until the publication of Sir William Osler's private
diary in 1969.&quot; Osler had been Halsted's physician while
Osler was on the Hopkins faculty. Halsted's addiction did not
appear to interfere with his work. </p>

<p>Americans received opium and morphine not only from their
physicians for pain; they could receive what they wanted, for
whatever reason they chose, over the counter or from mail order
catalogues. The American free enterprise system, coupled with the
federal system of government, meant that a bottle heavily laced
with morphine could be sold across state lines as an
&quot;addiction cure&quot; and affirmed on the label to contain
no morphine whatsoever, quite within the law. States could pass
laws restricting such advertising, but they were not inclined to
do so. Patent medicine companies were the leading advertisers in
American newspapers. They developed an ingenious protection from
prying investigations or public pressure to reveal secret
formulas, or from any state requirement to make only valid claims
for effectiveness: The proprietary manufacturers included in
their lucrative contracts with newspapers a proviso that the
advertising agreement would be void if the state in which the
newspaper was published enacted any laws affecting the sale or
manufacture of the nostrums. 11 </p>

<p>In the nation's capital, the manufacturers also fought off
requirements that their nostrums be labeled as to contents. Bills
to enact such a law under the interstate commerce clause of the
Constitution were defeated repeatedly, but in the 1890s a new
reforming spirit was evident in the nation. These reforms were
extensive, ranging from control over the use of forest land, to
government inspection of meat and other comestibles and laws
relating to adulterants in foods, and to drugs considered unsafe.
Attention to the danger of narcotics using the term
broadly-accompanied the peak of per capita consumption in the
United States. It is clear that what were regarded as the most
negative aspects of drug use led to the passage of the new
legislation. The simplest reform, correct labeling, was part of
the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Any over-the-counter medicine
- commonly these would be &quot;patent medicines&quot;-had to be
labeled correctly as to inclusion of any of the following drugs:
morphine, cocaine, cannabis, or chloral hydrate. A long-desired
reform, it simply informed the purchaser whether any of these
drugs were present; it did not prevent purchase or restrict the
amount of the drug. 16 Nevertheless, reports at the time indicate
that the amount of these substances dropped from a third to a
half as a response to public concern.17 Although the newspapers
remained quiet, widely read magazines such as Collier's and
Ladies Home Journal railed against patent medicines, especially
against morphine and cocaine. Even after passage of the
truth-in-labeling laws, the magazines continued their exposes
unabated until the next major step, which was restriction on the
availability of the drugs themselves.&quot; </p>

<p>Tracing the movement to restriction, as opposed to labeling
accuracy, requires a step back to the mid-nineteenth century.
Patent medicines are thought to have created some addiction, but
the number of addicts is difficult to estimate. That physicians
addicted or assisted in the addiction of patients is more
certain. The problem of iatroaddiction initially was approached
by limiting renewal of prescriptions for opiates. These legal
controls were mostly in the form of additions to the health
statutes and depended for their efficacy on the judgments of
physicians and pharmacists. These controls would not, of course,
affect interstate commerce in narcotics or the familiar patent
medicines, which still could be bought over the counter. No
consistent police efforts to enforce these laws appear to have
been undertaken.18 </p>

<p>As the public and leaders of the health professions became
more aware of the growing number of those addicted to opiates,
chiefly morphine, state laws were amended to be more stringent,
and the police occasionally staged crackdowns. As will be
recalled, however, the professions were pretty much unorganized
and struggling to achieve mandatory licensing; a threat to take
away a license could not hold much fear until a license was
required to begin with. Legislators also felt, or at least
claimed, a helplessness when neighboring states did not enact
strict laws-a circumstance more familiar to us with variations
in- the legal drinking age between states-with the result that
enforcement was weak. This circumstance, combined with a poorly
trained medical profession, a lack of professional organization,
and an absence of laws controlling either patent medicine or
interstate commerce in drugs, left local controls more symbolic
than effective. </p>

<p>The nineteenth century's last decade brought the rise of what
would come to be called the Progressive Movement, a set of
reforms usually taking the form of federal laws affecting the
entire nation with the ostensible purpose of improving the
nation's morals or resisting the selfish actions of the rich and
powerful. Alongside it grew a temperance, soon a prohibition,
movement that would eventuate in the Eighteenth Amendment
mandating prohibition of alcohol distribution for nonmedical
purposes in the United States. In many ways, of course, the
antialcohol movement was part of the Progressive Era; its
startling success and later dramatic repeal have given the
alcohol issue a somewhat separate development in our minds, but
the interrelation between the battles against alcohol and against
narcotics is an important one. The antialcohol crusade helped
establish the attitude that there could be no compromise with the
forces of evil, that &quot;moderation&quot; was a false concept
when applied to alcohol: Prohibition was the only logical or
moral policy when dealing with this great national problem. By
the nineteenth century a new wave of state prohibition laws was
enacted. These were tempered by the contemporary constitutional
understanding that a state prohibition law did not prevent
purchase of liquor from a &quot;wet&quot; state, for that would
be a form of interstate commerce and not subject to the states'
powers. This assumption helped placate some doubters about
prohibition, but the staunch fighters against alcohol also sought
to remove that loophole. This they did through the Webb-Kenyon
Act of 1913. Without going into the details of the broad and
involved movement that led to national prohibition, we should
note that the significance for the control of narcotics is that
another dangerous substance, over which there was even more
dispute as to the means of control, progressed inexorably toward
a policy of &quot;no maintenance&quot; and no compromise. The
moral question of how to deal with a dangerous substance was
being fought out over alcohol, but the case would be stronger
even with narcotics when that issue was brought to national
deliberation. </p>

<p>The means by which the narcotics issue arose at the federal
level was accidental. Certainly it would have come to the
attention of Congress and the president eventually as a corollary
to the alcohol prohibition movement or as a way of controlling
addiction, which was becoming a target of journalist reformers
and physicians. It was acquisition of the Philippines through the
Spanish-American War that occasioned action by the federal
government. </p>

<p>Again, in order to understand how the Philippines forced the
central government to take action on opium, it is necessary to
appreciate the divisions between federal and state powers that
were so marked until the last half-century. The Philippines,
unlike a state, came directly and wholly under the control of the
federal government. At last, Congress could not avoid making
decisions on such matters as the local availability of opium.
Opium had been provided to Chinese on the Philippine Islands
through a Spanish government monopoly. Civil Governor William
Howard Taft considered whether the monopoly should be
reinstituted. It was his judgment that this would be reasonable
and that the profits from the opium monopoly could be used to
help educate Filipinos, a task the United States eagerly accepted
as it sought to provide a model government for its first colony.
20 </p>

<p>It was at the point in 1903, when this reinstitution was
passing through the Philippine government under the eye of Civil
Governor Taft, that the moral question of compromising with
&quot;evil&quot; affected the future of opium's legal
availability in that land. Missionaries in Manila and in the
United States had learned that &quot;tainted money&quot; from
opium sales was to be employed for education, and they besought
President Theodore Roosevelt to prevent this moral wrong. He
ordered Taft to stop the bill, and that was the end of it. The
mood of moral leaders in the United States was sufficient during
the first few years of this century to prevent any such
&quot;maintenance&quot; program, even if it was restricted, as
promised, to the Chinese in the Philippines. This immediate
reaction to allowing opium to be used for purely
&quot;recreational&quot; purposes, coming even before the Food
and Drug Act, gave a signal as to how the federal government
would respond to later questions regarding the legal supply of
opium to individuals, not for medical reasons but for enjoyment
or to satisfy their addiction. </p>

<p>In response to the veto from Washington, Governor Taft
appointed an Opium Investigation Committee to consider how other
Asian territories handled the opium problem. This committee
introduces us to Bishop Charles Henry Brent, the Protestant
Episcopal bishop of the Philippines, who had come out with Taft
to help in Americanization of this new possession. Bishop Brent
later would become world famous for his pioneer efforts to launch
the ecumenical movement among Christian churches, but his second
claim to fame was as a world leader against nonmedicinal uses of
narcotics. He was appointed to the committee, which traveled to
Japan, Formosa, Shanghai, Saigon, and Singapore examining how
other nations dealt with the opium user. He and the other members
of the committee found the Japanese policy in Formosa, a Japanese
possession since its seizure from China in 1895, to be the most
effective and enlightened. Japan opposed smoking opium but did
not try to stop confirmed addicts abruptly from indulging in
their habit. Japan, hoped to &quot;mature out&quot; the opium
smokers and leave an opium-free colony. In Japan, itself, opium
use was controlled stringently by the government, rare even among
Chinese aliens, and strongly deprecated by Japanese society. </p>

<p>The Philippine Opium Investigation Committee recommended that
(1) male opium smokers over 21 should be registered in order to
receive opium from a reinstituted government monopoly and (2)
after a three-year period, the amount provided the smokers be
reduced gradually until the smokers had been completely weaned
from the drug. 1 But Congress reacted more sternly. Congress
decreed immediate opium prohibition, except for medicinal
purposes, for all native Filipinos; non-Filipinos-mostly
Chinese-were allowed a three-year period of use. Over 12,000
non-Filipino opium users were registered, and their usual dosage
was maintained for two-and-onehalf years. During the final six
months of the three-year leniency period ending March 1908, the
opium provided was gradually reduced to zero. For official
purposes, opium smoking had stopped in the Philippine Islands.
One additional point: The opium dispensing stations established
under these laws were the first American narcotic clinics,
although their goal was not long-term maintenance but rather
registration and detoxification. </p>

<p>The Philippine situation forced the federal government to take
a stand on opium use for nonmedicinal purposes, and the decision
was to prohibit. To Congress, once the question was posed,
compromise with narcotics was not a politically practical
alternative. The Philippines also gave the United States
leadership of the international control of narcotics, a role it
still holds. It was apparent to the Opium Investigating Committee
that the solution to the Philippine opium problem lay in the
control of international trafficking in opium, as well as in the
curtailment of opium production in the original producing states,
such as India, China, Burma, Persia, and Turkey, to name some of
the most prominent sites for the cultivation of the opium poppy. </p>

<p>At the time that the Philippines were perceived to be a victim
of external sources of opium, the United States was having
increasing problems with the Chinese Empire. Owing to
maltreatment of Chinese in the United States, merchants in China
planned a voluntary embargo on American goods. This worried
American industrialists, wholesalers, exporters, and the federal
government. China had also embarked on a vigorous effort to rid
itself of opium use and, employing draconian methods, was having
some success. As a means to indicate good will to China, to aid
the Philippine opium problem, and to take an international
leadership position on a moral issue of the times, the United
States proposed, following Bishop Brent's suggestion to President
Roosevelt, to convene an international meeting at Shanghai to
consider the opium traffic among nations and to suggest ways in
which China's antiopium campaign might be aided. </p>

<p>Thus, the Shanghai Opium Commission came into being. It would
meet during February 1909, with Bishop Brent as its elected
president. The group was designated a &quot;commission&quot;
because the United States was unable to gain approval for a more
powerful convocation, a &quot;conference,&quot; which under
international law could draft a treaty that would, if ratified,
bind the signatory states. A &quot;commission,&quot; on the other
hand, could make findings of only fact or opinion. In addition to
the United States and China, those who accepted invitations to
Shanghai were Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Persia,
Japan, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Portugal, Siam, and
Russia. Turkey accepted but did not send a representative. Persia
was represented by a local merchant. </p>

<p>The resolutions adopted by the commission were merely
recommendations and, even as such, had a comfortable vagueness
that allowed a latitude of interpretations. For example,
Resolution Three, taking cognizance of the near unanimous
agreement that opium for nonmedicinal uses should be prohibited
or &quot;carefully regulated,&quot; called upon nations to
&quot;reexamine&quot; their laws. This could hardly be considered
a clarion call for prohibition of nonmedical uses, but it was
Brent's goal to achieve a series of resolutions that at least
pointed in the direction of action to control traffic in
narcotics, with the hope that a future conference would enact a
treaty initiating such control.&quot; </p>

<p>The road from the Shanghai Opium Commission to the Hague Opium
Conference, which convened in December 1911 and resulted in the
Opium Convention of 1912, was a tortuous one, but after the
Shanghai meeting, the United States continued to press for a
second and more significant gathering. Eventually, the nations
gathered in The Hague, and once again Bishop Brent was elected
the presiding officer. </p>

<p>The Hague Opium Convention (which concerned cocaine as well as
opium) placed the burden of narcotic control on the domestic
legislation of each nation. Chapter Three of the convention
called for control of each phase of the preparation and
distribution of medicinal opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, and
any new derivative that could be shown to have similar properties
.24 </p>

<p>The convention was not put into force by the dozen nations who
attended the First Opium Conference, for it was agreed that the
requirements would be held in abeyance until all forty-six world
powers had signed and ratified the convention. Eventually three
conferences were held, the second in 1913 and the third in 1914,
only weeks before the outbreak of World War 1. A compromise was
reached regarding the implementation of the treaty: Any ratifying
nation was permitted to put the treaty into effect in 1915, even
if ratification had not been unanimous. But only seven nations
did this by the end of the World War and the beginning of the
Versailles treaty negotiations in 1919. The United States
supported incorporating the Hague Convention into the Versailles
treaty, so that ratification of the treaty ending World War I
would at the same time bring the nation under the requirements of
the Hague Convention, which required national and domestic
legislation to control the preparation and distribution of
opiates and cocaine. Of course, the United States never did
ratify the Versailles treaty, but it had already ratified the
Hague Convention in 1913 and had put it into effect in 1915. One
significant result of the inclusion of the Hague Convention in
the Versailles treaty was the passage in Britain of the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1920, an action taken not because of any serious
problem with addiction but because, by ratifying the Versailles
treaty, Britain had committed itself to comprehensive domestic
legislation. 25 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DOMESTIC NARCOTIC LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES</b> </p>

<p>During the year or so prior to the Shanghai Opium Commission,
the United States suggested topics to be discussed in 1909, and
one of the topics was a report on domestic antinarcotic
legislation. Americans understood that strong and enforced
domestic legislation in other nations would result in diminishing
the flow of drugs into the United States, but would other nations
understand why the United States had no national antinarcotic
legislation whatsoever? Americans knew that federal-state
separation of powers made a national antinarcotic law rather
difficult, but the State Department decided that something should
be on the books when the U.S. delegation arrived in Shanghai. </p>

<p>The simplest law that could be framed and stand a chance of
passage by the U.S. Congress before the commission opened was one
that excluded from the United States opium not intended for
legitimate medical uses or, in other words, opium prepared for
smoking. Here there was an ironic combination of political
factors. The United States hoped one of the major effects of the
Shanghai Commission would be to placate China with regard to the
poor treatment given Chinese nationals in the United States. Such
treatment was in violation of our treaty obligations with China.
The impetus for banning smoking opium from the United States,
however, had developed from the fear and loathing of the Chinese,
who were associated intimately with this particular manner of
ingesting opium. Thus, the negative American attitude toward
Chinese aliens gave the push that passed a &quot;face
saving&quot; law designed to show China the good will of the
United States. </p>

<p>After the law was enacted on February 9, 1909, it was
announced dramatically in Shanghai to the other nations as proof
of American sincerity.26 And yet no one in the American
delegation or within the State Department had any illusions that
this law would control domestic narcotic use. Additional
legislation was seen as imperative both to curtail the American
narcotics problem and to display an American example to other
nations where the implementation of narcotics control programs
was essential to the solution of the American domestic problem. </p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton Wright, a physician with political interests who
had been appointed opium commissioner by the State Department in
1908, oversaw the State Department's preparation for the Shanghai
meeting, which included culling information from police
departments, physicians, pharmaceutical houses, etc., regarding
the narcotic problem and consumption in the United States. Bishop
Brent was the chairman of the delegation, but after his elevation
to the commission's presidency, Wright became the acting head.
Back in Washington after the commission meeting, Wright took up
the battle for an international meeting that could frame a treaty
and played a leading role in the preparation of domestic
antinarcotic legislation. He had opposition within the State
Department on both questions, but he finally won the assent of
Philander C. Knox, the secretary of state, and moved ahead. </p>

<p>Wright, who combined an aggressive personal style with
self-righteousness and a thirst for political preferment, was
less effective than he otherwise might have been. He never got
the prize plum for which he yearned, the ministry to China, and
his chief claim for notability, the Anti-Narcotic Act of 1914,
known even then as the &quot;Harrison&quot; Act, left him at the
moment of achievement with almost no further role in the
antinarcotic movement. Eventually, he volunteered to help the
wounded on the western front during World War 1, was injured 27
there in an automobile accident, and died in 1917 in Washington.
His indomitable wife, Elizabeth Washburn Wright, carried on his
28 battle for world control of narcotics until her death in 1952.
</p>

<p>In late 1909 Dr. Wright proposed a domestic law that would be
based on the federal government's power of taxation. The
alternative federal power was that over interstate commerce, but
Wright believed that taxation would result in a detailed
accounting of narcotics from their introduction into the United
States to their distribution to manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers, including pharmacists and physicians. Heavy fines
would be levied on anyone not keeping records accurately or
selling and transferring these products without proper reporting
and payment of taxes. </p>

<p>Wright tried to solve the federal/state dichotomy in this
manner: The information obtained by this proposed law would be
made available to state boards of pharmacy and medicine, which
would then take appropriate action to ensure that &quot;the
proper relations . . . should exist between the physician, the
dispensing druggist, [and] those who have some real need of the
drugs.' &quot;29 So it is evident that at this early stage, two
years before the Hague Convention, Wright and the State
Department did not envision a federal role in policing the
relationships between, say, an addict and his or her supplying
pharmacist or physician. The sanctity of the state's police
powers would be maintained; the federal government would supply
only information. Reformers believed that the information,
however, could lead a responsible state agency to take only one
action, that is, to curb the supply of narcotics to those who did
not have a medical need for it-and &quot;mere&quot; addicts did
not fall into that category. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Foster Anti-Narcotic Bill (1910-1911)</b> </p>

<p>Republican Congressman David Foster of Vermont introduced
Wright's bill in April 1910. In addition to opium and cocaine, as
in the eventual Harrison Act, the bill was aimed at cannabis
(marijuana) and chloral hydrate, the same substances the Food and
Drug Act of 1906 required to be revealed on labels. It did not
allow small amounts of the drugs in mild remedies such as cough
syrup to be exempt from the stringent reporting requirements and
their severe penalties. Druggists feared the multitude of stamps
and labels at each stage; the fines, which would range from $500
to $5,000; and the one-to-five-year jail sentences. The word
&quot;knowingly&quot; did not qualify the prohibited actions,
making it likely that simple errors without any intention to
deceive would result in horrendous punishments. Although support
for the bill could be found, the individuals in the drug trade
would not endorse the detailed and hazardous provisions of the
Foster Bill. It never came to a vote in the Sixty-first Congress,
which ended in March 1911.30 </p>

<p>The next Congress was marked by a significant change: For the
first time in almost two decades, the Democrats gained control of
the House of Representatives. The South now had achieved new
importance, in that committee chairmanships changed hands. In the
Sixty-second Congress the Foster Bill became the Harrison Bill,
named after Francis Burton Harrison, a New York City Democrat who
served on the Foreign Relations Committee. Dr. Wright continued
his difficult task of trying to obtain the most stringent bill
consistent with winning essential political support from the
medical and pharmaceutical interests and now from the Democratic
Party. In order to mitigate the severity of the original Foster
Bill, the drug trades established the National Drug Trade
Conference, which would represent the major trade associations
and try to reach a compromise position on the complex
antinarcotic bill. The NDTC, which first met in Washington, D.C.,
in January 1913, provided the most powerful influence on the
writing of what would become known as the Harrison Act.&quot; </p>

<p>The attitude of the newly influential southern Democrats
toward any potential invasion of states' rights now had to be
taken more seriously. These politicians feared an interference
with the South's local laws, which enforced racial segregation
and Negro disenfranchisement. They remembered the era of
&quot;reconstruction,&quot; when the North ruled the South
following 1865, and wanted to maintain the authority the white
citizenry had subsequently won with the withdrawal of troops and
&quot;carpetbaggers.&quot; The narcotic control proposals
threatened to intrude federal authority into the states,
affecting local pharmacists and physicians and threatening to
reach right into a neighborhood and send an individual to federal
prison. Furthermore, this example of using the federal tax power
primarily to achieve a moral end-for the taxes were not intended
to bring in a significant revenue but rather to force disclosure
and compliance with rules of narcotics distribution-could be a
precedent for other concerns brewing in the United States, such
as protecting Negro voting rights in the South. </p>

<p>Dr. Wright, therefore, faced a new set of attitudes in the
Democratic-controlled House. He reacted by stressing the impact
of narcotics, especially cocaine, on Negroes. He attributed
attacks on whites to the crazed Negro cocaine fiend. He also
argued that many poor Negroes would not have the energy or
knowledge to send away for the cocaine, so the conclusion must be
that northern businessmen who did not care about the South's
concerns were shipping-via interstate commerce-cocaine to
Negroes. Further, unscrupulous or ignorant employers were said to
be supplying cocaine to their Negro workers .32 </p>

<p>One further concern about the precedent the antinarcotic law
would provide related to the flourishing prohibition movement. As
prohibition was achieved in state after state, the loophole for
at least the upper and middle classes was that alcohol could be
ordered across state lines and shipped into a dry state, for
interstate commerce was regulated by the federal government,
which so far was not teetotal. The Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913,
however, was passed to close this loophole, survived President
Taft's veto, and, much to the surprise of many, was declared
constitutional by the Supreme Court. This occurrence removed one
of the stumbling blocks to the Harrison Bill, for now a national
antinarcotic law could not serve as a precedent for curtailing
interstate commerce in a dangerous substance. </p>

<p>In the course of all this maneuvering, no one rallied to the
defense of any of the drugs named for control except that
occasionally cannabis was described by someone as not
habit-forming or not as serious as opium or cocaine. Perhaps
because the cannabis problem was not seen to be serious or
because the drug did not seem so dangerous, it was dropped from
the proposed law. Chloral hydrate, a sleeping medicine, was also
dropped. The attitude toward opium and cocaine, however, was
almost totally condemnatory. The only question was how to control
their distribution most efficiently, since they had medicinal
value but were also considered dangerously addicting. This was in
sharp contrast with alcohol; its use divided the nation, and huge
legitimate industries depended upon its continued consumption. </p>

<p>The government and the trades eventually reached agreement on
the proposed law by moderating the record-keeping provisions,
reducing penalties, and allowing the sale of patent medicines
with small amounts of narcotics in them. Representative Harrison
introduced it in June 1913, and it was passed quickly by the
House. In the Senate some amendments were offered, a few with an
apparent goal of destroying the bill's chances of passage. In
August of 1914, though, the Senate passed the bill, albeit with a
few modifications that were compromised in Conference Committee.
Finally, on December 17, 1914, President Wilson signed it into
law, to become effective March 1, 1915. At last the United States
had redeemed its pledge to other nations that it would enact a
stringent law, as it had urged every other nation to do. </p>

<p>The significance of the Harrison Act to strategists like Dr.
Wright, though, was more than just the satisfaction of redeeming
pledges made to questioning representatives of other nations. For
him, the Harrison Act was the implementation of the Hague
Convention of 1912, which called upon signatories to enact
domestic legislation controlling narcotics supplies and
distribution. Understood as the fulfillment of treaty
obligations, the Harrison Act would have the authority to usurp
the states' police powers, for the Constitution in Article Six
gives treaties concluded by the United States supremacy over the
laws of states. This would resolve the problem of states' rights
interfering with the ability of a national law to require a
uniform compliance with strict narcotics control .33 </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court at first did not give a very
strict interpretation to the Harrison Act. In the first Jin Fuey
Moy case (1916), the Court declared by a six-to-two majority that
the Harrison Act could not be understood as having been required
by the Hague Convention and that physicians could prescribe as
they saw fit, even to simple addicts. 34 This decision was a
stunning blow to federal enforcement, which, from the first day
of the act's implementation, was directed at pharmacists and
physicians who sold prescriptions or treated addicts without any
intent to cure them. </p>

<p>World War 1, arriving at almost the same time as the Harrison
Act, profoundly affected American attitudes, creating an intense
desire to purify the nation as it girded itself to fight for
democracy against the barbarism of the Kaiser. The fall of Russia
and the spread of Bolshevism intensified fears of contagion and
the desire to be sure that the United States remained pure and
strong. Prohibition took giant strides during World War 1. The
Prohibition Amendment in an early form nearly passed the House in
December 1914, a week after the passage of the Harrison Act. In
1916 it did pass, and by January 1919 Prohibition had become part
of the Constitution as the Eighteenth Amendment. Earlier,
Congress had passed wartime prohibition, which was intended to
save grain for the war effort as well as to promote efficiency in
war production plants. Similarly, a battle was being fought to
overturn the Jin Fuey Moy decision, which had weakened the
government's intention for the Harrison Act. A Treasury
Department committee reported that the number of addicts in the
nation was over a million.&quot; These exaggerated figures, as
well as a fear about returning veterans having become addicted on
the battlefield and the specter of alcohol prohibition, which
might drive alcoholics to morphine and cocaine, led to a new
attempt to put teeth into the Harrison Act. This time the
government was successful. </p>

<p>In March 1919, two months after the ratification of the
Eighteenth Amendment (which would go into effect a year later),
the Supreme Court ingeniously decided, five to four, that to call
a prescription for narcotics intended to supply a
&quot;mere&quot; addict with maintenance doses was an error, for
such a script could not be considered a true prescription given
in the proper conduct of medical practice. Since it was not a
prescription, the issuing physician had conveyed narcotics
without the required tax; he had therefore violated the Harrison
Act and could be arrested. The four dissenting justices were the
conservatives, who argued that this was an invasion of states'
police powers, while the majority, including Holmes and Brandeis,
felt that more power had to be given the government if it was to
carry out its duty to protect the public from such an insidious
evil .36 At last, the intent of the reformers had been achieved:
Simple maintenance was outlawed, and the federal government could
take action nationwide to arrest and convict health professionals
who practiced it. Narcotics now had a no-maintenance policy,
which a few months later would also be the policy for alcohol.
Enforcement of both prohibitions would be the responsibility of a
unit in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, reflecting the similarity
of the two conceptions. </p>

<p><b>Enforcement During the 1920s</b> </p>

<p>Several additional laws completed the early legislative
structure of American control of opium and cocaine. Some were
minor, such as a stipulation that no finished products such as
heroin or morphine could be imported into the United States.37
The law stated that only coca leaves and crude opium could be
imported and that the finished products, cocaine, morphine,
heroin, codeine, etc., were to be manufactured in American
pharmaceutical factories, which were given a monopoly to produce
these substances. This may have made up for revenues lost, as the
amounts sold legally in the United States fell after the Harrison
Act. Other laws dealt with transshipment of drugs 38 across the
United States for foreign markets. </p>

<p><b>Heroin</b> </p>

<p>Perhaps the most important addition to the Harrison Act's
control of opiates and cocaine came in 1924, when the United
States banned the importation of opium to be used for the
manufacture of heroin.39 The observance of federal-state
boundaries is evident in this law, for it does not ban the
manufacture of heroin altogether but only the importation of
crude opium for that purpose. Just that much seemed to be within
the power of the federal government. Also, this did not require
the seizure of heroin legally available in the United States for
cough medicines (the original claim for heroin's value) or for
certain other purposes, chiefly pain control or &quot;twilight
sleep&quot; during child birth. </p>

<p>Heroin had been made available commercially by the Bayer
Company of Germany in 1898 as a superior cough suppressant.40 The
Bayer Company believed that the addition of acetyl groups to the
basic molecule would make morphine more palatable, and this
product, diacetylmorphine, the company named Heroin, a trademark
that was protected until Germany lost such protections as a
result of losing the First World War. Similarly, by adding an
acetyl group to salicylic acid to make it less irritating to the
stomach when taken for joint pains, the Bayer Company launched
another successful venture. In 1899 the company named sodium
acetyl salicylic acid Aspirin, which similarly was protected by
trademark until World War 1. Few pharmaceutical firms can take
credit for naming and distributing two drugs that remain among
the most popular in Western society even after nearly a hundred
years. </p>

<p>Heroin essentially had been unrestricted in the United States
prior to the Harrison Act, and by 1912 in New York City it had
replaced morphine as the drug of recreational choice among
youthful males, according to the records of Bellevue Hospital.
The addictive nature of heroin had been recognized rather
quickly, for the AMA issued a warning in 1902. Heroin was popular
because it could be inhaled by sniffing, like cocaine, as well as
injected by needle. When injected into the bloodstream, heroin
crossed the blood-brain barrier more quickly than morphine and
therefore gave a more intense, but briefer, &quot;high.&quot;
During the years of intense concern over social control, which
began with the First World War, heroin became linked with male
gang violence and the commission of crimes. Some believed that
heroin stimulated the user to commit crimes or at least provided
the courage to pull off a bank robbery or mugging. In the early
1920s most of the crime in New York City was blamed on drug use,
chiefly the opiates, including heroin.41 </p>

<p>The preference for heroin over morphine by recreational users,
and the belief that other opiates could fulfill heroin's role as
a painkiller and cough suppressant, led to a move to ban heroin
for medical purposes. The heroin problem also contributed to
American fear of foreign nations after World War 1, for the drug
was being manufactured in other countries and then smuggled into
the United States. The Swiss drug industries, for example,
produced large amounts of heroin, which found its way into this
country. Heroin's image as a foreign product popular with feared
domestic groups helped support an isolationist stance,
illustrated by the American refusal to join or even recognize the
League of Nations. Influential congressmen, such as Stephen G.
Porter, Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign
Relations, urged that all heroin production in the United States
be stopped. As an example he would try to get other nations 42 to
follow at the Geneva Opium Conferences of 1924 and 1925. </p>

<p>The United States did enact the legislation sought by
Congressman Porter, but it failed to achieve its goals at the
meetings in Geneva. In fact, in disgust at the refusal of other
nations to agree to curb production of poppies and coca bushes,
the ultimate source of heroin 43 and cocaine, the United States
walked out of the conference. The United States, which had
founded the world antinarcotic movement in Shanghai and The
Hague, now saw it taken over by the League of Nations (as the
Versailles treaty had mandated) and controlled by the very
nations the United States sought to shame or force into a
narcotics policy that the United States viewed as responsible.
American participation in the worldwide effort then fell to a low
point until the 1930s, when participation was resumed in
international meetings. By the outbreak of World War II, the
United States was again achieving significant participation in
international antidrug activities. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMERICAN DOMESTIC CONTROL TO THE MARIJUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</b>
</p>

<p>The use of cocaine, which had been in &quot;soft&quot; drinks
like Coca-Cola until 1903 and was available easily to sniff as a
treatment for sinusitis or hay fever, fell precipitously after
reaching a peak somewhere around 1905. By the 1930s cocaine use
had receded, and during the 1950s physicians and narcotics agents
alike described cocaine use as a problem that once was serious in
the United States but now was practically absent. Several reasons
for its reduced use can be suggested. The drug had been
introduced as a wonder substance-Freud had called it the first
medicine that worked as an antidepressant. The Parke-Davis
Company manufactured it after 1885 in many forms for drinking,
smoking, inhaling, or rubbing on the skin. Within about a decade,
warnings surfaced. Consumption peaked about twenty years after
its initial distribution, and around the same time the accounts
of its effect on the lives of its users and its popularly
believed-although questionable-special link with southern blacks
created in the public's mind an image so fearful that cocaine's
effects became the extreme against which other drugs would be
compared. Cocaine's association with violence, paranoia, and
collapsed careers made laws against it by 1910 a popular matter.
The first strict antinarcotic law in New York State was passed in
1913 and was directed at cocaine. Al Smith, later to be an
anti-Prohibition candidate for president and critic of
Prohibition in his state while he was governor, drew the strict
anticocaine measure in his early years as a state assemblyman.44
The combination of strict laws and intense public support of
control measures brought on a reduction in consumption, which, at
the peak of its popularity, must have seemed most unlikely if not
impossible. </p>

<p>The effect of the Harrison Act, its court interpretations, and
supplementary legislation also appear to have reduced greatly the
number of opiate addicts. The medical and pharmacy professions
were denied an easy way of providing drugs. Although it is clear
that only a fraction of either profession was liberal in their
provision, this nevertheless had been enough to maintain a large
number of users. It had been argued recently that the
recreational users began to stand out more prominently, as the
medically addicted and more sedate group declined in numbers, and
that the relatively small number of addicts in the United States,
about 50,000 in 1940, would have had an &quot;underworld&quot; or
unsavory character even without the Harrison 45 Act's
criminalization of drug use. This point of view contrasts sharply
with the argument that the Harrison Act changed citizens who were
normal except for their addiction into criminals who had 46 to
violate the law to obtain their daily supply of opiates. Whatever
the reason, the number of those addicted fell from about a
quarter million around 1900 to much less than half that number by
World War II. The war effectively reduced supplies of narcotics
to the United States, and in 1945 the United States probably had
its lowest number of opiate addicts since the mid-nineteenth
century. The rise of addiction after World War 11 may have built
on the core of addicts left in the nation, but the dynamics of
the addiction epidemic that began in the 1960s appear in certain
respects to have had a different character. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>NARCOTIC CLINICS, 1913-1925</b> </p>

<p>In order to close the story of the decline in addiction after
1900, it is necessary to consider the legendary narcotic clinics
that, like the Philippine opium dispensaries, were intended to
deal with addicts who no longer could receive opiate or cocaine
supplies from local physicians .47 The first in the United States
was opened in 1912 by Charles Terry, the public health officer of
Jacksonville, Florida, where he provided both opiates and cocaine
to men and women, blacks and whites. Dr. Terry went on to become
a student of the opium problem in the United States and compiled
a classic book of reports, excerpts from articles, and
statistical information in <a
href="../Library/studies/op/opmenu.htm">The Opium Problem</a>,
published in 1928 and co-authored by Mildred Pellens. </p>

<p>Other clinics followed, particularly after the Treasury
Department, in enforcement of the Harrison Act, prosecuted or
threatened with prosecution health professionals who supplied
addicts indefinitely. A series of clinics in New England were
established at the suggestion of officials of the Internal
Revenue Bureau. In New York State, the crackdown on druggists and
physicians emanated from state law, and clinics were established
in upper New York State through state planning and authorization.
Registration of addicts was permitted so that physicians would
restrict maintenance to those already addicted. </p>

<p>In New York City, the Health Department did not wish to
provide opiates, morphine, and heroin on an indefinite basis but
did open a clinic at the city Health Department headquarters.
This clinic provided heroin, but only as an inducement to
registration and eventual detoxification and rehabilitation.
About 7,500 addicts registered, received their drug of choice in
dosages gradually decreased until uncomfortably small, usually
three to eight grains of morphine daily, and were offered
curative treatment. Most declined to be cured. Those who did
receive treatment, at North Brother Island, seemed both
unappreciative and very liable-the estimate was 95 percent - to
return to narcotics available on the street or from a physician
or druggist. </p>

<p>The Treasury Department, armed with fresh Supreme Court
decisions of March 1919, started to close down the clinics, along
with prosecuting the dispensing physicians and druggists. One
argument was that the availability of easy maintenance inhibited
cures and also that giving legal permission for maintenance
clinics undercut the Treasury Department's position when it
brought action against a professional for reckless provision of
drugs. From a legal point of view, the &quot;reckless&quot;
provider was obeying the tax laws, as was the clinic, unless the
federal government wanted to get into the question of medical
competence, which was a state, not a federal, concern. </p>

<p>Gradually the clinics were closed, the last one in 1925 in
Knoxville, Tennessee. Some had been operated poorly, others quite
responsibly with community support. Yet, because of the
intricacies of the tax powers under which the federal law
operated, all were closed, even if unfair harassment was
necessary to discourage the operation. The number of registrants
was not large, about 3,000 if we exclude the New York City
clinic, which was not intended for maintenance but for bait to
get addicts into detoxification. The number of addicts registered
under the New York State law, which provided for maintenance not
only in clinics but also from private physicians and pharmacists,
eventually totaled about 13,000 in 1920. It can be assumed,
therefore, that the clinics were not a major element in the
maintenance of addiction in the United States. One side note: The
13,000 addicted registrants in New York State in 1920 add up to
the largest number of legally supplied addicts recorded in any
Western country this century, a number not approached yet by
Britain under the socalled &quot;British System.&quot; Although
the &quot;American System&quot; preceded and surpassed in size
any scheme attempted then or subsequently in Britain, it was in
fact the large number of addicts in America that made maintenance
so unwieldy and unpopular. </p>

<p>The demise of the clinics left drug peddlers and individual
members of the health professions as the major targets of the
federal government. Generally, the physicians did not wish to
treat addicts, nor did they have any sympathy with addicts. Those
physicians who, for whatever reason, did continue to treat
addicts with maintenance doses were threatened and arrested,
unless the maintenance had been approved by the local narcotic
agent. Some maintenance was permitted, but only on a case-by-case
evaluation. From reports prepared by agents upon investigating
narcotic clinics, it appears that an acceptable life-style was a
requirement for permission to be maintained.48 </p>

<p>A theory had been advocated, mostly among maintaining
physicians in New York City, that longstanding addiction changed
the body's physiology in such a way that opiates were necessary
for the patient to remain normal.49 Too little opiate and the
patient would experience withdrawal, too much and the patient
would be &quot;high,&quot; but just the right amount would allow
normal feelings and behavior. </p>

<p>This, of course, is close to the argument made in the 1950s by
Drs. Dole and Nyswander to justify methadone maintenance. After a
series of scientific studies shortly after World War 1, the
government concluded otherwise .50 Those physicians who insisted
on maintaining patients without approval from a narcotics agent
ran a serious risk of arrest and, if convicted, loss of a medical
license and time in a federal penitentiary. In spite of the
danger, of course, some physicians supplied narcotics without
restraint or with very poor judgment, but evidence shows that
other, responsible physicians were entrapped without good reason
in order to boost the number of an agent's arrests and thereby
bolster his chances for promotion.51 An aura of fear, therefore,
accompanied a physician's decision to give an opiate to a
patient, especially a new patient. On the other hand, the
casualness with which physicians once handed out morphine or some
other opiate was reduced considerably. </p>

<p>Along with the rejection of maintenance, physicians
unfortunately had no effective medical cure available for
addiction. Several had been promoted in many forms in the
nineteenth and early twentieth century, but each had been found
to have no scientific merit .52 The problem devolved into a
decision of whether to stop opiates abruptly and thereby cause
the patient to go directly into full Withdrawalthe so-called
&quot;cold turkey&quot; approach-or gradually to reduce the
opiate over a few days or a few weeks. Because the addicted
person frequently has a threshold of average daily consumption
below which the user becomes acutely uncomfortable, and because a
yearning for heroin or morphine often persists for months or
years after the beginning of withdrawal, the decision to detoxify
abruptly or gradually usually was a difficult path for the
patient. Nevertheless, detoxification was the preferred route for
legal reasons. Two ancient warnings about detoxification, that
the patient would die in withdrawal, or that a supply cutoff
would precipitate a rash of suicides, did not materialize. </p>

<p>During the 1920s and 1930s the number of addicts diminished in
the United States. Grossly exaggerated estimates came from
antidrug entrepreneurs like Captain Richmond Pearson Hobson, who
had been a Prohibition advocate before unleashing his energies
against heroin and later marijuana as the head of several
national and international voluntary groups.&quot; Captain Hobson
attacked heroin in a most melodramatic manner, claiming there
were 4 million addicts in the United States and comparing them
all to lepers. In spite of Hobson, the concern over opiate
addicts and cocaine users declined during the two decades after
World War I. </p>

<hr>

<p><a href="../hemp/taxact/taxact.htm"><b>MARIJUANA TAX ACT OF
1937</b></a> </p>

<p>With the battle against opiate addiction apparently at a more
stable, less alarming level in the 1930s and the use of cocaine
having declined dramatically, a new dangerous drug appeared on
the American horizon: marijuana. Marijuana smoking arrived in the
United States with Mexican farm workers who had crossed the
border, mostly to labor in agricultural fields in the Southwest
and in sugar beet fields as far north as Montana and Michigan.
During the prosperous 1920s, about half-a-million farm workers
came to the United States, but as the Depression's widespread
unemployment laid an increasingly heavy burden on the country's
citizens, the Mexicans became an unwelcome group, encouraged in
all ways to return to Mexico. Entwined with the troubles they
were said to cause local citizens was the Mexicans' custom of
growing marijuana for their own use. Hence, marijuana was linked
to violence, dissolute living, and Mexican aliens.53 </p>

<p>The greatest fear of marijuana in the United States lay in the
West and Southwest. The government was importuned to take action,
but the recent experience with alcohol prohibition (which had
ended in 1933) made the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) and its
head, Harry J. Anslinger, formerly of the Prohibition Bureau,
hesitant to get involved in a drug that grew domestically and
prolifically. Cocaine and heroin were both foreign imports and
therefore, at least theoretically, could be regulated more
easily, but marijuana appeared to be almost impossible to curb,
let alone eradicate. The FBN tried to address this drug by
including it in a recommended uniform state narcotic law that
would leave to localities the question of prosecution and
allocation of enforcement resources. Then a curious law intended
to reduce the number of machine guns provided the federal
government with a mechanism to attack marijuana nationally and at
the federal level. </p>

<p>The Firearms Act of 1934 decreed that a machine gun could not
be transferred in any way without the payment of a transfer tax
(from which law enforcement personnel were exempted). As odd as
this mechanism may sound, the law was upheld by the Supreme Court
in 1937 as a legitimate use of the power of taxation for a moral
objective. Within weeks of this decision, the Treasury
Department, which housed the FBN, appeared before Congress asking
for a transfer tax for marijuana. Without a stamp permit and the
proper tax stamps, marijuana could not be sold, bartered, or
given away. Congress quickly approved the bill, and President
Franklin Roosevelt signed it into law later in 1937.
Unfortunately for the enforcement of this law, the FBN did not
receive any more money or agents. Therefore, the FBN relied on
obnoxious descriptions of marijuana to do the job. The substance
was described to the public as a danger at least equal to cocaine
or morphine, and the penalties for its illegal use or possession
were severe. Because use of marijuana does not seem to have been
great in the 1930s, the law's extraordinary severity did not
concern the general public until the 1960s, when thousands of
users were arrested as marijuana's popularity burgeoned.
Furthermore, the contrast between the effects of marijuana
observed in the 1960s and the longstanding claims of the FBN
regarding marijuana led to a problem concerning the credibility
of official statements, which still affects popular perceptions. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>WORLD WAR II TO THE PRESENT</b> </p>

<p>The Second World War ended with relatively few opiate addicts
and very little use of cocaine or marijuana in the United States.
The only closely controlled drug rising in use was alcohol,
consumption of which had increased in per capita rates since the
repeal of Prohibition. During all this period, sleeping pills and
other barbiturates were prescribed widely but did not appear to
be a similar problem. The same holds true for the amphetamines,
which had been made available in the 1930s and continued to be
manufactured and prescribed without restriction. </p>

<p>Treatment of hard-core addicts did take place at the two
federal narcotics hospitals in Lexington, Kentucky, and Fort
Worth, Texas. Each was, in fact, a prison in which addicts were
treated and forced to detoxify, but the patients/prisoners
frequently resumed their drug habits when they returned to their
previous environments. Around 1950 a younger age group began to
be admitted for heroin addiction, an abuse that reached a very
high level in 1970 and remains high today. This threat elicited
two responses. First, the federal government enacted more severe
laws that levied mandatory sentences for conviction of dealing in
narcotics. The laws, enacted in 1951 and 1956, are the peak of
legal penalties against narcotics, including marijuana, in the
United States.55 </p>

<p>The second response reflected the domestic and international
tensions of the time. The heroin menace-and it should be
reemphasized that cocaine and marijuana were not seen as anything
but potentially major problems in the 1950s-was ascribed to the
infiltration of the drug trade by Chinese Communists who had
taken over the China mainland in 1949. The Red Chinese
purportedly sent heroin to the United States to undermine our
democracy and at the 56 same time obtain specie, for which they
had a desperate need. By the 1970s, however, the United States
was defending the People's Republic of China against the same
charge, now levied by Soviet newspapers.57 Such are the vagaries
of international relations and the domestic drug problem. </p>

<p>Heroin addicts in the 1950s mainly were young males
concentrated in black and Hispanic urban ghettos. These addicts
concerned the federal government, as well as reform-minded
lawyers, academics, and physicians. The latter groups found the
harsh penalties and the loathing attitude toward the addicts to
be inhumane. Leaders of this countermovement included sociologist
Professor Alfred Lindesmith and the attorney Rufus King. They
believed a more relaxed approach would be much more successful,
as well as more kind. Rather than depriving addicts of heroin,
heroin should be provided them. Rather than jailing addicts, they
should be hospitalized, if necessary, or just left alone.58</p>

<p>This alternative view competed with the more hard-line style
of law enforcement exemplified by Commissioner Anslinger. After
forty or more years, treating addicts medically, which had been
popular before World War I and had then been found inadequate to
the task of reducing addiction, became part of public policy in
the 1960s. Methadone, a synthetic opiate developed in Germany in
World War 11, was used by Dole and Nyswander to provide
maintenance under theories similar to those which had justified
maintenance prior to the restrictive Supreme Court decisions in
1919. This marked a major break in American narcotic control
policies; maintenance again was legal, although not with heroin
or morphine. </p>

<p>Along with the possibility of maintenance, other milder forms
of control were invoked by the federal government. Civil
commitment to a narcotic treatment center,, thought more humane
than prison sentences, became possible legally in 1966, although
in subsequent years this did not prove a practical method either
to reduce addiction or to cure addicts in any marked number.59 </p>

<p>Also in the 1960s, an enthusiasm for drug consumption of all
kinds, polydrug abuse, replaced the habitual use of one or two
drugs, which had been more common in the past. Marijuana became
very popular with young people, and then gradually its popularity
expanded in both directions to even younger and to older ages.
Psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, appeared on the scene, along with
injectable methedrine or &quot;speed.&quot; Drugs came to
symbolize opposition to the government and older mores. The
turmoil and dissension caused by the Vietnam War added to the
sense of alienation many young people already felt from the older
generation, which frowned on drug use other than alcohol and
tobacco. In addition to cultural alienation and the rapid
increase in multidrug use, the drug problem in the 1960s was
intensified by the extraordinarily large number of young people
in the ages most likely to experiment with drugs; the post-World
War 11 &quot;baby boom&quot; generation had reached the teenage
years. </p>

<p>By 1970, marijuana was used commonly, and research was showing
that it did not have the awful effects ascribed to it from the
1930s onward. Various groups and individuals initiated movements
to legalize the substance, perhaps along the lines of tobacco.
The drug situation was perceived by the public and the federal
government to be so bad and yet so difficult to control that this
seemed a good time to reevaluate the nation's entire policy. A
National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse was established
in 1971. </p>

<p>In general, the members of the commission reflected
traditional views on the subject of drug control, and therefore
it was with even greater impact that the commission recommended
in its first report, &quot;Marijuana: A Signal of
Misunderstanding,&quot; that the substance be
&quot;decriminalized.&quot; By decriminalization was not meant
legalization but a step short of that position: Marijuana
possession for individual use no longer would be a crime, but its
sale and distribution would be against the law. The purpose of
control at this stage would be to relieve law enforcement
agencies of the nuisance of arresting individual users and
thereby allow more resources to be concentrated on investigating
large-scale crime and more dangerous drugs.6o The notion of
&quot;decriminalization&quot; proved difficult for all to
understand. Some foreign nations considered it to mean
legalization. President Nixon refused to receive the report in
public or to comment on it except to affirm that marijuana was
not going to be legalized if he had anything to say about it. </p>

<p>The second and final report, published in 1973, dealt with
drugs more broadly.60 It attempted to draw attention to the
actual, measurable damage done by drugs, reflected in hospital
admissions and drug-related deaths, as opposed to the myths that
had evolved around many of them. Heroin, for example, was
misperceived as causing more deaths annually than barbiturates.
This approach intended to make more rational the discussion over
drug policy, but it also laid the groundwork for the inclusion of
cigarettes and alcohol in the antidrug crusade. It de-emphasized,
however, the effects a drug such as cocaine has on judgment and
efficiency, the less quantifiable but still real aspects of drug
use. </p>

<p>The enforcement of laws against individual possession or use
of marijuana has fallen in the United States to a very low level.
Moreover, dealers in relatively small amounts are reportedly not
prosecuted either, because the largest dealers and smugglers, who
are involved with tons, not ounces or pounds of marijuana,
require all the time of officials. There has been a de facto
decriminalization throughout large parts of the country, even if
laws against individual use remain on the books. Possession of
marijuana in some states is a small-scale misdemeanor, and the
penalty is a ticket, like a parking violation. Yet, the frequency
of marijuana use by high school seniors has been dropping since
1978, and this reduction, coupled with a more conservative
national mood, has slowed further moves toward formal federal
decriminalization or more liberality in the drug laws. </p>

<p>The rise in cocaine's availability and popularity, for the
second time this century, has further complicated the control of
drugs in the United States. The fact that first millions should
use marijuana, then millions more take cocaine raises questions
about the ability of local and national governments to control
narcotics. The corruption that follows the drug traffic and the
restraints on resources that may be allocated to drug control
combine to leave a sense of frustration with enforcement policy.
What will be the result of these trends? It all remains
uncertain. We appear to be in an era of widespread drug use that
would seem to make reasonable the revocation of antidrug
statutes. We should recall, however, that a similar condition
prevailed around 1900, shortly before an onslaught against drug
use led to a substantial reduction in the use of opiates, heroin,
cocaine, and alcohol. That such a national response could occur
must make us pause before offering predictions for the future. </p>

use of opiates to prevent painful and uncomfortable bodily and
psychic symptoms that would occur if the drug's use were abruptly
stopped. Estimates of the number of addicts in the United States
have often been susceptible to ideological and political
influences. After carefully considering contemporary surveys,
importation statistics, and other estimates, and subjecting his
findings to modern statistical analysis, Professor Courtwright
concluded that the highest rate of addiction in the United States
occurred in the 1890s at the maximum rate of 4.59 per 1,000.
Today that rate would result in 1. I million addicts, about twice
the current official estimate. </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>We wish to express our sincere appreciation to the students
who assisted us in the preparation of the tables at Appendix A.
Because the drug statutes of the several states are particularly
confusing and difficult to find, and because so many
jurisdictions have recently changed their drug laws, the
preparation of the chart required long, tedious work which so
many were kind enough to perform. To them, our most sincere
thanks. </p>

<p>We should like to thank especially Michael A. Cohen, John F.
Kuether, W. Tracey Shaw, Alan K. Smith, and Allan J. Tanenbaum,
all students at the University of Virginia School of Law, whose
research assistance and tireless effort were invaluable. </p>

<p>We are particularly indebted to Professor Jerry Mandel who
supplied us with much of the raw data used in the historical case
studies in this Article. In his excellent article on drug
statistics in the Stanford Low Review, Problems with Official
Drug Statistics, 21 STAN. L. REV. 991 (1969), Professor Mandel
suggested in a footnote that someone should attempt a history of
the passage of anti-marijuana legislation. We have followed his
suggestion and earnestly hope that our product will fill this
gap. </p>

<p>A modified and expanded version of this Article will be
published in book form in the spring of 1971.</p>

<h1>History of Marihuana Legislation*</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This chapter traces the legislative histories of marihuana,
alcohol, and tobacco. </p>

<p>In the first section, &quot;History of Marihuana
Legislation,&quot; the origins of the intoxicant use of cannabis
in this country during the early 20th century are noted along
with the subsequent state and federal statutes enacted
prohibiting use, distribution, production and sale. </p>

<p>Proscriptions began appearing on the books after about 1914
and continued through 1971, which brings the reader to the point
subsequently covered by the rest of this Appendix. </p>

<p>Early colonial laws regarding alcohol are described in the
beginning of the next section, &quot;History of Alcohol
Prohibition.&quot; From that point in history, the national
movements which spread over the next two centuries, culminating
in the enactment of National Prohibition from 1920 to 1933, are
described. </p>

<p>The various state modes of control which appeared after Repeal
are then briefly enumerated along with a discussion of the
present state controls over production, distribution, and sale of
intoxicating beverages. </p>

<p>The introduction of tobacco cultivation in 1613 in the colony
of Virginia opens the third section, &quot;History of Tobacco
Regulation.&quot; The widespread use of tobacco in the latter
1800's into the first half of the 20th century is traced along
with the increasing pressure from groups fearful of tobacco's
deleterious effects on health. </p>

<p>Federal sumptuary regulations are outlined along, with a
discussion of the impact further federal controls might have on
the tobacco economy. </p>

<h2>History of Marihuana Legislation*<br>
</h2>

<p><i>*This section is drawn from the manuscript of The Marihuana
Consensus: A History of American Marihuana Prohibition, in press
1972, by Professors Charles H. Whitebread, 11, and Richard J.
Bonnie of the University of Virginia Law School.<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Marihuana&quot; or Indian hemp, labeled Cannabis Sativa
L. by Linneas in 1753, has been used for centuries in Asia and
Africa for its intoxicant properties. It was cultivated as a
source of fiber in North America in the early 17th century. Yet,
cannabis was not used as an intoxicant in North America until the
late 19th century, and in the United States until the early 20th.
</p>

<p>Cannabis use was prevalent in Mexico by 1898. Widely
cultivated and growing wild, the drug was readily available for
eating, drinking, or smoking, the latter being by far the most
common method of ingestion. Soldiers in Pancho Villa's army are
reputed to have used the drug freely. The path of the
introduction of marihuana smoking for pleasure into the United
States was not via Europe, which transmitted the fiber, oil, and
medicinal uses of hemp, but via Mexico and the West Indies. </p>

<p>The plant and its intoxicant use in the United States in the
first decades of the 20th century encountered a political and
social climate which was not particularly conducive to hearty
growth. Gradually criminal prohibitions appeared on the statute
books of nearly every state where the drug was used. </p>

<p>Well into the thirties, however, marihuana smoking attracted
little attention from the national policy and opinion apparatus
which was deeply ensnared in drug matters of much wider social
impact than the limited, regional use of this new drug. </p>

<p>The &quot;villain&quot; theory of American marihuana
prohibition - attributing the drug's illegal status to the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and its longtime head, Harry J.
Anslinger - has been particularly popular in recent years. </p>

<p>Although the federal narcotics bureaucracy, with Commissioner
Anslinger at the helm, was to become marihuana's leading
antagonist in the mid-thirties, a restrictive, public policy
toward the drug was well-rooted locally before that time. During
the &quot;local&quot; phase of marihuana prohibition, lasting
roughly from 1914 to 1931, practically every state west of the
Mississippi, except for two, had prohibited use of the drug for
non-medical purposes.<br>
</p>

<p>The real story of marihuana policy in the United States begins
as a series of distinctly local tales.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>STATE PROHIBITION: 1914-1930</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana use was a familiar phenomenon in the border towns of
Texas and New Mexico after 1910. First to note the use of the
drug were El Paso law enforcement officials who quickly secured a
local ordinance in 1914 banning sale and possession of the drug.
El Paso officials and local representatives of the Customs and
Agriculture Departments of the Federal Government agitated for
state and federal legislation to combat the &quot;killer
weed.&quot; </p>

<p>After an official request by the Secretary of Agriculture, the
Secretary of the Treasury issued a decision under the Food and
Drug Act prohibiting importation of cannabis after 1915 for other
than medical purposes. </p>

<p>On the state level in Texas, legislation was slow in coming.
Marihuana use was still a local problem in the 'border towns and
it attracted little statewide interest. The Texas Legislature
included marihuana when it passed a general narcotics statute in
1919, prohibiting transfer of listed narcotics except for medical
purposes (Texas, 1919: 278). In 1923, the statute was tightened
to prohibit possession with intent to sell (Texas, 1923:
156-157). The legislature's failure to prohibit simple possession
or use reflected an objection to interfering with private
conduct. </p>

<p>The degree of public interest in narcotics and marihuana is
well-illustrated by the limited newspaper coverage. In its only
direct reference to the 1923 marihuana legislation, the Austin
Texas Statesman, which had given the legislature extensive
coverage, stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The McMillan Senate Bill amended the anti-narcotic law so
as to make unlawful the possession for the purpose of sale of
marihuana or other drugs. Marihuana is a Mexican herb and is said
to be sold on the Texas-Mexican border</i> (Austin Texas
Statesman, 1923). <br>
</p>

<p>Even more surprising is the fact that the El Paso Times did
not mention the McMillan bill before or after its passage. </p>

<p>New Mexico in the same year prohibited sale, cultivation and
importation of cannabis. Mere possession was not expressly
prohibited but anyone found in possession was presumed to have
imported the marihuana illegally (New Mexico, 1923: 58-59). The
Santa Fe New Mexican, hometown newspaper of the bill's sponsors
paid scant attention, noting only that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The Santa Fe representative, however, had better luck with
his bill to prevent sale of marihuana, cannabis indica, Indian
hemp or hashish as it is variously known. This bill was passed
without any opposition. Marihuana was brought into local
prominence at the penitentiary board's investigation last summer
when a convict testified he could get marihuana cigarettes
anytime he had a dollar. The drug produces intoxication when
chewed or smoked. Marihuana is the name commonly used in the
Southwest and Mexico </i>(Santa Fe New Mexican, 1923).<br>
</p>

<p>In addition to coming in via Mexico, marihuana was being
smuggled in by sailors from Cuba and other points in the Indies
via New Orleans. Dr. Frank Gomila, Commissioner of Public Safety
of New Orleans, began his campaign for federal legislation which
would later bear fruit. He observed that the traffic was quite
organized amounting to thousands of kilograms a year:<br>
</p>

<p><i>... [T]he custom was to keep [marihuana] In warehouses or
storerooms for further distribution. It was sold by the
wholesaler to the retailer who In turn put the 'weed' through a
process known as 'sweating.' The dried leaves and stems were
soaked in sugar water and dried on butcher's brown papers </i>(Gomila
and Lambow, 1938: 29).<br>
</p>

<p>According to Dr. Gomila and the newspapers, the demand in New
Orleans in the mid-twenties was so great that the
&quot;peddlers&quot; were able to become exceptionally prosperous
by dividing the market. One had exclusive jurisdiction over the
blacks unloading the fruit boats, another over the lobby in a
certain hotel, and so forth. It should be noted that marihuana
was also available at the local pharmacy without a prescription
before 1923 in Texas and 1921 in Louisiana. After that marihuana
had to be bought on the street unless the user could successfully
forge a prescription. </p>

<p>Different pictures emerge, of the marihuana user in El Paso
and San Antonio on the one hand and New Orleans and Galveston on
the other. In the border towns, he was a Mexican laborer,
indolent to some, volatile to others. Local authorities were, by
and large, unable to generate any significant public or political
interest, although there were no political objections to making
the Mexican weed illegal. </p>

<p>In the port cities, however, the marihuana user was a
&quot;dope fiend,&quot; the basest element of American society.
He was a narcotics addict, a pimp, or a gambler; she was a
prostitute. In New Orleans, marihuana was simply another narcotic
in a city with a major narcotic problem. It was always open to
sensationalism. </p>

<p>Even before public attention was excited, however, the
prevalence of marihuana use came to the attention of the
President of the Louisiana State Board of Health, Dr. Oscar
Dowling. On August 21, 1920, he advised the Governor of the
increasing availability of marihuana, a &quot;powerful narcotic,
causing exhilaration, intoxication, delirious hallucinations, and
its subsequent action, drowsiness and stupor. . .&quot; (Jones,
1920). </p>

<p>At the same time, Dr. Dowling wrote to the Surgeon General of
the United States, Dr. Hugh Cummings, to advise him of the
increasing traffic in morphine, opium, and marihuana, and to seek
federal cooperation. </p>

<p>An interesting sidelight of this request for assistance from
Washington is that four months later Dr. Dowling was to become
embroiled in a bitter battle with the Federal Government over an
order to close his pet project, the New Orleans morphine clinics
(Dowling, 1920). Ultimately he would lose, and one of the
earliest attempts to deal with narcotics addiction would be
suppressed for a half century (Lindesmith, 1967: 135-161). </p>

<p>Very little, however, was done about the marihuana issue until
the press seized upon it. In the fall of 1926, the New Orleans
Item dispatched an army of reporters among the smoking and
selling population. </p>

<p>A series of articles published by the more widely circulated
Morning Tribune (both the Item and the Tribune were owned by the
same publishing company) exposed the immense profits being made
and commented upon the volatile effects of the drug upon its
&quot;addicts.&quot; It was reported that marihuana: </p>

<p><i>Numbs the sense, creates wild fancies and has a hypnotic
effect upon the user, making his will easily subordinated to that
of others.<br>
</i></p>

<p>What emerged from these articles, however, was not a vision of
addicts on the streets and pushers on the docks but rather
peddlers who lurked on playgrounds seeking to entrap young minds.
&quot;Over two hundred children under fourteen are believed to be
addicted to the marihuana habit,&quot; the paper reported, and
&quot;at least 44 schools were definitely being infected&quot;
(Gomila and Lambow, 1938: 29-31). </p>

<p>Local policy-makers wasted no time. The New Orleans Police
Department immediately launched a round-up. They arrested more
than 150 persons for violation of a law which had lain dormant
for two years (Gomila and Lambow, 1938: 29-31; WCTIT, 1928). </p>

<p>Dr. Dowling soon circulated &quot;a warning to parents,
guardians, and teachers of children against this menace&quot;
(WCTIT, 1928: 1). The Women's Christian Temperance Union jumped
on the bandwagon, focusing its attacks on the &quot;soft
drink&quot; bars which had sprung up all over New Orleans during
Prohibition: </p>

<p><i>The soft drink stand and the corner drug store have taken
the place of the saloon as a social meeting place. Here is where
marihuana and liquors can sometimes be bought </i>(WCTU, 1928:
3). <br>
</p>

<p>Beyond these immediate effects, a more substantial impact of
the local policy reaction in New Orleans was the formation of a
tightly knit coterie of New Orleans law enforcement, public
health, and social welfare officials who would carry their
campaign to Washington, with ultimate success. </p>

<p>The drug and the practice of smoking it spread during the
mid-twenties from the Gulf Coast and border town points-of-entry
in two directions north and west from the border together with
its ethnic identity and north and east from New Orleans with its
identity as a narcotic and enslaver of youth. </p>

<p>Practically every state west of the Mississippi River
prohibited the possession or sale of marihuana during the period
1915 to 1930. Most of them acted by 1930: California (1915), Iowa
(1921), Nevada (1923), Washington (1923), Arkansas (1923),
Nebraska, (1927), and Wyoming (1929). </p>

<p>The Bureau of Immigration records the entry of 590,765
Mexicans during this period, two-thirds of them remaining in
Texas, the others settling in states in the Rocky Mountain area,
most of them as farm laborers (U.S. Bureau of Immigration, 1915
to 1930). </p>

<p>Whether motivated by outright ethnic prejudice or by simple
discriminatory disinterest, the proceedings before state
legislatures resembled those in Texas in 1923. There was little,
if any, public attention and no debate. Pointed references were
made to the drug's Mexican origins and sometimes to the criminal
conduct which inevitably followed when Mexicans ingested the
&quot;killer weed.,&quot; </p>

<p>The Colorado Legislature first prohibited possession,
cultivation and sale of the drug in 1927, the year after the use
of marihuana noticeably increased (Colorado, 1927: 309). At that
time., according to a subsequent newspaper report, the drug was
&quot; used almost exclusively . . . by the Mexican population
employed in the beet fields&quot; (Rocky Mountain News, 1931). </p>

<p>Similarly, in 1929, the Montana Legislature amended its
general narcotic law to marihuana, prohibiting use, sale or
possession without a prescription (Montana, 1929: 5). On seven
different days from June 24 to February 10, the date of the
bill's passage, the Montana Standard succinctly noted the
progress of the bill through the legislature. The legislature's
attitude was characterized in the January 27 issue:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There was fun in the House Health Committee during the week
when the marihuana bill came up for consideration. Marihuana is
Mexican opium, a plant used by Mexicans and cultivated for sale
by Indians. &quot;When some beet field peon takes a few rares of
this stuff,&quot; explained Dr. Fred Fulsher of Mineral County,
&quot;he thinks he has just been elected President of Mexico so
he starts out to execute all his Political enemies. I understand
that over in Butte where the mexicans often go for the winter
they stage imaginary bullfights in the 'Bower of Roses' or put on
tournaments for the favor of 'Spanish Rose' after a couple of
whiffs of marihuana. The Silver Bow and Yellowstone delegations
both deplore these international complications.&quot; Everybody
laughed and the bill was recommended for passage </i>(Montana
Standard, 1929: 3).<br>
</p>

<p>About the same time, Mexican laborers bad begun to appear in
Idaho and the mayor of Boise remarked:<br>
</p>

<p><i>'The Mexican beet field workers have introduced a new
problem-the smoking in cigarettes or pipes of marihuana or grifo.
its use is as demoralizing as the use of narcotics. Smoking grifo
is quite prevalent along the Oregon Short Line Railroad; and
Idaho has no law to cope with the use and spread of this
dangerous drug </i>(WCTU, 1928: 3).<br>
</p>

<p>Idaho passed a law in 1927 (Idaho, 1927: 98). </p>

<p>By 1931, the Texas Legislature finally got around to
prohibiting possession of marihuana. By now alcohol prohibition
had withdrawn any philosophical barrier to making possession
illegal. The San Antonio Light reported that: </p>

<p><i>At last the state legislature has taken a definite step
toward suppression of traffic in a dangerous and
insanity-producing narcotic easily compounded of a weed
(marihuana) indigenous to this section. This newspaper has urged
the passage of prohibitory legislation and is gratified that the
solons at Austin have acted, even if tardily, in the suppression
of traffic in a drug which makes, the addict [read Mexican]
frequently a dangerous or homicidal maniac</i> (San Antonio
Light, 1931).<br>
</p>

<p>In the East, appearance of the practice was not a necessary
prerequisite for prohibition. That Maine (1913), Massachusetts
(1914), Vermont (1915), and Rhode Island (1918) barred the sale
of cannabis without a prescription before 1920 does not indicate
that marihuana smoking had appeared there on any significant
scale. Rather, in the course of anticipating and implementing the
national anti-narcotics policy declared by the Harrison Act in
1914, medical representatives on the drafting committees
recommended the inclusion of &quot;another narcotic&quot; to
which addicts could resort once the other opiates became
difficult to obtain. </p>

<p>The New York Times in 1914 described cannabis as a
&quot;narcotic [having] practically the same effect. as morphine
and cocaine,&quot; (New York Times, 1914: 6) and it noted in an
editorial that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>[T]he inclusion of cannabis indica among the drugs to be
sold only on prescription is only common sense. Devotees of
hashish are now hardly numerous enough here to count, but they
are likely to increase as other narcotics become harder to obtain
</i>(New York Times, 1914: 8).<br>
</p>

<p>By 1923, the New York Times referred to marihuana as the
city's &quot;latest habit-forming drug&quot; when reporting its
exhibition at a Women's Club meeting (New York Times, 1923: 24).
Finally, in 1927, whether responding to an increase in use or to
the substitution admonition, the legislature included marihuana
in its definition of &quot;habit forming drugs&quot; in a
comprehensive narcotics bill (New York, 1927: 1695). </p>

<p>The situation in Chicago paralleled that in New York until
1927. Large Mexican communities developed in Chicago and Gary,
Indiana, during the twenties and marihuana smoking became common
in these areas and among journeymen musicians as well. As in New
York, there was little public concern. The New Orleans pattern
took over around 1927, however, when the attention of local law
enforcement officials was suddenly drawn to the Mexicans and
their &quot;muggles.&quot; One law enforcement official reported
that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There are about 7,000 Mexicans in Gary, 10,000 in Indiana
Harbor and 8,000 in South Chicago.... The Mexicans depend on the
steel mills, railroads, and construction gangs for employment.
Many are drifters when slack labor conditions prevail....
[T]wenty-five percent of these Mexicans smoke marihuana. In fact,
many of them make their living by raising and peddling the drug </i>(Paul,
1929: 4).<br>
</p>

<p>A situation perceived to be so widespread was naturally
considered likely to infect the rest of the community. As in New
Orleans, reports started to appear that high school students were
smoking the weed (Paul, 1929: 1; Chicago Tribune, June 3, 1929). </p>

<p>Since there was then neither state nor federal legislation
prohibiting sale of marihuana, the local United States attorney
declared war armed with an Internal Revenue statute prohibiting
production and transfer of &quot;a cigarette substitute&quot; on
which tax had not been paid. In June 1929, he raided wholesale
houses &quot;believed to have disposed of large quantities of
marihuana cigarettes, sold to school pupils and other youthful
thrill seekers.&quot; He arrested nine men &quot;most of them
Mexicans&quot; (Chicago Examiner, June 22, 1929). At the same
time, local officials began to use a statute which prohibited
transfer of &quot;any cigarette containing any substance
deleterious to health&quot; (Chicago Examiner, June 19, 1929). </p>

<p>The Chicago Tribune, lobbying heavily for anti-marihuana
legislation then pending before the Illinois Legislature,
reported that day-to-day progress of the enforcement activity
(Chicago Tribune, July and October, 1929). Every stall in the
legislature earned a banner headline such as: </p>

<p>BAN ON HASHISH BLOCKED DESPITE RAVAGES OF DRUG </p>

<p>In an article appearing in June, 1929, the paper noted: </p>

<p><i>The number of addicts is growing alarmingly according to
authorities, because of the ease with which [marihuana] can be
obtained. The habit was introduced a dozen years ago by Mexican
laborers . . . but it has become widespread among American youths
and girls even among school children.</i> </p>

<p>The legislation, however, was killed. </p>

<p>Marihuana prohibition had become widespread. In states where
either Mexicans or the drug had appeared, its use was quickly
suppressed. </p>

<p>Soon after being apprised of its presence, local lawmakers
invoked the criminal law. In New Orleans, Denver, and Chicago the
spectre of a doped school population was the cornerstone of the
prohibitory effort. </p>

<p>And, during alcohol prohibition, paralleled by the local phase
of marihuana prohibition, it was naturally imperative to suppress
a drug which frustrated alcohol users might substitute, for their
customary intoxicant.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE UNIFORM NARCOTIC DRUG ACT</b> </p>

<p>Following the ad hoc local phase of marihuana legislation in
the United States was the nationalization phase. During this
period marihuana became integrated at both the state and federal
levels with the nation's narcotics policy which had been
manifested forcefully in Congress' adoption of the Harrison
Narcotics Act in 1914. </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, a taxing measure, required registration and
payment of an occupational tax by all persons who imported,
produced, dealt in, sold or gave away opium, cocaine or their
derivatives. The Act required all legitimate handlers of these
narcotics to file returns setting forth in detail their use of
the drugs. </p>

<p>Since the Act also provided that only legitimate users could
register and no one but a registered user could obtain the
specified form, any transfer by an illegitimate user was a
violation of the Act. For those failing to comply with its
registration requirements, the original Harrison Act provided
penalties of not more than $2,000 in fines or more than five
years imprisonment, or both. </p>

<p>Drafted as a tax law rather than an outright criminal statute,
the Act was intended to do indirectly what Congress believed it
could not do directly: regulate possession and sale of the
opiates. However, because the Act essentially was a
revenue-raising measure imposing a tax on transfers of narcotics,
it could not effectively prohibit the possession of drugs. </p>

<p>This indirect regulation of narcotics traffic had a number of
significant consequences. First, since the Act could not penalize
users of addiction directly, there was an immediate need for
complementary residual state legislation in order to deal
effectively with the drug problem. </p>

<p>Second, the enforcement of the Act was as signed to the
Internal Revenue Service in the Treasury Department. The first
enforcement agency for the Harrison Act was the Narcotics
Division of the Prohibition Unit of the Internal Revenue Service
created in 1920 (Schmeckebier, 1929: 143). This division was
incorporated in the Prohibition Bureau which was created in 1927
(Act, 1927:1381). </p>

<p>In 1930, the enforcement of the narcotics laws was severed
from the Bureau of Prohibition and established as the separate
Bureau of Narcotics in the Treasury Department (Act, 1930: 585).
The existence of this separate, agency has done as much as any
single factor to influence the course of drug regulation from
1930 to 1970 (King, 1953: 736). </p>

<p>Although the impact of the Bureau on the passage of the
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and the Marihuana Tax Act will be
explained in detail in subsequent sections, it is important here
to note that the existence of a separate bureau having
responsibility only for narcotics enforcement and for educating
the public on drug problems inevitably led to a particularly
prosecutorial view of narcotics addiction and the use and abuse
of all drugs. </p>

<p>After the passage of the Harrison Act in 1914, there remained
a considerable lack of uniformity regarding the offenses
prohibited and the penalties imposed by the several states. </p>

<p>In 1919, the American Medical Association asked the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue to call a conference, to
consider better control of traffic in narcotic drugs. The
profession was uncertain of its obligations in the matter because
they were faced with an amalgam of conflicting laws. The A.M.A.
asked that the wholesale, retail, and manufacturing drug
interests be among those attending, along with delegates from the
medical profession in each state. The proposal received no
official or unofficial response either from the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue or the Bureau of Prohibition. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the American Medical Association, through its
own Council on Health and Public Instruction, did hold a
conference in early 1922 during which a uniform state narcotic
control law was presented. At the November meeting of that
conference, there were present 15 representatives of 10
pharmaceutical organizations and two representatives of the
medical profession. </p>

<p>The draft of a uniform law was approved unanimously by all
present. The American Medical Association set out to codify the
draft and to send it for approval to each of the constituent
organizations (White, August 3, 1932; Woodward, August 6, 1932).
After securing approval, all the associations agreed to pursue
enactment first in New York.<br>
</p>

<p>The general lack of uniformity in anti-narcotics legislation,
the weakness of state enforcement procedures, and the growing
hysteria about dope fiends and criminality converged in several
requests outside the medical community for a uniform state
narcotic law (Anslinger and Tompkins, 1953: 159).<br>
</p>

<p>The drafting of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act must also be
viewed against the background of two larger movements: (1) the
trend toward the creation and dissemination of uniform state laws
by the National Commissioners on Uniform State laws, a group to
which each state sent two representatives appointed by the
governor; and (2) the general concern in the late 1920's and
early 1930's with interstate crime, manifested , for example, by
the creation in 1930 of the nearly autonomous Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Because the concept of states' rights and narrowly
construed federal power was then so powerful, an appeal to the
National Commissioners was the inevitable recourse for those
pressing for uniform anti-narcotic regulation. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DRAFTING THE UNIFORM ACT<br>
</b></p>

<p>By 1924, the Commissioners had appointed Committee to draft a
uniform narcotic drug act At the 1925 meeting of Commissioners,
the chair man of the Committee reported that he himself had
prepared a first tentative draft based on the New York Act, the
Washington state legislation, the Harrison Act, and a bill then
before the New York Legislature. Presumably this was the on
drafted by the A.M.A. Conference after its 192 meeting. </p>

<p>The chairman noted, however, that Dr. William Woodward, head
of the A.M.A.'s Bureau of Legal Medicine and Legislation, with
whom he had only recently conferred, had made &quot;some very
valuable suggestions.&quot; Because the tentative draft had
already been printed before these suggestions, he requested that
it &quot;not be read but be re-committed to the Committee&quot;
(1925 Handbook: 977-985). This first draft included cannabis in
the list of &quot;habit-forming drugs,&quot; although all such
drugs could be distributed and used for medical purposes (1925
Handbook: 978). </p>

<p>A second tentative draft was presented in 1928 and again the
draft was not discussed at the conference but recommitted for
further study. The second draft was essentially an exact copy of
the 1927 New York Statute. It also included cannabis in the class
of habit-forming drugs (1928 Handbook: 75-78,323-333). </p>

<p>There was a lack of concern on the part of the Commissioners
themselves with the whole narcotics problem between 1924 and
1928. The President of the Conference, introducing Dr. Woodward,
said:<br>
</p>

<p><i>In view of the importance of the act I think it would not
be amiss to listen to the Doctor for a few minutes, that he may
point out to us why it is important. In some of the states we do
not recognize the importance because it has not been called to
our attention </i>(1928 Handbook: 76-77).<br>
</p>

<p>Nor was the Bureau of Prohibition particularly concerned at
this time with the cannabis provision. Lack of official concern
and interest continued to be the Bureau's attitude toward the
second tentative draft (Nutt, June 13,1929). </p>

<p>Since neither the Commissioners nor federal narcotics
officials were particularly concerned about state and local
control of narcotics generally and marihuana in particular, it
seems clear that neither was responsible for the inclusion of
marihuana in the category of &quot;habit-forming drugs. Rather,
it would appear that it was included in the first draft because
that had been drawn from the 1923 Washington statute which had
listed cannabis. </p>

<p>Insofar as the second draft was a copy of the 1927 New York
Act, inclusion of cannabis in this draft is not unusual. Few, if
any, of the persons involved in the drafting were concerned about
marihuana smoking or even aware of its use. </p>

<p>Two third drafts were submitted, the first in 1929 and the
second in 1930. The initial one closely resembled the second
tentative draft, and once again it included cannabis in the
category of &quot;habit-forming drugs.` Again, the growth,
distribution, and possession of cannabis was prohibited except
for medical purposes. </p>

<p>The nascent Congressional interest in marihuana in 1929 and
the Bureau of Prohibition's subsequent resistance to amending,
and thereby endangering, the Harrison and Export and Import Acts,
caused the Bureau to take full notice of this 1929 third draft.
Like its predecessors, however, the initial third draft was
recommitted for further study (1929 Handbook : 43, 332-346). </p>

<p>The second third tentative draft, submitted in 1930, was the
first to remove cannabis from the definition of
&quot;habit-forming drugs&quot; and to include only a
supplemental provision for dealing with the drug (1930 Handbook:
485,97). </p>

<p>When the Conference of Commissioners met to consider the
second third tentative draft, Judge Deering, the Chairman of the
Committee on the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, recommended its
recommission for further study because the Committee had not yet
had an opportunity to consult the newly created Bureau of
Narcotics. </p>

<p>At the time of this conference, August 14, 1930, no one had
yet been appointed Commissioner of the Bureau, although Harry J.
Anslinger was Acting Commissioner (1930 Handbook: 126-127). The
Senate confirmed Anslinger's appointment as Commissioner on
December 18, 1930. </p>

<p>The Bureau of Narcotics their became actively involved in the
drafting process. Commissioner Anslinger was pressing for
inclusion of the cannabis provision. He stated that he felt the
limited medical use for cannabis was far outweighed by the need
to control potential cannabis addiction (Anslinger, July
28,1930). </p>

<p>Dr. Woodward and the pharmaceutical industry advocated
optional inclusion of marihuana on the one hand, and federal
narcotics representatives urged not only inclusion but
elimination of medical use, on the other. </p>

<p>The fourth tentative draft retained the optional cannabis
provision. At a session before the convening of the full
Conference of Commissioners from September 9-12, 1931,
Commissioner Anslinger and A. L. Tennyson of the Bureau met with
Judge Deering to discuss the Bureau's feelings about the fourth
tentative draft. </p>

<p>At this time Commissioner Anslinger stated that the Bureau
felt strongly that inclusion of cannabis in the state law ought
to be mandatory. Moreover, the Bureau urged that the only
successful way to deal with the marihuana drug traffic, because
of its domestic nature and the easy availability of the weed, was
to prohibit the cultivation of the plant altogether and to find
some substitute for the limited medical use (Tennyson, September
16, 1931). However, the fourth tentative draft presented to the
Conference of Commissioners included the optional marihuana
provision. And, the Conference tentatively approved the fourth
tentative draft and directed the Committee to prepare a final
draft (1931 Handbook: 127-128, 390-402). </p>

<p>The American Medical Association played a key role in the
drafting process prior to 1931. Their efforts had been largely
responsible for consideration of the Uniform Drug Act in the
first place. From the beginning in 1925, Dr. William Woodward,
the Director of the A.M.A.'s Bureau of Legal Medicine and
Legislation, actively assisted in the drafting of the Act and
widely circulated the drafts to interested persons for their
comments. </p>

<p>It appears, however, that Dr. Woodward's personal style and
the preeminent position of the American Medical Association in
the drafting process were resented by the two remaining interest
groups-the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the retail and
wholesale pharmaceutical associations. The Bureau had been
commenting on drafts only after they had been drawn by the A.M.A.
and did not feel it was playing an active role in the drafting
process. The pharmaceutical industry felt that their interests
were considered only peripherally and that they had been excluded
from the heart of tire, drafting process. </p>

<p>As a result of the dissent, a conference of interested parties
was scheduled before the final draft was to be presented to the
Conference of Commissioners. </p>

<p>Present at this preliminary conference on September 15, 1932,
were representatives of the Drug Committee the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics, the Department of State, the Public Health Service,
the American Medical Association, and delegates from the drug
industry and other medically related industries and
organizations. The final version of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act
was hammered out at this session. The Bureau was central to the
drafting process and Commissioner Anslinger made a major effort
to involve the drug manufacturers and the wholesale and retail
drug trade in it to protect the Act from possible subsequent
political disagreement (Anslinger, August 1, 1932): Finally, the
conference agreed on a draft to be presented to the National
Conference. </p>

<p>The manufacturers of drug products were strongly opposed to
the inclusion of cannabis under any criminal regulatory scheme.
Representatives of the industry opposed a mandatory cannabis
provision. The final conclusion reached by all the parties
present was:<br>
</p>

<p><i>After considerable comment, it was decided to eliminate
Section 12 (Cannabis) and leave it to the Conference of
Commissioners as to whether it should be included under the
general provisions of the Act </i>(Report of Preliminary
Conference, 1932: 23).<br>
</p>

<p>The Bureau was no longer insisting on the mandatory inclusion
of in absolute marihuana prohibition; it did not want to risk the
opposition of the drug industry to the, entire Act. </p>

<p>The fifth tentative draft did, however, include a significant
change in form which would have important consequences in the
decades to come. Although the marihuana provision remained
supplemental to the main body of the Act, any state wishing to
regulate the sale and possession of marihuana was instructed,
simply, to add cannabis to the definition of &quot;narcotic
drugs.&quot; All the, other provisions of the, Act would their
apply to marihuana as well as to the opiates and cocaine. The
Commissioners adopted this form as it had been prepared at the
September 15, 1932, preliminary Conference. </p>

<p>The only recorded opposition to the adoption of the final
draft came from some Commissioners who objected to tying the
Uniform State Law to the terms of the federal Harrison Act. This
last obstacle was over-come by the argument that a number of
states already had passed such legislation so that the states'
rights problem need not stand in the way. The Act was adopted 26
to 3 (1932 Handbook: 107).<br>
</p>

<p><b>ENACTMENT OF THE UNIFORM ACT BY THE STATES</b> </p>

<p>After final acceptance of the Uniform Act, the Bureau set to
work at once to secure state enactment-including an adequate
marihuana provision. A comprehensive campaign was undertaken in
the press, in legislative chambers, and in any other forum to
gain public support for the Uniform Act. </p>

<p>In addition, perceiving the absence of public awareness of
marihuana and needing to encourage positive action to overcome
the drug's optional status, the Bureau also sought to arouse
public interest in marihuana through &quot;an educational
campaign describing the drug, its identifications and its evil
effects&quot; (Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1937 : 59). </p>

<p>That there was little general knowledge about cannabis is
illustrated by the fact that as late as 1934, it was necessary to
show marihuana to the New York police so that they could
recognize it growing or in dried, smokable form (New York Times
1934: 6). </p>

<p>The Bureau's district supervisors and local agents were
campaigning actively in the legislatures before which the Act was
pending. A press campaign was conducted across the country to
gain the support of civic groups and other interested parties.
Mr. Anslinger sought editorial support in newspapers (Anslinger,
October 22, 1936) and assisted in the, drafting of articles for
popular magazines (Anslinger, December 23, 1936). To mobilize the
Bar, Bureau officials wrote an article for law journals
explaining the need for the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act (Anslinger,
1932: 52; Tennyson, 1932: 55). </p>

<p>Despite these efforts, it appears that the Uniform Act had a
rough time in state legislatures during its early life. By April
26, 1933, only two states had enacted it in full. As late as
March 1935, only 10 states had enacted the Uniform Law. </p>

<p>A number of significant objections had emerged in the state
legislatures considering the passage of the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act. First among these was the potential cost to the state of
enforcing the Act. Second, there was concern over the number of
registrants who would have to be licensed due to the belief that
the Uniform Act would require special licensing of doctors,
dentists, and veterinarians. Third, the limit on the amount of
exempt preparations which could be sold caused a great deal of
technical difficulty with the Act. Fourth, many criticized the
right of the court to revoke or suspend the license to practice
medicine or pharmacy. And finally, there seemed to be widespread
misunderstanding of the record-keeping requirements of the Act. </p>

<p>Although these objections were largely administrative, they
nevertheless posed what appeared to be serious stumbling blocks
to the successful passage of the Uniform Law in all the states. </p>

<p>The combination of public apathy and administrative resistance
necessitated a new approach in generating public interest.
Beginning in late 1934, Commissioner Anslinger gradually shifted
the focus of the FBN's educational campaign away from the
liability of federal law enforcement agencies to deal effectively
with the local drug problems to the need to cope with the new
drug menace-marihuana. </p>

<p>The clearest reflection of the, change in Bureau policy is
found in two official statements of Commissioner Anslinger, one
made in 1933 and the other in 1936. </p>

<p>One 1933 statement explains the need for a Uniform Narcotic
Drug Law and emphasizes United States international obligations,
the need for more effective coordination in law enforcement, and
the impact the law will have on the dangers of morphine, cocaine,
and opium addiction (FBN Paper, July 1933). In the later
statement, however, more than half of the time is devoted to a
discussion of the &quot;worst evil of all&quot; the marihuana
problem. </p>

<p>To aid the new approach's objective, Commissioner Anslinger
made speeches and contributed articles to journals. The most
influential of his efforts was &quot;Marihuana Assassin of
Youth&quot; which appeared in the widely circulated American
Magazine in July 1937 (Anslinger and Cooper,1937). </p>

<p>The FBN files contain more than 50 letters addressed to the
Commissioner which say: &quot;Your article was the first time I
ever heard of marihuana.&quot; </p>

<p>Among the most effective proponents of the Uniform Act was the
Hearst newspaper chain. These papers began editorializing in
favor of enactment within days after the Act had been approved in
1932. </p>

<p>The Hearst chain was not alone. A Birmingham, Alabama, paper
on August 22, 1935, emphasized the need to control marihuana as a
reason for adopting the Act (Birmingham Age Herald, August 22,
1935). A Washington Post columnist in September, 1934, devoted
three quarters of his article to marihuana with quotes from
Anslinger and Stanley urging adoption of the Uniform Act
(Washington Post, September 29, 1934).<br>
</p>

<p>Other large-city newspapers such as the Cleveland Plain,
Dealer and the St. Louis Star Times kept a steady, if
intermittent, stream of anti-marihuana articles flowing in the,
period just before the passage of the Uniform Act in those areas.
In Missouri, especially, local concern generated by the extensive
coverage in the Star Times speedily pushed the legislature to
adopt the Uniform Act. </p>

<p>Often it has been supposed on the basis of this increased
coverage that the use of marihuana increased around 1935. Since
there was some larger design involved, however, a firm conclusion
is unwarranted. At the same time, it is possible that use, did
spread after the publicity campaigns, especially among the young.
</p>

<p>Judging from the tremendous expansion in coverage by the New
York Times beginning in 1935, the evidence supplied by the
LaGuardia Commission in its 1944 Report and the, leap in
enforcement activity, marihuana, finally came to New York City in
the 1930's, though then probably on a smaller scale than in
Denver land the, border towns of Texas. </p>

<p>Apart from the press, another influential participant in the
marihuana campaign, especially after the Repeal of Prohibition,
was the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Although the WCTU had
distributed a pamphlet on marihuana as early as 1927, their
publication, the Union Signal, does not reflect any significant
interest either in the Uniform Act or marihuana, until 1934.
Before that year the &quot;narcotic&quot; receiving the most
attention was nicotine. Beginning in 1936, however, the Union
Signal had a direct line to the FBN national office, and from
then on every issue contained material on marihuana (WCTU bound
volumes, yearly). </p>

<p>The World Narcotic Defense Association and its head, Richmond
P. Hopson, were also involved in the drive for state enactment.
They were continually in postal contact with almost every state
legislator in the country (WNDA, 1937). The most well-financed
group in the campaign, the Association underwrote national
broadcasts and distributed a lengthy pamphlet on marihuana, in
1936. </p>

<p>The General Federation of Women's Clubs also contributed
energetically. The Federation educated its membership about the
need for the Uniform Act and about the evils of marihuana in
particular. The Chairman of the Federation's department of
legislation noted: <br>
</p>

<p><i>The situation concerning club women particularly is the
accessibility of the frightening degenerating marihuana weed,
which is rolled in cigarettes ... and has been playing such havoc
with young high school boys and girls</i> (WCTU, 1936: 285).<br>
</p>

<p>The state and local clubs immediately began to unite local
legislators and to conduct educational campaigns for parents,
teachers and children (WCTU, 1937: 36; Wood, January 13, 1936).
An FBN agent appeared at a New York meeting of the local
Federation with two marihuana plants. They were exhibited at a
local flower show: </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>Marihuana Plant exhibit at Flower Show</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>of Katrina Trask Garden Club</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Tomorrow, 3 P.M. on at the Casino</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>This plant is the cause of a dread menace
which in being fought by the State Department of Health.</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Public Invited to Show-25 cents (Saratogian,
1936: 5)<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>Other groups such as the YWCA , the National PTA and the
National Councils of Catholic Men and Women were all in touch
with the Bureau and were made, aware of the Bureau's dual aims of
&quot;influencing and creating public opinion in favor of the
passage of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and awakening the
parents of the country to the increasing danger of the use of
marihuana.&quot; (Anslinger, March 28, 1935). </p>

<p>However, arousing public opinion alone was not the ultimate
goal of the campaign. The FBN was interested in the enactment of
the Uniform Act along with prohibitory marihuana legislation in
all the states. </p>

<p>By early 1935, only 10 states had adopted the Uniform Act.
And, three of these states had not included marihuana (Anslinger,
March 1, 1935). The Bureau embarked upon its marihuana strategy
in 1935, the turning point in state enactment. Whether or not
public interest actually existed, public opinion-makers
influenced legislative opinion and created a &quot;felt
need&quot; for legislation. </p>

<p>Within the next year, 18 more states adopted the Act and every
one of them which did not have previous legislation included
marihuana (Anslinger, January 13, 1936; WCTU, 1937: 75).<br>
</p>

<p><b>ENACTMENT OF THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT<br>
</b></p>

<p>Despite the public opinion campaign conducted in the early
1930's the general public was largely unaware of the drug, its
use, or its alleged effects; only regional interest was aroused. </p>

<p>A change seems to have occurred after 1935. The increased
national awareness played a significant role in the decision of
the Treasury Department to seek federal legislation. On April 14,
1937, the &quot;Secretary of the Treasury, on behalf of the
Commissioner of Narcotics,&quot; submitted the
&quot;administration proposal to Congress to impose an excise and
transfer tax on dealings in marihuana&quot; (Schaller, 1970: 70).
</p>

<p>The scheme of the Marihuana Tax Act was threefold: a
requirement that all manufacturers, importers, dealers, and
practitioners register and pay a special occupational tax; a
requirement that all transactions be accomplished through use of
written order forms; and the imposition of a tax on all transfers
in the amount of $1 per ounce for transfer to registered persons
and a prohibitive $100 per ounce for transfers to unregistered
persons. </p>

<p>The key departure of the marihuana tax scheme from that of the
Harrison Act is the notion of the prohibitive tax. Under the
Harrison Act, a person not required to register, that is, a
non-medical user, could not legitimately buy or possess
narcotics. To the dissenters in the Supreme Court decisions
upholding the Act, this clearly demonstrated that Congress'
motive was to prohibit conduct rather than to raise revenue. </p>

<p>The seemingly bizarre legal formulation of this tax measure
was precipitated by the recognized need for the Federal
Government to take action forbidden to it under prevailing
constitutional doctrine. </p>

<p>Hearings on the proposed marihuana taxation were held before
the House Ways and Means Committee. During five mornings of
testimony by FBN officials, government witnesses, and industry
representatives, the Bureau presented the following four-fold
argument: (1) marihuana was a disastrous drug; (2) its use was
increasing alarmingly and had generated public hysteria; (3)
state legislation was incapable of meeting the threat posed by
the drug, thus, federal action was required; and (4) the
government might best act through separate legislation rather
than through an amendment to the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>No definite scientific study of the effects of marihuana was
presented to substantiate the position that marihuana was a
dangerous drug. No synthesis of available scientific information
was submitted nor was there any statement by the Public Health
Service. Neither of the government's own public health experts,
Assistant Surgeon General, Dr. Walter Treadway, and Dr. Lawrence
Kolb, testified, nor did Drs. Walter Bromberg or J. F. Siler who
had recently published scientific articles on the effects of
cannabis in humans (Siler, et. al., 1933: 269-280; Bromberg,
1934). </p>

<p>Instead, the scientific aspects were presented by a law
enforcement agency, the FBN:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Despite the fact that medical men and scientists have
disagreed upon the properties of marihuana, and some are inclined
to minimize the harmfulness of this drug, the records offer ample
evidence that it has a disastrous effect upon many of its users.
Recently we have received many reports showing crimes of violence
committed by persons while under the influence of marihuana. </i></p>

<p><i>The deleterious, even vicious, qualities of the drug render
it highly dangerous to the mind and body upon which it operates
to destroy the will, cause one to lose the power of connected
thought, producing imaginary delectable situations and gradually
weakening the physical powers. Its use frequently leads to
insanity. <br>
</i></p>

<p><i>I have a statement here, giving an outline of cases
reported to the Bureau or in the press, wherein the use of
marihuana is connected with revolting crimes</i> (U.S. Congress,
1937: 30). <br>
</p>

<p>Instead of having one of the few researchers who had done any
significant research into the effects of cannabis on humans, the
Bureau chose a Temple University pharmacologist, Dr. James Munch,
whose experience was confined to experimentation of the effects
of cannabis on dogs. </p>

<p>The second component of the Bureau's case was the contention
that marihuana use had spread alarmingly in recent years,
provoking a public outcry. To demonstrate this, the Bureau
submitted, for the record, the Gomila article cited earlier, and
a 1936 letter from the city editor of the Alamoosa Daily Courier
(U.S. Congress, 1937: 32-37). The letter described an attack by a
Mexican-American, allegedly under the influence of marihuana, on
a girl of his region.: <br>
</p>

<p><i>I wish I could show you what a small marihuana cigarette
can do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents.
That's why our problem is so great; the greatest percentage of
our population is composed of Spanish speaking persons most of
whom are low mentally, because of social and racial conditions </i>(Baskette,
September 4, 1936).<br>
</p>

<p>The third component of the Bureau's case was that even though
every state now had marihuana legislation, local authorities
could not cope with the marihuana menace. To support this
proposition editorial pleas from the Washington newspapers were
offered along with Bureau testimony that officials of several
states had requested federal help. </p>

<p>Senator Brown asked Commissioner Anslinger &quot;to make clear
the need for Federal legislation.&quot; He continued: </p>

<p><i>You say the states have asked you to do that. I presume it
is because of the freedom of interstate traffic that the states
require the legislation. </i></p>

<p>Anslinger agreed: </p>

<p><i>[W]e have had requests from the states to step in because
they claimed it was not growing in that state, but that it was
coming in from another state </i>(U.S. Congress, 1937:16).<br>
</p>

<p>Nothing was presented to support that statement; no letters
from local authorities and no investigative reports by FBN agents
describing the trafficking apparatus. </p>

<p>The congressmen and senators participating in the hearings
accepted the Bureau's argument. In fact, Senator Brown, Chairman
of the subcommittee which considered the legislation in the
Senate, and Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee,
had been thoroughly briefed by the Bureau in advance of the
hearings. There was no probing of the Government witnesses. In
fact, the Government made its case in the House in one session,
and the next three sessions were devoted to countering the
technical objections of the oilseed, birdseed, and hemp
industries (U.S. Congress, 1937:59-65 67-86 .<br>
</p>

<p>On the last morning of scheduled hearings, Dr. William C.
Woodward appeared on behalf of the AMA to oppose the bill. Dr.
Woodward objected to H.R. 6385 because he believed that its
ultimate effect would be to so restrict medical use by red tape
that any medical use would be impossible. He admitted that there
were currently few therapeutic applications but he observed that
the bill inhibited further research which might bear fruit. He
went even further to imply that the bill was designed with this
objective in mind. He noted that if federal legislation was
considered necessary, it could be achieved without sacrificing
medical usage by simply amending the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>Dr. Woodward's most pointed attack was directed against the
assumption that federal legislation was needed to control the
marihuana habit. He argued that existing state legislation was
more than sufficient if properly enforced and that if lack of
coordination was the problem, that was the FBN's fault. </p>

<p>Noting that the FBN already had the authority to &quot;arrange
for the exchange of information concerning the use and abuse of
narcotic drugs in [the] states and for cooperation in the
institution and prosecution of suits . . .,&quot; he asserted
that the Bureau had not done its job:<br>
</p>

<p><i>If there is at the present time any weakness in our state
laws relating to cannabis or to marihuana, a fair share of the
blame, if not all of it, rests on the Secretary of the Treasury
and his assistants who have had this duty imposed upon them for 6
and more years</i> (U.S. Congress, 1937: 93).<br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Woodward also contended that the law would be a useless
expense to the medical profession and unenforcible. He noted:
&quot;Since marihuana grows so freely, and every landowner was a
potential producer, whether wittingly or unwittingly, full
enforcement would require inspection of the entire land area of
the country, a task which would be unseemly for the Federal
Government to undertake&quot; (U.S. Congress, 1937: 94-95). </p>

<p>Finally, Dr. Woodward wondered why, if federal legislation was
considered necessary, the Congress did not simply amend the
Harrison Act. To the Bureau's argument that such a course would
be unconstitutional, he inquired how Treasury's counsel could
argue that the present bill was constitutional since the
technique was identical. Dr. Woodward's own view was that the
amendment of the Harrison Act would be constitutional and that
such a course would dispel the professional objections which he
raised (U.S. Congress, 1937:97). </p>

<p>After accusing Dr. Woodward of obstructionism, evasiveness,
and bad faith, the Committee did not even thank him for his
testimony (U.S. Congress, 1937: 121). When the Senate Finance
Committee conducted hearings on the bill, now styled H.R. 6906,
two months later, Dr. Woodward submitted instead a short letter
which stated the AMA's reasons for opposing the bill (U.S.
Congress, 1937: 33-34). </p>

<p>Both Committees reported the bill favorably despite Woodward's
objections. The Ways and Means Report stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Under the influence of this drug the will is destroyed and
all power of directing and controlling thought is lost.
Inhibitions are released. As a result of these effects, it
appeared from testimony produced at the hearings that many
violent crimes have been and are being committed by persons under
the influence of the drug Not only is marihuana used by hardened
criminals to steel them to commit violent crimes, but it is also
being placed in the hands of high-school children in the form of
marihuana cigarettes by unscrupulous peddlers. Cases were cited
at the hearings of school children who have been driven to crime
and insanity through the use of the drug. Its continued use
results many times in impotency and insanity </i>(U.S. Congress,
1937: 1-2).<br>
</p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act passed the House of Representatives very
late in the afternoon of a long session on June 14, 1937; the
only opposition came from congressmen who had no idea what
marihuana was and desired further information before voting
(Congressional Record, 1937: 5575, 5689). Instead of a detailed
analysis they received a statement of one of the members of the
Ways and Means Committee, which repeated uncritically the lurid
criminal acts attributed to marihuana users at the hearings.
After less than two pages of debate, the Act passed without a
roll call (Congressional Record, 1937: 5575).<br>
</p>

<p><b>TIGHTENING THE LAW<br>
</b></p>

<p>After the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act, the FBN began with
a four-pronged enforcement policy:<br>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Control of cultivation of the plant for legitimate
        purposes and eradication of wild growth; </li>
    <li>Pacification of marihuana-sensationalism in the press; </li>
    <li>Education of the federal judiciary toward strict
        application of the law; and </li>
    <li>Allocation of federal enforcement resources toward major
        trafficking rather than petty possession offenses.<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The scope of the plant's growth, the transportability of the
seeds, the dormancy of the seeds, and the lack of a highly
efficient herbicide militated against a comprehensive eradication
program. The cost of such a program would have been substantial
even if success were assured. No active effort was undertaken to
conduct an acre-by-acre survey of the United States. </p>

<p>The eradication &quot;program&quot; became simply a matter of
reaction to routine information-letters from farmers who had
identified the plant and discoveries of acreage by law
enforcement agents. </p>

<p>As the Bureau's interest in marihuana subsided during the
1940's, so did the effort to eradicate the wild growth. In fact,
the Federal Government encouraged the cultivation of hemp during
the war, even though an inactive strain had not been developed,
because sources of sisal rope had been severed by Japan's
occupation of the Philippines. All over the United States, the
weed remained plentiful and largely undetected. </p>

<p>After passage of the Act, Commissioner Anslinger directed his
agents to discourage local officials from playing up any alleged
involvement of marihuana with crime to the press. On April 11,
1938, the Commissioner told his New York District Supervisor
that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>Our present policy is to discourage undue emphasis on
marihuana for the reason that in some sections of the country
recently press reports have been so exaggerated that interest in
the subject has become almost hysterical and we are therefore
trying to mold public opinion along more conservative and saner
lines </i>(Anslinger, April 11, 1938).<br>
</p>

<p>Immediately following passage of the Act, the FBN also
directed an &quot;educational&quot; effort toward the federal
judiciary to emphasize the need for severe sentences for
marihuana offenders. The Bureau also concentrated on the stifling
of suppliers, large interstate traffickers, and smugglers. Small
possession cases were to be left to local authorities. </p>

<p>Several factors, however, served to frustrate this policy.
First, marihuana traffic was highly disorganized and there was no
national or regional network as such (New York City, 1945).
Second, use was still concentrated geographically and
socioeconomically and was not a major enterprise. Finally, during
the war years, the Bureau abandoned responsibility for most
marihuana law enforcement to the states, where the disorganized
traffic and regional use could be most effectively controlled.
The FBN chose instead to concentrate on the opiates. </p>

<p>After the relative quiet of the war years there was apparently
a significant increase in narcotic drug abuse in the late, 1940's
and the public began to be concerned with the spread of narcotic
addiction, particularly among young persons. Congressional furor
was aroused by the assertion that the use of marihuana inevitably
led to the use of these harder drugs, particularly heroin.<br>
</p>

<p>The new legislation came in two waves. In 1951, Congress
passed the Boggs Act (Boggs Act, November 2, 1951: 767) which
increased penalties for all drug violators. For the first time in
federal drug legislation marihuana and the narcotic drugs were
lumped together, since the Act provided uniform penalties for the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (Boggs Act, November 2,
1951: 767) and the Marihuana Tax Act (21 USC 1964). The states
followed the federal lead. Then, in 1956, Congress passed the
Narcotic Control Act, escalating the penalties still further.
Once again the states responded in kind. </p>

<p>The hearings before the Subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee and the floor debate indicate that the Boggs Act
was motivated by a. perceived increase in narcotic use in the
period 1948 to 1951 (Kefauver Committee Hearings, 1951: 240-241;
New York Times, 1951). </p>

<p>Representative Boggs, speaking during the Congressional debate
on his bill, enunciated a concern which was reflected in many
other quarters. After noting that there had been a 24% increase
in arrests for narcotic violations between 1949 and 1950 and a
70% increase between 1948 and 1950, Representative Boggs stated: <br>
</p>

<p><i>The most shocking part about these figures is the fact that
there has been an alarming increase in drug addiction among
younger persons. In the first six months of 1946, the average age
of addicted persons committed . . . at Lexington, Kentucky, was
37.5 years. Only three patients were under the age of 21. During
the first six months of 1950, only four years later, the average
had dropped to 26.7 years and 766 patients were under the age of
21... </i>(Congressional Record, 1951: 8197).<br>
</p>

<p>Representative Boggs and others supported the mandatory
minimum sentences for drug peddlers because they felt that some
federal judges had been lax in enforcing the narcotic laws
(Congressional Record, 1951: 8197, 8207, 821 1). Public opinion
was overwhelming that harsh sentences, including the death
penalty for peddling narcotics to minors, would strangle the drug
monster then stalking the American youth (Kefauver Committee
Hearings, 1951: 430-431). </p>

<p>The Boggs Act was directed in large part at the federal
judiciary since a key provision removed judicial discretion in
sentencing by providing that upon conviction for a second or
subsequent offense the imposition or execution of the sentence
could not be suspended nor probation granted. </p>

<p>There had been no concerted lobbying effort by the judicial
community during the legislative process; however, James V.
Bennett, Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, aroused the
judges in the Fifth U.S. Circuit District into eventually
recommending the amendment of the law to remove provisions for
mandatory minimum sentences (Yew Orleans Statesman, May 28, 1954;
New Orleans Times-Picayune, May 28, 1954). </p>

<p>Even while the Boggs Act was still pending in Congress, the
Bureau of Narcotics encouraged the states to modify their
existing narcotic and marihuana legislation to enact
&quot;penalties similar to those provided in the Boggs Bill
[which] would be of material assistance in the fight against the
narcotic traffic&quot; (Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1950: 6). </p>

<p>Seventeen states and the territory of Alaska responded by
passing &quot;little Boggs Acts&quot; by 1953 and 11 other states
increased their penalties by 1956. Two of the latter group, Ohio
and Louisiana, enacted penalty provisions which were
substantially more severe than those passed previously in any
jurisdiction (Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1956: 28). </p>

<p>The Ohio law, approved June 16,1955, provided a 20 to 40 year
sentence for the sale of narcotic drugs. The Louisiana measure,
adopted the following year, provided severe prison sentences
without parole, probation, or suspension for the illegal sale,
possession, or administration of a narcotic drug. The sentences
ranged from a five-year minimum to a 99-year maximum (Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, 1951: 8). </p>

<p>Underlying the inclusion of marihuana in the scheme of
increased penalties was the progression theory. In the Boggs
hearings many witnesses testified to the link between marihuana
use and ultimate heroin addiction. Commissioner Anslinger, for
example, testified: <br>
</p>

<p><i>The danger is this: Over 50 percent of these young addicts
started on marihuana smoking. They started there and graduated to
heroin; they took the needle when the thrill of marihuana was
gone </i>(Boggs Act Hearings, 1951: 206).<br>
</p>

<p>Representative Boggs himself summed up the stepping-stone
thesis in House floor debate:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Our younger people usually start on the road which leads to
drug addiction by smoking marihuana. They then graduate into
narcotic drugs-cocaine, morphine, and heroin. When these younger
persons become addicted to the drugs, heroin, for example, which
costs from $8 to $15 per day, they very often must embark on
careers of crime ... and prostitution ... in order to buy the
supply which they need</i> (Congressional Record, 1951:
8197-8198).<br>
</p>

<p>The stepping-stone theory thus supplanted the older hypotheses
which had linked marihuana to addiction, insanity and violent
crime. </p>

<p>In a paper filed as an exhibit to the hearings on the Boggs
Act, Dr. Harris Isbell, Director of Research at the Public Health
Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, stated that marihuana
was not physically addictive, although he paid lip service to the
psychological dependence hypothesis (Boggs Act Hearings, 1951:
147-148). </p>

<p>Acknowledging the possibility of &quot;temporary
psychosis&quot; in &quot;predisposed individuals,&quot; Isbell
otherwise disputed the crime and insanity thesis. Before the
Kefauver Committee in the Senate he testified that: </p>

<p><i>[M]arihuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated,
giggle, laugh, bother no one, and have a good time. They do not
stagger or fall, and ordinarily will not attempt to harm anyone. </i></p>

<p><i>It has not been proved that smoking marihuana leads to
crimes of violence or to crimes of a sexual nature. Smoking
marihuana has no unpleasant after-effects, no dependence is
developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped at
any time. In fact, it is probably easier to stop smoking
marihuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes </i>(Kefauver
Committee Hearings, 1951: 119). <br>
</p>

<p>Some observers felt that the narcotics problem had disappeared
almost entirely from the national scene after the Boggs Act was
passed. Nevertheless, state and federal law enforcement
authorities, armed with data suggesting that the strengthening of
the drug laws had at least halted the increase in drug use,
pressed for further increases in penalties in order to root out
the drug menace entirely (Federal Bureau of Narcotics. 1956: 28).
Without extended debate or widened public interest, Congress
passed the Narcotic Control Drug Act in 1956 (Daniel Committee
Hearings, 1955: 57). </p>

<p>There was less attention paid to marihuana during
Congressional debate in 1956 than had been the case in 1951. But,
the established precedent of classifying marihuana with hard
narcotics continued and resulted in a proliferation of marihuana
offenses and a, further increase in penalties based on the theory
that the end of the American narcotics experience could thereby
be assured. </p>

<p>However, efficacy of still higher penalties was not uniformly
accepted among law enforcement officials; the Deputy Commissioner
of the FBN suggested that more severe penalties might press grand
juries not to indict and the petty juries not to convict in drug
cases. Others rejected this view and felt strongly that more
severe penalties were imperative if society was to be rid of its
present peddlers and if new entrants into the narcotics business
were to be deterred (Good, July 31, 1954). </p>

<p>Among congressmen considering the Bill, there was no dissent
from the proposition that harsher penalties were the means to
eliminate the illicit use and sale of all drugs (Congressional
Record. 1956: 10689). </p>

<p>In addition to facilitating enforcement of narcotics laws
through a number of ancillary provisions, the Narcotics Control
Act of 1956 established the following penalties:<br>
</p>

<table border="1">

    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>10 years</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Parole or probation were made unavailable to all except first
offenders in the possession category (26 TTSC, 1964). </p>

<p>The Act also created a new offense by prohibiting illegal
importation of marihuana. Simple possession was by statute
sufficient to convict the possessor of knowingly receiving
illegally imported marihuana (21 USC, 1964). </p>

<p>Few legislators recognized that marihuana was in any way
different from the physically addictive narcotics. The House
Subcommittee on Narcotics, which produced what became the
essentials of the 1956 Act, had inserted a footnote to the major
heading &quot;Narcotics&quot; which stated in fine print that the
term narcotics included marihuana (U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News,
1956: 3294). Only once during the Congressional debates on the
House and Senate versions of the Bill was the subject of
marihuana as a separate substance even raised. </p>

<p>Moreover, in a statement reflecting the general acceptance of
the stepping-stone concept, Senator Daniel, Chairman of the
Senate Subcommittee that investigated the drug problem, described
marihuana: <br>
</p>

<p><i>That is a drug which starts most addicts In the use of
drugs, Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to some of
the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted to the
habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin habit and then to
the final destruction of the persons addicted </i>(U.S. Code
Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 1956: 3294).<br>
</p>

<p>By the fifties, marihuana had been fully integrated into the
narcotics legislation of every state in the Union and of the
national government. Possession of the drug, even for one's own
use, was a felony everywhere, and the user was subject to long
periods of incarceration as punishment for his indulgence.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1960-1970: NEW LEGISLATIVE APPROACH</b> </p>

<p>From the mid-fifties to the mid-sixties, federal activity in
marihuana and narcotic law enforcement was relatively stable. The
number of offenders apprehended and convicted in both areas
remained constant (U.S. Courts, 1956-1964). </p>

<p>However, in the early and mid-sixties a new phenomenon was
occurring. Drug abuse began to spread. It no longer confined
itself to the ghettos and certain socioeconomic and ethnic
groups; the new users were the sons and daughters of the middle
class. It began striking home at the average American and became
a national, major issue of concern (Rosevear, 1967: 117-131; U.S.
Bureau of Narcotics, 1966: 40). </p>

<p>The new middle class use of marihuana induced significant
medical inquiry into the nature of the drug and spurred a new
legislative approach. One commentator stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Nobody cared when it was a ghetto problem. Marihuana-well,
it was used by jazz musicians or the lower class, so you didn't
care if they got 2 to 20 years. But when a nice, middle-class
girl or boy in college gets busted for the same thing, then the
whole community sits up and takes notice. And that's the name of
the game today. The problem has begun to come home to roost-in
all strata of society, in suburbia, in middle-class homes, in the
colleges. Suddenly, the punitive, vindictive approach was
touching all classes of society. And now the most exciting thing
that's really happening is the change in attitude by the people.
Now we have a willingness to examine the problem as to whether
it's an experimentation, or an illness rather than 'an evil' </i>(New
York Times, Feb. 5, 1970: 14).<br>
</p>

<p>Congress initially acted by passage of the Drug Abuse Control
Amendments of 1965 (Public Law 89-74,1965). This legislation
established a Bureau of Drug Abuse Control within the Food and
Drug Administration and created criminal, misdemeanor penalties
for the illegal manufacture and sale of depressant and stimulant
drugs and hallucinogens. </p>

<p>The dramatic increase in the use of marihuana and other drugs
during the latter 1960's was a matter of high public visibility.
In response, President Johnson offered Reorganization Plan No. 1
of 1968 (H. Doe. No. 249,1968). This reorganization was effective
on April 8, 1968 and placed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (of
Treasury) and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (of FDA) in the
Department of Justice and designated it the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs. </p>

<p>What had been obvious with the passage of the 1965 Drug
Amendments became glaring with this reorganization, that is, the
tremendous disparity in penalties for violations involving
dangerous drugs as opposed to narcotics and marihuana. As a
result of increased medical and scientific inquiry, LSD and
several other drugs 'were acknowledged as being more powerful
hallucinogens than marihuana. </p>

<p>To compound the disparity, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
major active ingredient in marihuana, was placed under controls
whereby someone in unauthorized possession of THC was subject to
no penalty, but someone in possession of marihuana was subject to
a minimum mandatory penalty of two years imprisonment (Federal
Register, 1968: 14880). Congress then changed the possession
penalty, tinder the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, to a
misdemeanor and increased the penalties for sale or manufacture
of LSD and the other controlled drugs to up to five years (Public
Law 90-639, 1968). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, a great disparity regarding penalties for these
substances still existed. The atmosphere for change was ripe.
Adding pressure to the situation was the criminalization of
increasing numbers of young persons whose sole crime was
possession of marihuana for their own use. </p>

<p>In late 1968, the newly formed Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs drafted legislation which would nationalize
control of the drugs under the Bureau's jurisdiction. The
proposed law vested on the commerce clause rather than on the
taxing powers. </p>

<p>The change in authority was prophetic because the Leary
decision, which was handed down by the Supreme Court on May 19,
1969, held that the order form procedure necessary to meet the
requirements of the Marihuana Tax Laws, forced an individual to
incriminate himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment (Leary v.
U.S., 1969). Ostensibly, this decision left BNDD with no
marihuana possession law and was another factor in evidence of
the need for a revision of the law. </p>

<p>This new bill , H.R. 13742, covered the regulation of narcotic
drugs, &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; and marihuana. It was
transmitted by President Nixon on July 14, 1969. </p>

<p>Emerging from this legislation was an overall balanced scheme
of criminal penalties. Minimum mandatory offenses were
essentially abolished and the offense of possession of a
controlled substance for one's own use was made a misdemeanor.
Further, in first-offense, simple possession cases, the court was
given the discretion to place a defendant on probation, for up to
one year. If, at the end of the probation period, the defendant
bad not violated any of the conditions of the probation, his
conviction could be expunged. </p>

<p>The same misdemeanor penalty and opportunity for first
offender treatment was provided for the distribution of a small
amount of marihuana for either: (1) no remuneration; or (2) the
cost of the drug. </p>

<p>This provision was included in recognition of the large number
of such transactions which take place among youth and in
recognition of a phenomenon which surfaced as a substantial
challenge to the traditional picture of the national marihuana
trade. Legislators had formerly stereotyped the
&quot;seller&quot; as the vicious criminal pushing his wares for
high profit and felt that extraordinarily harsh penalties were
justified for sellers (Narcotics Legislation Hearings, 1969: 4). </p>

<p>But several studies showed that the structure of marihuana
traffic bore little or no relation to the traditional stereotype.
One survey of 204 users found that 44% had sold to friends at
least once. Many casual users sold to leave themselves enough
profit to cover the amount of their own use (Goode, 1969: 7).
Under the new Act, they would not be punished as distributors. </p>

<p>The new legislation also made a distinction between marihuana
and narcotic drugs. Marihuana was placed in a category with
hallucinogenic drugs and their difference from narcotics was
emphasized by the difference in penalties as follows:<br>

<p>* Distribution of small amounts of marihuana for no
remuneration is treated the same as simple possession.<br>
</p>

<p>The bill was passed by Congress (and signed into law by
President Nixon) on October 27, 1970, as the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. </p>

<p>In conjunction with this new federal law, a uniform state act
was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws and approved by them as the Uniform Controlled
Substances Act at their annual conference August 1-7, 1970. </p>

<p>The following statement in the preface of the Act explains its
purpose:<br>
</p>

<p>This Uniform Act was drafted to achieve uniformity between the
laws of the several states and those of the Federal Government.
it has been designed to complement the new federal narcotic and
dangerous drug legislation and Provide and interlocking trellis
of Federal and state law to enable government at all levels to
control more effectively the drug abuse problem. </p>

<p>The Uniform Act does not recommend penalties except with
respect to possession for one's own use. For such offenses, the
Conference recommended that it be treated as a misdemeanor. </p>

<p>To date, 26 states and three territories have adopted the Act
in its entirety or in a varied form. Currently, 10 to 15 states
are considering it. </p>

<p>The most recent chapter in the legal history of marihuana
appears in other pages of this Appendix. The appointment of the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse and the issuance
of its Report are themselves significant events from an
historical point of view.<br>

<p><b>National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>History of Alcohol Prohibition*</h1>

<p><b>*This section is based in large part on a paper prepared
for the Commission by Jane Lang McGrew, an attorney from
Washington, D.C. <br>
</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1920, the national policy of Prohibition began. The 18th
Amendment to the Constitution had been officially ratified:<br>
</p>

<p><i>It sought, by law, to make the whole Nation into enforced
teetotalers and to put an end to all evils associated with
drinking. It sought to eradicate a taste deeply rooted in the
habits and customs of a large part of the population through
outlawing the business that ministered to its satisfaction</i>
(Hu, 1950: 48).<br>
</p>

<p><b>1650-1750: THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS<br>
</b></p>

<p>In fact, it started earlier. &quot;Ministers shall not give
themselves to excess in drinkinge, or riott, or spending their
tyme idellye day or night,&quot; ruled the Virginia Colonial
Assembly in 1629 (Cherrington, 1920:16). </p>

<p>Massachusetts ordered that no person shall remain in any
tavern &quot;longer than necessary occasions&quot; in 1637, while
Plymouth Colony in 1633 prohibited the sale of spirits &quot;more
than 2 pence worth to anyone but strangers just arrived&quot;
(Cherrington, 1920: 18). </p>

<p>This sampling of the earliest colonial laws is representative
of the attempt, continued since those times, to control excessive
consumption. Excessive drinking, it was considered, produced
behavior unseemly in some, such as ministers, and dangerous in
others, such as Indians. </p>

<p>But drinking per se was not frowned upon. Indeed, when the
Puritans set sail to Massachusetts, they had taken care to carry
with them 42 tons of beer (in contrast with 14 tons of water) and
10,000 gallons of wine (Lee, 1963: 15). </p>

<p>The regulation of liquor consumption was a matter of
considerable concern in certain colonies. Thus, for a time,
Massachusetts went so far as to prohibit the drinking of healths
in 1638 (Lee, 1963: 19). The law was soon abandoned for reasons
obvious, albeit unrecorded. It rapidly became clear, however,
that liquor laws could do more and perhaps better, than control
consumption: they could provide a source of revenue. By the turn
of the 18th century, the regulatory impulse was concentrated on
fines, excise taxes and license fees. </p>

<p>Fines were imposed for drunken behavior, unlawful sales to a
drunken tippler or to Indians, and for selling without a license.
Court records indicate that these laws were enforced with
reasonable regularity (Krout 1967: 29-30). Licenses often carried
their own fees, and excise taxes were levied upon distilled
spirits as well as beer and fermented drink in many cases. </p>

<p>Until the 18th century, however, there was no attempt to
prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale, or consumption of
alcoholic beverages. Quite the contrary, at least one
individual-in some cases a reluctant individual-was required in
many towns to run the local inn or public house for visitors and
travelers. </p>

<p>Although colonial statutes made it clear that tipplers and
idlers were unwelcome, the diary of a colonial traveler, Sarah
Kemble Knight, suggests that such laws were unsuccessful in
containing the ribaldry which took place in many such houses.
Madam Knight complained:<br>
</p>

<p><i>I could get no sleep, because of the Clamor of some of the
Town Tope-ers in the next room.... I heartily fretted &amp;
wish't 'am tongue tyed.... They kept calling for Tother Gill, Wch
while they were swallowing, was some Intermission, But presently,
like Oyle to fire, encreased the flame </i>(Miller, Johnson,
eds., 1963: 430-431).<br>
</p>

<p>Persons other than Madam Knight were to become more outspoken
about their concern for the use of spirits. The, most significant
premonition was the Colony of Georgia's action in 1735 when the
first prohibitory statute against the importation of &quot;ardent
spirits&quot; was enacted. At the same time, however, the
consumption of beer was encouraged (Grant, 1932: 1). The time for
temperance had not yet arrived.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1750-1825: TEMPERANCE STIRRINGS<br>
</b></p>

<p>As the evils of intemperance began to attract the attention of
the ministry, John Wesley denounced the sin of distilling -and
declared for its Prohibition in 1773 (Cherrington, 1920: 37-38). </p>

<p>On his heels came the publication of a pamphlet entitled
&quot;The Mighty Destroyer Displayed and Some Account of the
Dreadful Havoc Made by the Mistaken Use, As Well As the Abuse, of
Distilled Spiritous Liquors,&quot; by Anthony Benezet, a member
of the Society of Friends, advising against the use of any drink
&quot;which is liable to steal away a man's senses and render him
foolish, irrascible, uncontrollable, and dangerous&quot;
(Cherrington, 1920: 38). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, typical of the century's ambivalence, the first
master at Harvard was fired when it was found that Harvard
students had been left &quot;wanting beer betwixt brewings a week
and a week and a half together&quot; (Lee, 1963: 16). </p>

<p>Concern for the effect of liquor upon the public weal was
expressed by John Adams who noted in his diary on February 29,
1760, that the taverns were &quot;becoming the eternal haunt of
loose, disorderly people . . .&quot; (Cherrington, 1920: 37).
Worst of all he continued: <br>
</p>

<p><i>... These houses are become the nurseries of our
legislators. An artful man, who has neither sense nor sentiments,
may, by gaining a little sway among the rabble of the town,
multiply taverns and dram shops and thereby secure the votes of
taverner and retailer and of all; and the multiplication of
taverns will make many, who may be induced to flip and rum, to
vote for any man whatever </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 215).<br>
</p>

<p>The health argument in behalf of temperance was first made by
Nathaniel Ames, in the 1752 edition of his Almanack, who wrote
that </p>

<p><i>Strong Waters were formerly used only by the Direction of
Physicians; but now Mechanicks and low-li'd Labourers drink Rum
like Fountain-Water, and they can infinitely better endure it
than the idle. unactive and sedentary Part of Mankind, but DEATH
is in the bottom of the cup of every one </i>(Lee, 1963: 22).<br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Benjamin Rush shared his concern, publishing in 1785 his
now famous &quot;Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon
the Human Body and Mind.&quot; Enumerating the diseases of the
body and mind which plague the drinker of distilled liquors, Dr.
Rush outlined the symptoms, including &quot;unusual garrulity,
unusual silence, captiousness ... an insipid simpering ...
profane swearing ... certain immodest actions&quot; and
&quot;certain extravagant acts which indicate a temporary fit of
madness&quot; (Rush, 1943: 323, 325-326). </p>

<p>Although the rumblings of the temperance movement were thus
perceptible in the late 18th century, there is no evidence that
its effects were felt. In 1766, it is recorded that the repeal of
the Stamp Act was greeted in Providence, Rhode Island with
&quot;32 of the most loyal, patriotic and constitutional
toasts&quot; (Lee, 1963: 18). Notwithstanding this evidence of
devotion to His Majesty. it was often thereafter the tavern which
provided the meeting places for the most defiant revolutionaries.
</p>

<p>Subsequently, when the colonial period disappeared into the
post-Revolutionary era, Alexander Hamilton adopted the idea
earlier effected by the individual colonies, to tax distilled
liquors for revenue purposes. In 1791 , the tax was enacted as
part of the Revenue Act. The following year, the Second Congress
of the United States added license fees for distilleries and
taxes on liquors distilled from imported materials. </p>

<p>Incensed by this federal action, farmers in Western
Pennsylvania mobbed revenue collectors and armed to resist this
intrusion by the new Federal Government. It required 15,000
militia to bring the so-called Whiskey Rebellion to an end
(Peterson, 1969: 119-120). Such was the first indication that the
liquor industry in the United States would be a force with which
the government would have to reckon. </p>

<p>Toward the end of the 18th century, a temperance movement, as
such, became discernible. The Methodist Church took a staunch
position against the sale or imbibing of ardent spirits
&quot;unless in cases of extreme necessity.&quot; Five years
later, in 1789, even the exception was excised (Cherrington,
1920: 50). A similar platform was adopted by the Presbyterian
Synod of Pennsylvania and by the Yearly Meeting of Friends of New
England (Cherrington, 1920: 51, 58). </p>

<p>On a non-clerical level, the movement began to organize.
Although there is some dispute as to the identity of the original
temperance society, it appears that as early as 1778, there was
an organization calling itself the Free African Society which
excluded men of drinking habits, followed soon thereafter by the
Organization of Brethren, and the Litchfield, Connecticut
Association of &quot;the most respectable farmers&quot; in
Connecticut determined to discourage the use of spirits
(Cherrington, 1920: 49, 58). </p>

<p>The turn of the century saw the vitalization of the temperance
spirit. Religious leaders, including Cotton Mather, Dr. Lyman
Beecher, John Wesley and Reverend Andrew Elliott inveighed
against the consumption of liquors. Temperance activity figured
prominently in the concerns of the Presbyterian, Methodist,
Universalist, Baptist, and Friends churches. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Had. the temperance reform in America awaited for a
non-church or a non-Christian leadership,&quot;</i> theorizes one
historian, </p>

<p><i>... the temperance revolution of the past century would yet
remain to be accomplished.... Every successful temperance
movement of the last century has been merely the instrument-the
machinery and equipment through which the fundamental principles
of the Christian religion have expressed themselves in terms of
life and action</i> (Cherrington, 1920:92).<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever the Christian input , however, it is also apparent
that a desire to reform was aroused in the country, very much
like that which was to be experienced a century later during the
Progressive Movement. Thus, Massachusetts Society for the
Suppression of Intemperance of 1813, damned not only rum, but all
of the &quot;kindred vices, profaneness and gambling&quot; and
beseeched members to &quot;discourage... by ... example and
influence, every kind of..... immorality&quot; (Lee, 1963: 23).
Mingling with the potential temperance leaders during this period
were the future spokesmen of abolitionism, feminism, and
utopianism. </p>

<p>In the meantime, the industry was able to report triumphantly
that the federal taxes on distilling and importing spirits were
repealed in 1802. From 1813 until 1817, the retailers' and
distillers' licenses bore a federal tax, but beginning in 1818
the industry enjoyed a tax-free era which was to last until 1862.
Thomas Jefferson rejoiced-&quot;as a moralist&quot;-explaining
that: </p>

<p><i>It is an error to view a tax on that liquor as merely a tax
on the rich. It is a prohibition of its use in the middling class
of our citizens, and a condemnation of them to the poison of
whisky, which is desolating their houses. No nation is drunken
where wine is cheap; and none sober, where the only antidote is
the bane of whisky </i>(Peterson, 1969: 122-123).<br>
</p>

<p>Future prohibitionists would likewise castigate the government
for drawing its revenues from the liquor industry and
participating in the profits of evil thereby.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1825-1870: THE PLEDGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Temperance was not always equated with teetotalism. Beer and
usually wine were initially exempt from denunciation in both
sermons and treatises. There developed in the mid-19th century,
however, the conviction that all brews, be they &quot;ardent
spirits,&quot; beer, ale, or wine, were anathema. </p>

<p>The, new temper of the movement was epitomized by the travels
of Father Theobald Matthew of Ireland who toured the United
States from 1849 to 1851, administering the pledge of total
abstinence to some 600,000 persons in 25 states. A White House
dinner and a Senate reception stamped official approval upon his
sojourns (Furnas, 1968: 80). Thus did temperance drift into a new
phase, with its ardent spokesman, Congressman Gerrit Smith,
crying that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>I would that no person were able to drink intoxicating
liquors without immediately becoming a drunkard. For, who, then
would . . . drink the poison that always kills, or jump into the
fire that always burns?</i> (Furnas, 1968: 15).<br>
</p>

<p>It was in this atmosphere that the first prohibition
experiments were undertaken on a statewide basis. &quot;Until the
liquor traffic is abolished . . . all efforts at moral reform
must languish,&quot; judged one of the earliest prohibitionists. </p>

<p>In &quot;Grappling with the Monster,&quot; T. S. Arthur
stated, &quot;The CURSE is upon us, and there is but one CURE:
Total Abstinence, by the help of God, for the Individual, and
Prohibition for the State&quot; (Furnas, 1968: 15). </p>

<p>In 1847, the first such cure was enacted for the state of
Maine (Cherrington, 1920: 134). (Actually, the first Prohibition
law went into effect in 1843 in the territory of Oregon. This was
repealed five years later.) </p>

<p>A wave of prohibition statutes followed. Delaware, on the
heels of Maine, passed its first prohibition law only to have it
declared unconstitutional the following year. Similar laws were
enacted in Ohio, Illinois, Rhode Island, Minnesota,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York during the
next few years. They met with varying fates, including veto by
the governors, repeal by the legislatures and invalidation by the
state supreme courts. </p>

<p>The evaluations by several historians of these early trials
were to he heard again in the 20th century: the enactments lacked
support from a large portion of the population, making
enforcement exceedingly difficult. Ultimately, all but one of the
states repealed the prohibition statutes of the 19th century
(Grant, 1932: 5; Peterson, 1969: 123). </p>

<p>Notwithstanding this record, prohibitionists took heart.
&quot;This thing is of God,&quot; cried Lyman Beecher from the
pulpit. &quot;That glorious Maine law was a square and grand blow
right between the horns of the Devil&quot; (Furnas, 1968: 167).
Temperance societies, established in all but three states by 1832
and destined to proliferate, began to consolidate as well. </p>

<p>The American Temperance Society, later to become the American
Temperance Union, was organized in 1826. It quickly begat
auxiliaries, so that by 1835, 8,000 locals existed (Cherrington,
1920: 92-93). </p>

<p>As the years passed, they witnessed the founding of more
temperance, organizations of a general and national character
than during any other period in the United States' history. The
Washingtonian movement, organized in the City of Baltimore in
1840, was followed by the Martha Washington movement in 1841. </p>

<p>The Sons of Temperance came into existence in 1842, at, the
same time the Order of Rechabites was organized, and the
Congressional Temperance Society of 1833 was revived on the basis
of total abstinence. They took heart at their early state,
successes and fought against the defeats of repeal. </p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the United States government, which
had heaped honors upon Father Matthew, concluded a treaty with
King Kamehameha III of Hawaii in 1850 permitting the introduction
and sale of liquor on his island. </p>

<p>As further evidence of the national dichotomy, Chicagoans in
the 1850's fought virulently against the enforcement of Sunday
closing laws. To protest, an armed mob burst into the business
district of the city, to be met by police. Fortunately, the mob
was dispersed before the mayor found it necessary to use the
cannon he had hurriedly planted around City Hall (Peterson, 1969:
120). </p>

<p>It was the time when patent medicines, 40 proof and more,
began to develop their clientele. And although the Demon Rum
might threaten their health and life, Lydia Pinkham's Compound
offered a cure for any and all ails and aches. </p>

<p>By the time of the Civil War, both the assimilative and
coercive traditions of the temperance movement had crystallized:
that is, temperance proponents were determined to save the weak
and to destroy the recalcitrant (Gusfield, 1963: 69-70). The
hardening of positions was accompanied by the development of
political consciousness in the movement and recognition of
political objectives. These processes were only temporarily
blunted by the Civil War in the 1860's and the diversion of
interest to the abolitionist cause. </p>

<p>Part of the heritage of the Civil War was the tax on liquor
and beer imposed in 1862. Rates were increased several times
between 1863 and 1868, so that the tax imposed at the rate of 20
cents per gallon rose to $2 per gallon. </p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon was noted by the Federal Government:
as the rates increased, the revenue did not. In fact, the number
of gallons reported actually declined. As the decade went on,
attempts were made to enforce the tax laws and in 1868, $25,000
was actually appropriated to detect violators. Fraud continued
almost unabated. Stockpiling of liquor was popular to hedge
against future, increases, for they were not applicable to liquor
on hand. </p>

<p>The infamous Whiskey Ring was active in these days and was not
finally broken up until 1875, when, in a peak of nerve, members
established a corruption fund in the District of Columbia to halt
the prosecution of 321 persons charged with violations of the
revenue laws. Before then, however, Congress apparently had
second thoughts about the implications of the revenue collections
and reduced the tax from the high of $2 per gallon to 50 cents in
1869. The happy result was to see a rise in collections from
$13.5 million in 1868, to $45 million in 1869, and $55 million
the following year. Taking further precautions, the government
stipulated that new stamps be developed to preclude
counterfeiting and tampering (History of the Alcohol 14-20;
Cherrington, 1920: 156162). </p>

<p>Congress did not escape unscathed by criticism and reaction.
It came from both sides of the temperance issue. Temperance
advocates such as Senator Wilson of Massachusetts and Senator
Pomeroy of Kansas decried the fact that federal revenues would be
drawn from the liquor industry. </p>

<p>At the same, time, however, the industry revolted, leading to
mass tax evasion schemes and devices and the organization of
their first industry lobby, the United States Brewers
Association. The Association rapidly launched a, legislative
campaign and succeeded in 1863 in reducing the tax rate of beer
from $1 to 60 cents (Cherrington, 1920:157). </p>

<p>By 1870, the Civil War dust had cleared and the temperance
battle lines were drawn, already tested by the skirmishes of the
1840's and 1850's. The most interesting feature of their war
strategy was soon to become apparent: women and children were
welcomed at the battlements.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1870-1913: TOWARD A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE </b></p>

<p>A series of &quot;isms&quot; was aroused in this era:
feminism, unionism, socialism, and progressivism. Prohibition
absorbed elements of them all, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The feminist movement originated early in the 1800's. Until
the 1870's, however, feminine involvement in the temperance
effort was largely peripheral. The Women's Crusade of 1873 and
the organization of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in
1874 marked the formal entrance of women into the temperance
movement.<br>
</p>

<p>The WCTU was devotedly headed by Frances E. Willard, a lady
equally committed to the principle of equality of the sexes.
Temperance was to bridge the gap, she believed:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Drink and tobacco are the great separatists [sic] between
men and women. Once they used these things together, but woman's
evolution has carried her beyond them; man will climb to the same
level . . . but meanwhile ... the fact that he permits himself
fleshly indulgence that he would deprecate in her, makes their
planes different, giving her an instinct of revulsion </i>(Furnas,
1968: 281).<br>
</p>

<p>Although the WCTU was organized initially around the
temperance issue, it was not long before Miss Willard's
leadership expanded its conscience. </p>

<p>A statement of principles was adopted in its early years: </p>

<p><i>We believe in a living wage; in an 8-hour day; in courts of
conciliation and arbitration, in justice as opposed to greed in
gain; in &quot;Peace on Earth and Good Will to Men&quot;</i>
(Gusfield, 1963: 76).<br>
</p>

<p>Within three years of its inception, the WCTU reported that
its concerns included &quot;a better Indian policy&quot; and
&quot;wiser civil service reform&quot; (Gusfield, 1963: 77).
There were those in the Union who felt that their interests
should be limited to temperance. But, forecasting the mood of
Progressivism, Miss Willard steered the organization along the
broader lines to social reform. </p>

<p>The WCTU was responsible for part of the early campaign to
educate the public about temperance. Children were recruited to
sing praises of &quot;the true and the brave&quot; who signed the
abstinence pledge. They were assisted in this effort by
McGuffey's Readers which denounced the licensing of liquor stores
and saloons:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Licensed-to do thy neighbor harm,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to kindle hire and strife,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to nerve the robber's arm,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to whet the murderer's knife,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-like spider for a fly,</i> </p>

<p><i>To spread thy nets for man, thy prey,</i> </p>

<p><i>To mock his struggles, crush his soul,</i> </p>

<p><i>Then cast his worthless form away </i>(Lee, 1963: 34-35).<br>
</p>

<p>Whiskey makes &quot;the happy miserable&quot; and impoverishes
the rich, the, McGuffey books concluded. And the word spread. By
1902, the temperance campaign had permeated the public school
systems: every state but Arizona had introduced compulsory
temperance education. Their texts teemed with both facts and
misinformation such as &quot;Alcohol sometimes causes the coats
of the blood vessels to grow thin. They are then liable at any
time to cause death by bursting.&quot; (Sinclair, 1962: 43). </p>

<p>The WCTU was not carrying the burden of reform alone, however.
In 1869, the National Prohibition Party was born. Three years
later, the first party ticket was put forth in the presidential
campaign of 1872, headed by John Black, who received 5,607 votes
for President. Success at the polls ultimately peaked in 1892
when John Dedwell, the Prohibition presidential candidate,
received a total of 270,710 votes. Thereafter, its partisans
declined in number, having failed to break voters away from their
traditional affiliations (Cherrington, 1920: 165-169). </p>

<p>As a rule, the WCTU eschewed partisanship. Their objectives
were far broader and more practical than those contemplated by
the Prohibition Party. Only once it supported the Prohibition
Party in the notorious election of 1884. </p>

<p>The election of 1884 carried a variety of implications for
future candidates on the temperance issue. In New York City
alone, 1,007 primaries and conventions reportedly were held by
the various parties. Of these, over 60% took place in saloons
(Peterson, 1969: 123), recalling to mind the complaint of John
Adams a century before (Cherrington, 1920: 37; Dobyns, 1940:
215). The meeting places were indicative of the fact that at this
time neither party could afford to adopt a dry plank in its
platform, for New York would be a pivotal state in the race
between Republican James G. Blaine and Democrat Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p>Blaine campaigned hard, trying to overcome the defection of
several thousand dry Republicans to the Prohibition Party.
Speaking in behalf of Blaine at a New York City rally,
Presbyterian minister Samuel Burchard denounced the Democrats as
the party of &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.&quot; Needless
to say, the Catholic vote, as well as the wet vote, quickly
swelled the Democratic totals. Blaine, having thus alienated both
wets and drys, lost the state--and the election-by a tiny margin
(Furnas, 1968: 273; Lee, 1963: 29-30). </p>

<p>In case the lesson that temperance was an issue to be reckoned
with in national politics was lost on the parties after 1884, the
events of the decade culminating in the birth of the Anti-Saloon
League in 1895, dramatized the point. A second wave of state
prohibition laws was experienced between 1880 and 1890. The
results of much of the legislation during those years were less
than satisfying to temperance advocates, however; only six states
emerged with state-wide prohibition by statute or constitutional
amendment. Numerous other states had enacted local option, which
permitted towns to go dry if they so chose by referendum. Without
state or federal insulation from wet communities, however, the
so-called dry towns were scarcely temperance models. </p>

<p>In the wake of these state legislative actions, South Carolina
introduced a state dispensary system in order to eliminate the
motive of private gain from the liquor business. Political
scandals which quickly developed tended to discredit it, however,
if indeed it had enjoyed much support from any corner
(Cherrington, 1920: 250-251). </p>

<p>With this discomfiting history behind it, the Anti-Saloon
League arose to the challenge, while Carrie Nation independently
thrust her way into the public eye. The League was to develop the
art of lobbying or &quot;pressure political&quot; to its most
dramatic heights. Scarcely more than 10 years after organization,
it was described as &quot;the most dangerous political movement
that this country has ever known&quot; by the National Model
License League, a wet (and harassed) association. A more rational
viewpoint was expressed by the president of the New York State
Brewers Association in 1913: </p>

<p><i>We are not dealing with a theory which is the delusion of
the fanatic alone, but with a real condition which is in the
hands of a well organized force, led by aggressive, experienced,
and untiring leaders </i>(Odegard, 1928: 23).<br>
</p>

<p>The focus of the League's indictments included not simply
alcohol, but the saloon itself, as the purveyor of spirits. The
myriad League publications denounced the saloon for <i>&quot;annually
sending thousands of our youths to destruction, for corrupting
politics, dissipating workmen's wages, leading astray 60,000
girls each year into lives of immorality and banishing children
from school&quot;</i> (Odegard, 1928: 40-59). </p>

<p><i>&quot;Liquor is responsible for 19% of the divorces, 25% of
the poverty, 25% of the insanity, 37% of the pauperism, 45% of
child desertion, and 50% of the crime in this country,&quot;</i>
the League determined. <i>&quot;And this,&quot;</i> it concluded
, <i>&quot; is a very conservative estimate&quot;</i> (Odegard,
1928: 60). </p>

<p>League posters appeared everywhere depicting the saloon-keeper
as a profiteer who feasted on death and enslavement. Others
screamed out the dire consequences of alcohol. &quot;Alcohol
inflames the passions, thus making the temptation to sex-sin
unusually strong,&quot; advertised one (Sinclair, 1962: 51). </p>

<p>It was the League which geared up the campaign, but it was not
alone. As the Progressive spirit caught the national interest in
the early 19th century, the movement for reform embraced the
cause of temperance. The temperance movement assumed an aura of
evangelism, combining the concept of America's mission with the
vision of Messianism. Through the combination of temperance and
progressivism, it was believed that the Kingdom of God could
actually come to the United States.<br>
</p>

<p>In an article in Appleton's Magazine in 1908, the Reverend
Charles F. Aked articulated the aspirations of the reformers: </p>

<p><i>We are spending our lives, many of us, in the effort to
make the world a little better and brighter for those that shall
come after us.... we want to open out life and liberty to all the
sons of men. We want to make possible for all of life in the
whole, the good and the beautiful ... and the common sale of
intoxicating liquor renders our work a thousand times more
difficult ... </i>(Timberlake, 1063: 34-38).<br>
</p>

<p>Others were more mundane. Scientists began accumulating
evidence of the effect of quantities of alcohol on the nervous
system and general physical condition. The myth that alcohol
consumption improved muscular power was exploded. The
relationship between mental psychoses and alcohol was documented,
and thus did the condemnation of alcohol as a poison assume
scientific support. Finally, in 1915, whiskey and brandy were
discreetly removed from the list of authoritative medicinal drugs
contained in the United States Pharmacopoeia (Timberlake, 1963:
47). </p>

<p>Who were the people fueling the movement? Largely middle
class, rural, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant comprised the temperance
movement and they confronted the urban and industrial communities
head-on. &quot;The Anglo-Saxon stock is the best improved,
hardiest and fittest.... [I]f we are to preserve this nation and
the Anglo-Saxon type we must abolish [saloons],&quot; proclaimed
one temperance publication (Gusfield, 1963: 100). Calling itself
&quot;The Protestant church in action&quot; (Sinclair, 1962:
108), the Anti-Saloon League concentrated single-mindedly and
evangelically on the cause of temperance and refrained from
dabbling in other reforms (Gusfield, 1963: 108). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Episcopal and Lutheran churches never
aligned themselves with the AntiSaloon League, while Jewish and
Catholic groups generally opposed their objective. The conviction
shared by Anti-Saloon Leaguers expressed by Reverend Francis
Ascott McBride was: &quot;The League was born of God&quot; (Lee,
1963: 35). Thus one had to be for or against the movement; there
was no half-way commitment. </p>

<p>When the sides were lined up initially, industrialists and
union leaders alike preferred to keep God on their side. From the
company's point of view, the saloon was often responsible for
industrial injuries and absenteeism. Some believed that the
drinking man demanded higher wages than his sober counterparts.
Furthermore, union locals tended to congregate in saloon meeting
halls maintained for that purpose and, it was sometimes
suspected, for the plottings of anarchistic conspirators (Furnas,
1968: 310). </p>

<p>Accordingly, it was not long before industry moved from an
acquiescent position to an active role in the temperance
movement. Various methods were adopted to encourage sobriety,
including lectures, literature and job preferences for
teetotalers. Businessmen opined that sobriety expanded
productivity, increased bank deposits, improved collections and
stimulated the retail trade (Timberlake, 1963: 67-79). </p>

<p>At the same time, the prospect of diverting patronage of the
liquor industry to other products tantalized some industries.
Thus the Welch Grape Juice Company advertised:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Get the Welch Habit-It's one that won't get you!</i>
(Timberlake, 1963: 77).<br>
</p>

<p>Opinion was not unanimous, of course. Businessmen, including
bankers, whose interests were tied to the liquor industry could
ill afford to be beneficent toward temperance. Others, including
the DuPonts, Rockefellers, Kresges, and Wanamakers spent freely
to cover the League's annual campaign costs of $2.5 million
(Odegard, 1928: 126). </p>

<p>As surely as liquor was the enemy of the home, it was also
proclaimed the enemy of the working man. &quot;The great sinkhole
for the workers' wages is the saloon,&quot; wrote the editors of
one League publication, The California Liberator. &quot;When that
abomination is destroyed, labor is freed from its greatest
curse&quot; (Odegard, 1928: 53). The logic appealed to the union
leadership. According to one official of the American Federation
of Labor: <br>
</p>

<p><i>No force in our country has been as effective in the
promotion of temperance among working people as the organized
labor movement. The labor movement has achieved more for the
cause of temperance than all the temperance societies combined
... </i>(Timberlake, 1963: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>Since similar credit has been claimed for the League, the
Protestant church, and business interests, it is difficult to
apportion the plaudits. Subsequent events suggest that the labor
interests failed to live up to this claim, however. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding Terrence V. Powerderly's early speech against
&quot;the strong right hand of labor itself . . . that carries
with it the rum which drowns reason,&quot; his own Knights of
Labor repealed their constitutional provision which denied
membership to anyone connected with the liquor trade (Timberlake,
1963: 85-86). </p>

<p>As the reports of the National Commission on Enforcement of
the Prohibition Laws (known as the &quot;Wickersham
Commission&quot;) were later to record, it was particularly the
workers who resented the paternal legislation which they believed
was directed at them and their habits (National Commission on Law
Observance, 1931: 345). </p>

<p>In addition, there were. those whose livelihoods would be
directly affected-indeed, effaced-by the success of the campaign:
brewery workers, bartenders, glass workers, waiters, and
musicians among others.<br>
</p>

<p>Thus, even though the Socialist Party resolved in 1908 that <i>&quot;any
excessive indulgence in intoxicating liquors by members of the
working class is a serious obstacle to the triumph of our cause
since it impairs the vigor of the fighters in political and
economic struggle&quot; </i>(Timberlake, 1963: 98), the
industrial urban centers of the country continued to harbor and
stimulate antagonism towards the temperance movement.<br>
</p>

<p>The identification of the saloon and its offerings with the
urban, immigrant working class further enraged Prohibitionists.
As one sociologist observed, &quot;The saloon appeared as the
symbol of a culture which was alien to the ascetic character of
American values . . .&quot; (Gusfield, 1963: 100). Thus,
Americanism became a central issue in the temperance movement. </p>

<p>One temperance spokesman, cited in Barker's &quot;The Saloon
Problem,&quot; vented these sentiments:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The influx of foreigners into our urban centers, many of
whom have liquor habits [sic], is a menace to good government. .
. . [T] he foreign born population is largely under the social
and political control of the saloon. If the cities keep up their
rapid growth they will soon have the balance of political power
in the nation and become storm centers of political life </i>(Timberlake,
1963: 118).<br>

<p><b>1913-1933: NATIONAL PROHIBITION -- PROLOGUE AND FINISH<br>
</b></p>

<p>The distrust of the immigrant population became more
pronounced as the economic, political, and social power of the
cities developed. It was given a strong impetus by the
anti-German tremors which shook the country in a mood of
anticipation before World War 1. </p>

<p>The United States Brewers Association misread the prevailing
temper and associated itself with the German-American Alliance to
oppose the temperance advocates and defend German kultur in the
United States. </p>

<p>As the United States came closer to war, the antipathy which
developed against the Central Powers was directed with equal
force against brewers and tipplers (Furnas, 1968: 334-35) :<br>
</p>

<p><i>Pro-Germanism is the only froth from the German's beer
saloon. Our German Socialist Party and the German American
Alliance are the spawn of the saloon. . . . Prohibition is the
infallible submarine chaser </i>(Sinclair, 1962:122).<br>
</p>

<p>The war gave the prohibition cause new ammunition. Literature
depicted brewers and licensed retailers as treacherously stabbing
American soldiers in the back. Raw materials and labor were being
diverted from the war effort to an industry which debilitated the
nation's capacity to defend itself. It was urged that wartime
prohibition would stop the waste of grain and molasses and would
remove a handicap on workers' efficiency. </p>

<p>&quot;Liquor is a menace to patriotism because it puts beer
before country,&quot; preached Prohibitionist Wayne Wheeler
(Odegard, 1928: 72). The fact that names Pabst, Schlitz, and
Blatz broadcast their national origin only did further injury to
their interests. </p>

<p>In this atmosphere the Wartime Prohibition Act was passed in
1918. It followed a series of federal laws such as the Wilson
Original Packages Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act, attempts to
protect dry states from their wet neighbors. </p>

<p>The Wilson Original Packages Act was passed on August 8, 1890,
and provided that all intoxicating beverages shipped interstate
would be subject to the laws of the destination state upon
arrival. No mechanism for federal enforcement was provided. </p>

<p>The Webb-Kenyon Act, enacted March 1, 1913, was intended to
reinforce the 1890 Act by providing that it was a violation of
federal law to ship an intoxicating beverage interstate with the
intent that it be used or sold in any manner in violation of the
laws of the destination state. The lack of federal enforcement
rendered the statute virtually meaningless. </p>

<p>The Reed Amendment, enacted four years later, provided a fine
of $1,000 for transporting liquor into a dry state with no
greater effect. </p>

<p>None of the earlier acts met with substantial success in
curbing the flow of liquor into purportedly dry regions, but they
did mark a change in federal policy. Formerly liquor laws were
designed solely to produce federal revenue; Congress now took
cognizance of the role it could play in the regulation of
consumption. </p>

<p>The role was actually forced upon a reluctant Congress at
first. Indeed, the government had passed up numerous prior
opportunities to involve itself in the temperance movement as
such. The particular part it was to play was forecast by the Sons
of Temperance who, in 1856, declared themselves for national
constitutional prohibition. </p>

<p>Twenty years later, Congressman Henry Blair of New Hampshire
introduced a prohibition amendment to the Constitution for the
first time in Congress. As a senator, he introduced another such
resolution in 1885, along with Senator Preston Plum of Kansas.
After consideration by the Senate Committee on Education, the
bill was reported out favorably and placed on the Senate Calendar
in 1886. Nevertheless, no action resulted (Cherrington, 1920: 317
). </p>

<p>In the meantime, states continued the struggle between the
wets and the drys, with great success for the temperance
advocates. By 1913, nine states were under stateside prohibition.
In 31 other states, local option laws were in effect. By reason
of these and other variants of regulatory schemes, more than 50%
of the United States population was then under prohibition. </p>

<p>The national constitutional campaign was resumed as such in
1913 when the Anti-Saloon League went on record at its 15th
National Convention in favor of immediate prosecution of the
objective of constitutional amendment. </p>

<p>The National Temperance Council, founded at the same time,
coordinated the activities of numerous temperance organizations
with the same object. In 1913, the demands of the League were
formally presented to Congress by the Committee of 1,000. </p>

<p>The measure was then introduced in the House by Congressman
Thompson and in the Senate by Senator Sheppard. The following
year, the first joint resolution failed to secure the necessary
two thirds majority for submitting a constitutional amendment to
the states. A second resolution was submitted in 1915 and
favorably considered by the Judiciary Committees of both houses,
but neither ever came to a vote. </p>

<p>Ultimately, in 1917, the resolution to prohibit the
manufacture, sale, transportation or importation of alcoholic
beverages in the United States was approved by Congress and sent
to the states for ratification (Cherrington, 1920: 317-330). </p>

<p>It took only one year and eight days for the 18th Amendment to
secure the necessary ratification. On January 8, 1918,
Mississippi proudly became the first state to ratify, and on
January 16, 1919, Nebraska completed the job as the 36th state
(Lee, 1963: 42). By the end of February 1919, there remained only
three hold-outs: New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island
(Cherrington, 1920: 330). </p>

<p>October 28, 1919, was the day that Congress enacted the
National Prohibition Act-more often known as the Volstead
Act-with the intent to give effect to the new constitutional
amendment. Officially, the liquor drought was to begin on January
17, 1920. The celebrants of the occasion were concentrated in the
membership of the Anti-Saloon League, which could rightly claim
that its consummate skill in pressure politics had maneuvered the
country into its dry state. </p>

<p>The early experience of the Prohibition era gave the
government a taste of what was to come. In the three months
before the 18th Amendment became effective, liquor worth half a
million dollars was stolen from Government warehouses. By
midsummer of 1920, federal courts in Chicago were overwhelmed
with some 600 pending liquor violation trials (Sinclair, 1962:
176-177). Within three years, 30 prohibition agents were killed
in service. </p>

<p>Other statistics demonstrated the increasing volume of the
bootleg trade. In 1921, 95,933 illicit distilleries, stills,
still works and fermentors were seized. in 1925, the total jumped
to 172,537 and up to 282,122 in 1930. In connection with these
seizures, 34,175 persons were arrested in 1921; by 1925, the
number had risen to 62,747 and to a high in 1928 of 75,307
(Internal Revenue, Service, 1921, 1966, 1970: 95, 6, 73).
Concurrently, convictions for liquor offenses in federal courts
rose from 35,000 in 1923 to 61,383 in 1932. </p>

<p>The law could not quell the continuing demand for alcoholic
products. Thus, where legal enterprises could no longer supply
the demand, an illicit traffic developed, from the point of
manufacture to consumption. The institution of the speakeasy
replaced the institution of the saloon. Estimates of the number
of speakeasies throughout the United States ranged from 200,000
to 500,000 (Lee, 1963: 68). </p>

<p>Writers of this period point out that the law was circumvented
by various means. Although there may have been legitimate,
medicinal purposes for whiskey, the practice of obtaining a
medical prescription for the illegal substance was abused. It is
estimated that doctors earned $40 million in 1928 by writing
prescriptions for whiskey. </p>

<p>The legal system was equally evasive; the courts convicted
about seven percent of those charged with liquor violations
(Sinclair, 1962: 193-195; Dobyns, 1940: 292). The exception for
sacramental wine from protection under the Volstead Act also
invited abuse. In 1925, the Department of Research and Education
of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ reported that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The withdrawal of wine on permit from bonded warehouses for
sacramental purposes amounted in round figures to 2,139,000
gallons in the fiscal year 1922; 2,503,500 gallons in 1923; and
2,944,700 gallons in 1924. There is no way of knowing what the
legitimate consumption of fermented sacramental wine is but it is
clear that the legitimate demand does not increase 800,000
gallons in two years </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 297).<br>
</p>

<p>The smuggling trade was revived with new vigor and new
incentives. Rum-runners, often under foreign flags, brought
liquor into the country from Belgium and Holland. In 1923, there
were 134 seizures of such vessels. The following year, 236 were
apprehended (History of the Alcohol . . . 928). With fewer risks,
liquor was readily smuggled across the Canadian border. One way
or the other, the Department of Commerce estimated that, as of
1924, liquor valued at approximately $40 million was entering the
United States annually (Sinclair, 1962: 198).<br>
</p>

<p>The manufacture of &quot;near-beer&quot; and industrial
alcohol provided other opportunities for diversion from licit
channels, while the salvage of the California grape industry was
section 29 of the Volstead Act (27 U.S.C. § 46) which authorized
the home production of fermented fruit juices. Although the
section was allegedly inserted to save the vinegar industry and
the hard cider of America's farmers, it was welcomed by home
winemakers as well. In the spirit of cooperation, the grape
growers even produced a type of grape jelly suggestively called
&quot;Vine-go&quot; which, with the addition of water, could make
a strong wine within two months (Sinclair, 1962: 206). </p>

<p>One of the great ironies of the prohibition era was the fact,
noted by the Wickersham Commission, that women happily took to
drink during the experimental decade, and, what is more, did so
in public. As the counterpart of the WCTU, the Women's
Organization for National Prohibition Reform was founded, stating
in its declaration of principles that Prohibition was &quot;wrong
in principle&quot; and <i>&quot;disastrous in consequences in the
hypocrisy, the corruption, the tragic loss of life and the
appalling increase of crime which has attended the abortive
attempt to enforce it&quot; </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 107). </p>

<p>Drinking at an earlier age was also noted, particularly during
the first few years of Prohibition. The superintendents of eight
state mental hospitals reported a larger percentage of young
patients during Prohibition (1919-1926) than formerly. One of the
hospitals noted: &quot;During the past year (1926), an unusually
large group of patients who are of high school age were admitted
for alcoholic psychosis&quot; (Brown, 1932:176). </p>

<p>In determining the age at which an alcoholic forms his
drinking habit, it was noted: &quot;The 1920-1923 group were
younger than the other groups when the drink habit was
formed&quot; (Pollock, 1942: 113).<br>

<p>To be sure, the Volstead Act was enforced in the United States
wherever it had popular support. In the rural South and West
prohibition was effective and in some cases still is. The
failures of prohibition enforcement were spotlighted in the big
cities where the law was flagrantly defied and in the smaller
towns, populated by miners and industrial workers, where the law
was simply ignored (National Commission on Law Observance, 1931:
345). </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the weak enforcement of the Volstead Act, some
believe that it was only the coming of the Depression with its
demand for increased employment and tax revenues which finally
killed the experiment (Gusfield, 1963: 127). Others observe that
Prohibition was a by-product of the stress and excesses of war
and could not have survived in peacetime even under optimal
economic conditions (Sinclair, 1962: 23-24). Finally, there are
those who accuse the selfishly motivated businessmen of the
United States for repeal which they allegedly brought about
through the same high-pressure tactics so successfully employed
by the partisans of temperance in the preceding decades (Dobyns,
1940: 5-130 passim). </p>

<p>Despite mixed motivations, the repeal movement was financed
and driven by the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment
(AAPA). </p>

<p>The members declared that &quot;the principal business and
objective of the Association shall be to educate its members as
to the fundamental provisions, objects and purposes of the
Constitution of the United States&quot; (Dobyns, 1940: 5). They
worked for the election of Congressmen who agreed to submit the
question of repeal to a vote of the people in each state. They
were successful fund-raisers and by January 1, 1931, had almost
$3 million in cash in the bank (Dobyns, 1940: 9). </p>

<p>The sources of the funds included a number of converts from
the dry cause. In 1928, the DuPont family abandoned the drys,
followed in 1932 by John D. Rockefeller and S. S. Kresge
(Gusfield, 1963: 128). Their conversion was effected under the
strong influence of the income tax. Doggedly, Pierre S. DuPont
circulated a brochure concluding that &quot;the British liquor
policy applied in the United States would permit the total
abolition of the income tax both personal and corporate&quot;
(Dobyns, 1940: 22). </p>

<p>Concern for the effects of the prohibition laws was not
limited to the private, wealthy sector. In 1928, a dry-wet
confrontation emerged in the presidential election between Alfred
E. Smith, a Catholic New Yorker, and Herbert Hoover. Hoover
solemnly praised the &quot;great social and economic
experiment&quot; and tightened his grip on the dry vote.<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the popular image of Smith as a staunch wet,
his platform tried to avoid any outright repeal sentiment. He
asked instead for an amendment of the Volstead Act which would
provide a &quot;scientific definition of the alcoholic content of
an intoxicating beverage.&quot; This would enable each state to
interpret and apply the federal standard within its borders. In
addition, he favored what was to be known as the &quot;state
store&quot; system of manufacturing and dispensing alcoholic
beverages (Lee, 1963: 212).<br>
</p>

<p>In retrospect, it is difficult to ascertain whether it was the
religious campaign or the dry campaign which defeated Al Smith.
H. L. Mencken may have written accurately that &quot;if [Al
Smith] loses, it will be because those who fear the Pope
outnumber those who are tired of the Anti-Saloon League&quot;
('Sinclair, 1962: 303). Nevertheless, Prohibition survived the
1928 election, as did Hoover's campaign pledge to establish a
commission to investigate the conditions under Prohibition. Head
of the Commission was George W. Wickersham, former Attorney
General under Taft. Although the Commission's purpose was set
forth as an examination of the problems of enforcement, it soon
decided to undertake much broader policy considerations. </p>

<p>The Commission's report, published in 1931, included opinion
surveys, statistics on the number of deaths connected with
enforcement efforts, testimony by consultants and experts, and an
analysis of the organization, personnel and methods of
prohibition enforcement. On the basis of the five volume report,
the Wickersham Commission ironically concluded in its summary
that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There have been more sustained pressures to enforce this
law than on the whole has been true of any other federal statute,
although this pressure in the last four or five years has met
with increasing resistance as the sentiment against prohibition
has developed . . . . That a main source of difficulty is in the
attitude of at least a very large number of respectable citizens
in most of our large cities and in several states, is made more
clear when the enforcement of the national prohibition act is
compared with the enforcement of the laws as to narcotics. There
is an enormous margin of profit in breaking the latter. The means
of detecting transportation are more easily evaded than in the
case of liquor. Yet there are no difficulties in the case of
narcotics beyond those involved in the nature of the traffic
because the laws against them are supported everywhere by a
general and determined public sentiment </i>(Sinclair, 1962:
367-368).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this dire analysis, 10 out of the 11
commissioners signed a summary of conclusions of the report which
stated that the Commission as a whole opposed the repeal of the
18th Amendment, the entry of the Federal or state governments
into liquor business, or even the modification of national
prohibition to permit the sale of light wines and beer (Sinclair,
1962: 364). </p>

<p>Walter Lippmann commented, &quot;What was done was to evade a
direct and explicit official confession that Federal prohibition
is a hopeless failure&quot; (Sinclair, 1962: 365). Whether or not
Lippmann correctly read the Commission's intentions, there was
clearly a gap between the input and the outcome of the report. </p>

<p>It is difficult to assess the relative numbers of the wet and
dry partisans during the last few years of national prohibition.
In terms of strength, however, the wets surely had the edge which
less than two decades before had belonged to the drys. The new
wet strength showed up at the National Convention of the
Democratic party held in Chicago in 1932, where Mayor Cermak of
that city filled the galleries with his supporters. And, though
Franklin D. Roosevelt had wooed the dry vote for some time, he
now came forward on a platform which favored the outright repeal
of the 18th Amendment. Accepting his nomination, he stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>I congratulate this convention for having had the courage,
fearlessly to write into its declaration of principles what an
overwhelming majority here assembled really thinks about the 18th
Amendment. This convention wants repeal. Your candidate wants
repeal. And I am confident that the United States of America
wants repeal </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 160).<br>
</p>

<p>While dry leaders looked on with disgust, Roosevelt was
elected president and Congress turned a somersault. The repeal
amendment was introduced February 14, 1933, by Sen. Blaine of
Wisconsin and approved two days later by the Senate 63 to 23. The
House followed four days later, voting 289 to 121 to send the
amendment on to the States (Lee, 1963: 231). It required approval
by 36 states. Michigan was the first state to ratify it; 39
states voted, on the amendment during 1933, with 37 approving its
ratification and two-North and South Carolina-voting against its
ratification. The final ratification was accomplished on November
7,1933, when Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Utah gave their
approval. </p>

<p>Congress officially adopted the 21st Amendment to the
Constitution on December 5, 1933. </p>

<p>Within three weeks of taking office, President Roosevelt
witnessed the first sales of 3.2 beer, following a redefinition
by statute of the terms &quot;intoxicating liquors.&quot; The
more popular, higher alcohol-content beer was relegalized by
Congress under the Cullen-Harrison Act. Sale of beer became legal
on April 7, 1933, in the District of Columbia and the 20 states
where state laws did not prohibit its sale. During the next four
years the remaining states changed their laws to permit its sale,
with Alabama and Kansas in 1937, as the last to join the legal
sale ranks. <br>
</p>

<p>The job of total repeal was accomplished with the help of the
determined AAPA during the succeeding year. Their lawyers
assisted the states in preparing bills for conventions and
release of various forms of political propaganda, thereby
enacting a serious satire on the 1919 campaign launched by the
Anti-Saloon League. Notwithstanding their high and enduring
constitutional principles, on December 31, 1933, with repeal a
reality, the AAPA ceased to exist and sent its files to the
Library of Congress. &quot;Having attained its objective . . .
the Association resisted the temptation to linger on as a
'sentinel of American liberty' '', the New York Times observed in
the organization's obituary (Dobyns, 1940: 132). <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>PROHIBITION IN PERSPECTIVE</b> </p>

<p>During 13 years, what did Prohibition accomplish? There is no
single compilation of Prohibition statistics which would enable
us to determine the degree of success which Prohibition enjoyed
during its lifetime. </p>

<p>In discussing the relative successes and failures of
Prohibition, most observers conclude that the undertaking failed.
&quot;Prohibition destroyed the manufacturing and distributive
agencies through which the demand for liquor had been legally
supplied. But the demand remained&quot; (Hu, 1950: 51). </p>

<p>In its Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of
the United States, the Wickersham Commission concluded that the
country had prohibition in law but not in fact. They reported:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There was general prevalence of drinking in homes, clubs
and hotels.... Throughout the country people of wealth,
businessmen and professional men and their families, and the
higher paid workingmen and their families, are drinking in large
numbers in open flouting of the law. And neither Congress nor the
states set up adequate machinery or appropriated sufficient funds
for the enforcement of the prohibitory legislation. Federal and
state legislation, as a matter of fact, strove to satisfy so
that, as it was aptly said, the drys had their prohibition law
and the wets had their liquor </i>(Hu, 1950: 52).<br>
</p>

<p>Although some view the theory of prohibition as reasonable, it
is generally conceded that the realities of manufacture and
distribution make it unworkable, for in one form or another,
alcohol can be easily produced by farmers, high school chemistry
students, and ordinary citizens. </p>

<p>Prohibition has been attempted many times in various parts of
the world; except for some Moslem areas, attempted legislative
controls have not proven adequate. In spite of many sincere and
determined efforts, no country in Europe or the Americas has yet
succeeded in eliminating the use of alcohol by society by
legislative fiat (H.E.W., 1968: 41). </p>

<p>Those who had been accustomed to using alcoholic beverages
sought other sources of supply &quot;in disregard of the
legislative mandate. In the presence of high pecuniary returns
there [was] a strong tendency for supply to meet demand in spite
of prohibition&quot; (Hu, 1950: 51). </p>

<p><b>Consumption. </b>Although it is impossible to make an
accurate determination of the consumption of alcoholic beverages
under Prohibition-since there are no statistics compiled
regarding the output and sale of the outlaw industry-estimates
have been made by those examining the economic results of
Prohibition as well as by the Bureau of Prohibition of the U.S.
Department of Justice. The Bureau placed the consumption of
alcoholic beverages at 73,831,172 gallons, or 0.6 gallon per
capita in fiscal year 1930 as contrasted with 166,983,681 gallons
or 1.7 gallons per capita in 1914. </p>

<p>In terms of pure alcohol, the Bureau concluded that per capita
consumption in 1930 was 35% of the 1914 rate of legal
consumption. These estimates have been criticized as being far
too low (Tillitt, 1932: 35). </p>

<p>The figures published by the Department of Commerce in the
Statistical Abstract of the United States reflect a different
picture. The average annual per capita consumption of hard liquor
from 1910-1914, inclusive, was 1.46 proof gallons. &quot;This
5-year period was before the rise of abnormal conditions
coincident to the World War and may be taken as fairly indicative
of the normal rate of drinking that - prevailed in the
Pre-Prohibition 'era&quot; (Rosenbloom, 1935: 51). </p>

<p>The per capita rate for the Prohibition years is computed to
be 1.63 proof gallons. This is 11.64% higher than the
Pre-Prohibition rate (Tillitt, 1932: 35). Based on these figures
one observer concluded: &quot;And so the drinking which was, in
theory, to have been decreased to the vanishing point by
Prohibition has, in fact, increased&quot; (Tillitt, 1932: 36). </p>

<p>Others disagree with the implications of these unverified
statistics noting that persons of limited means, formerly unable
to patronize the expensive speakeasies, once again had cheap
access to alcohol following repeal and thereby increased
consumption (Harrison &amp; Laine, 1936: 1). </p>

<p>Popular opinion is equally inconclusive; a survey conducted by
the American Institute of Public Opinion in 1936 asked whether
conditions (drinking customs, consumption, etc.) were better
worse or without significant change since Repeal 36% indicated a
worsening and 31% could see no appreciable change (Harrison &amp;
Laine, 1936: 2). Perhaps indicative of a gradual process of
adjustment, however, the results of later Gallup polls suggest a
gradual decline in the use of alcohol. Of a national sample, 67%
indicated they used alcohol in 1945, in contrast to 60% in 1950
and 55% in 1958 (Gusfield, 1963: 135).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Alcoholic Psychoses.</b> There was a notable decrease in
alcoholic psychoses and in deaths due to alcoholism immediately
preceding the enactment of Prohibition and a gradual increase in
alcoholic psychosis and in deaths from alcoholism in the general
population since 1920. </p>

<p><i>&quot;These facts appear to indicate that since 1920,
Prohibition [was] increasingly impotent as a means of preventing
excessive use of alcohol to an extent productive of serious
mental disorders and untimely death. 1920 marks the end of the
decline and the beginning of the rise in the trends of alcoholic
mental diseases and of deaths from alcoholism in the general
population&quot;</i> (Brown, 1932: 88). </p>

<p>The increase in mental disorders and deaths from alcoholism
after 1920, however, also coincides with the heavy consumption
period-early 1900's-which would have resulted in an increase in
alcoholism some years later. </p>

<p>The following table reflects the decrease prior to 1920 and
the subsequent gradual increase in percentage of alcoholic
psychosis among new admissions to 56 hospitals in 25 states as
well as among admissions to New York civil state hospitals
(Brown, 1932: 76-77; Malzburg, 1949: 294) :<br>

<p><b>Deaths from Alcoholism.</b> In New York City, from 1900
through 1909, there was an average of 526 deaths annually
attributable to alcoholism. From 1910 through 1917, the average
number was 619. It plummeted to 183 for the years 1918 through
1922. Thereafter, the figure rose, averaging a new high of 639
for the years 1923 through 1927 (Rice, ed., 1930: 122). </p>

<p>Total deaths from alcoholism in the United States show a
comparable trend, with the gradual increase resuming somewhat
earlier, about 1922 (Brown, 1932: 61, 77; Feldman, 1927: 397;
U.S. Department of Commerce, 1924: 55). </p>

<p>The highest death rates from alcoholism occurred during the
decade prior to Prohibition as did the highest death rates from
cirrhosis of the liver. These statistics should be qualified by
the observations of Dr. Charles Morris, Chief Medical Examiner
for New York City: <i>&quot;In making out death certificates
(which are basic to Census Reports) private or family physicians
commonly avoid entry of alcoholism as a cause of death whenever
possible. This practice was more prevalent under the National Dry
Law than it was in preprohibition time&quot;</i> (Tillitt, 1932:
114-115). </p>

<p>Even if reliable, per se, such statistics may be unrelated to
the consumption of alcoholic beverages in any given year. Another
writer of this period noted: &quot;The relation of fatal
alcoholic diseases to consumption of alcohol must be one
extending over a long period of years and the actual duration of
the critical period can hardly be estimated&quot; (Jellinek,
1942: 48-1). According to one sociologist, rates of alcoholism
and related mental and physical diseases reflect past drinking
habits, developed ten to 15 years earlier (Gusfield, 1963: 119).<br>
</p>

<p>A shorter &quot;lead time&quot; is suggested by a mental
hygiene statistician who attributes the temporary reduction in
alcoholic psychoses &quot;to the legal restriction of the sale
and use of alcoholic beverages, made effective by the support of
public opinion which during the war period had discountenanced
self-indulgence, of all sorts&quot; (Brown, 1932: 88). He adds,
however, that the notable increase in alcoholic psychoses and
deaths from alcoholism towards the end of the prohibition era
(1927-1932) indicated that: </p>

<p><i>... since 1920, prohibition has become increasingly
impotent as a means of preventing excessive use of alcohol to an
extent productive of serious mental disorders and untimely deaths
</i>(Brown, 1932: 88). </p>

<p>The highly limited statistical label of death from alcoholism
has been noted elsewhere:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The trend of death from alcoholism reflects hardly anything
else than progress in the treatment of the so-called diseases of
chronic alcoholism. Nevertheless, statistics of death from
alcoholism have been used by both Drys and Wets to prove that
Prohibition or repeal has greatly improved the rate of death from
alcoholism. . . . Death from alcoholism is simply not an index of
the prevalence of inebriety. Death from alcoholism could fall to
zero in response to medical progress, while at the same time the
rate of inebriety might rise many fold </i>(Jellinek, 1947: 39).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Arrests</b> Arrests for drunkenness also provide a source
of information about the extent of drinking in the United States.
It must be noted, however, that statistics of this sort vary with
local police policies. For example, during a six-year period in
the 1930's, the arrests for drunkenness were from 14 to 31 times
higher in Philadelphia than in New York (Kolb, 1941: 608). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, gross statistics drawn from 383 cities indicate
that arrests for drunkenness per 10,000 population reached a high
of 192 in 1916 and fell to 71 in 1920. From this level, they rose
steadily again to reach 157 in 1928 (Warburton, 1932: 102). Of
course, arrests prior to Prohibition may not bear the same
relation to the use of alcohol as they did subsequently,
Warburton theorizes: <br>
</p>

<p><i>. . . [U]nder Prohibition, especially during the early
years, police were more strict in making arrests, and . . . a
larger proportion than formerly of persons appearing on the
streets under the influence of liquor are arrested. Also, since
the sale of liquor is illegal and cannot be obtained in public
saloons, and when the police are more strict in arresting
intoxicated persons, it is reasonable to suppose that drinking is
less public and that fewer drunken persons appear on the streets
relative to the quantity of liquor consumed </i>(Warburton, 1932:
103).<br>
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the cyclical trend suggested by these figures
coincides with statistics on alcoholism (Brown, 1932: 61, 71,
77). Whatever their independent validity, however, they correlate
earth the theory of one author that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>[T] he l8th Amendment could not have been passed without
the support of the psychologically tolerant, made temporarily
intolerant by the stress of war. But when the moderates deserted
the drys in the time of peace, the hard core of the movement was
revealed</i> (Sinclair, 1962: 23--24).<br>
</p>

<p>Without the support of the moderates, the author theorizes,
Prohibition was to become itself a symbol of excess, unsupported
by the vast majority of the population. </p>

<p>Outcome. What, then, did Prohibition accomplish? To a great
extent it eliminated the saloon from American life. While bars
and taverns reopened joyfully following repeal, they ceased to be
the centers of systematic political corruption and debauchery
which they had once been. Part of this may be attributable to the
greater sophistication of the electorate and politics generally.
Part, no doubt, is owing to the fact that women were welcome as
customers in the new cocktail lounges, having shown themselves to
be eager patrons of the speakeasies. </p>

<p>And finally, the change in the character of the saloon was
effected by public determination that it should be changed. This
attitude was expressed in the post-repeal statutes concerned with
the physical appearance of the saloon and the character of
persons authorized to operate them. </p>

<p>Prohibition did make the nation conscious that corruption of
the law and of the populace may be the consequence of a law which
is not reflective of the morals and mores of the time. It played
out some of the deepest social class resentments, culminating in
the realization that the behavioral standards of some could not
be impressed -upon others. It demonstrated that the fervor of war
and the cult of patriotism may be abused-and abuse the country in
return. </p>

<p>Repeal reimposed the burden of regulation upon the states.
They were required to develop a system of control directed at the
particular objectives they wished to achieve. The post-repeal era
was to prove an exercise not only in states' rights but in
states' responsibilities. <br>
</p>

<p><b>1933-1971: AFTER THE DELUGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>On December 4, 1933, the day before final ratification of the
repeal amendment, the President established the Federal Alcohol
Control Administration, pursuant to Executive Order No. 6474.
FACA was to have the power to grant or revoke permits to engage
in the alcoholic beverage industry-not the brewing industry-as
well as the power to control plant capacity and production; it
was also to engage in consumer protection through regulations
designed to prevent misbranding and false advertising of
alcoholic beverages. In addition, FACA prohibited the ownership
of retail outlets by manufacturers and wholesalers (Harrison
&amp; Laine, 1936: 24-29). </p>

<p>This scheme fell under the Schecter Poultry decision by the
Supreme Court. The Treasury, Federal Trade, Commission and Food
and Drug Administration then moved in. A new alcohol control
agency was proposed, leading to a dispute as to whether it should
be independent or part of the Treasury.<br>
</p>

<p>Joseph H. Choate, Jr., first head of the FACA, testified that:
</p>

<p><i>The Treasury has not been an organization whose duty it was
to study and understand the liquor business, the interest of the
public in that business, or the method by which that business
ought to be carried on in order to subserve the interests of both
the public and state governments. It has been a creature of one
idea, that one idea being, quite properly, to get revenue and get
it as fast and as copiously as it could </i>(Harrison &amp;
Laine, 1936: 33).<br>
</p>

<p>The Department of the Treasury agreed with Choate's analysis. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, this testimony was disregarded and the Federal
Alcohol Administration was created as a division of Treasury in
1935. This arrangement was superseded in 1936 when the Liquor Tax
Administration Act established FACA as an independent agency of
the government. Soon thereafter it was reorganized, once again as
an arm of the Department of Treasury, and even its separate
identity was abolished as of June 30, 1940. Today, the Treasury
retains full authority to administer all federal liquor laws. </p>

<p>The current federal laws regulating trade in intoxicating
beverages may be classified in the following categories: </p>

<p>(1) Revenue: Taxes are imposed on rectifiers, brewers,
manufacturers of stills, dealers; wholesale and retail stamps are
required on distilled spirits (26 USC, 1971a). </p>

<p>(2) Criminal Penalties: Criminal penalties are provided for
unauthorized production, sale or possession, transportation into
states prohibiting sale, C.O.D. shipments and unlabeled shipments
(26 USC, 1971b; 18 USC, 1971). </p>

<p>(3) Interstate Transportation: Interstate shipments of
alcoholic beverages are subject to the laws of the receiving
state (27 USC, 1971a). </p>

<p>(4) Permits: Importers, manufacturers and sellers of
intoxicating beverages must have permits (27 USC, 1971b). </p>

<p>(5) Unfair Practices: Exclusive sales arrangements, tying,
bribery and false advertising or labeling are prohibited (27 USC,
1971b). </p>

<p>The intent of the Federal Government to reserve all decisions
regarding regulation of consumption is quite clear from federal
statutes presently in force. The states have reacted with a
variety of regulatory schemes controlling to varying degrees the
seller, the buyer, the place, time and opportunity for sale and,
through revenue measures, the cost. </p>

<p>In 18 states, the state store or state monopoly system has
entirely displaced the private wholesale or retail sale of
intoxicating beverages. Other states permit the sale of liquor,
wine and beer through private, licensed outlets. </p>

<p>The license system may be implemented by different, means.
Administration may be solely by the state, or control may be
shared by the counties or municipalities. </p>

<p>Local control may be exercised to a greater or lesser degree.
For example, in the 1930's, immediately after repeal,
Massachusetts and New Mexico permitted local boards to grant
retail licenses only after investigation and approval of
applicants by the state board. During the same period, other
states, predominantly in the South, gave local authorities
supplemental powers to issue licenses while requiring concurrent
state licenses as well.<br>
</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions, the local license had to be obtained
first, and the state license could be granted thereafter. In
Illinois, however, the state commission's power was curtailed by
requiring that a state license be granted once the local license
was secured. And although the state was given the power to revoke
its license, it was given no power to inspect places of sale to
determine grounds for revocation (Harrison &amp; Laine, 1936:
50-53). </p>

<p>The license system has been suspect by many wets as well as
drys because of the opportunities it may afford for political
abuse. On the other hand, there is substantial opinion which
holds direct participation in the sale of liquor in contempt. As
to the relative efficacy of each, there are no reliable means of
making a judgment. Each apparently depends on the integrity and
capacity of the individuals charged with the job of enforcement
and oversight. </p>

<p>Superimposed on the basic system of regulating the sale of
liquor are other sumptuary laws which are directed at the
purchaser. Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated
persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales as well.
Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence
of alcohol as well as for drunken behavior.<br>
</p>

<p>The sale of liquor by the drink is permitted in most states,
but some still require that it be sold in packaged form only,
reflecting the continuing fear of the resurrection of the saloon.
In many states Sunday closing laws are enforced, and mandatory
closing times are imposed upon bars and package stores alike.
Sales are prohibited almost uniformly on Election Day, at least
during polling hours, and, in many places, on Thanksgiving,
Memorial Day, Christmas and other holidays. </p>

<p>Local option is still granted in most states, in voting units
ranging from the plantation to the city or county. Of the
monopoly or control states, only Utah and Wyoming fail to make
provision for local option at all. Wyoming maintains a state
monopoly at the wholesale level only. Private retailer sellers
are licensed. </p>

<p>In the remaining monopoly states, it is often possible for
towns within a wet county to go dry, and sometimes vice versa. Of
the 33 license states, only 10 (including the District of
Columbia) do not permit local option at any level. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the various patterns of regulation, Senator
Arthur Capper's words of the 1930's still seem to be correct: </p>

<p><i>We can repeal prohibition, but we cannot repeal the liquor
problem</i> (Peterson, 1969: 126).<br>
</p>

<p>Neither the states nor the population have yet come to grips
with the problems of alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Both the
monopoly system and the license system are directed at other
concerns. They, no more than Prohibition, have been able to
control or even alleviate the very real and dire consequences of
alcohol use by society.<br>

<h2>History of Tobacco Regulation* </h2>

<p><b>*This section is based in part on a paper prepared for the
Commission by Jane Lang McGrew, an attorney from Washington, D.C.
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>Since 1613, when John Rolfe introduced a successful experiment
in tobacco cultivation in Virginia (Morison, 1965 : 52) the leaf
has assumed major social, industrial, economic and medical
implications. Consequently, persons concerned with tobacco on a
commercial or personal basis have been subject to a variety of
different regulations over the past 360 years.<br>
</p>

<p>Tobacco has been attacked by social observers and medical
authorities for the damage it has allegedly done, to the social
and physical condition of man. Yet it has also provided a
substantial source of revenue to the state and Federal
governments of the United States. </p>

<p>As is now the case with alcohol, tobacco has long been subject
to regulatory controls over the quantity and quality of
production. On the other hand, sumptuary laws affecting tobacco
have been far fewer-and weaker-than those aimed at alcohol. In
fact, there has never been a time when tobacco was prohibited
throughout the United States although consumption under certain
circumstances has been forbidden at various times in different
jurisdictions. </p>

<p>Tobacco-associated today with smoking of cigarettes, and to a
lesser extent, of pipes and cigars-has been popular at times for
both snuffing and chewing. Indeed, until about 1870 cigarettes
were relatively rare in the United States, and almost all tobacco
consumed domestically was chewed during the mid-19th century
(Gottsegen, 1940: 9-10). </p>

<p>What ever the preferred mode of consumption, however, the,
commodity has always been the subject of debate respecting the
appropriate governmental attitude. On the one hand, proponents of
the leaf stress its social benefits and its economic and
industrial significance. Some enthusiasts even endorse its
alleged medical and psychological benefits. Opposed are those who
cite the health hazards of smoking and others who are convinced
of its immorality.<br>
</p>

<p>The motivation for regulation has come from both sides of the
controversy. Most sumptuary restrictions were fostered by the
latter group in an effort to suppress the habit. Those who seek
to institutionalize and foster use of the drug focus on the
regulation of the quantity and quality of production.<br>
</p>

<p>This section does not attempt to weigh the merits of the
various regulatory schemes. Rather, it will trace from John
Rolfe's day the three threads of regulation which have
circumscribed both the producer and consumer of tobacco in the
United States.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>REGULATION OF PRODUCTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>In the opinion of King James I of England, tobacco was
&quot;loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the
brain&quot; and &quot;dangerous to the lungs&quot; (Middleton,
1953: 93). Whether the King was prescient, or simply sensitive,
was irrelevant in the 17th and 18th centuries, however, for
tobacco rapidly became the mainstay of the Maryland and Virginia
economics. Within seven years of John Rolfe's first imaginative
experiment,, Virginia exported nothing but tobacco and a little
sassafrass to England (Middleton, 1953: 93-94). Almost as
quickly, the leaf became the staple of the colony of Maryland and
competition developed in Carolina as well.<br>
</p>

<p>In Massachusetts Bay, the product fared less well. The first
general letter (April 17,1629) from an official of the New
England Company to the Massachusetts Bay settlers prohibited the
planting of tobacco except in small quantities for medicinal
purposes (Werner, 1922: 100). Next door in Connecticut, however,
the colonists attempted to rival the southern planters with a
local leaf. Indeed, the infant industry was coddled by the
protectionist General Court at New Haven, which promulgated a
rule in 1641 that: </p>

<p><i>No persons within this jurisdiction shall [smoke] any other
Tobacco but such as is or shall be planted within these
[districts], except they have license from the Courte </i>(Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut, undated: 20).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the royal attitude and the fear of certain
patent holders of the London Company that Virginia had become a
&quot;colony founded on smoke&quot; (Tobacco Institute,,
Virginia, 1971 : 19; Middleton, 1953: 94), England encouraged the
growth of the tobacco industry. Monopolies to import tobacco from
the colonies were granted by the Crown to court favorites who
soon prospered as a result of this trade. </p>

<p>In 1621, a bill was introduced which, according to one
contemporary commentator, was &quot;extremely remarkable&quot;:
No tobacco was to be imported after the 1st of October, 1621,
except from Virginia and Bermuda; and, after that day, none was
to be planted in England. Although the act was initially defeated
by the House of Lords, James I in 1922 himself granted the import
monopoly to the Virginia and Bermuda, companies and prohibited
the domestic cultivation of tobacco (Brooks, 1952: 88). </p>

<p>The system worked well for the British importers, but the
methods of financing they employed became onerous to the colonial
planters. The tobacco was marketed by consignment to an English
merchant who deposited the proceeds of the sale to the planters'
accounts. Often, however, the high commissions charged and the
cost, of goods ordered by the Virginians in payment for their
crop contributed to the growth of colonial indebtedness. The
extension of credit to cover the deficiencies caused the debts to
grow constantly, but the only alternative to the consignment
system was to sell the product in the colony at a lower price
(Middleton, 1953: 104-107). </p>

<p>Industrial competition in this market provided the impulse for
certain regulatory relief. Importation of the Carolinian product
into Virginia was forbidden by an act of 1679, amended in 1726 to
prohibit importation by land as well as by sea. Nor was North
Carolina permitted to export its tobacco from Virginia ports. In
Great Britain, the Privy Council looked with disfavor upon such
colonial legislation which threatened the financial well-being of
the merchants and so disallowed the Virginia Act in 1731
(Middleton, 1953: 114-115). </p>

<p>Competition similarly induced both Virginia and Maryland to
enact laws prescribing the dimensions of the hogshead in which
tobacco was packaged in 1658. Vying for purchasers, the two
colonies gradually enlarged the statutory size of the hogshead
until, under edict from the Privy Council in Britain, Maryland
was ordered to pass a gauge act establishing the size of the
hogshead in the same dimensions as those fixed in Virginia. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding such legislation, however, the manufacture of
hogsheads was still characterized by carelessness and
irregularity until the warehouse inspection system went into
effect in the 18th century (Middleton, 1953: 116-117). </p>

<p>It was not long before the colonial planters were faced with a
more serious problem-overproduction-which was causing a decline
in prices as well as quality of the leaf. In 1619, the first
tobacco inspection law was passed by the Virginia House of
Burgesses, ordering the lowest grade of tobacco to be destroyed
and prohibiting &quot;second growth&quot; tobacco and the
marketing of trash leaves. </p>

<p>This act was followed in 1621 by a more direct attempt to
restrict production. Each cultivator was required to limit his
growth to 1000 plants of nine leaves each. Although this order
was soon rescinded as a patent failure, an act of 1629 permitted
each planter to tend only 3000 plants with an additional
allowance of 1000 for non-laboring 'women and each child (Brooks,
1952: 96).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the statutory effort, the problem intensified.
Virginia attempted to encourage the other tobacco colonies to
reach agreements restricting plantings, but in Maryland, Lord
Baltimore resisted. If planters were poor, he asserted: </p>

<p><i>It is not from the low price of Tobacco, but from their
owne sloth, ill husbandry and profusely spending their croppe in
Brandewine, and other liquors </i>(Robert, 1949: 11).<br>
</p>

<p>Carolina, Maryland and Virginia actually reached a decision to
prohibit the planting of the staple from. February 1667 to
February 1668. This &quot;stint&quot; proved a less effective
means of control than the winds of 1667, which almost destroyed
the, crop ready for harvest that year (Tobacco Institute,
Virginia, 1971: 19). </p>

<p>Acts of God failed to provide an ultimate solution, however,
and severe economic dislocation in Maryland and Virginia
intensified. By 1681, the Virginia governor, Lord Culpeper,
complained:<br>
</p>

<p><i>... [T]hat which is more to us than all other things put
together, and will be the speedy and certain ruin of the colony,
is the low price of tobacco. The thing is so fatal and desperate
that there is no remedy; the market is overstocked and every crop
overstocks it more. It is commonly said that there is tobacco
enough now in London to last all England for five years.... Our
thriving is our undoing, and our purchase of negroes, by
increasing the supply of tobacco, has greatly contributed thereto</i>
(Brooks, 1952: 112-113).<br>
</p>

<p>The failure of the Virginia Assembly to pass another act
requiring a &quot;stint&quot;' led the so-called &quot;cutters
and pluckers&quot; to take the matter into their own hands in
1682 by burning both their own crops and the plants of their
neighbors (Roberts, 1949: 11). The riot stimulated legislative
action in 1684 of a less helpful sort: the destruction of tobacco
was made a criminal offense,, subject to the death penalty
(Brooks, 1952: 12). </p>

<p>Seventeenth century quality control laws proved no more
successful in the effort to relieve the depression of the
industry. Renewed efforts were made in early years of the next
century, however. </p>

<p>In 1713, the Virginia House of Burgesses established a
warehouse system to enforce tobacco inspection. Forty public
warehouses were created. Strong opposition to the system led the
Privy Council to disallow the act In 1717, but the ensuing
depression of the 1720's was convincing evidence of the need for
relief. Accordingly, the system was reinstated with British
approval in 1730, cornplete with public warehouses and official
inspectors (Middleton, 1953: 120-121). </p>

<p>The apparent success of the system appealed to Maryland,
suffering also from a surfeit of tobacco. &quot;Tobacco, our
money, is worth nothing wrote one Marylander in 1724, &quot;'and
[there is] not a Shirt to be had for Tobacco this year in all our
country&quot; (Tobacco Institute, Maryland, 1971: 21). </p>

<p>Tobacco riots ensued when the Mary] and Assembly initially
refused to follow Virginia's example. One individual was moved to
inform Lord Baltimore that no improvement in the economic state
of the colony was possible until inspection laws were passed that
&quot;will prevent the sending to Market Such trash as is unfit
for any other use but Manure&quot; (Tobacco Institute,,,
Maryland, 1971: 23). Accordingly, Maryland followed Virginia in
the creation of an inspection system in 1747,and Carolina did
likewise in 1754 (Brooks, 1952: 165). </p>

<p>Tobacco entirely dominated the economic and social structure
of Virginia and Maryland. &quot;Tobacco requires us to abhor
communities or townships,&quot; wrote a 17th century governor of
Maryland, &quot;since a planter cannot carry on his affairs
without considerable elbow room within his plantation&quot;
(Brooks, 1952: 98). </p>

<p>In Virginia, tobacco had gained such ascendancy that it was
used as money. For example, when, in 1621, a cargo of twelve
young women made its way to the colony, each one was valued at
120 pounds of the best leaf (Brooks, 1952: 93). By law,
Virginia's ministers were paid in tobacco at 16,000 pounds
annually in 1696. The law provided that: </p>

<p><i>A competent and sufficient provision for the clergy will be
the only means to supply this dominion with able and faithful
Ministers whereby the glory of God may be advanced,the church
propagated, and the people edified </i>(Werner, 1922: 102).<br>
</p>

<p>Not until the Option Act was passed by the Virginia Assembly
in 1755 could the clergy's fees be paid in either money or
tobacco (Brooks, 1952: 167). </p>

<p>The regulation of tobacco in the colonies was devised in
response to the industry with the intent to further the
prosperity of the planters who dominated the economy. This theme
continued to pervade all related regulatory efforts in the
tobacco-producing states thereafter, as new practices developed
in the marketing of the leaf. </p>

<p>The initial hogshead inspection system gradually gave way to
the sale of loose-leaf tobacco by auction. In 1849 the Virginia
Code recognized these methods in lieu of the sale of hogsheads of
the leaf as provided in the 1730 Act. By 1865, the tobacco
auction had completely replaced the earlier marketing techniques
in Virginia (Tobacco Institute, Virginia, 1971: 28-29). </p>

<p>More than a half century later Maryland followed suit. In
1939, the loose-leaf auction warehouse system was introduced to
replace the hogshead system, and the conversion occurred almost
overnight. The practices engaged in are regulated by the Maryland
State Tobacco Authority, established in 1947 by law. The
Authority itself is supervised by eight representatives selected
by the Governor from the producing counties, the University of
Maryland, the buyers and the sellers (Tobacco Institute,
Maryland, 1971: 9-10). </p>

<p>The Federal Government came to recognize the significance of
the tobacco industry in response to state pressures. Accordingly,
since 1930, several bills have been enacted to aid the growers. </p>

<p>Enacted in 1935, the Tobacco Inspection Act directs the
Secretary of Agriculture to establish quality standards and to
designate auction markets (7 U.S.C. 511 (b) and (d)). The
following year, the Tobacco Control Act was passed, bestowing
Congressional approval upon state compacts which regulate the
production of tobacco, and subsidizing the expenses of the state
commissions involved (7 U.S.C. 515). Thus, the two elements of
initial colonial regulation were preserved: the encouragement of
quality and the discouragement of quantity. </p>

<p>The latter objective was further implemented by the
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. Since that time, parity
payments have been made to tobacco producers: </p>

<p><i>In amounts which, together with the proceeds thereof, will
provide a return to such producers which is as nearly equal to
parity price as the funds so made available will permit </i>(7
U.S.C. 1303). <br>
</p>

<p>In addition, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to set
national marketing quotas respecting each kind of tobacco (7
U.S.C. 1312), to apportion the quotas among the states, and to
allot the portions among the farms (7 U.S.C. 1314). Penalties are
imposed for overproduction (7 U.S.C. 1314). </p>

<p>There is nothing subtle about these measures, of course. Their
intent is obvious: to assure the economic stability of an
industry which, as of 1960, provided the United States population
with more than 150,000,000 pounds of manufactured tobacco for
consumption annually (Heimann, 1960: 93), and which provided more
than $4.8 billion in taxes in 1971 (USDA, Tobacco Situation,
1971b: 44). </p>

<p>During the same year, growers' gross receipts reached about
$900 million (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 2), while cigarette
sales alone grossed for the manufacturer and seller approximately
$5 billion (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 53). The commercial
motivation is sound enough if considered abstractly. When
combined with the revenue incentive, however, it has largely
obscured sumptuary controls.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>REGULATION FOR REVENUE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton's tax package of 1794 proposed the first
federal excise taxes upon tobacco products. To the distress of
Philadelphia snuff manufacturers (Brooks, 1952: 146), however,
the tax was restricted after serious Congressional debate to
their product only. </p>

<p>James Madison led the opposition to a general tobacco tax; his
views were summarized in the Annals of Congress on May 2, 1794: </p>

<p><i>As to the subject before the House, it was proper to choose
taxes the least unequal. Tobacco excise was a burden the most
unequal. It fell upon the poor, upon the sailors, day-laborers,
and other people of these classes, while the rich will often
escape it</i> (Robert, 1949: 100). </p>

<p>The legislative decision was probably tempered as well by
considerations of the enforceability of the measure: snuff had to
be manufactured, while quid and pipe tobacco were often homegrown
leaf at the time (Heimann, 1960: 155). In any case, the snuff
bill was ultimately enacted, modified, suspended and repealed,
with small, if any, effect upon federal revenues. </p>

<p>The opportunity to distill tax money from tobacco was seized
upon more vigorously at the time of the Civil War. On July 1,
1862, an ad valorem tax was imposed upon cigars for the first
time. This tax was raised two years later when a separate tax
upon cigarettes was also imposed (Werner, 1922: 358). (Even the
Confederacy sought to levy a tax-in-kind upon tobacco crops, but
was precluded from doing so by the inspection system which
required the inspector to deliver the full amount of tobacco
specified in the warehouse receipt (Robert, 1949: 117).) </p>

<p>Thereafter, the taxes were raised in 1865, 1866 and 1875. A
temporary reduction followed, until the Spanish-American War
necessitated further increases. Concurrently, taxes were levied
upon smoking and manufactured tobacco and snuff, lest the burden
fall unequally upon smokers (Werner, 1922: 559). </p>

<p>By 1880, the tobacco taxes bad largely stabilized. At that
time, they accounted for 31% of total federal tax receipts, or
$38.9 million. Of this, 50% of the collections was derived from
smoking and chewing tobacco, 40% from cigars and cheroots, and
less than 2% from cigarettes (Heimann, 1960: 156). </p>

<p>Since that time, federal tax collections on tobacco products
have risen almost annually. Between 1910 and 1920, they increased
more than 500%, the greatest increase in any single decade. By
1970, they accounted for almost $2.1 billion, down slightly from
the two preceding years (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5). </p>

<p>Indicative of changing patterns of consumption, the taxes on
cigarettes, as a percentage of the total federal tobacco revenue
jumped from 13.6% in 1910 to 51.1% in 1920. By 1970, the
percentage at 97.2% far outdistanced those revenues derived from
other forms of the product (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5). </p>

<p>Excise taxes have proved profitable and easy to collect. The
revenue schemes are simple on both the federal (26 U.S.C. 5701 et
seq.) and state levels. In the past, no justification for them
has been deemed necessary since Madison's protest. No elaborate
licensing or state monopoly system, such as those designed to
control commerce in alcohol, has ever been imposed.<br>
</p>

<p>In 1921, Iowa became the first state to cash in on the crop
directly by taxing cigarettes. By 1930, 11 other states had
adopted the revenue measure (Robert, 1949: 256). </p>

<p>In 1950, 40 states and the District of Columbia taxed
cigarettes. The rates ranged from one cent to five cents for a
pack of 20 except in Louisiana which levied an eight cent tax on
cigarettes. In 1958, Montana imposed an equivalent rate. </p>

<p>Between 1950 and 1962, 43 of the 47 taxing states raised their
rates at least once. The frequent increase in cigarette taxes
narrowed the gap between the rates in low tax states and higher
tax states. In the 12-year period, the median tax rate rose from
three cents to six cents per pack (Federal Trade Commission,
1970: 3) ; the maximum rate remained at eight cents in Texas,
Louisiana, Montana and New Mexico, in contrast to the two cent
rate in the District of Columbia and Kentucky. </p>

<p>The four leading states in terms of both production and
relative dependence on the crop have been North Carolina, South
Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia, the latter two being the only
states in the history of cigarette taxation to decrease their
taxes; the reduction was only .5 cent (from three cents to two
and a half cents) in 1960 and 1961, respectively.<br>
</p>

<p>By 1966, Oregon became the 49th state to impose a tax on
cigarettes; the rate was four cents per pack. Finally, in 1969
North Carolina imposed a cigarette tax-two cents. </p>

<p>The cigarette excise taxes continued to increase during the
sixties. By 1970, the taxes ranged from North Carolina's two
cents to Pennsylvania's 18 cents for a weighted average of 10.7
cents. Twenty nine states levied taxes of 10 cents or more per
pack (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 40). Local governments
superimposed further excise taxes on the state taxes, ranging
from one cent to 10 cents per package (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970:
iv). </p>

<p>By mid-1971, the range had widened further Connecticut at 21
cents and North Carolina at two cents, the weighted average state
tax being 11.1 cents (USDA, Tobacco Situation , 1971a: 7).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOBACCO REVENUES<br>
</b></p>

<p>A peculiar relationship exists between production and revenue.
In 1970, cash receipts from tobacco brought in $11 million for
Pennsylvania; tobacco farmers and cigarette taxes amassed $194.6
million for the state. By comparison growers in North Carolina
collected $576 million while the state collected only $13.4
million in cigarette revenues (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b:
43). </p>

<p>The federal excise tax on a package of cigarettes is currently
eight cents and has remained so since 1951. The combined state
and federal tax was highest in Pennsylvania; 26 cents for 20
cigarettes, which was 58.2% of the retail price. Connecticut's 24
cents and Texas's 23.5 cents were close behind; the average for
the United States was 46.8%. </p>

<p>To the Federal and state governments today, tobacco is a
financial asset. The total federal and state revenue collected f
rom all tobacco products in 1971 amounted to over $4.7 billion.
Local governments excised the product further bringing the sum
total to $4.8 million (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 44). </p>

<p>From the years 1890 to 1930 cigarette tax collections from
tobacco soared from approximately $1 million to over $339
million. By 1950, they exceeded $1.2 billion. </p>

<p>Totals for the years 1890 to 1970 are recorded in the

<p><b>REGULATION OF CONSUMPTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>Even as far back as the 16th century, smoking was considered
to have medicinal value. Juan de Cardenas, a Spanish physician
who lived in Mexico in the late 1500's, wrote that &quot;Soldiers
subject to privations, kept off cold, hunger, thirst by smoking
and all the inhabitants of the hot countries of the Indies
alleviate their discomforts by the smoke of this blessed and
medicinal weed&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 63-64). </p>

<p>During, the recurrent epidemics of plague in the 17th century,
it was widely believed that smokers were spared; it has been
reported that men who attended the sick and accompanied the dead
kept their pipes lit (Wagner, 1971: 63-64). </p>

<p>In 1614, one Scottish doctor praised the tobacco plant which: </p>

<p><i>Prepareth the stomach for meat; it maketh a clear voice: it
maketh a sweet breath . . . in a few words it is the princess of
physical plants</i> (Gottsegen, 1940: 87).<br>
</p>

<p>King James disagreed strenuously, and in 1604 ordered a
substantial increase in the import duty on the leaf. Smoking, he
wrote in &quot;A Counterblaste to Tobacco&quot;, is: </p>

<p><i>A custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful
to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking
fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible Stygian smoke of
the pit that is bottomless</i> (Brooks, 1952:56, 71). </p>

<p>Another more passionate moralist wrote: </p>

<p>.<i> . . imagine thou beheldest here a firme-sucker's wife
most fearfully fuming forth very fountains of blood, howling for
anguish of heart, weeping, wailing, and wringing her hands
together . . . while she _pitifully pleads with her husband thus:
Oh husband, my husband . . . ! Why dost thou so vainly prefer a
vanishing filthy fume before my permanent virtues? </i>(Brooks,
1952: 72). <br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such alliterative literature, the habit of
smoking increased in popularity, particularly in the colonies. A
French visitor observed in 1686 that: </p>

<p><i>Large quantities of it [tobacco] are used in this country,
besides what they sell. Everyone smokes while working and idling.
I sometimes went to hear the sermon; their churches are in the
woods, and when everyone has arrived the minister and all the
others smoke before going in. The preaching over, they do the
same thing before parting. They have seats for that purpose. It
was here I saw that everybody smokes, men, women, girls and boys
from the age of seven years </i>(Robert, 1949: 99).<br>
</p>

<p>It was said that even in New England, women of the colony
&quot;smoke in bed, smoke as they knead their bread, smoke whilst
they're cooking&quot; (Gottsegen, 1940: 147). </p>

<p>In the tobacco colonies, of course, there was no attempt to
restrict Consumption of tobacco. It was, after all, their
economic mainstay. </p>

<p>Officials in the northern colonies were less enthusiastic
about the habit, however. In 1632, the General Court of
Massachusetts Bay took the initiative and forbade smoking in
public tinder penalty of a fine (Tobacco Institute,
Massachusetts, 1971 : 17). In 1638, the proscription was expanded
to prohibit anyone from smoking in any inn or public house except
in his own room &quot;so as neither the master of the house nor
any of the guests there shall take offense thereat which if they
do, then such person is forthwith to forebear upon paying of two
shillings sixpence fine for every offense&quot; (Werner, 1922:
100). </p>

<p>This law was followed by another in 1646 which prohibited
smoking except on a journey of five miles or more from any town.
Nor could a citizen of the colony bring a pipe or tobacco into
the precincts of the court (Werner, 1922: 100), although he might
smoke at &quot;the ordinary tyme of repast comonly called
dynner&quot; (Heimann, 1960: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>Plymouth colony was similarly strict. In 1638, a law was
passed forbidding anyone from smoking on the streets. The
following year, it was decreed that jurymen might not smoke, on
pain of a five shilling penalty. </p>

<p>In 1641, even the importation of tobacco was forbidden,
although the law was repealed a year later. A law passed in 1646
prohibited all from smoking, but exempted &quot;soldiers in time
of their training.&quot; And, finally, in 1669, it was ordered
that anyone found smoking on the Sabbath within two miles of a
meeting house, would be fined 12 pence (Werner, 1922: 101). </p>

<p>The colony at New Haven, Connecticut, essayed a like series of
statutes to regulate tobacco consumption. In 1646, the General
Court decreed that: </p>

<p><i>No person under the age of twenty years nor any other that
hath not already accustomed himself to the use thereof, shall
take any tobacko, until he hath brough a certificate under the
hands of [a physician] that it is usefull for him, and also, that
he hath received a license from the court for the same.... None
shall take any tobacko, publickly in the street or any open
places unless on a journey of at least ten miles.</i> (Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut: 20-21).<br>
</p>

<p>Within three years those laws were repealed (Werner, 1922:
102). However, it was further ordered in 1655 that: </p>

<p><i>No tobacco shall be taken in the streets, yards or aboute
the howses in any plantation or farme in this jurisdiction
without dores, neere or aboute the towne, or in the meeting
howse, or body of the trayne Souldiors, or any other place where
they may doe mischief thereby, under the penalty of 84 pence a
pipe for a time, wch is to goe to him that informs and prosecuts </i>(Heimann,
1960: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>As a result of the regulation, snooping became a profitable
undertaking. In the end, however, the laws were of no avail in
suppressing tobacco. </p>

<p>By 1680, the governor of Connecticut recognized the
significance of the leaf and reported that, &quot;We have no need
of Virginia's trade, most people planting so much Tobacco as they
spend,&quot; (Heimann, 1960: 84). Indeed, by the early 18th
century, New England-grown tobacco was being produced in great
enough quantity for both domestic consumption and export (Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut: 22-23). <br>
</p>

<p>Tobacco was not one of the major concerns of the 18th century
either before or after the Revolution. Social reform was
generally secondary to political issues. By the end of the
century, however, Dr. Benjamin Rush had published his
&quot;Observations upon the influence of the Habitual use of
Tobacco upon Health, Morals, and Property&quot; in his collection
of Essays, Literary, Moral and Philosophical. It appeared in
1798, and stressed the Doctor's thesis that smoking and chewing
provoked drunkenness:<br>
</p>

<p><i>One of the usual effects of smoking and chewing is thirst.
This thirst cannot be allayed by water, for no sedative or even
insipid liquor will be relished after the mouth and throat have
been exposed to the stimulus of the smoke, or juice of Tobacco. A
desire of course is excited for strong drinks, and these when
taken between meals soon lead to intemperance and drunkenness.
One of the greatest sots I ever knew, acquired a love for ardent
spirits by swallowing ends of Tobacco, which he, (lid, to escape
detection in the use of it. . . </i>(Robert, 1949: 106).<br>
</p>

<p>There was little immediate response to Rush's dire warnings,
although in the year his tract was published, Boston enacted a
statute to prohibit the carrying of a lighted pipe or cigar in
public streets-apparently with the intent to reduce the hazard of
fire (Brooks, 1952: 245). </p>

<p>An anti-tobacco crusade was launched in the 19th century,
although with considerably less fervor that its sister movement
against alcohol. Among the leaders were Rev. George Trask who
said tobacco and alcohol were Satan's twins; and the Rev. Orin
Fowler, who declared in 1833: &quot;Rum-drinking will not cease,,
till tobacco-chewing and tobacco smoking and snuff -taking shall
cease&quot; (Robert, 1949: 107). Another, Dr. Joel Shew,
attributed delirium tremens, perverted sexuality, impotency,
insanity and cancer to the effects of smoking and chewing
(Brooks, 1952: 219). </p>

<p>The crusade warned as the pipe continued to attract adherents.
From the 18th century on, the cigar too began to grow in favor,
particularly after 1840. It is estimated that by 1850, the
average number of cigars smoked was approximately 19 per capita.
Within 10 years, the number had increased to about 26 (Gottsegen,
1940: 8-10). </p>

<p>Women smoked and chewed as well as the men. Indeed, Mrs.
Andrew Jackson and Mrs. Zachary Taylor both smoked their pipes in
the White House (Heimann, 1960: 90). And, of course, the other
residents of the Capital engaged heavily in the practices of both
chewing and spitting, to the extent that Charles Dickens, during
his tour of the States, felt called upon to report that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Washington may be called the headquarters of
tobaccotinctured saliva.... In all the public places of America,
this filthy custom is recognized. In the courts of law, the judge
has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, and the
prisoner his; while the jurymen and spectators are provided for.
. . . The stranger will find [the custom] in its full bloom of
glory, luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness, at Washington </i>(Brooks,
1952: 215-216). <br>
</p>

<p>Chewing and snuffing remained popular until the time of the
Civil War. Thereafter, cigarette smoking was gradually adopted in
North America, a habit indirectly acquired through the British
from their Turkish and French allies during the Crimean War
(Werner, 1922: 105). </p>

<p>By 1870, approximately 13.9 million cigarettes were smoked
annually in the United States, or .36 per capita. Over the next
60 years, the number was to reach 976.91 per capita (Gottsegen,
1940: 28). </p>

<p>As more persons took to cigarettes, the zeal of reformers,
which had ebbed during the Civil War, was renewed. Pamphlets,
like those of the Temperance Movement, were published, urging
abstinence from smoking: </p>

<p><i>&quot;I'll never use tobacco, no;</i> </p>

<p><i>It is a filthy weed;</i> </p>

<p><i>I'll never put it in my mouth.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>Said Little Robert Reed.</i> </p>

<p><i>&quot;It hurts the health ; it makes bad breath;</i> </p>

<p><i>'Til very bad indeed.</i> </p>

<p><i>I'll never, never use it, no!&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>Said Little Robert Reed </i>(Brooks, 1952: 242-243).<br>
</p>

<p>During the period following the Civil War and prior to the
formation of the American Tobacco Company in 1890, the
anti-liquor forces continued to snipe at tobacco in all forms. A
reformed drinker and temperance lecturer, John B. Gough, would
pull from his pocket a square of tobacco, smell it as if it were
a rose, cry out &quot;Ali you black devil, I love-you&quot; and
throw it away. </p>

<p>The anti-tobacconists were led by Lucy Gaston, the greatest,
warrior in the anti -cigarette campaign who was trained in the
office of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and then moved
over into the anti-tobacco Movement in the 1890's. Miss Gaston
encouraged children to wear anti-tobacco pins or buttons and
organized armies of children to sing and preach to and against
their smoking elders (Wagner, 1971: 40). </p>

<p>&quot;All hostility to tobacco seems nowadays to be
concentrated on cigarettes,&quot; noted Harper's Weekly,
observing the scene in 1905 (Robert, 1949: 169). It was scarcely
a startling revelation. Twenty years earlier, the New York Times
editorialized that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>A grown man has no possible excuse for thus imitating the
small boy.... The decadence of Spain began when the Spaniards
adopted cigarettes and if this pernicious habit obtains among
adult Americans the ruin of the Republic is close at hand . . . </i>(Brooks,
1952: 253).<br>
</p>

<p>Miss Gaston witnessed some legislation victories. Between 1895
and 1921, 14 states banned the sale of cigarettes (Neuberger,
1963: 52). Even in the city of New York it was declared unlawful
for women to smoke in public (Brooks, 1952: 271). Curiously,
However, the city of Boston repealed its law which prohibited
smoking in public in 1880 (Gottsegen, 1940: 153). </p>

<p>The apparent success of the prohibitionists revived the
anti-tobacconists' enthusiasm. &quot;Prohibition is won; now for
tobacco!&quot; pledged Billy Sunday. Miss Gaston also renewed her
dedication and actually announced her candidacy for the
presidency of the United States in 1920 on an antitobacco
platform. </p>

<p>For many anti-tobacconists, when it became apparent that the
elder generation may be lost, the war against tobacco was focused
on the youth of the country. The National Education Association
pledged its membership to cooperate in efforts made in the city,
state and nation to safeguard the health and morals of youth from
cigarette smoking to the end that high ideals for American
manhood may be, preserved for the coming generation (Hamilton,
1927: 168). </p>

<p>The National Congress of PTA, in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1926
resolved &quot;to lend its force to the cause of eliminating
throughout the United State-, the use of cigarettes by minors and
make this a special work for the ensuing year for the good of our
youth&quot; (Hamilton, 1927: 168). </p>

<p>It is for these reasons that the WCTU declared an educational
war against tobacco, but declined to seek prohibitory legislation
(Robert, 1949: 247). </p>

<p>The disenchanting experience of Prohibition, the omnipresence
of the tobacco industry, the need for new sources of state
revenues and the prevalence and popularity of cigarette smoking
combined to frustrate the anti-tobacco campaign. Cigarettes did
provide a new source of revenue. Federal income from tobacco
taxes soared to new heights because of increased cigarette
consumption and advanced rates. </p>

<p>In any event, by 1927, each of the 14 states which had enacted
prohibitory laws against cigarettes had repeated them (Neuberger,
1963: 52). Immediately thereafter these, states imposed taxes
upon the once forbidden product (Robert, 1949: 256; Federal Trade
Commission, 1970: 3).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>STATE REGULATION</b> </p>

<p>Only those laws which forbade the sale of tobacco products to
minors remain on the books, a trend set by New Jersey and
Washington in 1883 (Gottsegen, 1940: 155). </p>

<p>All but a few statutes restricting tobacco products to minors
were enacted between 1916-1920, simultaneous to the development
and popularity of the domestic-blend cigarette. </p>

<p>All 50 states bad laws banning sales to minors by 1950. Since
then, Georgia,. Louisiana, and Wisconsin have repealed theirs le
o 47 states plus the District of Columbia, WIL Vs prohibiting
sales to minors. </p>

<p>The most common age of restriction for cigarettes and tobacco
products today applies to persons under the age of 18. In an
effort to ensure stricter enforcement 11 states have lowered the
age of restriction from 21 to 15 (Tobacco Merchants Association,
1971: 1-2). In contrast to this trend, however, the, California
Legislature, 1971 defeated a bill to allow school smoking areas
and lowering the sale to minor restrictions to 15 years old (NIC
Smoking and Health, 1971: 1). </p>

<p>According to a Special Report released by the Tobacco
Merchants Association of the United States, the liability for
infractions in all states is on the vendor and donor of
cigarettes. In a few states, manufacturer and persons advising or
compelling the minors to smoke, or owning the premise where such
behavior occurs are also liable. However, in some states the
infraction does not extend to the parent or guardian. Some states
penalize the minor himself and others require that he divulge his
source. </p>

<p>Most of the statutes that prohibit the furnishing of
cigarettes to minors extend the ban also to one or more other
tobacco products. Only I 1 states restrict the sale
&quot;only&quot; to cigarettes. The efficacy of such statutes, in
the day of the cigarette machine, is subject to substantial
skepticism. </p>

<p><b>THE IMPETUS FOR FEDERAL SUMPTUARY REGULATION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The effect of smoking on health has been the subject of
discussion for hundreds of years. Early participants in the
tobacco controversy, beginning in the late 16th century, did not
associate the use of tobacco with the production of cancers
although they credited it with causing or curing nearly every
other known disease. </p>

<p>Dr. John Hill, of London, a physician, botanist and prolific
writer, first suggested the relation in 1761. In Cautions Against
the Immoderate Use ol Snuff, he reported six cases of
&quot;polypusses&quot; related to excessive indulgence in tobacco
in the form of snuff. One such &quot;polypus&quot; was described
as a swelling in one nostril that was hard, black and adherent on
a broad base. Painless at first, it later developed &quot;all the
frightful symptoms of an open cancer.&quot; Dr. Hill believed
that this lesion could be fatal and placed the blame for its
origin on tobacco. Dr. Hill has been noted as the first to report
an association of tobacco with cancer (Redmond, 1970: 21). </p>

<p>In 1939, the first scientific study linking lung cancer with
smoking was published. Between 1950 and 1954, 14 studies
associating cigarettes and serious diseases were completed
(Fritschler, 1969: 145). </p>

<p>At the present time, there is no government agency with clear
jurisdiction over the health aspects of cigarettes. The Federal
Trade Commission can act on matters of advertising and package
information. The Food and Drug Administration concerns itself
only with foods, drugs, solids, or liquids that are eaten or
drunk. Tobacco is neither a food nor a drug under current legal
definitions. Nor are cigarettes eaten or drunk; they are inhaled.<br>
</p>

<p>The 1890 edition of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, an official
listing of drugs published by the government, included tobacco.
In later editions, tobacco was dropped. Former Senator Maurine
Neuberger has claimed that the removal of tobacco from the
Pharmacopoeia was the price paid to get support of tobacco-state
legislators for the Food and Drug Act of 1906. The leaf was
thereby removed from the jurisdiction of the FDA (Wagner, 1971:
74).<br>
</p>

<p>The first statement from the Public Health Service on the
subject was made by its Surgeon General, Leroy F. Burney, M.D.,
in the Journal of the American Medical Association in November,
1959. The heart of this statement was that &quot;the weight of
evidence at present implicates smoking as the principal
etiological factor in the increased incidence of lung
cancer&quot; (Diehl, 1969: 154). </p>

<p>In June, 1961 the American Cancer Society, the American Heart
Association and the National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease
Association jointly requested that a commission be appointed
&quot;to consider the responsibilities of government, of business
and of voluntary agencies relative to the health hazards of
cigarette smoking and to recommend a solution of this health
problem that would protect the public and would interfere least
with the freedom of industry and the happiness of
individuals&quot; (Diehl, 1969: 155). </p>

<p>On June 7, 1962, the then Surgeon General, Dr. Luther Terry,
announced, with the approval of the President, that he was
establishing an &quot;expert committee to undertake a
comprehensive review of all data on smoking and health.&quot; </p>

<p>The members of this committee were respected scientists who
had previously expressed no opinion about the relationship of
tobacco to health. All members were approved for appointment by
the tobacco industry as well as by the American Medical
Association and several national health agencies. Half of the
committee members were cigarette smokers. </p>

<p>On January 11, 1964, after some 15 months of intensive study,
this Advisory Committee- to the Surgeon General issued its
monumental unanimous report stating that &quot;cigarette smoking
is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States
to warrant, appropriate remedial action.&quot; </p>

<p>The committee stated unequivocally that &quot;cigarette
smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men; the magnitude
of the effect of cigarette smoking far outweighs other factors.
The data for women, though less extensive, point in the same
direction.&quot; Air pollution was found to be a very minor
factor in the cause of the disease, far outweighed by cigarette
smoking. </p>

<p>The death rate from heart disease, the report noted, was 70
percent higher in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers, and
although there was not enough evidence to say positively that
smoking causes heart disease, there was enough to assume that it
is a cause and to take action against it. </p>

<p>Another conclusion of great importance was that
&quot;cigarette smoking is the most important of the causes of
chronic bronchitis in the United States and increases the risk of
dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema.&quot; </p>

<p>The report analyzed the statistical, pathological, clinical,
and experimental evidence in relation to smoking and other
diseases. A total of more than 4,000 published reports were
studied and more than 150 investigators were personally
interviewed. &quot;The result was the most comprehensive and
authoritative report on this subject ever made&quot; (Diehl,
1969: 156).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE HEALTH WARNING REQUIREMENT<br>
</b></p>

<p>At the time the Surgeon General's Report was published, no
statute, administrative ruling or court decision required that
cigarette packaging or advertising contain any statement about
the dangers to health attributable to cigarette smoking.<br>
</p>

<p>After Trade Regulation Rule Proceedings in March and June
1964, the Federal Trade Commission concluded that cigarette
advertising was deceptive (misleading) and that advertisers had a
responsibility to warn the public of the health hazards of
cigarette smoking. </p>

<p>To accomplish this, the Commission proposed that cigarette
packages state the amount of tar and nicotine in the smoke of the
cigarette which the package contains and that cigarette packages
and cigarette advertising carry a statement such as:
&quot;Caution: Cigarette 'Smoking is Dangerous to Health. It May
Cause Death from Cancer and Other Diseases.&quot; </p>

<p>This warning was to be required on cigarette packages
beginning January 1, 1965, and in cigarette advertising beginning
July 1, 1965. The tobacco industry first obtained a postponement
of the effective dates of this ruling and then prevailed upon
Congress to vitiate the ruling by passing the Cigarette Labeling
and Advertising Act, requiring all packages of cigarettes sold in
this country to carry the label &quot;Cigarette Smoking May be
Hazardous to Your Health,&quot; but prohibiting the Federal Trade
Commission and state and local governments from requiring any
other label on cigarette packages and any warnings in cigarette
advertising at least until 1969. </p>

<p>A New York Times editorial called the Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act of 1965 &quot;a shocking piece of
special-interest legislation-a bill to protect the economic
health of the tobacco industry by freeing it of proper
regulation&quot; (Cigarette Labeling and Advertising, 1965). An
article in the Atlantic Monthly described the political
maneuvering behind this legislation under the title &quot;The
Quiet Victory of the Cigarette Lobby: How It Found the Best
Filter Yet-Congress&quot; (Diehl, 1969:162). </p>

<p>Public concern attending publication of the Surgeon General's
report, Smoking and Health, and the pending FTC regulations for
warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising
apparently convinced the tobacco industry that some action by
Congress was inevitable. </p>

<p>Reportedly the industry decided to accept a weak label on
cigarette packages provided that the legislation would prevent
any regulation of cigarette advertising. This was accomplished by
inserting into the proposed law the provision precluding the FTC
and all state or local governments from requiring any warning on
cigarette packages other than the one approved by Congress and
also preventing any warnings in cigarette advertising. </p>

<p>At House and Senate committee hearings, committee members
friendly to the industry attempted to discredit both the Surgeon
General's Report and the testimony given by the Surgeon General,
the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and the
representatives of various medical and health organizations. The
tobacco industry then presented a number of physicians who
testified that they disagreed with the conclusions of the Surgeon
General's Advisory Committee and that in their opinion there was
no real evidence that cigarette smoking is harmful (Diehl, 1969:
162). </p>

<p>Although this act temporarily prevented any requirement that
tar and nicotine content be indicated on cigarette packages, the
Federal Trade Commission did establish a laboratory to determine
the, tar and nicotine content of the smoke of cigarettes on the
American market, making the results of these tests available
periodically to the public. </p>

<p>The Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act also required that
about July 1, 1967, and annually thereafter the Federal Trade
Commission report to Congress concerning the effectiveness of the
warning label, and upon current practices of cigarette
advertising and promotion, with &quot;recommendations for
legislation that are deemed appropriate.&quot; </p>

<p>After an intensive study the Federal Trade Commission made a
detailed report to Congress with the following summary and
recommendations: &quot;There is virtually no evidence that the
warning statement on cigarette packages has had any significant
effect.&quot; </p>

<p>Sales remained constant and the industry continued to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising; $200 million a
year was being spent on radio and television alone in 1967;
cigarette advertisers had become the single largest product
advertisers on television accounting for about eight per cent of
television advertising time (Wagner, 1971: 166).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Another government agency had become concerned with cigarette
advertising. The Federal Communications Commission is mandated to
assure that the airways, which belong to the public, are used in
the public interest. </p>

<p>John P. Banzhaf, III, who has been called the &quot;Ralph
Nader of the tobacco industry&quot; was responsible for the FCC's
involvement in the cigarette advertising controversy. After
viewing several cigarette commercials on television, Banzhaf
concluded that &quot;what he was seeing might be considered
legally 'controversial&quot;' (Wagner, 1971: 168). He then wrote
to WCBS-TV in New York on December 1, 1966, requesting that he or
some other responsible spokesman be given an opportunity to
present contrasting views on the issue of the benefits and
advisability of smoking. </p>

<p>Banzhaf's letter cited three commercials that presented the
view that smoking is &quot;socially acceptable and desirable,
manly, and a necessary part of a rich full life. &quot;He
asked-free time roughly approximate to that spent on the
promotion of the &quot;virtues and values of smoking.&quot; CBS
routinely turned down the request. He sent a second letter to CBS
and submitted a formal complaint against WCBS-TV to the FCC in
Washington. </p>

<p>The FCC, in a letter to the television station dated June 2,
1967, said programs it had broadcast dealing with the effect of
smoking on health were insufficient to offset the effects of paid
advertisements broadcast for a total of five to 10 minutes each
broadcast day. &quot;We hold that the fairness doctrine is
applicable to such advertisements&quot; the Commission said. They
rejected Banzhaf's claim for equal time, however. </p>

<p>The FCC called on the station to provide free each week
&quot;a significant amount of time for the other viewpoint,&quot;
thereby implementing the smoking education campaigns launched by
the government under the cigarette labeling law. &quot;This
requirement will not preclude or curtail presentation by stations
of cigarette advertising which they choose to carry.&quot; The
FCC basically decided that it was not in the public interest for
the airways to be used by radio and television to advertise
cigarettes without some warning of the health hazards involved
with smoking (Wagner, 1971: 169). </p>

<p>The FCC was deluged with requests to reconsider its action.
The agency stood firm in its unanimous decision. As a result of
the ruling many of the voluntary health agencies and the Public
Health Service made available to the television and radio
industries spot announcements and other program materials on the
serious consequences to health caused by cigarette smoking. </p>

<p>The FCCs decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals on
November 21, 1968; the court said the agency could indeed use its
fairness doctrine to require free time for anti-smoking
commercials. &quot;The danger cigarettes may pose to health is,
among others, a danger to life itself,&quot; the Court said. </p>

<p>As the Commission emphasized, it is a danger inherent in the
normal use of the product, not one merely associated with its
abuse or dependent on intervening fortuitous events. It threatens
a substantial body of the population, not merely a peculiarly
susceptible fringe group. Moreover, the danger, though not
established beyond all doubt, is documented by a compelling
cumulation of statistical evidence (Wagner, 1971: l66-173). </p>

<p>(The cigarette manufacturers then asked the Supreme Court to
review their case, but the high court turned down the request,
leaving the appeals court decision standing.) </p>

<p><i>&quot;Most observers agree that the dramatic entrance of
the FCC into the smoking controversy was probably the most
important single event during the three-year moratorium on
requiring health warnings in cigarette advertisements imposed by
Congress on the FTC&quot;</i> (Wagner, 1971 : 175).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE BAN ON ADVERTISING<br>
</b></p>

<p>Both the U.S. Public Health Service and Federal Trade
Commission have annually reported findings to Congress since
passage of the cigarette labeling law. The FTC recommended that
the Act should be amended to: &quot;Warning: Cigarette Smoking Is
Dangerous to Health and May Cause Death From Cancer and Other
Diseases.&quot; </p>

<p>Additionally, the FTC recommended legislation to require the
same warning to appear in all cigarette advertisements and to
require statements of tar and nicotine content on all cigarette
packages and in all advertising. </p>

<p>Legislation to accomplish these objectives as well as the
following were recommended by the FTC: </p>

<p><i>Cigarette advertising on television and radio should be
barred entirely. Alternately, cigarette advertising on television
and radio should be limited as to hours in which it may appear;
the extent to which it may appear; and the types of programs on
which it may appear;</i> </p>

<p><i>Increased appropriations, should be made to the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare for education of the public
(especially young people) as to the health hazards of smoking;</i>
</p>

<p><i>Appropriations should be made for research under the
direction of the National Institutes of Health on the development
of less hazardous cigarettes.<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;By 1969, the stage had been set for a showdown over
cigarette advertising and promotion&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 190).
The U.S. Government was increasing its efforts to discourage the
sale of cigarettes. Post office trucks carried posters:
&quot;100,000 Doctors Have Quit Smoking.&quot; </p>

<p>The Surgeon General continued to release reports about the
adverse health effects of smoking. </p>

<p>Dr. Daniel Horn, director of the National Clearinghouse for
Smoking and Health, was urging doctors to deliver antismoking
appeals to patients in their offices. </p>

<p>Movie personalities had become involved in the American Cancer
Society's campaign called I.Q. (for &quot;I Quit&quot;) that
passed out lapel buttons and dispatched public speakers around
the country to discourage the habit. Doris Day, Debbie Reynolds
and Lawrence Welk refused to allow tobacco companies to sponsor
their TV shows. </p>

<p>Two ad agencies--Ogilivy and Mather and Doyle Dane
Bernbach-and a few radio and television stations would not accept
cigarette business. Several magazines did not accept cigarette
advertising as a matter of principle: Reader's Digest, the New
Yorker, and the Saturday Review. The Christian Science Monitor
had never carried cigarette ads; the Boston Globe announced in
May, 1969 that it would no longer accept such advertising
&quot;because accumulated medical evidence has indicated that
cigarette smoking is hazardous to health&quot; (Wagner, 1971:
220). </p>

<p>In April 1969, a few weeks before the House Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee was scheduled to open hearings on the
FTC proposals, a series of bills were introduced in the House by
representatives of tobacco producing states. One such bill, H.R.
7177, co-sponsored by all eleven of North Carolina's House
Delegation, proposed &quot;to establish a comprehensive Federal
program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with
respect to any relationship between smoking and health.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Identical measures were introduced under the sponsorship of
congressmen from Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and Florida. Some
accounts of the activity on Capitol Hill during this period
attribute these bills to the tobacco interests' intention
&quot;to prevent strengthening of the warning label and make
permanent the ban on state and Federal regulation of cigarette
advertising, which was due to expire on June 30. Passage of this
legislation was the best tobacco interests could have hoped for
under the circumstances&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 205). </p>

<p>After testimony from both sides, the House Committee approved
a stiffer health warning but prohibited regulatory action on
cigarette advertising for six years and in other ways generally
upheld the status quo. </p>

<p>The Senate, Commerce Committee, on December 5, 1970, voted out
a bill banning cigarette commercials from the air as of January
1, 1971. The FTC was prohibited from acting on cigarette ads in
newspapers and magazines until the middle of 1972. The labeling
provision in the Senate bill was weaker than that established in
the House-voted measure, and the bill also precluded cigarette
regulatory action by the fifty states and local governments. </p>

<p>In a session on December 12, a floor amendment was introduced
which loosened the Committee's proposed restriction on the FTC by
allowing the agency to require health warnings in advertising as
of July 1, 1971. The bill also authorized the FTC to move sooner
if it found that tobacco companies were switching from broadcast
to print advertising so massively that it could be considered a
&quot; gross abuse.&quot; This bill also approved a new required
health warning for cigarette packages&quot;Warning: Cigarette
Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.&quot; </p>

<p>After Senate passage, the measure still had to -pass a joint
Senate-House Conference Committee where important differences
between the two bills had to be reconciled. </p>

<p>The bill that emerged from conference differed only slightly
from the Senate measure. The cautionary label to which the
conferees agreed provides: &quot;Warning: The Surgeon General Has
Determined That Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your
Health.&quot; &quot;In a final concession to the broadcasters,
the conferees agreed to delay for one day the blackout of
cigarette commercials from December 31, 1970, to midnight January
1, 1971. That would give them a last shower of cash from the New
Year's Day football bowl games&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 216). It was
estimated that the loss to television and radio stations would
amount to about $220 million a year, or about 7.5% of their total
advertising revenues. </p>

<p>President Nixon signed the Act on April 1, 1970. </p>

<p>Some observers marvel that the bill was passed &quot;in spite
of massive pressure that had been brought to bear against it and
against the regulation of cigarette advertising generally, by the
tobacco industry, the broadcasting industry, and the lobbyists
and their political allies. This was a combination that for years
had proved invincible against a counterforce of scientists and
public health and public interest advocates who, armed with
formidable statistics on the damage to health and life caused by
cigarette smoking, had sought to protect consumers by requiring
all cigarette advertising to provide adequate warnings of these
dangers&quot; (Whiteside, 1970: 58). </p>

<p>There are those observers , on the other hand, who do not view
the ban of cigarette advertising on television and radio as such
a success for the consumer. Rather, they cite the statistics on
consumption in other countries to point up the fact that bans on
advertising do not reduce sales.<br>
</p>

<p>In Czechoslovakia, for example, no direct advertising of
tobacco is permitted; yet consumption increased 14% between 1953
and 1958. Advertising of foreign cigarettes was banned in 1962 in
Italy; the following year sales increased 39.4% and in 1964, 11.7
%. Sales increased in England after television cigarette
advertisements were banned in 1965. Consumption figures for the
following three years in Britain reveal increases: 112 billion
cigarettes in 1965, 118 billion in 1966; and 119.1 billion in
1967 (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 113-114). </p>

<p>Robert Miller, an agricultural economist in the Department of
Agriculture's Economic Research Service, reports that cigarette
consumption is up in every part of the world although advertising
was banned in several European countries some years ago. He
predicts an eventual decrease in sales during the next five years
and perhaps a 12-13% decrease in tobacco consumption (Tobacco
Advertising Could End, 1970: 7). </p>

<p>Other observers can see a gradual reduction in cigarette
consumption as a result of a prohibition on advertising; some
feel a ban on advertising merely makes it difficult to launch a
new brand. Others predict that the ban will eliminate the social
acceptability of the habit although consumption will not go down.
</p>

<p>The &quot;live dangerously novelty&quot; has also been
identified as a possible cause for gains in consumption;
&quot;such a philosophy might well be prevalent among the young,
the very ones that antismoking advocates are most anxious to
protect&quot; (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 112-113). </p>

<p>Another consequence of the ban on cigarette commercials was
the FCC ruling that the broadcasters' obligation to air
antismoking messages had ended. The stations continue to run them
as public service spots; however, the volume was decreased
considerably from the former 1 to 3 ratio established by the FCC.
The antismoking forces are fearful that a decrease in these spots
is harmful to their cause and may retard their efforts to reduce
cigarette consumption. </p>

<p>On October 20,1971, a U.S. District Court ruled that the
Congressional ban on cigarette advertising is constitutional. The
ruling stated that such advertising does not qualify under the
First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech; a sharp
distinction was drawn between guarantees of freedom. of speech
for individuals and the &quot;limited extent&quot; to which
broadcast advertising qualifies for such protection. </p>

<p>The court also ruled that Congress had more than one
&quot;rational basis&quot; for excluding cigarette ads from
television and not the printed media one being that broadcasts
are the &quot;most persuasive&quot; types of advertising
(Cigarette Ad Ban, 1971). Ultimately, the constitutional question
will have to be decided by the United States Supreme Court.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONSUMPTION TRENDS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is widespread in America today; 45.9% of the
male population 17 years of age and over and 30.5% of females 17
and over are smokers. In 1970, about $10.6 billion of
individuals' expenditures was for cigarettes. </p>

<p>Data on cigarette sales and advertising has been obtained by
the FTC from domestic cigarette manufacturers; the table below
provides cigarette sales for the years 1963 to the present
(Federal Trade Commission, 1970: 3) :<br>
</p>

<p><b>TOTAL CIGARETTES SOLD<br>
</b></p>

<p>Year Billions </p>

<p>1963 516.5 </p>

<p>1964 505.0 </p>

<p>1965 521.1 </p>

<p>1966 529.9 </p>

<p>1967 535.8 </p>

<p>1968 540.3 </p>

<p>1969 527.9 </p>

<p>1970 534.2 </p>

<p>The reduction in sales in 1964 coincides with the public
attention given the Report of the Surgeon General issued on
January 11, 1964. Public awareness of the dangers cited in the
Report was high. It was soon forgotten, for in 1965 the total
number of cigarettes sold was almost 5 billion higher than the
year prior to the Surgeon General's Report. </p>

<p>In 1969 there was another significant decline; it has been
suggested that this decline is attributable to several
high-visibility events and also by sales tax increases. For
example, the FCC ruling was upheld in November 1968 giving
impetus to the antismoking TV campaign; the federal government's
anti-smoking campaign was in full swing during 1968-69; the
public outcry was being felt by economic interests-magazines,
newspapers, personalities and advertising agencies which refused
sponsorship for business from tobacco companies. </p>

<p>There were significant state tax increases immediately prior
to 1969 which probably contributed to the reduction in sales
during that year. During fiscal year 1967, 15 states increased
their cigarette tax rates; the average increase was 3.5 cents.
The rate increase ranged from New York's, Ohio's, and Illinois'
two cents to California's and Florida's seven cents. The next
year, seven more states increased their cigarette taxes. The
rates ranged from Massachusetts' and Vermont's two cents to
Minnesota's, Rhode Island's, and Tennessee's five cents the
average increase approximately four cents (Council of State
Governments, 1968: 196-197). </p>

<p>The ban on cigarette advertising on television and radio began
on January 2, 1971, yet several calculations reflect a rise in
cigarette sales during the past year. Business Week projections
of industry sales and brand rankings show that a record 529
billion cigarettes were consumed in 1971, 1.5% more than 1970's
sales (Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 56). Tobacco industry
sources estimate that consumption has risen in 1971 by 1.5% to
535 billion cigarettes (Cigarette Sales Up, 1972: 3). </p>

<p>John C. Maxwell, tobacco analyst for Oppenheimer &amp;
Company, a brokerage firm, also reported a rise-2.3% in domestic
unit sales in 1971. He relates part of the growth in cigarette
consumption to the population mix the increase hit the 20-40 year
age group, where smoking is heaviest. The Maxwell report suggests
that the rest of this growth must be related to &quot;government
overkill, wherein many voices in Washington suggest that
everything we eat or drink is harmful&quot; (Maxwell, 1971: 1).<br>
</p>

<p>An industry specialist with Manufacturers Hlanover Trust
Company, on the other hand, attributes both the lag in sales in
1969 and the new increase to the &quot;very effective antismoking
ads on television. Since the ban, these commercials rarely
appear&quot; (Cigarette Sales Up, 1972: 3). </p>

<p>Another industry executive notes, &quot;For years we have
believed that the role of cigarette advertising is to attract
smokers from competitive brands rather than induce nonsmokers to
start smoking. We failed to convince the Federal Communications
Commission of this, but it is borne out by our industry's
experience since the TV ban. Within a relatively stable market,
some companies have continued to gain while others lost. Some
brands have increased their share of market while others have
declined&quot; (Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 56). Skeptics
continue to argue that tobacco companies have also been trying to
recruit new young smokers.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOBACCO: ECONOMICS AND POLITICS<br>
</b></p>

<p>It is generally accepted that tobacco has been an extremely
powerful force in American politics. Approximately 50 million
smokers smoked 535 billion cigarettes in the past year. More than
100,000 employees receive $500 million in wages annually from
tobacco manufacturing companies; over 4,500 wholesalers handle
the distribution of tobacco products and hundreds of thousands of
merchants depend on tire sale of cigarettes as a source of their
income. </p>

<p>Cigarette companies had been spending over $200 million per
year on radio and television advertising, and since the ban,
almost all of this money has been diverted to other media
advertising providing many thousands of jobs in ad agencies and
in the various media. Three million people from about 750,000
families receive $1.4 billion annually for the cultivation of
tobacco used in cigarettes. </p>

<p>Peripherally affected are those involved in producing the 40
million pounds of moisture-proof cellophane, the 70 million
pounds of aluminum foil, the 27 billion printed packs, and the
2.7 billion cartons (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 110-111;
Wagner, 1971: 120; USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971a: 29-31). </p>

<p>One writer, reporting on the present public policy trend,
notes that &quot;attempts to discourage smoking would affect the
lives of millions of people and would have profound economic and
political consequences&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 121). </p>

<p>Advocates of cigarette smoking today are organized into
extremely powerful groups, each having its own specific function
and plentiful resources. </p>

<p>The Tobacco Tax Council, established in 1949, compiles data on
the taxation of tobacco products by the Federal, state and local
governments. The Council's annual booklet, &quot;Cigaret Taxes in
the United States&quot; has been superseded by &quot; The Tax
Burden on Tobacco&quot; since 1966. This pamphlet
&quot;undertakes to trace the history of tobacco taxes from the
years of the Civil War down through [the present year]&quot;
(Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: iii).<br>
</p>

<p>The trade association promoting the welfare of the tobacco
industry is the Tobacco Merchants Association of the U.S. It is
composed of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, importers,
exporters, leaf dealers, suppliers, and firms interested in the
industry. Its Bulletins cover legislation, trends, special
reports; its numerous other publications and activities seek to
improve industry operations and expand outlets (e.g.,
international) f or potential sales (Tobacco Merchants
Association, 1971: 1-4).<br>
</p>

<p>The tobacco industry's point of view is nurtured and protected
by the Tobacco Institute, a nonprofit corporation founded in
1958. Its membership includes major U.S. manufacturers of
cigarettes, smoking and chewing tobacco, and snuff: The Bloch
Brothers Tobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corporation, Conwood Corporation, G. A. Georgopulo &amp; Company,
Helme Products, Larus &amp; Brother Company, Liggett &amp; Myers,
Lorillard, Philip Morris Incorporated, R. J. Reynolds Industries,
Scotten-Dillion Company, and United States Tobacco Company. </p>

<p>The Institute is financed by contributions from the large
corporations according to their share of the market. The
institute reports on the pro-tobacco side of the medical story,
attempting to discredit antismoking publicity, and publishes
information on the historical role of tobacco, its place in the
national economy, the industry itself, and the public's use of
tobacco products. </p>

<p>The Council for Tobacco Research, created in 1953 in response
to medical bulletins reporting on the hazards of smoking,
processes and administers millions of research grants.
&quot;Although research money was to be awarded with no strings
attached [The Council] nicely serve[s] the purpose of identifying
the industry with the welfare of humanity and spreading good will
through the scientific community&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 80). </p>

<p>The scientific data continue to be attacked from both sides.
Since 1954 a great quantity of research has been published and,
in turn, disputed. For example, &quot;the press played up the
Hammond and Auerbach study and the claim that twelve beagles had
developed lung cancer&quot; from cigarettes. &quot;The findings
have subsequently been downgraded by ' v the author to two
microscopic tumors with the further revelation that two dogs in
the control group also developed tumors&quot; (Maxwell, 1971: 1).
</p>

<p>Another area of contention has developed around the
relationship between cigarette smoke itself and lung cancer. A
recent paper by Dr. Geoffrey Myddelton given at the Second World
Conference on Smoking and Health in London, September 20-24,
1971, compares the incidence of smoking and lung cancer in
various countries. He indicates, &quot;Japan smokes 86% as much
as Britain but has only 27% of its lung cancer. Canada smokes
twice as many cigarettes as the Netherlands but has only 69% as
much lung cancer.&quot; He goes on to correlate the use of diesel
file] in England to lung cancer (Maxwell, 1971: 2). </p>

<p>From the other side, the United States Public Health Service
1972 report The Health Consequences of Smoking maintains that
&quot;nonsmokers as well as smokers may be harmed by cigarettes,
. . . tobacco smoke in closed cars and poorly ventilated rooms
can contaminate the atmosphere for everyone. . . . The chief
danger is exposure to low levels of the deadly gas, carbon
monoxide. Experiments, with animals have shown that various
concentrations of the colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas
'adversely affect' the structure and function of the heart and
lungs. The implication is that this may also be true in man&quot;
(Study Says Cigarette Smoke Also May Harm Nonusers, 1972: 1). </p>

<p>It is estimated that at the present time one and a half to two
million adults give up smoking every year. Sensing the hazards of
the future, some cigarette, companies sought fiscal security in
diversification and substitution; tobacco manufacturers are now
marketing, for example, safety razors, fertilizers, dog food,
ballpoint pens, peanut butter and other non-nicotine products. By
1967, sales on non-tobacco products accounted for approximately
one-third of the, total sales of cigarette manufacturers. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether tobacco power will be whittled
away any further in the next few years. Some feel that &quot;the
tobacco subsystem has succeeded in keeping the health question a
low priority item on the government's agenda by playing one
government agency off against another.... This subsystem cuts
across institutional lines and includes the paid representatives
of tobacco growers, marketing organizations and manufacturers.,.
Congressmen representing tobacco growing states [are] leading
members of four subcommittees, including two ,appropriations
subcommittees and two committees in each house of Congress
handling tobacco legislation. . . . Tobacco power [is] thus
firmly entrenched and well supported&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 121). </p>

<p>On the other hand, a strongly worded commentary by an industry
spokesman cites Justice John Marshall's statement to illustrate
industry's precarious position: &quot;The power to tax involves
the power to destroy.&quot; He continues with a description of
the tobacco industry's present situation:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The onslaught of state and local taxes on tobacco products
... represents a most serious threat to all segments of our
industry.... We are now facing a calculated attempt to destroy,
or at least drastically curtail, the sale of smoking products.
The political and economic climate is most favorable for this
attack. Smoking and health is a prime political issue in the same
context as air pollution, crime in the streets, and consumerism.
At the same time, local governments are verging on bankruptcy.
Revenue of any sort is therefore a must. It is a tough battle,
and cigarette industry is currently bearing the largest part of
the attack </i>(Regensburg, 1971: 146).<br>
</p>

<p>The revenues gained from tobacco tax collections are
significant. Over $2.1 billion in Federal taxes and over $2.5
billion in state cigarette taxes were collected in Fiscal Year
1971 (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 4-6, 8; USDA, Tobacco Situation,
1971b: 44). Total tobacco taxes were $4.8 billion in 1971
compared with $1.7 billion in 1950. </p>

<p>In 1970 tobacco taxes accounted for 1.1% of total federal tax
receipts and represented 13.8 percent of all excise taxes (USDA,
Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 40). This places the tobacco tax as the
seventh largest source of collection by the Federal government
behind the major giants, e.g., income and profit taxes (both
corporate and individual), employment taxes, manufacturers excise
taxes, alcohol taxes, and estate and gift taxes. In terms of
individual commodities it ranks behind only alcohol. Thus,
federal revenue would be importantly affected if tobacco
consumption were to decline. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONCLUSION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The big question is how the Federal government plans to
proceed. Six tobacco bills are now pending in Congress. One of
these bills would give the Federal Trade Commission authority to
set maximum permissible limits on tar and nicotine. Another would
establish a graduated cigarette tax based on tar content. </p>

<p>The FTC is presently carrying on negotiations with the
industry to come up with a &quot;clear and conspicuous&quot;
health warning for its print advertising. It is expected that the
industry, &quot; which has been working closely with the FTC
'will' take some 'voluntary' labeling action&quot; (Where
Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 57). </p>

<p>The industry feels the pressure; one member explains: &quot;We
are resigned to it. Over-all.... the industry mood is much more
relaxed-now that we have this first big year behind us&quot;
(Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 57). </p>

<p>The public is clamoring for government action; a 1970 College
Poll'. surveying-youths 18 and older on more than 100 campuses
reveals that 96% believe that smoking is dangerous to one's
health (College Poll, 1971). </p>

<p>Further, a 1969 study on teenage (13- to 18-yearolds) smoking
attitudes, motivation and habits indicates &quot;deep teenage
dissatisfaction with cigarette smoking, considerable knowledge of
its ill effects, but a very exaggerated estimate of the
acceptance of smoking by the adult world&quot; (Lieberman
Research, 1969: 1-20). And, a 1970 nationwide survey of teenagers
revealed: &quot;72% of non-smokers identified physicians as the
one group that could persuade them not to start smoking and 42%
of those who smoked said their physician's advice would influence
them to stop&quot; (Doctors, 1970: 24). </p>

<p>Critics of the industry claim: &quot;The controversy about
smoking and health continues largely because of the energy, time
and money spent by the tobacco industry in keeping this
controversy alive&quot; (College Poll, 1971).<br>
</p>

<p>In September, 1935, Fortune Magazine published a discussion of
the medical implications of smoking. It concluded that: </p>

<p><i>This much can be said: That the possible benefit to be
derived from tobacco is always less than the possible harm </i>(Robert,
1949: 256).<br>
</p>

<p>Official policy has never accepted this judgment. In recent
years, steps have been taken to discourage smoking, although
there is little conclusive evidence that consumption patterns are
changing. It can be expected that official policy and alterations
in individual behavior will both evolve slowly during the coming
years. The socioeconomic impact of a sudden change in official
policy would be great, a circumstance reflecting the momentum of
several centuries of intense commercial activity.<br>

has just raised the subsidy that tobacco growers will get on
their 1964 crop. At the same time, the Food for Peace program is

<h2>William Bennett</h2>

<p> When William Bennett moved across town from the Department of
Education to be &quot;czar&quot; at the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, he brought his people with him. All white, all
male, none with law enforcement or social-service experience,
some had been with Bennett the entire eight years since his debut
at the National Endowment for the Humanities. </p>

<p> Bennett's men held themselves above the mere budget-cutters,
tax-slashers, regulation-busters, and states-rightsers that
comprised the broader executive branch. John Walters, Bennett's
chief of staff at Education and author of the punitive Schools
Without Drugs, had been to meetings of Ed Meese's Drug Policy
Board and had been appalled at their inanity. Everybody was so
busy jockeying for position that nobody ever ventured an honest
opinion or original idea. Bennett's office, on the other hand,
prided itself on being one continuous philosophy forum, with
great questions of political theory and national purpose the
stuff of daily conversation. Envisioning themselves a kind of
ideological Bennettista cavalry to the Republican infantry,
Bennett's crew saw their mission at the drug office as
fundamentally identical to that at Education or the Endowment: To
reform America's character, by force if necessary. </p>

<p> It would have been okay with them to be assigned teen
pregnancy, abortion, welfare -- any platform from which to
harangue the public about values and exact punishment for
transgression. &quot;Drugs are the hill we're fighting over at
the moment, but the war is much bigger than that,&quot; Bruce
Carnes, Bennett's budget director, would say. &quot;Our fight is
any issue that has a shade on character.&quot; </p>

<p> The &quot;hill&quot; they'd just been given to fight over,
though, wasn't just any piece of political turf, but was the
hottest hot-button issue of the decade. More than half the
country believed drugs to be the America's worst problem.
Majorities favored mandatory drug tests for all citizens,
warrantless police searches of suspected dealers' homes, and
roadblocks to search cars randomly. This wasn't mere naked
paintings or politically correct social studies textbooks. This
was a chance to preach and kick ass on the nation's brightly lit
center stage. </p>

<p> Even before Bennett's Senate confirmation, his men began
plotting their course. The same 1988 law that created the drug
czar's office also required it to produce a drug-control strategy
by September, and there was no time to waste. Bennett himself
wasn't around much. He'd checked himself into a $700-a-week
therapeutic resort to kick his two-pack-a-day cigarette habit. </p>

<p> But in the lofty and freewheeling style to which they'd
become accustomed, Bennett's core group of advisors began laying
out the assumptions on which national drug policy would hereafter
be based. </p>

<p> At this point, the United States had been fighting its War on
Drugs for twenty years. Despite the billions spent, the millions
imprisoned, and the loss of liberties to both drug user and
non-user alike, drugs were cheaper, more potent, and used by
younger children than when Nixon started the War. The drug
cartels were wealthier and more sophisticated than ever. The
number of cocaine dependents had grown. Drug violence, unheard of
at the start of the Drug War, now terrorized poor neighborhoods.
Drug combatants died daily; just the number of slain innocent
bystanders had tripled in the two years prior to Bush's
inauguration. Rather than evaluate the efficacy of the War on
Drugs and the wisdom of pursuing it, Bennett and his men merely
shuffled the deck one more time. </p>

<p> Under Nixon, heroin was the big bad drug. Halfway through
Carter's reign, marijuana nudged it aside. As the public's
passion to fight marijuana waned, cocaine was thrust forward to
draw fire. Then crack. The Drug War front shifted endlessly too,
from the border to the streets to Bolivia to the money-laundering
banks to the suburbs and back to the border again. </p>

<p> Now it was the Bennettistas' turn, and they achieved the most
radical recasting of the country's &quot;drug problem&quot; yet:
Drugs would no longer be discussed as a health problem. </p>

<p> The physical dangers of illegal drugs had always been the
Drug War's causa belli. Even the &quot;zero tolerance&quot;
policy of the late Reagan years was couched in the rhetoric of
&quot;instantaneous addiction&quot; and &quot;the poisoning of
our children&quot;: health terminology. </p>

<p> That had to stop. Because if the drug issue was going to
serve the Bennettistas' decade-long crusade to police the
nation's character, drug abuse needed to be placed in the same
category as offensive art, multicultural teaching, and ethical
relativism: a matter of morality. </p>

<p> &quot;The simple fact is that drug use is wrong,&quot;
Bennett decreed. &quot;And the moral argument, in the end, is the
most compelling argument.&quot; Terence Pell, Bennett's personal
lawyer from Education and now the drug office's chief counsel,
put it this way: &quot;We have to believe. If you think drugs are
bad, that they make people bad neighbors, horrible parents,
dangerous drivers and what have you, then you think drugs are
bad. There's a moral dimension.&quot; </p>

<p> If drugs are a health problem then addicts are
&quot;sick,&quot; and that cast them in a sympathetic light the
Bennettistas felt addicts didn't deserve. The decision to take
drugs that first time, after all, is voluntary. Walters directly
attacked the old approach. &quot;The health people say 'no
stigma,'&quot; he would say, &quot;and I'm for stigma.&quot; </p>

<p> The medical model of drug abuse was to Bennett's men a
philosophic and practical morass. If you base prohibition on
drugs' health effects, what do you say to the millions of
occasional users who convincingly claim to be uninjured by the
drugs they took? If you acknowledge that heavy drug users are
sick, you create an expectation that the government will treat
them. </p>

<p> The biggest problem with basing a prohibitive drug policy on
the health risks, though, was the invitation to comparisons. The
year the chain-smoking Bennett became drug czar, tobacco killed
some 395,000 Americans -- more than died in both world wars.
Alcohol directly killed 23,000 and another 22,400 on the
highways. The Natural Resources Defense Council in March
published a report, widely praised by medical authorities,
estimating that as many as 5,500 Americans would develop cancer
from the pesticides they ate during their preschool years. The
incidence of breast cancer in American women had more than
doubled since World War II, owing largely to dioxin and other
pollutants. Cocaine, on the other hand, killed 3,308 people that
year, slightly less than died from anterior horn cell disease.
Heroin and other opiates killed 2,743. And no death from
marijuana has ever been recorded. </p>

<p> Drugs damage without killing, of course, but even here other
preventable health problems put illegal drugs in deep shade. The
General Accounting Office, Congress's non-partisan investigative
agency, estimated that some 350,000 people were using cocaine
daily in 1989. While that's a big number, 15 times that many
children were going to bed hungry at least once a month that
year, 50 times that many Americans were sleeping on the streets,
and 100 times that many had no health insurance. </p>

<p> Discussing drugs as a moral problem obviated such
comparisons. If the case could be made that drug use is simply
wrong, then it wouldn't matter that some people use drugs safely,
that alcohol and tobacco kill more people than reefer and smack,
that more American than European children know hunger. </p>

<p> The Bennettistas worked hard to address the inconsistencies
of their approach. Their most glaring problem was the new drug
czar himself. By any medical definition, Bennett was a drug
addict, so dependent on nicotine after giving up the drug in its
smokable form that he now carried everywhere a pack of nicotine
chewing gum and was up to 40 milligrams of nicotine a day --
about as much as in two packs of cigarettes. </p>

<p> Alcohol was another problem. Bennett's drug office had no
Congressional mandate to address it, his mainstream constituency
enjoyed it, and the alcohol industry's mulitmillion-dollar lobby
wouldn't stand for further restrictions on booze. So the drug
office needed somehow to place alcohol on the &quot;moral&quot;
side of the line. No small trick. Aside from the cirrhosis and
highway deaths, booze was implicated in violent crime to a much
greater degree than any illegal drug. The Justice Department
found that half of those convicted of homicide in 1989 were using
alcohol at the time of the killing, while fewer than six percent
said they were on drugs alone. </p>

<p> Bennett's men tiptoed through the minefield of alcohol and
tobacco. John Walters took the position that marijuana, cocaine,
and heroin, &quot;enslave people&quot; and &quot;prevent them
from being free citizens&quot; in a way that alcohol and tobacco
do not. Bruce Carnes decided that drug taking was
&quot;life-denying,&quot; and &quot;inward,&quot; but that
alcohol and tobacco were not. Illegal drugs, Bennett said in a
speech that May, &quot;obliterate morals, value, character, our
relations with each other and our relation to God.&quot; None of
these conclusions was based on science, but collectively they had
the effect of royal fiat. </p>

<p> The Bennettistas also relied on a neat bit of tautology:
marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are immoral because they are
illegal. Why are they illegal? Because they are immoral.
Compliance, not health, was the real issue. &quot;Now that the
government has spoken to the subject that drugs are
unlawful,&quot; said Paul McNulty, a Bennettista soul-mate
directing communications at the Justice Department, &quot;a
person who disobeys the law has made a moral choice and should be
dealt with appropriately.&quot; Bennett freely admitted drug
enforcement was but an instrument of a wider agenda, calling for
&quot;the reconstitution of legal and social authority through
the imposition of appropriate consequences for drug dealing and
drug use.&quot; &quot;The drug crisis,&quot; he told the
Washington Hebrew congregation, &quot;is a crisis of authority,
in every sense of the term, 'authority.&quot; </p>

<p> Consequently, &quot;a massive wave of arrests is a top
priority for the War on Drugs,&quot; Bennett announced.
Washington, D.C. had arrested 45,000 of its citizens for drugs in
the two years prior to Bennett's appointment, &quot;without
making an appreciable dent in either the drug trade or the murder
rate,&quot; Newsweek noted. But Bennett wanted more of the same.
On the day he was sworn in, he declared the city a &quot;high
intensity drug trafficking area&quot; and unveiled a massive plan
to fight drugs in the nation's capital. More than eighty federal
agents would bolster the city's drug squad. A curfew would sweep
the streets of minors after 11 p.m. A judge ruled the curfew
unconstitutional, but the mood was infectious. Some members of
Congress suggested declaring de facto martial law -- placing the
D.C. police under federal control and sending in the Army and
National Guard. Of the $100 million Bennett wanted spent in D.C.,
95 percent was for law enforcement. Of that, more than half would
go to a new prison, and until that could be built, Bennett
proposed converting abandoned military buildings into makeshift
drug prisons. As for the purpose of all this new incarceration,
Bennett was characteristically blunt: &quot;I'm not a person who
says that the first purpose of punishment is
rehabilitation,&quot; he told Congress. &quot;The first purpose
is moral, to exact a price for transgressing the rights of
others.&quot; </p>

<h2>Elvis Presley</h2>

<p> The year ended on an odd note for the War on Drugs. Four days
before Christmas 1971, Egil Krogh's phone rang. It was Dwight
Chapin, from Bob Haldeman's staff. </p>

<p> &quot;The King is here,&quot; Chapin said. </p>

<p> &quot;King who?&quot; Krogh asked. &quot;No kings on the
president's schedule today.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Not just any two-bit king,&quot; Chapin answered.
&quot;The King. Elvis. The King of Rock.&quot; </p>

<p> Elvis Presley had appeared that morning at the Northwest Gate
of the White House and handed the guard a nearly illegible
six-page letter on American Airlines stationery. He was an
admirer of the president, Presley wrote, and he wanted to help
spread Nixon's anti-drug message. He was well positioned, too:.
&quot;The drug culture, the hippie elements, the SDS, Black
Panthers, etc. do not consider me as their enemy or as they call
it The Establishment.&quot; To dispel any doubts as to his own
loyalty, Presley added in bold underline, &quot;I call it America
and I love it!&quot; </p>

<p> Then Presley made his pitch. &quot;I can and will do more
good if I were made a Federal Agent at Large. . . . All I need is
the Federal credentials.&quot; </p>

<p> Presley was registered at a nearby hotel under the name Jon
Burrows. &quot;I will be here for as long as it takes to get the
credentials of a Federal Agent,&quot; Presley wrote. &quot;I have
done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing
techniques and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where
I can and will do the most good.&quot; </p>

<p> Though he didn't mention it in the note to Nixon, Presley was
a collector of police badges. And he was a dopehound of legendary
excess. But in the squareball Nixon White House, Presley found
perhaps the only people in the United States who didn't know
that. Krogh certainly didn't. He took the letter at face value. </p>

<p> At 12:30, the King was relieved of his present for the chief
executive - a nickel-plated .45 automatic, complete with
ammunition -- and ushered into the office of the president. </p>

<p> Nixon was dressed like Nixon: blue suit, white shirt, tie.
Elvis was dressed like Elvis: black velvet jacket, chest hair,
gold medallions, sunglasses and a belt buckle big as a dinner
plate. He pulled up a sleeve to exhibit cufflinks the size of
hamsters. As Nixon bent close to examine them, Elvis launched
into a tirade against the Beatles, who he accused of being
anti-American. </p>

<p> &quot;You know,&quot; Nixon said. &quot;Those who use the
drugs are the protesters. You know, the ones who get caught up in
dissent and violence. They're the same group of young
people.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Mr. President,&quot; Elvis said, &quot;I'm on your
side. I want to be helpful. And I want to help get people to
respect the flag because that's getting lost.&quot; </p>

<p> Then Elvis got to the point. &quot;Mr. President, can you get
me a badge from the Narcotics Bureau?&quot; </p>

<p> Krogh was afraid of this. He'd already called the number-two
man at BNDD who earlier that day had thrown Elvis out. Elvis had
gone there before stopping at the Northwest gate, and offered a
$5,000 &quot;donation&quot; to BNDD in return for a badge. </p>

<p> Nixon, not knowing any of that, looked uncertainly at Krogh.
&quot;Bud, can we get him a badge?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;If you want to give him a badge, I think we can get him
one.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;I'd like to do that. See that he gets one.&quot; </p>

<p> Elvis then did something nobody had ever done in the Nixon
Oval Office; he gathered the president up in his arms and gave
him a big bear hug. The staff was stunned; the photographer
didn't even get a picture. Nixon endured it stiffly, handed out
presidential tie clasps, and dismissed the King with a hearty pat
on the shoulder. </p>

<p> And so it came to pass that on the day Elvis Presley died of
a drug overdose in 1977, he was a credentialed Special Assistant
in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. </p>

        were the first real miracle drugs because they allowed
        the patient to be anesthetized while the doctor performed
        surgery. Before the advent of opiates, the most common
        surgery was a simple amputation. That is, the doctor got
        several big strong people to hold the patient down and
        then literally sawed off an arm or a leg while the
        patient screamed in pain. For this reason, a good doctor
        was a fast doctor. Battlefield hospitals during the Civil
        War commonly had large piles of severed arms and legs.

<p align="center"><b><u>SOLDIER'S DISEASE AND ADDICTION IN THE
CIVIL WAR <br>
</u></b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Abstract<br>
</b></p>

<p>Soldier's Disease -- widespread addiction following massive
administration of opiates during the Civil War -- is the earliest
and most often repeated example of a drug problem before the
narcotics laws. The story exemplifies several basic themes used
in support of continued drug prohibition -- addiction is easy to
acquire, hard to kick, and is a publicly noticed, i.e. <i>asocial,
</i>problem. Soldier's Disease, though, is a myth. Not one case
of addiction was reported in medical records or the literature of
the time; under ten references were made in the Nineteenth
Century to addiction the cause of which was the Civil War; and no
perjorative nickname for addicted veterans, like Soldier's
Disease, appeared in the literature until 1 9 15, and it did not
become part of the Conventional Wisdom of drug experts until
almost a century after Appomattox. </p>

<p align="center"><b>THE MYTHICAL ROOTS OF U.S. DRUG POLICY:</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>SOLDIER'S DISEASE AND ADDICTS IN THE CIVIL
WAR<br>
</b></p>

<p><b>myth ... 1: </b>a usu. traditional story of ostensibly
historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of
a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomena ... <b>3
... b: </b>an ill-founded belief held uncritically esp. by an
interested group.<br>
</p>

<p>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1973<br>
</p>

<p>The earliest (and often the only) example of opiate addiction
as a social problem which is frequently cited by drug experts is <b>Soldier's
Disease -- </b>widespread addiction resulting from widespread
opiate use in the Civil War. Most writers who report Soldier's
Disease devote no more than three sentences to it. It is the
brevity, clarity, &quot;catchiness,&quot; and conceptual
implication of &quot;Soldier's Disease&quot; which accounts for
the contemporary significance of such a fleeting reference.
Possibly the lengthiest and most graphic description of opiate
use in the Civil War, resulting in massive addiction among
veterans, was provided by Gerald Starkey, a century after that
war: </p>

<p><i>In 1862 (sic) the Civil War broke out.... They would charge
each other, literally pound chains down cannons and fire point
blank at the enemy and these young men were presented to their
field surgeons with terrible shrapnel wounds ... along with
terrible pain.</i> </p>

<p><i>About all the field surgeon could do was use the two new
invented tools that had been presented to him in the previous
five or six years I the hypodermic needle and syringe, along with
Morphine Sulfate .... They injected the young wounded veterans
with huge amounts of Morphine daily (every four hours) to kill
their pain.... It was necessary for the surgeons to do
full-quarter amputations -- literally take the arms and legs off
right at the start of the body, usually to stop infectious
gangrene.</i> </p>

<p><i>In 1865 there were an estimated 400,000 young War veterans
addicted to Morphine.... The returning veteran could be. .
identified because he had a leather thong around his neck and a
leather bag (with) Morphine Sulfate tablets, along with a syringe
and a needle issued to the soldier on his discharge.... (T)his
was called the &quot;Soldier's Disease.&quot;</i> </p>

<p>(Starkey, 1971:482-84)1 </p>

<p>The lesson to be learned from &quot;Soldier's Disease&quot;
involves four linked hypotheses, phrased as fact, which form a
paradigm justifying today's U.S. Drug policy. This paradigm is:<br>
</p>

<p>Free access to opiates sooner or later breeds a massive use of
opiates. </p>

<p>Widespread use of opiates leads to a lot of addicts. </p>

<p>Addiction is long-term, often enough, forever. </p>

<p>Addiction is a publicly manifest problem.<br>
</p>

<p>In sum, free availability leads to a social problem.<br>
</p>

<p>The historical record shows, however, that Soldier's Disease
is a fanciful reconstruction of the past by writers I 00 years or
more after the Civil War. There was not, to my knowledge, a
single mention of Soldier's Disease, Army Disease, or any other
sobriquet referring to addicted veterans, until a half -century
after the Civil War; not one addict was noted in any writing or
statistic compiled during or immediately after the Civil War; and
reports of addicted veterans who began using during that War are
only rarely mentioned throughout the rest of the 19th Century.<br>
</p>

<p>Soldier's Disease is a modern creation that has very little to
do with the facts of 19th Century drug use. Rather, it is an idea
which fits, which shores up, modern drug policies. It is an
assertion about what opiates are supposed to do, applied to a
past situation. <br>
</p>

<p>In the next part -- Section I -- of this paper, the relevance
of Soldier's Disease to contemporary drug policy is addressed.
Soldier's Disease is the only tale of a pre-Harrison Act opiate
problem which a self-respecting scholar in recent years could
point to as a pre-1914 social problem due to opiates. In Section
2, the modern creation of Soldier's Disease, and its recent
popularity among drug experts, is shown by noting the first who
mention the concept and when, a generation or two later, it
became accepted by scholars of all persuasions. Then the focus
turns to the historical evidence which would test, in order, the
four steps in the above paradigm. In Section 3 the questions are:
&quot;were opiates widely used by soldiers during the Civil
War?&quot; and &quot;was addiction among them widespread <i>during
</i>the war?&quot; In Section 4 the questions are: &quot;was
there wide-scale addiction among veterans <i>after </i>the
war?&quot; and &quot;was this a publicly manifest problem?&quot;
What follows is the evidence for answering these four questions:
in order, &quot; a tentative yes...... no,&quot; &quot;no,&quot;
and &quot;no.&quot; The conclusions will expand further on how
the mythic and the actual situation of Civil War opiate use
relates to the current Drug policy debate. </p>

<p align="center">1. <b><u>The Relevance of Soldier's Disease</u></b>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>To Contemporary U.S. Drug Policy</u></b> </p>

<p>The paradigm justifying U.S. opiate policy -- availability
leads to use; use leads to addiction; addiction is long-term; and
addiction becomes a publicly manifest problem -- conveys the idea
that unavoidable <b>Social </b><i>consequences </i>of free access
to opiates justify the enormous costs of contemporary U.S. drug
policy. Of all the stories about the &quot;bad old days&quot;
when opiates were legal, only Soldier's Disease provides
convincing </p>

<p>I. evidence&quot; that opiate availability led to a publicly
manifest problem, beyond merely a substantial increase in the
numbers of addicts. Thus, only the tale of Soldier's Disease
demonstrates Step 4 of the paradigm. The very phrase
&quot;Soldier's Disease&quot; connotes a publicly manifest
problem. Otherwise, the tales told about opiates before the laws
banning them were either too far-fetched to be repeated in modern
times, or reflect a social problem only if you believe the
paradigm, (and often not even then). During and just before 1914,
the type of stories carried by the press about opiates did not
indicate a social problem which might lead to a need for
prohibition, and the absence of media coverage of the Harrison
Act during the year it was passed by Congress further suggests
the irrelevance of opiate use to a social problem. </p>

<p>There were, in the medical as well as the mass media of the
late 19th and early 20th Centuries, occasional alarms sounded
about other publicly manifest opiate problems, but no scholar in
recent years believes that these were real or significant. (For
example, the press periodically reported an opium problem,
particularly white women smoking opium in Chinatown, with Chinese
men. A racist, not an opiate problem). Even the moralistic
anti-opium writers of about a century ago, with rare and often
unbelievable exceptions, did not point to a publicly noticed
problem.2<br>
</p>

<p>Today, there are <i>imputed </i>social problems, but not a <i>demonstrated
</i>one, beyond Soldier's Disease. Historians David Musto and
David Courtwright (Musto, 1972:2-4; and Courtwright, 1982:16-28)
extend a tradition3 of research into the megatonnage of opiates
annually imported into the U.S. from well before the Civil War
through the early 20th Century. Additionally, opiates were
typically a key ingredient in patent medicines, and there was a
huge national campaign against them resulting in the Pure Food
and Drug Act. Neither the level of imports nor the widespread use
of opiates in patent medicines, in the absence of belief in a
paradigm such as we noted, suggest anything beyond widespread
availability. <br>
</p>

<p>The medical literature of the 19th Century is filled with
discussions about opiates, many written by experts who believed
its use was terrible. To them, a loss of &quot;moral will,&quot;
perhaps best exemplified by secretiveness, including husbands and
wives keeping large scale addictions hidden from their spouses
for many years,4 was a major problem. Addicts were deemed liars,
which was only natural given the opprobrium attached to addiction
in much of U.S. society long before there were drug laws.<b> </b>The
medical and pharmaceutical literature also had an on-going
contest, essentially, to report the oldest, most long-time,
addict with the largest habit. None of the above indicates that
the behavior of 19th or early 20th Century addicts was a publicly
evident problem. </p>

<p>In the years just before national drug prohibition, there was
barely a sign of an opiate-caused social problem, Two newspapers,
to my knowledge, were indexed for 1906-1912 -- the New York Times
and the San Francisco Call.5 In each, there were three basic
types of stories: recent state laws<u> </u>which were forerunners
of the Harrison Act in that they criminalized opiate use; arrests
(over half being of Chinese Americans); and international
stories. Opiates are assumed to be &quot;evil&quot; but the only
allusion to a possible social consequence in any Times story is
headlined &quot;Says Opium Aids Music Composers.-6 The only
public problem with opiates recounted in the Call, besides white
women in Chinese opiate dens7 and problems which result from the
local laws, is lethargy among the troops at The Presidio.
(&quot;It destroys the vitality of the user, and would in time
make the soldier a useless charge.&quot;) (S.F. Call, 1910b) 8 </p>

<p>The year the nation's major opiate prohibition law was passed,
the mass media, (at least the New York Times, San Francisco
Chronicle, Washington Post, and the Hearst Press), gave virtually
no coverage to Congressional discussion or passage of the
Harrison Act, or when it was signed into law or took effect.
(Aldrich, 1979) Fourteen months after it was signed, a medical
journal presented the results of a one-question survey -&quot;In
your opinion what are the five most useful and important drugs in
the materia medica?&quot; -- answered by teachers at leading
medical schools. &quot;Not only did it (opium) receive 102 votes
out of 107, but in 60 instances it was named first.&quot;
(Robinson, 1916) </p>

<p>What the above suggests is not only that the rationales to
justify opiate prohibition circa 1914 could not be repeated by
self-respecting <i>scholars </i>as rationales for continued
prohibition today, but that hardly a rationale was offered at
all. The Harrison Act crept in on tip-toes, called a tax act,
with no fanfare, no public interest or debate. When, a few years
later, it became clear that this was a criminal law with
considerable consequences, there was a brief flurry of criticism
and a rationale provided for continuing opiate prohibition,
namely the vileness and criminality of &quot;junkies&quot; and
the criminal cartels supplying them. Obviously, the consequences
of the law provided the rationale for justifying the law, but
there were not that many opiate addicts and it was not that big a
social problem for the debate to continue. </p>

<p>&quot;Evidence&quot; of a social problem is needed to justify
opiate prohibition only when such prohibition is a significant
social issue (which it was not in the years preceding the
Harrison Act) and when criticism of drug laws crescendoes. Only
then do scholars reconsider the rationales for the drug laws, and
turn to the historical record for insights into contemporary
concerns. It is only in these periods when the four parts of the
paradigm, enunciated above, have to be demonstrated if
contemporary drug policy is to be accepted. It is the final step
-- the manifestation of a problem, in public -- which makes the
other three socially significant. The only currently cited
example of the complete paradigm, in the absence of opiate
prohibition, is Soldier's Disease ... and it's a myth.<br>
<br>

<p><b>2. </b><u>Tracking The Develogment of The MM<br>
</u></p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>It's Roots</u> </p>

<p>The earliest portrayal of Soldier's Disease among Civil War
veterans appeared as World War I erupted over Europe (also the
year the Harrison Act, took effect). In &quot;The Curse of
Narcotism in America -- A Reveille,&quot; Marks, a Yale
professor, intended to alert the U.S. to an enormous addiction
problem among Civil War veterans that would be replicated in
another war: </p>

<p>Did you know that there is practically no old American family
of Civil War reputation which has not had its addicts?.... (I)t
was the &quot;army disease&quot; because of its prevalence?....
(W)ith the war that hangs over us, the drug evil will spread into
a giantism of even more terrible growth than the present?....
(T)here are something like 4,000,000 victims of opium and cocaine
in this country today? </p>

<p>(Marks, 1915:315)9 </p>

<p>Marks feared the return of the &quot;hydra-headed
drug-curse&quot; of the Civil War, but others writing during
World War I about the consequences of combat upon drug use among
servicemen made no reference to the War Between the States.
(Crothers, 1916; N.Y. Times, 1917; Stanley, 1918; and Weber,
1918)<br>
</p>

<p>In the nine years after World War I, a handful of authors
mentioned Civil War-related addiction, though none mentioned Army
Disease or any such synonym. (Bishop, 1919 and 1920; Illinois
Medical journal, 192 1; World's Work, 1924; and Fell, 1924).<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Army Disease&quot; was next noted in <u>The Opium
Problem</u>. Terry and Pellens' encyclopedic work of 1928, which
became &quot;regarded as the single most comprehensive work in
the field&quot; only several decades later.10 (Ball, 1970) For
Terry and Pellens, &quot;the Civil War gave it (chronic opium
intoxication) a considerable impetus (which) seems definitely
established.&quot; (Terry and Pellens, 1928: 5) Between 1928 and
the late 1950's, only a handful of scholars noted &quot;Army
Disease&quot; (Terry, 193 1; Woods, 193 1: Dai, 1937: Barnes,
1939; and Lindesmith, 1947), and even in the early 1960's it was
infrequently mentioned (Isbell, 1960 and 1963; Kolb, 1960 and
1962; Clausen, 196 1; Maurer and Vogel, 1962; and Sonnedecker,
1963), though prior to the drug explosion of the mid- 1960's
there were few scholars in the drug field. For the experts who
the past quarter century have claimed Soldier's Disease, if they
cite any reference it is typically Terry and Pellens. </p>

<p><b>B. </b><u>The Contemporary Conventional Wisdom<br>
</u></p>

<p>Since 1964, Soldier's Disease, in essence, was mentioned in
about 100 works by drug experts, half of these since 1973.11 It
was also mentioned in several studies by prestigious government
agencies and Drug and Crime Commissions.12 Among the experts are
many renowned critics of U.S. drug policies -- including Edward
Brecher, Alan Dershowitz, John Kaplan, Arnold Trebach and Norman
Zinberg. In the early 1970's a few writers questioned the
factuality of Soldier's (Kramer, 1971 and 1972; Swatos, 1972;
Musto, 1973; and Quinones, 1975), but shortly thereafter they
were rebutted in a detailed historical analysis. (Courtwright,
1978 and 1982)13 Since the mid- 1970's the mention of Soldier's
Disease has diminished, maybe because the critics had an impact
or because most experts stopped probing the roots of U.S. drug
policy after the early 1970's. <br>
</p>

<p>Soldiers Disease is, however, still mentioned by many experts
... and no one, yet, has responded to Courtwright. </p>

<p>Though briefly stated, a consistent theme involving three
components is reiterated by almost all the cited drug experts,
the only variation being in the synonyms used. First, morphine in
particular, and opiates in general, were administered by naive
doctors &quot;indiscriminately&quot; (also termed &quot;
promiscuous&quot;, &quot;imprudent&quot;,
&quot;uncontrolled&quot;, &quot;overdosage&quot;,
&quot;ignorant&quot;, etc.). Second, as a consequence of such
medical naivete, addiction among soldiers was massive (also
termed &quot;prevalent&quot;, &quot;commonplace&quot;,
&quot;thousands&quot;, wholesale usage&quot;,
&quot;rampant&quot;, etc.). Third, so widespread was the
addiction among soldiers and veterans that it became known as
Soldier's Disease (also termed &quot;army disease&quot;,
&quot;soldier's illness&quot;, or &quot;soldier's
sickness.&quot;),14 </p>

<p>The only clear disagreement is the few who estimate the number
of addicted Civil War veterans. Some claim 45,000 (Ashley, 1972
and 1978; Geis, 1973; Health PAC, 1970; and Kenny, 1972); others
400,000. (H. Jones and Jones, 1977; Lingeman, 1969; Schwartz,
1980; Starkey, 197 1; Summers et. al., 1975; and Westin and
Shaffer, 1972) Since no writer in either camp provides one clue
for their claim, the possibility that both estimates arose out of
the thin air circa 1970 is not ruled out. </p>

<p>Is today's conventional wisdom about Soldier's Disease an
intellectual version of the children's game of Telephone where a
simple message, after innumerable repetitions, becomes distorted
and a new &quot;catchy&quot; message takes on a life of its own
... or have recent writers captured the essence of opiate
addiction in a past era? That depends on the evidence during and
just after the Civil War.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. </b><u>Opiate Use and Addiction During The Civil War<br>
</u></p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>The Need For and Use Of Opiates</u> </p>

<p>During the Civil War, and at least until 1914, opiates were
considered the best medicine for controlling dysentery and
diarrhea and for containing the pain from war wounds. The Surgeon
General's history of the just ended Civil War was often lavish in
its praise of opium. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Opium -- </i>this medicine merits first place among
these remedies. It was used almost universally in all cases of
severe wounds, and was particularly useful in penetrating wounds
of the chest, in quieting the nervous system and, indirectly in
moderating hemmorhage. </p>

<p>(US Surgeon General, 1870 :645) </p>

<p>But, how great was the need? How widely was it used? Given the
need, and the use, of opiates then, how many soldier addicts were
there in the Civil War?<br>
</p>

<p>Official records from the Civil War show more incidents of
severe <u>illness</u> for which opiates were the main remedy than
there were <u>wounds</u>. More died from disease than were killed
in battle or succumbed to wounds (For Union troops, 62%
&quot;disease,&quot; 19% &quot;battle,&quot; and 12%
&quot;Wounds&quot; of 360,000 deaths among Union troops).
(Duncan, 1912:397) Union medical records (for medical problems,
not deaths) show approximately 1,400,000 acute and 200,000
chronic cases of diarrhea or dysentery, 250,000 wounds, and
300,000 cases, combined, of typhoid, typhus, continued fever,
venereal disease, scurvy, delerium tremens, insanity and
paralysis. (Brooks, 1966:127) There were 30,000 amputations
reported performed by the Union's doctors. (US Surgeon General,
1883) Among Confederate prisoners, 32% of the almost 19,000 who
died in captivity in the north succumbed to diarrhea or
dysentery. (Brooks, 1966:126) In Andersonville prison from
February 1864 to April 1865, of 12,541 recorded Union soldier
captives who died, 45% did so from diarrhea or dysentery, and
only 7% from wounds, gangrene or &quot;debility.&quot; (US
Surgeon General, 1879:32) There was obviously a great <u>need</u>
for opiates. </p>

<p>Civil War physicians frequently dispensed opiates. The
Secretary of War just after 1865 stated the Union Army was issued
10 million opium pills, over 2,840,000 ounces of other opiate
preparations (such as laudunum or paregoric which, by weight,
were well under half opium), and almost 30,000 ounces of morphine
sulphate. (Courtwright, 1978:106-7 and 1982) <br>
</p>

<p><b>B. </b><u>Not One Report of Addiction In The Field<br>
</u></p>

<p>Yet for all the quantities dispensed, <i><u>there was not one
report from 1861-1865 of an addicted soldier.</u></i> </p>

<p>Could opiate addiction pass unnoticed, and have no
consequences, among troops living in raw conditions and often
moving from one place to another? Could so much morphine and
opium preparations get used without generating a single addict?<br>
</p>

<p>The 30,000 ounces of morphine is most easily explained.
Probably, most of it was <b><i>dusted </i></b>or <b><i>rubbed </i></b>into
wounds or, during anesthetization, <b><i>rubbed </i></b>into raw
tissue. (Adams, 1952; and Brooks, 1966) In the campaign of
Fredericksburg in December of 1862, &quot;hypodermic syringes
were unknown, such drugs as morphine being doled out on the point
of a knife&quot; by surgeons. (Duncan, 1985: 200) By the end of
the war, the hypodermic needle was beginning to be used, in
places -- &quot;roughly 19 per cent of Union Army physicians were
capable of administering morphine hypodermically.... and even
fewer Confederate physicians were (so) capable.&quot;
(Courtwright, 1978:105) Whether the hypodermic administration of
morphine during the Civil War was extremely rare as some have
claimed (US Surgeon General, 1888:547) or as others have implied
by their failure to note such use in medical histories of the war
(Courtwright, 1978:104-105), or was frequent as one neurologist
noted (Courtwright, 1978:106), there is not one case mentioned
where morphine was injected for pleasure, or to stave off
withdrawal pains. </p>

<p>The Civil War lasted four years, with 1,500,000 three year
enlistments on the Union side. Thus, those ten million opium
pills dispensed by Union doctors average roughly two per soldier
per year (assuming the pills survived combat conditions). Prior
to amputations or other battlefield surgery, the patient
routinely expected and was routinely given one of these pills.
Similarly, the 2,84 1,000 ounces of opiate preparations works out
to about a half -ounce per Union soldier per year. Though
physicians argued about the benefits of opiates for the relief of
pain which accompanied &quot;the fluxes&quot; (diarrhea and
dysentery), &quot;the partisans of opium were very much in the
majority&quot; and used opium for dysentery and other forms of
flux including &quot;chronic fluxes.&quot; Army physicians
&quot;united opium with almost every medicine employed to check
the progress of the disease,&quot; and despite typical failure to
cure returned &quot;almost always to opium as the drug which at
least alleviated, if it did not cure.&quot; Where the sufferings
of the patient were very great and continuous, and where
sleeplessness and restlessness had become a medical danger,
opiates were highly recommended, even by the otherwise skeptical
physician. (US Surgeon General, 1879: 743-747) Again, applying
basic arithmetic, and taking into account that there were many
more than the <i>reported </i>1.6 million cases of dysentery and
diarrhea, it is easy to understand why there were periodic
shortages of opiates. As with morphine, there is not a single
report during the Civil War of a soldier rising opium for
pleasure, and the single claim of opiates used to stave off
withdrawal pains (published 16 years after the War) was the
&quot;confession&quot; of an officer charged with &quot;deserting
in the face of the enemy, and sentenced to be shot.&quot;15
(Nolan, 1881) </p>

<p>Though modern writers have accused the military doctors in the
Civil War of not fully appreciating the addictive qualities of
opiates, one historian of Civil War medicine writes that
physicians in the field did not fully appreciate the benefits of
opium.<br>
</p>

<p>Tincture of opium and paregoric were always available, but
nowhere in the records does one get the impression that they were
used routinely in the management of the fluxes. </p>

<p align="center">(Brooks, 1966:117) <br>
</p>

<p>Morphine, too, may well have been underused, to judge from a
leading, albeit unusual, neurologist at the time, S. Weir
Mitchell, who: </p>

<p>(S)colded the medical profession for its reluctance in using
this mighty painkiller, pointing out that some patients' agonies
were so severe the choice must lie between Morphine and
amputation. </p>

<p>(Adams, 1952:138)<br>
</p>

<p>The naivete of military physicians regarding the negative
effects of opiates, often noted shortly after the Civil War, had
to do basically with their misunderstanding the medical effects
of opiates, not the addictive properties of the drug.16 (US
Surgeon General, 1879:735-750) </p>

<p>There were no reports of addiction in situations which, a
century or so later, generated numerous such references. For the
Civil War, one virtually never reads of a soldier suffering
withdrawal pains, or dying of an OD; or a physician in the field
besieged for an opiate for feeding a habit (as distinct from
easing pain or controlling diarrhea). In Wait Whitman's
description of the 80,000 to 100,000 sick and wounded he saw in
600 hospital visits during three years of the Civil War, he notes
that many patients craved tobacco, sweets, or alcohol, yet he
never once mentions opium. (Whitman, 1895) The sickness form
submitted by physicians to the Surgeon General from mid- 1 862 to
the end of the war listed 152 categories of disease, including
&quot;serpent bite,&quot; &quot;apoplexy,&quot;
&quot;insanity,&quot; &quot;night blindness,&quot;
&quot;poisoning,&quot; &quot;inebriation,&quot; &quot;delirium
tremens&quot; and &quot;chronic alcoholism&quot;, but not
addiction or opiate deprivation. (US Surgeon General, Pt. 1, V.
1). In the Surgeon General's history of the Civil War,
&quot;nostalgia ... .army itch .... poisoning .... alcoholism
.... and venereal disease,&quot; but not opiate use, are singled
out for special comment. Under &quot;nostalgia&quot; the problem
of boredom is given prominence and smoking tobacco, drinking
alcohol, and gambling are singled out for their &quot;sedative
influence,&quot; to &quot;pass the dull hours&quot; in lieu of
satisfying the craving for excitement. (US Surgeon General, 1888:
886) In sum, there is no hard evidence of addicts during the
Civil War, and it is hard to believe it would have been missed
had addiction been significant.<br>
</p>

<p><u>C. Not One Report of Addiction Immediately After The Civil
War</u> </p>

<p>If addiction among Civil War veterans was significant, it
should have been most noticed in the immediate post-War years.
There were 63,000 soldiers whose chronic diarrhea carried on
after the war, (Adams, 1889) and over 20,000 survivors of
amputations reported by Union doctors. (US Surgeon General, 1883)
When the Civil War ended, and veterans filled the prisons, New
York State prison keepers at Auburn and Sing-Sing told of
contraband smuggled into prisons, such as &quot;whiskey,
tobacco... yellow covered literature.... sugar, tea, coffee,
butter, pies, cakes, liquor, looking glasses, combs, brushes,
etc.&quot;, yet opiates were not mentioned. (North American
Review, 1867:572-74) In the Mississippi State Hospital, whose
admission records of the mentally ill go back to 1855, the first
narcotism case was recorded in 1884. (Jaquith, 1965) The edition
of the United States Dispensatory, (the enormous physician's desk
reference of the time), which appeared just after the Civil War
devotes 27 pages to &quot;opium&quot; without noting the Civil
War. (Wood and Bache, 1868) Surely a significant minority of
those 63,000 diarrhetics and 30,000 amputees were advised to take
opiates by their physicians, and willingly took what at the time
was the best relief of their problems. Yet only two references to
veterans who began using opiates during the Civil War were
published before 1880. (Day, 1868; and Oliver, 1872) (A third
pre-1880 case-history of an addicted veteran, cited by some as
demonstrating Soldier's Disease, started using opiates after the
war). (Anon, 1876) </p>

<p><b>D. </b><u>The Logic For Claiming The Existence of Many
Civil War Addicts</u> </p>

<p>How, then, could recent experts agree on massive addiction
during the Civil War? Almost certainly it has to do with trust in
the statements of Terry and Pellens without bothering to check
the original sources. The one exception -- the one historian who
has checked those sources and maintains the validity of addiction
during the Civil War -- is Courtwright, who believes that
addiction must exist ... even though it is not in evidence. For
morphine, Courtwright cites S. Weir Mitchell's claim that 40,000
morphine injections were given at one army hospital in one year.
This number is far beyond any other -- in fact, except for it
there would be no consideration of the <i>widespread </i>use of
morphine other than what was rubbed and dusted into wounds.
Courtwright considers the claim &quot;puzzling, to say the
least,&quot; (and there are reasons for doubting Weir,
personally),17 but he concludes if that number &quot;is even half
correct, it seems impossible that a substantial portion of the
patients ... did not end the war as addicts.&quot;
&quot;Impossible&quot; as it seems, not a single addict was
reported during the Civil War. </p>

<p>Courtwright also notes &quot;the frequency and casualness with
which opiates were administered&quot; and states that &quot;vast
quantities of opium preparations other than morphine were
dispensed under circumstances (such as to those with chronic
diarrhea, dysentery or malaria) which could very easily lead to
addiction.&quot; The only trouble is &quot;very easily&quot; did
not occur. </p>

<p>Disregarding the lack of documentation on a single addict
during the Civil War, Courtwright contends &quot;that the war
contributed to the spread of addiction,&quot; and <b><i>&quot;</i></b>offer<b><i>
</i></b>the fighting, sick and wounded veterans greatly expanded
the pool for iatrogenic addiction.&quot; (Courtwright,
1982:55-56, emphasis added) Since opiates were widely
administered in the early as well as last years of the Civil War,
<b>it </b>is hard to imagine why addiction would only develop
after the war. Nonetheless, accepting Courtwright's contention
for the moment, the test of the validity of Soldier's Disease
thus depends on analysis of post-war addiction among veterans.<br>

Century <br>
</u></p>

<p>Were it not for Horatio Day's <u>The Opium Habit</u>,
published in 1868, the modern day notion of Soldier's Disease
might never have developed. The latter of these two sentences by
Day (quoted by Terry and Pellens) is, by far, the most widely
cited writing on Soldier's Disease: </p>

<p><i>The events of the last few years [Civil War] have
unquestionably added greatly to their [confirmed opium eaters']
number. Maimed and shattered survivors from a hundred
battlefields, diseased and disabled soldiers released from
hostile prisons, anguished and hopeless wives and mothers made so
by the slaughter of those who were dearest to them, have found,
many of them, temporary relief from their sufferings in Opium.</i>
</p>

<p>(Day, 1868:1) </p>

<p>This remark, quoted by several modern writers,18 is the only
reference to the Civil War in Day's 335 page tome. Day recounts
many types of persons who were addicts, but not one specific case
of a soldier or veteran.19 in context, Day's two-sentence
allusion to the Civil War suggests an extremely minor problem
recounted by an encyclopedic problem-seeker.<br>
</p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>Courtwright's Evidence Is Skimpy<br>
</u></p>

<p>Courtwright recognizes that &quot;army disease&quot; was not
an &quot;epidemic,&quot; but still concludes: &quot;It is
possible to document numerous references to addicted veterans
both as a class and as individuals.&quot; (Courtwright, 1978:1 1
1) Using the same evidence, and more, I reach opposite
conclusions. Why? <br>
</p>

<p>In <u>Dark Paradise: Opiate Addiction In America Before 1940</u>,
Courtwright cites 1 18 books and articles published between the
Civil War and the end of the century (Courtwright, 1982) yet in
his studies of Soldier's Disease he lists nine references to
addicted veterans, and only five appeared in the 19th Century2O
and were to veterans who had used opiates during the Civil War.
Adding two more which I uncovered (Earle, 1880; Nolan, 188 1),
and including two other brief and vague references (Crothers,
1892 and 1893), this averages one reference every 4 years between
18651899. The overwhelming majority of articles about opiate use
written in the fifteen years following Appomatox, including
several by writers who presented lists of the types of people who
were addicts, do not single out the Civil War,21 nor can I find
such a reference in newspapers of the time.22 </p>

<p>None of these nine sources demonstrates that opiate addiction
by Civil War veterans was of social significance. In addition to
those previously quoted (Day and Nolan, who writes of the alibi
used by a deserter), there were three references by the most
prolific writers of the period, Mattison and Crothers (twice).23
Mattison's sole mention appears at the end of his career, 3 years
after the War ended. (Mattison, 1898) Crothers wrote
prolifically. If a &quot;drug problem&quot; could be unearthed,
trust Crothers to lead the digging party.24 In the context of his
encyclopedic writings, Crothers' few mentions of the Civil War
suggests its role in subsequent addiction was miniscule.
(Crothers, 1892 and 1893) Further, when World War I broke out in
Europe, Crothers urged combat physicians_to use opiates
liberally, and fears of a subsequent addiction problem were
groundless. (Crothers, 1916) Two other references are of tone
addicts, one -- of a long-time successful minister --
demonstrating the difficulty of detecting addiction at the time.
(Russell, 1887; and Keeley, 198 1) </p>

<p>B. <u>&quot;Only Your Pharmacist Knows For Sure&quot;<br>
</u></p>

<p>The two other references suggest that for a while, in some
places, there were some addicted veterans ... reported by those
who would notice addicts even if the general public did not
recognize them -- i.e. the apothecaries who sold opiates. Terry
and Pellens, reviewing an 1 878 study , noted that even
physicians did not recognize the extent of addiction: <br>
</p>

<p><i>Druggists were in a much better position to know the truth
.... when counter sales were legal, and as a matter of common
practice, physicians were called upon only by those opiate users
seeking (cure).</i> </p>

<p>(Terry and Pellens, 15)<br>
</p>

<p>A Massachusetts study of 1871 &quot;consulted&quot; 20-30
druggists and got mailed responses from 125 physicians. 40 of
these physicians did not know of a single case of &quot;opium
eating,&quot; and of 46 who commented on whether &quot;the
injurious use of opium has increased of late years,&quot; 6 1 %
answered it had not and another 13% answered it was diminishing.
Only one physician, but at least two druggists, stated that
opiate use begun during the late war was an important cause for
addiction. (Oliver, 1872) Without denying the significance of
this report, these mentions of addicted veterans had no
ramifications in the drug literature at the time. It was a state
publication with very limited circulation, the few summaries or
reviews of the report in the medical literature at the time did
not mention the Civil War,25 and save for Terry and Pellens'
lengthy excerpt from it in 1928 we might never have known that
some pharmacists, at least, recognized that addicted veterans, as
a class, were among the ranks of addicts.26 </p>

<p>In Chicago in 1880, 50 pharmacists were surveyed about the
cause of addiction of their regular opiate using customers. The
most mentioned were &quot; rheumatism and neuralgia&quot; (38
each); &quot;some&quot; respondents, (but less than four),
believed addiction was caused by sickness and pain and/or the
&quot;loss of property and position in society&quot; due to the
recent war. (Earle, 1880) (On another government survey, of
doctors in Michigan in 1878, the Civil War was not mentioned).
(Marshall, 1966) </p>

<p>In toto, these surveys indicate that there was a small,
temporary phenomenon of addicted veterans, which was not a social
problem in the sense that anyone but a few pharmacists recognized
it in the quarter century after the Civil War. </p>

<p><b>C. </b><u>&quot;Any&quot; Vs. &quot;Many&quot;</u> </p>

<p>No one doubts that all the opiates used to alleviate the pain
from all the chronic diseases and continuous pain resulting from
the Civil War resulted in some soldiers using and becoming
addicted to opiates. The issue, however, is not whether there
were <u>any</u> addicted veterans but if there were <u>many</u>.
Courtwright's contention that <b>&quot;a </b><i>substantial </i>number
of them (veterans) eventually became addicted to opium or
morphine,&quot; and that &quot;two events, the Civil War and the
spread of hypodermic medication, triggered a <b><i>massive </i></b>increase
in iatrogenic opium and especially morphine addiction,&quot;
(emphasis not in the original). (Courtwright, 1982) is
unwarranted.<br>
</p>

<p>In arguing that the importance of Soldier's Disease should not
be discounted, Courtwright stresses the importance on later 19th
Century addiction of the wrenching impact that War had on society
as a whole, such as the loss of loved ones, property, fortunes
and social position. By such reasoning, any social event or
condition which occurs in reasonable proximity before an increase
in drug use can be considered a &quot;cause.&quot; Ergo, the iron
horse can be blamed for late 19th century addiction, or movies
and television for the increased drug problems of the last few
decades. (In the Massachusetts study noted above, more
pharmacists reported state restrictions on the use of alcohol a
&quot;cause&quot; of recent opiate use than reported the Civil
War). However, Soldier's Disease is cited in the drug literature
the past few decades to imply something quite specific -- namely,
the presence of opiates, outside of strict and knowledgeable
medical control, ipso facto causes massive publicly noted
addiction, Nothing less. </p>

<p><b>5. </b><u>Soldier's Disease and Drug Policy</u> </p>

<p>In sum, Soldier's Disease proves to be another myth. In
reality, the widespread use of opiates during the Civil War
generated so infinitesimal a problem that only two or three
apothecaries, and two or three of the most encyclopedic drug
experts, even speculated on the possibility of addicted soldiers
from that War for almost half a century. Soldier's Disease did
not become the Conventional Wisdom until almost a century after
that war. </p>

<p>Implicit in the concept of Soldier's Disease are four aspects
of addiction which, together, are a paradigm used to justify
current opiate laws -- easy access leads to widespread use,
addiction is easy to acquire, hard to kick, and its consequences
are powerful and publicly obvious. In the popular contemporary
idiom, the paradigm consists of &quot;it's so good, don't even
try it once&quot;; &quot;once an addict, always an addict&quot;;
and in the image of the &quot;junkie&quot;. (Belief in this
paradigm, in the early 1970's, led many experts, and particularly
critics of U.S. military policy, to sound the tocsin about opiate
use by GIs for inevitably this would lead to a huge problem of
addicted veterans ... which it didn't)27 Since each aspect of the
paradigm is contradicted by the historical evidence, Soldier's
Disease is a mythic reconstruction of the past to make it
coincide with contemporary assumptions. <br>
</p>

<p>How significant is the paradigm in justifying opiate laws?
Each year over the past two decades the nation has spent billions
in drug law enforcement, resulting in an annual average of over a
half million drug arrests, and has spent billions for trying
those arrestees and incarcerating scores of thousands of them.
Until the mid-1980's, when cocaine replaced opiates as the most
often used and most frightening &quot;hard drug,&quot; the
dangers of opiate addiction formed the core of the nation's
perceived drug problem and most of the prisoners serving drug
sentences had been convicted on opiate charges. Additionally,
drugs are a major economic alternative for young poor people, as
well as a major source of police corruption. None of this --
neither the public money, arrests, incarcerations, the
competitive illegal economy, and police corruption -existed
regarding drugs until there were prohibitory laws. </p>

<p>How significant is Soldier's Disease for the paradigm which
shows opiate availability ipso facto causes a massive social
problem? As noted in Section I of this paper, there is no other
pre-Harrison Act example of a currently believable social
problem. Though an ancient and seemingly minor issue, addiction
among Civil War veterans functions as a lynchpin or cornerstone.
Strip away Soldier's Disease, and the only problem suggested by
the paradigm are the medical consequences of addiction, which
occurs in a large percentage of opiate users. The facts about
addiction among the Civil War's soldiers and veterans indicates
that widespread addiction, too, is a natural result of free
access to drugs. </p>

<p>The facts about Civil War drug use indicate open availability
and no recognizable negative consequences; the facts, the past
few generations, show extremely limited access to opiates and an
immense &quot;drug problem.&quot; It is in the illegal context
that the modern &quot;opiate problem&quot; arises, rather than in
a legal context such as the Civil War. The chemistry lesson of
the Civil War is that opiates per se do not cause the problem,
the context does.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>FOOTNOTES</u></b> </p>

<p><b>1 </b>The imagery of the &quot;leather thong around his
neck and a leather bag&quot; is, to my knowledge, unique to
Starkey. </p>

<p>2 Occasionally a moralistic author of the late 19th Century
cited a social problem with opiates which no-one else ever
noticed, but two problems were repeated enough to warrant
comment. T.D. Crothers in several articles claimed that morphine,
in particular, led to crime. According to one scholar who studied
the period, &quot;No other writer ... asserts the strength and
ubiquity of this association .... (and) it is extremely difficult
to accept the validity of his position.&quot; (Swatos, 1972),
though at least one other expert claimed, as an alibi in a trial
for a property crime, (Kane, 1882b), that the cost of opiates
forced some persons with huge habits to steal. Still, before the
laws all but the extremely poor could easily afford any size
habit. Crothers' unique assertions about opiate-caused crime can
not justify a policy which generates the extraordinary
drug-related crime of today. </p>

<p>There were also occasional reports that addicts were lethargic
and neglectful of personal hygiene and business. However, the
types of people on 19th Century lists of addicts, were typically
in demanding jobs. That, said the experts at the time, was why
they sought the &quot;stimulating&quot; effects of opiates. The
many reports of people not knowing their spouses were long term
addicts suggests that the lethargy and inattentiveness to
business was hardly blatant. Aside from the racist comments about
opiate use in Chinatowns, the allegation that opiates effected
the performance of a class of persons, such as impeding the
performance of soldiers (S.F. Call, 19 1 Ob), was rare. </p>

<p>3 Terry and Pellens, in their encyclopedic classic The Opium
Problem, also report import statistics, as does Kane, the author
of the longest scholarly work in the early 1880's. (Terry and
Pellens, 1928:50-5 1; and Kane, 1880). <br>
</p>

<p>4 &quot;It has been reported that for many years husbands and
wives, to say nothing of other members of a family, have lived in
complete ignorance of the existence of this condition in one or
the other.&quot; (Terry and Pellens: 2)<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>7 The obvious racism manifest in such headlines as
&quot;Crafty Chinese Are Doubly Accused&quot; (S.F. Call, 1910a),
becomes a &quot;social problem&quot; when white women are
involved, as suggested by the following headline: </p>

<p>Police and Detectives Sweep Chinatown, Battering In Doors of
Opium Places </p>

<p>Two White Women Are Captured In Dragnet. (S.F. Call, 191lb)<br>
</p>

<p>The S.F. Call on occasion linked opiate use to crime or
lunacy, but each time the details indicated the problem was a
result of the law. (S.F. Call, 1910c and d, and 1911a) New York
City's Commissioner of Corrections said that if addicts are
deprived of opiates on arrest, &quot;normal persons ... very
frequently go insane.&quot; (N.Y. Times, 1914) <br>
</p>

<p>9 Estimates of the number of opiate addicts and &quot;cocaine
fiends&quot; circa 1915 varied enormously. Marks' estimated
4,000,000; a U.S. Public Health Service expert estimated a
minimum of 70,000 and, elsewhere, &quot; I 18,000.... (and)
granting (a) somewhat improbable assertion ... a maximum not more
than 187,000 users of opium,&quot; (Marks, 1915; Wilbert, 1914
and 1915). </p>

<p>10 Had <u>The Opium Problem</u> gained earlier recognition as
a classic, Soldier's Disease might have been the conventional
wisdom of drug experts before the late 1950's. The original 1928
printing of 400 copies not sold out for decades. A 1 970 reprint
sold much better. </p>

<p>12 Soldier's Disease was cited in publications by several
influential government agencies and prestigious commissions
created to address the drug issue. Starting with 1973, references
to Soldier's Disease can be found in: Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department, 1974; National Commission on Marihuana, 1973;
Organized Crime Task Force, 1984; President's Commission on
Organized Crime, 1986; Strategy Council, 1975; U.S. Attorney
General, 1984: and U.S. Department of H.E.W., 1975. </p>

<p>13 Despite my many criticisms, I respect Courtwright's
judiciousness and his willingness to grapple with the issue
(which no other expert who claims Soldier's Disease has done), He
recognizes and responds to contrary evidence, and criticizes
simplistic recitations of Soldier's Disease. </p>

<p><b>14 </b>Of the authors the past 30 years who report
widespread addiction by Civil War veterans, over a third mention
Soldier's Disease, a third denote Army Disease, an occasional
author labels it Soldier's Illness or Soldier's Sickness, and the
others describe the phenomenon without noting a sobriquet. </p>

<p>15 The officer confessed at his trial that he was
&quot;suffering for want of the drug (opium) ... (and) so great
was the craving that he temporarily deserted his post to ...
obtain it, though knowing that his life would thereby be
forfeited.&quot; (Nolan, 188 1). This smacks of tales from the
1930's of murderers caught red-handed who, desperate to avoid the
electric chair, claimed marijuana &quot;caused&quot; their crime.
</p>

<p>16 The failure to note opiate addiction as a significant
problem was not due to the absence of the concept of addiction
during and just after the Civil War, The commissioners of the
Prison Association of New York in 1866 reported that men &quot;of
a low order of morals ... (were) addicted to habits of profanity
and intemperance.&quot; (North American Review, 1867:570) </p>

<p>17 An article on opiates by Mitchell -- on the effects of
opiates on birds -confirms him as an eccentric scientist. (Boston
MSJ, 1870) Weir found that morphia did not induce steep
&quot;beyond a slight tendency to quietude, which we can never be
sure is not due to the habit of the wounded or sick pigeon of
seeking a remote corner and remaining at rest,&quot; but
&quot;used hypodermically in excessive amounts ... act as
excitants .... (and) in the duck they approach nearest to the
typical strychnic spasm.&quot; Weir also found &quot;great
difficulty with which pigeons, especially old birds, are poisoned
by opiates.&quot; </p>

<p>In All or part of Day's two sentences on the Civil War are
quoted by five 20th Century writers, (Brecher et. al., 1972;
Courtwright, 1978; Cuskey, </p>

<p>Premkunar and Sigel, 1972; Quinones, 1975; and Terry and
Pellens, 1928), and closely paraphrased without attribution by
some others. </p>

<p>19 Calkins, Day's contemporary, refers to over 200 cases in <u>Opium
and the Opium Appetite</u>. but not one soldier who began opiate
use between 1861-65.<br>
</p>

<p>20 Courtwright and Terry and Pellens cite addicted Civil War
veterans who came to public attention in the 20th Century as
evidence of that war's impact on subsequent addiction. Besides
lending credence to the phenomenon they also demonstrate that
such addiction was benign and unnoticed. The octogenarians cited
in 1928 by Terry and Pellens (&quot;today in more than one old
soldiers' home are cases of chronic opium addiction which date
from this (Civil War) period&quot;) (Terry and Pellens, 69), or
the 82 year old Confederate veteran who &quot;had been shot in
the head during the Civil War&quot; and &quot;had been addicted
55 years&quot; under medical supervision since then, (Waldorf,
1973), reveal that the addiction of veterans was not <i>a social
problem, </i>and not even <i>a medical problem </i>until
prohibition of opiates. </p>

<p>21 Apart from Courtwright's citations, of the 29 books or
largest articles about opiates, published between 1865-1879,
which I have located, there is not an original reference to
soldiers addicted during the Civil War. (Brown, 1972: Calkins,
1867 and 1871; Chaille, 1876; M.D., 1878; Frost, 1870; Gibbons,
1870: Gould, 1878; Harrington, 1878; Ingals, 1877 and 1878;
Layard, 1874 and 1878; Lippincott's, 1868; Ludlow, 1867;
Mattison, 1876 a and b, and 1878 a and b; McFarland, 1877;
National Quarterly Review, 1870; Parrish, 1869 and 1873; Popular
Science, 1875; The Probe, 1869 a and b: Richet, 1878; R.S., 1869;
and Warren, 1867). Several times as many articles were shorter
pieces, and likewise <u>made</u> no mention of addiction linked
to the Civil War. </p>

<p>22 Four lengthy newspaper articles during the 1870's, about
non-Chinese opiate use, do not mention soldiers or veterans of
the Civil War. (New York Daily Herald, 1877 and 1878; and New
York Times, 1877 and 1878). </p>

<p>23 Two of the four 20th Century sources cited by Courtwright
were also works by Crothers. (Crothers, 1900 and 1902). </p>

<p>24 Headings of 7 of the 18 chapters in Crothers' book <u>Morphinism
and Narcomanias From Other Drugs</u> are &quot;Chloralism ....
Chioroformism .... Coffee Addiction .... Tea Inebriety ....
Tobacco Inebriety .... Ether Inebriety .... (and) Addictions From
Other Drugs,&quot; these &quot;others&quot; including arsenic,
ginger, cologne and lavender. (Crothers, 198 lb) </p>

<p>25 Three reviews of the 1872 Massachusetts study appeared in
medical journals at the time. None mentioned the Civil War (Amer.
J of Medical Sciences, 1872; and Lancet, 1873), and one even
considered the reports of opiate habituation &quot;exaggerated
.... a piece of scandal,&quot; witness that in its subsequent
annual report the Massachusetts Board of Health made &quot;no
allusion whatsoever to the subject (of opiates)&quot; (Medical
Times, 1873). </p>

<p>26 Morgan provides a lengthier excerpt of the 1872
Massachusetts study than did Terry and Pellens, but omits the
physician's, and two pharmacists', comments. The single sentence
relevant to the Civil War -- &quot;The taste for opium eating
among soldiers retired from the army is alluded to by a few of
our correspondents&quot; -- follows a listing of other causes of
addiction, (injudicious prescribing, depressed nervous systems,
overwork with deficient nutrition, a vicious mode of life, and
intemperance). </p>

<p>27 In several fundamental respects, the opiate use of soldiers
and veterans of the Vietnam War is not analogous to the Civil War
situation, though the fears about what widespread opiate use
among GIs would engender once they were mustered out exactly
parallels the fears implicit in Soldier's Disease. The soldiers
who used opiates in the Civil War did so to alleviate the pain
from wounds, and to help cure &quot;the fluxes,&quot; but using
such drugs &quot;to get high&quot; or to reduce stress were the
essential reasons for opiate use by Vietnam era GIs. In so far as
a few veterans continued regularly using opiates in the 1970's
and 1980's, they contributed to a social problem because, in the
context of illegality, any regular opiate use tends to be a
financial burden and criminal problem. The counterparts of these
GIs, a century earlier, went unnoticed. Further, the fact that so
many GIs abandoned opiate use once out of Vietnam can be argued
as a demonstration of the effects of the U.S. approach of massive
treatment opportunities and massive enforcement. The handful of
addicted veterans after the Civil War would suggest that
suppression is not the root cause of why regular opiate users
quit before becoming addicted.<br>

<h1>&quot;American Prohibitionists and Violence, 1865-1920&quot; </h1>

<p> by Richard Hamm </p>

<p> Today I want to post part of a paper I delivered at a Meeting
of the Alcohol and Temperance History Group as an Affiliated
Society of the American Association for the History of Medicine,
at its 68th Annual Meeting at Pittsburgh in May 1995. At that
time I said I wasn't planning to publish it, for various reasons,
but I have been urged by people whose views I value to
disseminate it, so I placed it-in pieces-on the List serve of the
ATHG. It brought forth a good string, so I have agreed to place
this piece (essentially the Pittsburgh paper) on the Web page of
the ATHG. </p>

<p> The prohibitionists were social reform agitators who sought a
major change in their society's customs. Social reformers have
been, of course, a nearly constant presence in American society
since the early 19th century. Accounts of many social reformers'
campaigns, often deal with the violence inflicted upon reformers
seeking change in society and the violence engaged in by some
reformers to achieve their ends. Indeed, violence, even killing
and attempted killing, seems almost endemic to the history of
social reforms in the United States. But, with the special cases
of the Women's crusades of 1873 and Carry Nation aside, the vast-
and ever-growing literature on the temperance movement pays
little attention to the issue of violence.(1) This gap is a
serious deficiency. </p>

<p> There are two limits to my work. First, I am most interested
in violence in its most dramatic and drastic forms, killing or
attempting to kill people. So I will be talking mostly of
killings, attempted killings, and mobbings (because after all
they can easily lead to killings). Second, I am talking about
violence in respons to or as a part of agitation and not violence
attendant to law enforcement. Thus I am going to pass over
silently the many studies, popular and not, of moonshining,
bootlegging, and violence.(2) Violence in resistance to law or
violence undertaken by law officers is somewhat separate from
violence associated with a social reform movement's agitation for
change. Such violence grows out the state's presumption to have a
monopoly of force and its willingness to resort to force to gain
the ends of its policy. To break the law of the state is to risk
its use of violence against you, hence the likelihood that the
law breaker will engage in violence. Law enforcement and violence
go together hand and glove. </p>

<p> But within these limits there still broad area of violence to
be explored as reform and violence also seem to go together. We
can break down violence associated with reform into two large
categories. First, violence, used by their opponents, to stop
reformers from agitating. Second, violence by reformers directed
at achieving their ends-in their view, a righteous violence. A
brief look of some reforms in American history shows the
existence of these two types of violence. </p>

<p> Violence to deter reform, for example, surfaces in studies
and memory of the civil rights movement. The literature is filled
with works that explore the violence directed against civil
rights advocates in the American South in the 1950s and 1960s. We
all know of the bombing of the Birmingham churches, the mobbing
of sit in protesters and freedom riders, and the killing of
Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney.(3) Similarly, contemporary
commentary on the anti-abortion movement has focused on the wave
of violence against doctors and workers at women's health
centers, most notably in the cases of Pensacola shootings and the
recent the shootings in Brookline. </p>

<p> Historians of abolitionists, perhaps the most deeply studied
of all social reform movements, have delineated both types of
violence in that crusade. They have explored the many
anti-abolitionist mobs of the Jacksonian era, including that
which mobbed and killed the abolitionist editor Eliajah Lovejoy
in 1837. Also, they have spent considerable effort exploring the
forces and meaning of John Brown's and other abolitionists'
willingness to engage in terrorism to bring about the end of
slavery.(4) But virtually no where in the vast scholarly studies
of the prohibition movement are there similar studies of the
prohibitionists and violence. Its not because violence is not
there </p>

<p> On the issue of deadly violence against agitators, the recent
scholarly literature is almost silent on the subject but the drys
themselves recorded that it happened. The temperance movement at
its peak, sought to encourage the faithful and to preserve the
records of its achievements and struggles by publishing, among
other things, prohibition encyclopedias. Two standard reference
books produced by the drys, <i>The Pocket Cyclopedia of
Temperance</i> (1916) and <i>Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol
Problem</i> (1925-1930) show that drys included information on
violence against prohibitionists. Both works contain articles on
so called &quot;Temperance Martyrs.&quot; Indeed, scattered
through the six volumes and 2940 page <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
are many accounts of mobbings, attempted killings, and killings
of drys. Some of the stories in the <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
are classics. For instance, it details in the article on
Pennsylvania how a county chairman of the Anti-Saloon League was
shot at in 1913, but &quot;fortunately the bullet, intended for
his heart, was arrested by a copy of the bible which he carried
under his arm.&quot; The article includes a picture of the page
where the bullet was stopped. While such miraculous tales were
rare, pedestrian tales of violence were common in the temperance
movement.(5) </p>

<p> I have combined the counts of the <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
and the <i>Pocket Encyclopedia</i> to come up with some ball park
figures of the violence directed against prohibitionists. These
numbers exclude from them prohibitionists who suffered violence
as a result of official or unofficial law enforcement or (from
the sources available) who suffered violence in uncertain
circumstances. For example, a minister who denounced violators of
a state prohibition law and sought to bring private prosecutions
in the courts and suffered violence would be in this estimate
engaging in unofficial law enforcement and is not included in the
figures of prohibitionist agitators who experienced violence.
Including such persons would roughly double the number of
assaults and triple the number of the killings. Combining the two
lists, I have found the names of six drys who between 1874 and
1908 were killed over their advocacy of their cause. At least
another nineteen drys were mobbed, beaten, shot at, or had their
homes (or businesses) dynamited for their support of
temperance.(6) </p>

<p> Without a doubt, advocating prohibition was a dangerous
business for some of its agitators. On the other hand, the
temperance advocates seemed not to have engaged in violence
against their enemies. I know of no prohibitionist who engaged in
violence to the point of killing to bring about their goal of a
dry nation. Some prohibitionists, Carry Nation being the most
prominent though certainly not alone, did engage in direct action
against liquor sellers, destroying their place of business and
their stock through violent means. Assaults on people sometimes
emerged from such attacks. But such &quot;hatchetation&quot;
aside, the prohibitionists did not seem to engage violence that
could lead to killing. I would like to is explain two things.
First, why the violence against drys has received so little
attention. And second, explain the relative dearth of righteous
violence by drys. </p>

<p> Why does the scholarly literature not contain much
information on the topic of violence against prohibitionist
agitators? One explanation can be dismissed out of hand, that is
that those who the opponents perpetuated their deeds against were
too obscure to make an impact. Among the six prohibitionist
killed, are a doctor, a judge, a minister, four editors of reform
or other newspapers (including the minister), and a United States
Senator. (The Senator is Edward Carmack of Tennessee.) If you
turn toward those who suffered assaults or mobbing for agitation
on the temperance question, the trend is similar with editors and
ministers predominating. Those attacked included figures of some
renown in temperance history; for example Albert Banks-clergyman,
dry editor, and propagandist- was shot and wounded and Samuel W.
(&quot;Sam&quot;) Small- journalist, dry, and evangelist-was
mobbed and beaten. The violence occurred in all areas of the
nation, though the South and West seem disproportionally
represented, and extended from the decade after the Civil War
through the second decade of the 20th century. It should appear
much more prominently in the scholarly literature. </p>

<p> Two general causes seem to explain why the violence against
prohibitionists for their agitation has received so little
attention. First, contentions from the time of the killing or
other violence that the violence had nothing to do with
prohibition may have led scholars not to consider the topic.
Second, and more importantly, there was little place for accounts
of such violence in the evolving scholarly interpretations of
prohibition. </p>

<p> I know of at least one example of a dry killed over his
advocacy of prohibition where non-prohibitionists sources
asserted that he &quot;was not slain because of his convictions
but&quot; because of a &quot;personal difficulty.&quot;(7) If
other killings and attacks have similar conflicting accounts (and
logic would indicate that they should, as it was in the interests
of the opponents of prohibition to downplay violence against
their enemies) it is likely that scholars have been misdirected
away from the topic of violence against dry agitators. But, there
is little evidence that scholars have paid any attention to the
topic at all. </p>

<p> While scholarly interpretations of prohibition have changed
dramatically over time, all of them share the trait that they
either have little room in their frameworks for discussions of
violence or have a tendency to turn scholars away from approaches
and sources that would explore issues violence. Since World War
II, scholarly interpretations of prohibition have been marked by
two large trends. First, there is the focus on the social status
of the members of the movement.(8) Second, there is the question
of how, if at all, prohibition related to the reform movements of
the day: populism, progressivism, and women's rights.(9) Scholars
working in the field have thus tended to mine the sources to
answer questions about these concerns. Thus by combing membership
rolls, church records, tax records, census data, and other
sources they have told us much about the social status of the
prohibitionists. Similarly in exploring the links between
anti-monopolism, regulation, peace reform, women's suffrage,
divorce reform, and anti-prostitution (just to name some)
scholars have illuminated the connections of the movement to
other reforms. But in doing these things they have mostly
eschewed writing narratives of movement history that would have
confronted the sources that raise the questions of violence
against drys and violence by drys.(10) It is to violence by drys
that I would like to turn now. </p>

<p> One thing is clear about violence by drys: there was no dry
equivalent to John Brown, there was no dry equivalent to Michael
F. Griffin or John Salvi The closest that the prohibition
movement ever came to such figures was Carry Nation. Nation's
trashing of saloons is the stuff of American legend and folklore.
Moreover it has been the subject of some scholarly work.(11) Thus
a look at Nation and her movement in the context of the righteous
violence of other movements is illuminating. </p>

<p> When we talk about figures in reform movements adopting
violence, two things stand out. First that they believed that
their violence is justified; violence-even killing-has become an
acceptable means of bringing about the change that they want.
Second, they act violently because they perceive that their
movement is loosing ground. Hence John Brown's moral certainty of
the evil of slavery and belief that sin could only be expatiated
by the spilling of blood convinced him that violence was
acceptable. He, in turn, convinced others to fight and kill with
him in Kansas and Virginia because, after the Compromise of 1850
with its Fugitive Slave Law and the Kansas Nebraska Act repealing
the Missouri compromise, for the abolitionists crusade their
enemies seemed to have gained the upper hand.(12) Similarly, the
justifiable homicide argument used by the advocates of violence
in the anti-abortion movement give them a moral base for their
actions.(13) Significantly, also, the first killing by
anti-abortionists came after it became clear that the Supreme
Court was not going to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> </p>

<p> , the second came after a pro-abortion candidate was elected
president. How do these two factors, developing a view that see
the violence as acceptable and acting out of fear of failure of
the reform play out in the prohibition movement and in the career
of Carry Nation? </p>

<p> There was a potential for developing an ideology of righteous
violence, in the prohibition movement. And evidence of it does
not rest alone on the career of Carry Nation. Before I turn to
Nation and her ideas for justifying her violence, let me turn to
another source that show that drys did enunciate such ideas. The
1915 novel <i>Quarrytown</i>, written by Douglas Dobbins and
published by the American Issue Publishing (the press of company
of the Anti-Saloon League) shows community organized righteous
violence in a favorable light. In this fictionalized account of
the struggle against the return of saloons to a stone quarrying
town, the drys ultimately resort to violence. </p>

<p> At the opening the town is dry and virtually free of crime.
But the dry utopia vanishes, as neither law nor community action
offer adequate protection from the evil trade. Drys fail to block
the issuing of a liquor license at a state liquor licensing board
(dominated by politicians beholden to the organized liquor
interest), a dry organized boycott falters when its denounced by
a new editor of the town's newspaper, and citizen prosecutions of
the saloon keeper for violations of the law falter before
corrupted juries. Thus the saloon spreads crime and disorder
throughout the community, literally turning brother against
brother in drunken brawls. After all other means have been tried
the dry townsmen resort to violence. One night after the saloon
is shut, they engage a Boston Tea Party type raid on it,
destroying its fixtures and stock. When the newspaper editor
condemns the act as lawlessness he is ostracized by the town.
When the saloon keeper rebuilds, the temperance men of the town
blow up the establishment with three separate dynamite bombs, the
first being set away from where the proprietor slept to allow him
time to escape. Moreover, the local minister preached a sermon in
advance of the act calling for the blowing up of &quot;every
hell-hole in the United States tomorrow with dynamite!&quot; And
in case the message was not clear, the dynamite works. The saloon
keeper never came back and the town was the better for it: no
murders, or assaults, no wife beatings, and no squandering of
food and education money on whisky occur within its borders.(14) </p>

<p> Without ever saying it in so many words, this publication of
the Anti-Saloon League legitimated violence against saloons. But
it did so in a rather limited way. Violence was not the first
resort, but the last resort for the drys of Quarrytown. Its only
because law and boycotts have failed them, and only after liquor
begins to wreck havoc in their community do they take action. And
their first action, does not threaten life or limb. Even the
bombing is planned to allow the saloon keeper to escape harm.
Similarly, Carry Nation carried the conviction that her violence
was justified and resorted to violence only after other means had
failed. </p>

<p> Once you get past the myth and hype, Nation's short career as
a saloon smasher is revealing of the potential of righteous
violence in the prohibition movement. Nation captured the
national imagination in 1900 when she began single-handedly
destroying dives in Kansas. Her actions were quickly overshadowed
by the hucksterism to which she resorted to keep her agitation
going: the selling of hatchets and the appearances at resorts
like Coney Island. She remained a national figure until her death
in 1911. Nation was motivated, like many drys, by a personal
religious belief that liquor selling was sinful. Indeed, in her
autobiography she recounting receiving visions from God showing
her the evils of liquor. And she adopted violence only after
other she had tried other means.(15) </p>

<p> In 1900 Nation lived in state that had a two decade old, and
widely violated, policy of prohibition. Moreover, it must of have
seemed to her that the temperance movement was in a rut. In her
town of Medicine Lodge, working with the WCTU she closed the
town's seven bars through the tried a true techniques of the
women's crusade of 1873: picketing with song, prayer, and moral
appeals to the sellers and purchasers. These were techniques that
had been used against legal saloons, in Kansas there were nothing
but illegal ones. Moreover, for a decade now in Kansas the policy
had been widely violated, often with the contrivances of the
state's political leaders. And at the national level the
temperance movement was stalled. Between 1889 and 1907 no state
adopted prohibition. WCTU had lost its driving force with the
death of Frances Willard in 1898 and the Prohibition Party had
splintered into two warring camps. The leading temperance
organizations seemed unable to advance the cause or indeed to
stop the rollback movements in various states with prohibition.
Hence, with conviction, and at a time when the movement was
faltering, Nation turned away from moral suasion and turned to
violence. As she explained, &quot;If there's anything that's weak
and worse than useless it's this moral suasion. I despise it.
these hell traps of Kansas have fattened for twenty years on
moral suasion.&quot;(16) </p>

<p> And her violence struck a chord among some temperance
advocates. While some debated the value of violence, others
joined Nation. She soon headed an organization of several hundred
similarly minded saloon foes. And, in a two month period,
following her lead this group, and others, engaged in vigilante
action against saloons in Kansas's major cities, Topeka and
Wichita. Mobbings and riots swept the cities; people were beaten
and shots were fired in anger. And among some temperance workers
the violence was welcome. One woman letter writer to a WCTU paper
wrote: &quot;What if a few people do get killed[?] . . . I'm
tired of this sentimental gush about 'stopping before it comes to
bloodshed. . . .' I for one, hope a thousand more of them will be
smashed in Kansas before she stops.&quot; The response to Nation,
shows that the potential for righteous violence existed in the
temperance crusade.(17) </p>

<p> Which raises new questions: Why was there only one Carry
Nation? Part of the answer lays in the changing circumstances of
the prohibition movement. Soon after Nation's actions in Kansas,
the Anti-Saloon League emerged as the dominate organization in
the temperance movement. And the League's techniques of political
lobbying, official law enforcement, and public opinion building
changed the fortunes of the crusade. For example, take the topic
of national legislation; the League's Washington Office, between
1902 and 1919, pressured the United States Congress to enact laws
that: prohibited the sale of liquor in federal buildings, banned
the transport of liquor through the mails, ended liquor sales in
national soldiers' homes, retained a law excluding all alcoholic
beverages from Army posts, created Oklahoma as a dry state, and
limited and then prohibited the transportation of liquor into dry
states. A similar record of success can be found in the
prohibitionists' campaigns in the states in the same period.(18)
The very success of the drys in gaining what they wanted through
the political process made righteous violence redundant. </p>

<p> This pattern of potential righteous violence in the
prohibition crusade and the mostly unstudied violence used
against drys by their opponents, suggest that we need to look
more deeply into prohibition as a reform movement. As Robin Room
wrote over twenty years ago, &quot;we must attempt to understand
the antiliquor movement . . . as a massive, sustained organized
effort with a highly developed set of tactics and coherent,
tangible goals.&quot; (19) Indeed, if we seek a usable past, one
that might help deal with current social reform crusades, say
against abortion or cigarettes, it is imperative that we look,
far deeper than I have here, into tactics, strategies, and
contexts, of the temperance crusade to see how they prompted or
retarded violence. </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p> (1) Typical of the treatment of the topic of violence and the
prohibitionists can be found in examining the three available
surveys of the movement's history. Norman Clark, <i>Deliver Us
From Evil: An Interpretation of American Prohibition</i>(New
York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1976) and Paul Aaron and David
Musto, &quot;Temperance and Prohibition In America: A Historical
Overview&quot; in Mark H. Moore and Dean Gernstein, eds., <i>Alcohol
and Public Policy: Beyond the Shadow of Prohibition</i>
(Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1981), 127-181 devote no
space to the topic. Jack S. Blocker, Jr. <i>American Temperance
Movements: Cycles of Reform</i>(Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1989),
30- 34, 59-64, 74-79 mentions violence in connection with
enforcement of the Maine Law and in the direct action of the
women's crusades of 1873 and their precursors. Moreover, Mark
Lender, editor, <i>Dictionary of American Temperance Biography</i>
(Westport CT: Greenwood Press, 1984) does not contain a sketch of
any prohibitionists killed, either as response to agigation or
because law enforcement activities. </p>

<p> Three works discuss the role of violence associated with
temperance reform. Jed Dannebaum, <i>Drink and Disorder:
Temperance Reform in Cincinnati from the Washington Revival to
the WCTU</i> (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press,
1984) and Jack S. Blocker Jr., <i>&quot;Give to the Winds Thy
Fears&quot;: The Women's Temperance Crusade, 1873-1874</i>
(Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1985); Robert Bader, <i>Prohibition
in Kansas</i> (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1986). </p>

<p> On liquor law enforcement before national prohibition see:
Stephen Cresswell, <i>Mormons, Cowbosy, Moonshiners, and
Klansmen: Federal Law Enforcment in the South and West, 1870-
1893</i> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1991); William
F. Holmes, &quot;Moonshining and Collective Violence: Georgia,
1889- 1895,&quot; <i>Journal of American History</i> 67 (1980):
589-611; William F. Holmes, &quot;Whitecapping: Agrarian Violence
in Mississippi, 1902-1906,&quot; <i>Journal of Southern History</i>
35 (1969): 165-185; Wilbur R. Miller, <i>Revenuers and
Moonshiners: Enforcing Federal Liquor Law in the Mountain South,
1865-1900</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,
1991). </p>

<p> (2) Indeed, certain killings connected to the civil rights
crusade have been used to illuminate the very nature of the
movement and its opponents. See for example, Seth Cagin and
Philip Dray, <i>We Are Not Afraid: The Story of Goodman,
Schwerner and Chaney and the Civil Rights Campaign for
Mississippi</i> (New York: Bantam Books, 1988) and Herbert
Shapiro, <i>White Violence and Black Response From Reconstruction
to Montgomery</i> (Amherst: University of Massachsetts Press,
1988). </p>

<p> (3)On the topic of abolitionist violence and their reactions
to violence see, Jane H. Pease and William Pease,
&quot;Confrontation and Abolition in the 1850s,&quot; <i>Journal
of American History</i> 58 (1972): 923-937; John Demos, &quot;The
Antislavery Movement and the Problem of Violent 'Means,'&quot; <i>New
England Quarterly</i> 37 (1964): 501-526; Lewis Perry, <i>Radical
Abolitionism: Anarchy and the Government of God in Antislaery
Thought</i> (Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1973); Michael
Fellman, &quot;Rehearsal for the Civil War: Antislavery and
Proslavery at the Fighting Point in Kansas, 1854-1856,&quot; in
Lewis Perry and Michael Fellman, <i>Antislavery Reconsidered: New
Perspectives on the Abolitionists</i> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana
University Press, 1979), 287-307; Silvan S. Tomkins, &quot;The
Psychology of Commitment: The Constructive Role of Violence and
Suffering for the Individual and for His Society, in Martin
Duberman, editor, <i>The Antislavery Vanguard: New Essays on the
Abolitionists</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965),
270-298. On violence directed against abolitionists see <i>&quot;Gentleman
of Property and Standing:&quot; Anti-Aboliton Mobs in Jacksonian
America</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970). Beyond
specific works that deal with violence, three surveys of the
abolitionist crusade show how intergal the topics of violence are
to the reform's history as they devote attention to both the
violence against and by abolitionists: Ronald G. Walters, <i>The
Antislavery Appeal: American Abolitionism After 1830</i> (New
York: Norton, 1978); Merton L. Dillon, <i>The Abolitionists: the
Growth of a Dissenting Minority</i> (Dekalb: Northern Illinois
University Press, 1974) and James B. Stewart, <i>Holy Warriors:
The Abolitionists and American Slavery</i> (New York: Hill and
Wang, 1976). </p>

<p> (4) Clarence T. Wilson, Deets Picket, and Harry G. McCain,
editors, <i>The Pocket Cyclopedia of Temperance</i> (Topeaka:
Temperance Society of Methodist Epsicopal Church, revised
edition, 1916), 155-162; Ernest Cherrington, ed., <i>Standard
Encyclopaedia of the Alcohol Problem</i> 6 volumes (Westerville,
OH: American Issue Publishing Co., 1925-1930), 2618-2620, also
for example see 85, and 1800-1801, &amp; 2133 (bible story); even
midway through the crusade, drys were recording the suffering of
their martyrs, see: <i>Cyclopaedia of Temperance and Prohibition</i>
(New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1891), 201-202. </p>

<p> (5) The list, derrived from <i>SEAP</i> and <i>Pocket</i>
includes: Dr. J. W. Beal and Judge D. R. Cox both killed in
Malden, Missouri on Februray 18 1907; Edward W. Carmack, United
States Senator from Tennessee, shot November 9, 1908 in
Nashville; Sam D. Cox, editor and publisher of <i>The Sentinel</i>
killed in Minatare, Nebraska on December 20 1906: Roderick D.
Gambrell, editor of <i>The Sword and Shield</i> killed in
Jackson, Mississippi on May 5, 1887; Rev. John R. Moffett, editor
of <i>Anti-Liquor</i> shot on November 11, 1892 in Danville
Virginia; and Joseph B. Rucker editor of the <i>Somerset Reporter</i>
killed in Somerset, Kentucky on September 19, 1892. Two of these
killings have received scholarly treatment, Paul Isaac, <i>Prohibition
and Politics: Turbulent Decades in Tennessee, 1885-1920</i>
(Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1965) and Richard F.
Hamm, &quot;The Killing of John R. Moffett and the Trial of J. T.
Clark: Race, Prohibition, and Politics in Danville,
1887-1893,&quot; <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</i>
101 (1993): 375-404 </p>

<p> (6) This is the case of John R. Moffett, for details see:
Hamm, &quot;Killing.&quot; The assertion that Moffett did not die
for his convictions generated a controversy between the slain
man's brother and William Copeland, editor of the Danville paper
at Moffett's death and later editor of the <i>Times Dispatch</i>.

<p> (7) After the pioneering work of Joseph Gusfield on the
social status of temperance reformers, scholars rushed to test
this theory, and for nearly a generation, the study of
prohibition focused, as the title of one article put it, on
&quot;The Prohibitionists Who Were They?&quot; Joseph R.
Gusfield, <i>Symbolic Crusade: Status Politics and the American
Temperance Movement</i> (Urbana: University of Illinois Press,
1963); Jack Blocker, Jr. &quot;Modernity of Prohibitionists&quot;
and Charles A. Isetts, &quot;A Social Profile of WCTU Crusade:
Hillsboro, Ohio&quot; in Jack Blocker Jr., ed., <i>Alcohol Reform
and Society: the Liquor Issue in Social Context</i> (Westport,
CN: Greenwood Press, 1979), 99-110, 149-170; Robert A. Hohner,
&quot;The Prohibitionists: Who Were They?&quot; <i>South Atlantic
Quarterly</i> 68 (1969): 491-505; Jack S. Blocker Jr., <i>&quot;Give
to the Winds Thy Fears&quot;: The Women's Temperance Crusade,
1873-1874</i> (Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1985). The salience
of relgious idenity and the prohibition issue emerged as a topic
in political histories. Richard Jenson, <i>The Winning of the
Midwest, Social and Political Conflict, 1888-1896 </i>(Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1971); Paul Kleppner, <i>The Cross
of Culture: A Social Analysis of Midwestern Politics, 1885-1900</i>
(New York: MacMillian Free Press, 1970); Jed Dannebaum,
&quot;Immigrants and Temperance: Ethnocultural Conflict in
Cincinnati, 1845-1860&quot; <i>Ohio History</i> 87 (Autumn 1978):
125-139. </p>

<p> (8) On the issue of whether prohibition should be considered
a progressive reform, Richard Hofstader in <i>The American
Political Tradition</i> (New York: Vintage Books, 1954) and in <i>Age
of Reform</i> (New York: Vintage Books, 1955) and Andrew
Sinclair, <i>Era of Excess: A Social History of the Prohibition
Movement</i> (New York: Harper and Row, 1962) argued no. John
Burnham in &quot;New Perspectives on the Prohibition 'Experiment'
of the 1920s&quot; <i>Journal of Social History </i>2 (1968):
51-68; and James Timberlake in <i>Prohibition and the Progressive
Movement, 1900-1920</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1963) challenged that view. Jack S. Blocker, Jr., <i>Retreat from
Reform: The Prohibition Movement in the United States, 1890-1913</i>
(Westport: Greenwood Press, 1976) plotted the temperance
movement's abandonment of broader social reform to concentrate on
prohibition alone. Works by, Norman Clark and Austin Kerr,
utilizing the organizational interpretation of Robert Wiebe,
placed prohibition firmly within the panapoly of progressive
reforms. See Clark, <i>Deliver Us From Evil</i>; K. Austin Kerr, <i>Organized
for Prohibition: A New History of the Anti-Saloon League</i> (New
Haven, CN: Yale University Press, 1985). On the organizational
interpretation see: Louis Galambos, &quot;The Emerging
Organizational Synthesis of Modern American History,&quot; <i>Business
History Review</i> 44 (Autumn 1980): 279-90; Samuel P. Hays, <i>Response
to Industrialism, 1885-1914</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 1957), 48- 70; Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., <i>The Visible
Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business</i>
(Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1977); Louis Galambos,
&quot;Technology, Political Economy, and Professionalization:
Central Themes of the Organizational Synthesis,&quot; <i>Business
History Review</i> 57 (Winter 1983): 471-93. Recently, the work
on temperance reform has focused on its relationship with larger
question of reform in the history of women. Ruth Bordin, <i>Woman
and Temperance </i>(Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1981),
15-33; Barbara Leslie Epstein, <i>The Politics of Domesticity:
Women, Evangelism and Temperance in Nineteenth Century America</i>
(Middletown, CN: Wesleyan University Press, 1981, 1986); Ruth
Bordin, <i>Francis Willard: A Biography</i> (Chapel Hill, NC:
University of North Carolina Press, 1986); Ian Tyrrell, <i>Woman's
World Woman's Empire: the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in
International Perspective, 1880-1930</i> (Chapel Hill, NC:
University of North Carolina Press, 19. </p>

<p> (9) I am as guilty as any other scholar in the field, see
Richard F. Hamm, <i>Shaping the Eighteenth Amendment: Temperance
Reform, Legal Culture, and the Polity, 1880-1920</i> (Chapel
Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1995). We do not have a
good modern history of the Prohibition Party, though Blocker, <i>Retreat</i>
is a good start; similarily WCTU histories have tended to trail
off with Frances Willard's death. Where such narratives are to be
found are in the local studies of an area or region. Local
studies which have looked at the mechanics of the movement like
Robert L. Hampel, <i>Temperance and Prohibition in Massachusetts,
1813- 1852</i> (Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Research Press, 1982); have
often focused on areas that did not have significant outbreaks of
violence during temperance agitation. </p>

<p> (10) The only full length biolgraphies of Nation are old and
negative, Herbert Asbury, <i>Carry Nation</i> (New York: Knopf,
1929) and Robert Lewis Taylor, <i>Vessel of Wrath: The Life and
Times of Carry Nation</i> (New York: Signet Books, 1966). The
recent work by Robert Bader is more sympathic and connects her
clearly to events in Kansas. Robert S. Bader, &quot;Mrs.
Nation,&quot; <i>Kansas History</i> 7 (1984/5): 246-262; and <i>Prohibition,
</i>133-155. Nation is desperately in need of a biography which
could use the insights of women's history, gender relations, and
temperance studies to illuminate her career. The place to begin
such a reinterpretation of Nation is her autobiography, Carry A.
Nation, <i>The Use and Need of the Life of Carry A. Nation</i>
(Topeka, KA: F. M. Stevens and Sons, 1909). </p>

<p>From _Our Right To Drugs_ by Thomas Szasz, Praeger Publishers,
NY (1992): </p>

<h2>*The Food and Drugs Act of 1906* </h2>

<p>Before 1907, all drugs could be sold and bought like any other
consumer good. The manufacturer did not even have to disclose the
contents of his concoction. Hence the name patent medicine, the
adjective alluding to the fact that the composition was a trade
secret, protected by a patented name. </p>

<p>Although there is no evidence that the American consumer ever
complained about the free market in drugs, there is plenty of
evidence that his self appointed protectors complained bitterly
and loudly. The first landmark event in the federal regulation of
drugs (and foods) was the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. What did
Congress intend to achieve with this seemingly laudable
legislation? To protect people from the sale of
&quot;adulterated&quot; or &quot;misbranded&quot; foods or drugs,
that is, &quot;assur[ing] the customer of the identity of the
article purchased, not of its usefulness.&quot; </p>

<p>I say Congress's aim in enacting this legislation was
seemingly laudable because, while it is desirable that people
know what drugs they buy, forcing manufacturers by law to list
the ingredients of their products is an unnecessary infringement
on the free market -- the foot in the door of
paternalistic-statist protectionism. If Great American Drugs,
Inc., wants to market a mystery product, there is no reason why
the government should prevent it from doing so. And if I want to
buy such a pig in a poke, why should the government prevent me
from making that choice? People who want to be informed about the
drugs they buy and use would abstain from purchasing mystery
products, and market forces would then create a supply of
truthfully labeled drugs. In short, there would be no need to
prohibit the non-disclosure of the contents of medicinal (or
other) products. It is enough to prohibit false disclosure and to
punish it, as fraud, by both criminal and civil penalities. As
for nondisclosure, it would be &quot;punished&quot; by the
invisible hand of the market. The truth is that behind Congress's
ostensible aim of combating drug misbranding lay its growing
antagonism to the habit of pharmacological self-pleasuring,
manifested by the act's specifically mandating the listing on the
label of what were then the main ingredients of Americans'
favorite nostrums: alcohol, hypnotics, and sedatives. The
relevant lines of the Food and Drugs Act read as follows: </p>

<p>That for purposes of this Act an article shall also be deemed
misbranded: ... if the package fails to bear a statement on the
label of the quantity or proportion of any alcohol, morphine,
opium, cocaine, heroin, alpha or beta eucaine, chloroform,
cannabis, chloral hydrate, or acetanilide. </p>

<p>It is implicit in this sentence that, back then, Congress took
for granted the legality of a free market in drugs, including
cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and morphine. </p>

<p>[...] </p>

<p>*The Harrison Act (1914) and It's Aftermath* </p>

<p>In 1914, Congress enacted another landmark piece of anti-drug
legislation: the Harrison Narcotic Act. Originally passed as a
record-keeping law, it quickly became a prohibition statute. In
the course of the next seven years, by a curious coincidence of
history -- if, indeed, it is a coincidence -- in Russia the
Soviet Union replaced the czarist empire, while in the United
States the free market in drugs was replaced by federal drug
prohibition possessing unchallengeable authority. Excerpts from
two key Supreme Court decisions quickly tell the story. </p>

<p>In 1915, in a test of the Harrision Act, the Court upheld it
but expressed doubts about its constitutionality: &quot;While the
Opium Registration Act of December 17, 1914, may have a moral
end, as well as revenue, in view, this court, in view of the
grave doubt as to its constitutionality except as a revenue
measure, construes it as such.&quot; </p>

<p>Yet, only six years later the Court considered objection to
federal drug prohibition a taboo. In Whipple v. Martinson the
justices declared, </p>

<p>&quot;There can be no question of the authority of the State
in the exercise of its police power to regulate the
administration, sale, prescription, and use of dangerous and
habit-forming drugs.... </p>

<p>The right to exercise this power is so manifest in the
interest of public health and welfare, that it is unnecessary to
enter upon a discussion of it beyond saying that it is too firmly
established to be successfully called in question. </p>

<p>In 1914, trading in and using drugs was a right. In 1915,
limited federal drug controls were a constitutionally
questionable tax revenue measure. By 1921, the federal government
had gained not only complete control over so-called dangerous
drugs, but also a quasi-papal immunity to legal challenge of its
authority. Thus has the rejection of one of our most basic
constitutional rights become transformed into reverence for one
of our most baneful therapeutic-religious dogmas. Once ignited,
the fire of &quot;progressive&quot; drug protectionism spread and
soon enveloped the whole contry, transforming the Harrison Act
into the legislative embodiment of the &quot;moral principle that
taking narcotics for other than medicinal purposes was harmful
and should be prevented.&quot; That threw the monkey wrench
medicinal purpose into the machinery of the trade in drugs; this
undefined and undefinable concept has haunted us ever since. In
1920, drug prohibitionists won another major victory: America
was, at last, alcohol-free -- if not de facto, then at least de
jure. Since 1924, when Congress made it illegal to manufacture,
possess, or sell heroin, America has been free from heroin as
well -- if not in practice, then at least in theory. </p>

<p>[...] </p>

<p>In retelling this tale, it is impossible to overemphasize
that, although initially the drug laws were intended to protect
people from being &quot;abused&quot; by drugs others wanted to
sell them, this aim was soon replaced by that of protecting them
from &quot;abusing&quot; drugs they wanted to buy. The government
thus succeeded in depriving us not only of our basic right to
ingest whatever we choose, but also of our right to grow,
manufacture, sell, and buy agricultural products used by man
since antiquity. <br>

<h1>Hemp Around Their Necks</h1>

<p> From The Murderers </p>

<p> THE STORY OF THE NARCOTIC GANGS </p>

<p> By HARRY J. ANSLINGER </p>

<p> U. S. Commissioner of Narcotics </p>

<p> and WILL OURSLER </p>

<p> FARRAR, STRAUS AND CUDAHY, NEW YORK, 1961 </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> In 1930 there was no federal law against smoking marijuana,
and the average American citizen in an average community had
probably never heard of &quot;reefers&quot; or &quot;tea&quot; or
other words in the argot of marijuana users. But by the middle
thirties we began to see the serious effects of marijuana on our
youth. An alarming increase in the smoking of marijuana reefers
in 1936 continued to spread at an accelerated pace in 1937.
Before this, use of reefers had been relatively slight and
confined to the the Southwest, particularly along the Mexican
border. </p>

<p> Seizures by state officers in these two years, however, had
increased a hundred percent and by hundreds of pounds. Reports I
received from thirty states showed an &quot;invasion&quot; by
this drug, either by cultivation or underworld importation. </p>

<p> Marijuana was something new and adventuresome. The angle-wise
mobsters were aiming their pitch straight at the most
impressionable age group-America's fresh, post-depression crop of
teenagers. </p>

<p> One adolescent gave a picture to an agent of a typical
&quot;smoker&quot; in an apartment or &quot;pad&quot;: </p>

<p> &quot;The room was crowded. There were fifty people but it
seemed like five hundred. It was like crazy, couples lying all,
over the place, a woman was screaming out in the hall, two,
fellows were trying to make love to the same girl and this, girl
was screaming and crying and not making any sense. Her clothes
were mostly pulled off and she was snickering and blubbering and
trying to push these two guys away.... The place was nothing but
smoke and stink and these funny little noises I could hear but
they were way out, that far I could hardly hear them and they
were right there in the room, that laughing and crying and the
music and all that stuff. It was crazy wild. But I didn't want to
do anything, I didn't want to sleep with those women or like
that. I just wanted to lie down because the room seemed big and
Eke a great tremendous crowd like at a ball game or something. .
. .&quot; </p>

<p> Made from the hemp plant known as Cannabis sativa americana,
marijuana is almost a twin brother to Cannabis sativa indica,
otherwise called hashish. There are said to be almost three
hundred names for the varieties of the hemp weed. In some parts
of Asia it is called bhang; in South Africa it is called dagga.
It is also challed chira and ganja. And many other names. </p>

<p> The hemp weed grows best in warm climates but has also been
found along roadsides north of Boston. It grows to heights of
from five and a half to fifteen or sixteen feet. Its leaves,
seeds and flowers contain a substance which when chewed or smoked
produces hallucinatory effects. </p>

<p> Elaborate technical processes have been developed for the
manufacture of Cannabis cigarettes from the resin in the plants.
Although pharmacists have never been able to isolate completely
the nature of the Cannabis &quot;principal&quot; that produces
the narcotic effect, it is known to exist in the fringes or hairs
on the leaves and in the flowers, and in the thick resin that
flows through the stalk and other parts of the plant. </p>

<p> Cannabis grows wild in many parts of the world, and is
cultivated in India, and illegally in certain areas of Africa,
Mexico, Brazil and the United States. It also grows wild in parts
of the United States, although we have been able to root the wild
Cannabis out of most communities. </p>

<p> Origins of hemp weed are ancient. Rites that go back
thousands of years, in temples long vanished, may wen have
evolved around the effects of some variant of the hemp weed.
Worshipers of the Hindu god Siva were said to use Cannabis
indica. In the eleventh century A.D., the Mohammedan sect called
the Assassins, used hashish in so-called religious observances.
They made homicide a high ritualistic art. Their name itself is
today a synonym for murder. </p>

<p> Marijuana effects on the average user are described in a
brochure we published in the Bureau for the information of lay
groups. &quot;The toxic effect produced by the active narcotic
principle of Cannabis sativa, hemp, or marijuana,&quot; the
report states, &quot;appear to be exclusively to the higher nerve
centers. The drug produces first an exhaltation with a feeling of
well being, a happy, jovial mood, usually; an increased feeling
of physical strength and power, and a general euphoria is
experienced. Accompanying this exaltation is a stimulation of the
imagination followed by a more or less delirious state
characterized by vivid kaleidoscopic visions, sometimes of a
pleasing sensual kind, but occasionally of a gruesome nature.
Accompanying this delirious state is a remarkable loss in spatial
and time relations; persons and things in the environment look
small; time is indeterminable; seconds seem like minutes and
hours like days. </p>

<p> &quot;Those who are accustomed to habitual use of the drug
are said eventually to develop a delirious rage after its
administration during which they are temporarily, at least,
irresponsible and prone to commit violent crimes. The prolonged
use of this narcotic is said to produce mental
deterioration.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the great difficulties with Cannabis is its
unpredictability. Physicians who have made hundreds of tests with
Cannabis report that there is no way to predict what effect it
have on the individual, both under controlled and noncontrolled
conditions. One man has no reaction at all; the next may go
berserk and try to stab somebody or harm himself. The medical
profession after many such experiments was forced to drop the
narcotic as a possible analgesic because of this unpredictable
quality. </p>

<p> Much of the most irrational juvenile violence and that has
written a new chapter of shame and tragedy is traceable directly
to this hemp intoxication. A gang of boys tear the clothes from
two school girls and rape the screaming girls, one boy after the
other. A sixteen-year-old kills his en tire family of five in
Florida, a man in Minnesota puts a bullet through the head of a
stranger on the road; in Colorado husband tries to shoot his
wife, kills her grandmother instead and then kills himself. Every
one of these crimes had been proceeded (sic) </p>

<p> by the smoking of one or more marijuana &quot;reefers.&quot;
As the marijuana situation grew worse, I knew action had to be
taken to get the proper legislation passed. By 1937 under my
direction, the Bureau launched two important steps First, a
legislative plan to seek from Congress a new law that would place
marijuana and its distribution directly under federal control.
Second, on radio and at major forums, such that presented
annually by the New York Herald Tribune, I told the story of this
evil weed of the fields and river beds and roadsides. I wrote
articles for magazines; our agents gave hundreds of lectures to
parents, educators, social and civic leaders. In network
broadcasts I reported on the growing list of crimes, including
murder and rape. I described the nature of marijuana and its
close kinship to hashish. I continued to hammer at the facts. </p>

<p> I believe we did a thorough job, for the public was alerted
and the laws to protect them were passed, both nationally and at
the state level. We also brought under control the wild growing
marijuana in this country. Working with local authorities, we
cleaned up hundreds of acres of marijuana we and uprooted plants
sprouting along the roadsides. </p>

<p> The 1937 law does not prohibit the sale of marijuana b puts a
tax of $100.00 an ounce on any sale or transfer of drug and makes
such sale or transfer illegal without proper registration and
approval from the Bureau. Possession without proper authorization
can bring a prison term. </p>

<p> The Marijuana Tax Act is patterned in general after the
Harrison Act, but with some major technical variations,
principally based on the fact that while marijuana is used in
laboratory tests it is not used for medical purposes. </p>

<p> There were still some WPA gangs working in those days and we
put them to good use. just outside the nation's capital, for some
sixty miles along the Potomac River, on both banks, marijuana was
growing in profusion; it had been planted there originally by
early settlers who made their own hemp and cloth. The workers
cleaned out tremendous river bank crops, destroying plants, seeds
and roots. AR through the Midwest also, WPA workers were used for
this clean-up job. The. wild hemp was rooted out of America. </p>

<p> During the Second World War, after Axis powers in the Far
East and Europe cut off our access to countries where hemp was
grown for the making of cord and cloth, we developed, under
strict controls, our own hemp growing program on the rich
farmlands of Minnesota. Less than one thousandth of one percent
was ever diverted into illegal channels. After the war this
production stopped and the fields went back to ,corn and wheat.
With the war's end, however, the narcotic branch of the
underworld was given a new lift by the publication of an
extraordinary document which has come to be known as the La
Guardia Report. </p>

<p> The title was a misnomer, it was actually a report of a
committee on marijuana which had been appointed by the
&quot;Little Flower&quot; of New York to give an objective
picture of marijuana from a scientific point of view. La Guardia
was always not only an honest official who warred against the
syndicate &quot;tin horns,&quot; as he called them, but was also
a good friend of Bureau of Narcotics. In Congress he fought
consistently for increases for our Bureau to help us to achieve
the power needed to do our job. </p>

<p> The men who issued this document were men of science doctors,
technicians, authorities Published as a book by the Jacques
Cattell Press in 1945, the report bore the tide: The Marijuana
Problem in the City of New York: Sociologic Medical,
Psychological and Pharmacological Studies, by the Mayor's
Committee on Marijuana. </p>

<p> This report declared, in effect, that those who had been
denouncing marijuana as dangerous, including myself and experts
in the Bureau, were not only in error, but were spreading
baseless fears about the effects of smoking Cannabis. I say the
report was a government printed invitation to youth and
adults-above all to teenagers-to go ahead and smoke all the
reefers they felt like. </p>

<p> Relying solely on a series of experiments with a group of 77
prisoners who volunteered to make the tests, the Mayor's experts
asserted that they found no major menace in the use of this
narcotic, which they termed &quot;a mild drug smoked by bored
people for the sake of conviviality.&quot; </p>

<p> The report further claimed that there was &quot;no
apparent&quot; connection between &quot;the weed&quot; and crimes
of violence, that smoking it did not produce aggressiveness or
belligerence as a rule, that it could be used for a number of
years without causing serious mental or physical harm and that
while it might be habit forming it could be given up abruptly
without causing distress; in other words, it did not produce the
bodily dependence found in heroin, cocaine, morphine and other
drugs. </p>

<p> Finally, the report suggested that the drug is so mild that
it might well be used successfully as a substitute in the process
of curing addiction to other drugs, or even in the treatment of
chronic alcoholism. </p>

<p> Doctors and other authorities who studied the effects of this
drug, however, tore the report apart for its inaccuracies and
misleading conclusions. The Journal of the American Medical
Association joined the. Bureau in condemning it as unscientific. </p>

<p> &quot;For many years medical scientists have considered
Cannabis a dangerous drug,&quot; the Journal's editorial of April
26, 1945 stated. &quot;Nevertheless. . . . the Mayor's Committee
on Marijuana submits an analysis by seventeen doctors of tests on
77 prisoners and, on this narrow and thoroughly unscientific
foundation, draws sweeping and inadequate conclusions which
minimize the harmlessness of marijuana. Already the book has done
harm. One investigator has described some tearful parents who
brought their 16-year-old boy to a physician after he had been
detected in the act of smoking marijuana. . . . The boy said he
had read an account of the La Guardia committee report and this
was his justification for using marijuana.. </p>

<p> A criminal lawyer for marijuana drug peddlers has already
used the La Guardia report as a basis to have defendants set free
by the Court. </p>

<p> &quot;The value of the conclusions,&quot; continued the
editorial, &quot;is destroyed by the fact that the experiments
were conducted on 77 confined criminals. Prisoners were obliged
to be content with the quantities of drug administered.
Antisocial behavior could not have been noticed, as they were
prisoners. At liberty some of them would have given free rein to
their inclinations and would probably not have stopped at the
dose producing 'the pleasurable principle. . . .' Public
officials will do well to disregard this unscientific, uncritical
study, and continue to regard marijuana as a menace where it is
purveyed,&quot; the Journal concluded. </p>

<p> There can be no doubt of the damage done by the report.
Syndicate lawyers and spokesmen leaped upon its giddy sociology
and medical mumbo-jumbo, cited it in court cases, tried to spread
the idea that the report had brought marijuana back into the
folds of good society with a full pardon and a slap on the back
front the medical profession. </p>

<p> The lies continued to spread. They cropped up on panel
discussions, in public addresses by seemingly informed
individuals. They helped once again, in a new and profitable
direction, to bewilder the public and make it unsure of its own
judgments. This carefully nurtured public doubt was to pay off
with extra millions in the pockets of the hoods. One killer who
helped to nourish that doubt-a hoodlum called Lepke took a
multi-million-dollar cut in exchange for the terror inspired by
the mere mention of his name.<br>

<h1>Roughing It </h1>

<p>Volume II </p>

<h2>Chapter XIII: The Gentle, Inoffensive Chinese </h2>

<p><strong>Mark Twain, 1871 </strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Of course there was a large Chinese population in Virginia
City - it is the case with every town and city on the Pacific
coast. They are a harmless race when white men either let them
alone or treat them no worse than dogs; in fact, they are almost
entirely harmless anyhow, for they seldom think of resenting the
vilest insults or the cruelest injuries. They are quiet,
peaceable, tractable, free from drunkenness, and they are as
industrious as the day is long. A disorderly Chinaman is rare,
and a lazy one does not exist. So long as a Chinaman has strength
to use his hands he needs no support from anybody; white men
often complain of want of work, but a Chinaman offers no such
complaint; he always manages to find something to do. He is a
great convenience to everybody - even to the worst class of white
men, for he bears the most of their sins, suffering fines for
their petty thefts, imprisonment for their robberies, and death
for their murders. Any white man can swear a Chinaman's life away
in the courts, but no Chinaman can testify against a white man.
Ours is the &quot;land of the free&quot; - nobody denies that -
nobody challenges it. [Maybe it is because we won't let other
people testify.] As I write, news comes that in broad daylight in
San Francisco, some boys have stoned an inoffensive Chinaman to
death, and that although a large crowd witnessed the shameful
deed, no one interfered. </p>

<p>There are seventy thousand (and possibly one hundred thousand)
Chinamen on the Pacific coast. There were about a thousand in
Virgina. They were penned into a &quot;Chinese quarter&quot; - a
thing which they do not particularly object to, as they are fond
of herding together. Their buildings were of wood; usually only
one story high, and set thickly together along streets scarcely
wide enough for a wagon to pass through. Their quarter was a
little removed from the rest of the town. The chief employment of
Chinamen in towns is to wash clothing. They always send a bill
pinned to the clothes. It is mere ceremony, for it does not
enlighten the customer much. Their price for washing was $2.50
per dozen - rather cheaper than white people could afford to wash
for at that time. A very common sign on the Chinese houses was:
&quot;See Yup, Washer and Ironer&quot;; &quot;Hong Wo,
Washer&quot;; &quot;Sam Sing &amp; Ah Hop, Washing.&quot; The
house-servants, cooks, etc., in California and Nevada, were
chiefly Chinamen. There were few white servants and no Chinawomen
so employed. Chinamen make good house-servants, being quick,
obedient, patient, quick to learn, and tirelessly industrious.
They do not need to be taught a thing twice, as a general thing.
They are imitative. If a Chinaman were to see his master break up
a center-table, in a passion, and kindle a fire with it, that
Chinaman would be likely to resort to the furniture for fuel
forever afterward. </p>

<p>All Chinamen can read, write, and cipher with easy facility -
pity but all our petted voters could. In California they rent
little patches of ground and do a deal of gardening. They will
raise surprising crops of vegetables on a sand-pile. They waste
nothing. What is rubbish to a Christian, a Chinaman carefully
preserves and makes useful in one way or another. He gathers up
all the old oyster and sardine cans that white people throw away,
and procures marketable tin and solder from them by melting. He
gathers up old bones and turns them into manure. In California he
gets a living out of old mining claims that white men have
abandoned as exhausted and worthless - and then the officers come
down on him once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the
legislature has given the broad, general name of
&quot;foreign&quot; mining tax, but it is usually inflicted on no
foreigners but Chinamen. This swindle has in some cases been
repeated once or twice on the same victim in the course of the
same month - but the public treasury was not additionally
enriched by it, probably. </p>

<p>Chinamen hold their dead in great reverence - they worship
their departed ancestors, in fact. Hence, in China, a man's front
yard, back yard, or any other part of his premises, is made his
family burying-ground, in order that he may visit the graves at
any and all times. Therefore that huge empire is one mighty
cemetery; it is ridged and wrinkled from its center to its
circumference with graves - and inasmuch as every foot of ground
must be made to do its utmost, in China, lest the swarming
population suffer for food, the very graves are cultivated and
yield a harvest, custom holding this to be no dishonor to the
dead. Since the departed are held in such worshipful reverence, a
Chinaman cannot bear that any indignity be offered the places
where they sleep. Mr. Burlingame said that herein lay China's
bitter opposition to railroads; a road could not be built
anywhere in the empire without disturbing the graves of their
ancestors or friends. </p>

<p>A Chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter except
his body lay in his beloved China; also, he desires to receive,
himself, after death, that worship with which he has honored his
dead that preceded him. Therefore, if he visits a foreign
country, he makes arrangements to have his bones returned to
China in case he dies; if he hires to go to a foreign country on
a labor contract, there is always a stipulation that his body
shall be taken back to China if he dies; if the government sells
a gang of coolies to a foreigner for the usual five-year term, it
is specified in the contract that their bodies shall be restored
to China in case of death. On the Pacific coast the Chinamen all
belong to one or another of several great companies or
organizations, and these companies keep track of their members,
register their names, and ship their bodies home when they die.
The See Yup Company is held to be the largest of these. The Ning
Yeong Company is next, and numbers eighteen thousand members on
the coast. Its headquarters are at San Francisco, where it has a
costly temple, several great officers (one of whom keeps regal
state in seclusion and cannot be approached by common humanity),
and a numerous priesthood. In it I was shown a register of its
members, with the dead and the date of their shipment to China
duly marked. Every ship that sails from San Francisco carries
away a heavy freight of Chinese corpses - or did, at least, until
the legislature, with an ingenious refinement of Christian
cruelty, forbade the shipments, as a neat underhanded way of
deterring Chinese immigration. The bill was offered, whether it
passed or not. It is my impression that it passed. There was
another bill - it became a law - compelling every incoming
Chinaman to be vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly-appointed
quack (no decent doctor would defile himself with such legalized
robbery) ten dollars for it. As few importers of Chinese would
want to go to an expense like that, the lawmakers thought this
would be another heavy blow to Chinese immigration. </p>

<p>What the Chinese quarter of Virginia was like - or, indeed,
what the Chinese quarter of any Pacific coast town was and is
like - may be gathered from this item which I printed in the
Enterprise while reporting for that paper: </p>

<p>Chinatown. - Accompanied by a fellow-reporter, we made a trip
through our Chinese quarter the other night. The Chinese have
built their portion of the city to suit themselves; and as they
keep neither carriages nor wagons, their streets are not wide
enough, as a general thing, to admit of the passage of vehicles.
At ten o'clock at night the Chinaman may be seen in all his
glory. In every little cooped-up, dingy cavern of a hut, faint
with the odor of burning Josh-lights and with nothing to see the
gloom by save the sickly, guttering tallow candle, were two or
three yellow, long-tailed vagabonds, coiled up on a sort of short
truckle-bed, smoking opium, motionless and with their lusterless
eyes turned inward from excess of satisfaction - or rather the
recent smoker looks thus, immediately after having passed the
pipe to his neighbor - for opium-smoking is a comfortless
operation, and requires constant attention. A lamp sits on the
bed, the length of the long pipe-stem from the smoker's mouth; he
puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire, sets it on fire, and
plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would fill a hole
with putty; then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds to
smoke - and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling
of the juices in the stem would well-nigh turn the stomach of a
statue. John likes it, though; it soothes him; he takes about two
dozen whiffs, and then rolls over to dream, Heaven only knows
what, for we could not imagine by looking at the soggy creature.
Possibly in his visions he travels far away from the gross world
and his regular washing, and feasts on succulent rats and
birds'-nests in Paradise. </p>

<p>Mr. Ah Sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at No.
13 Wang Street. He lavished his hospitality upon our party in the
friendliest way. He had various kinds of colored and colorless
wines and brandies, with unpronounceable names, imported from
China in little crockery jugs, and which he offered to us in
dainty little miniature wash-basins of porcelain. He offered us a
mess of birds'-nests; also, small, neat sausages, of which we
could have swallowed several yards if we had chosen to try, but
we suspected that each link contained the corpse of a mouse, and
therefore refrained. Mr. Sing had in his store a thousand
articles of merchandise, curious to behold, impossible to imagine
the uses of, and beyond our ability to describe. </p>

<p>His ducks, however, and his eggs, we could understand; the
former were split open and flattened out like codfish, and came
from China in that shape, and the latter were plastered over with
some kind of paste which kept them fresh and palatable through
the long voyage. </p>

<p>We found Mr. Hong Wo, No. 37 Chow-chow Street, making up a
lottery scheme - in fact, we found a dozen others occupied in the
same way in various parts of the quarter, for about every third
Chinaman runs a lottery, and the balance of the tribe
&quot;buck&quot; at it. &quot;Tom,&quot; who speaks faultless
English, and used to be chief and only cook to the Territorial
Enterprise, when the establishment kept bachelor's hall two years
ago, said that &quot;Sometime Chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap,
ketch um two tree hundred, sometime no ketch um anything; lottery
like one man fight um seventy - maybe he whip, maybe he get whip
herself, welly good.&quot; However, the percentage being
sixty-nine against him, the chances are, as a general thing, that
&quot;he get whip herself.&quot; We could not see that these
lotteries differed in any respect from our own, save that the
figures being Chinese, no ignorant white man might ever hope to
succeed in telling &quot;t'other from which&quot;; the manner of
drawing is similar to ours. </p>

<p>Mr. See Yup keeps a fancy store on Live Fox Street. He sold us
fans of white feathers, gorgeously ornamented; perfumery that
smelled like Limburger cheese, Chinese pens, and watch-charms
made of a stone unscratchable with steel instruments, yet
polished and tinted like the inner coat of a sea-shell. ^1 As
tokens of his esteem, See Yup presented the party with gaudy
plumes made of gold tinsel and trimmed with peacocks' feathers. </p>

<p>[Footnote 1: A peculiar species of the &quot;jade-stone&quot;
- to a Chinaman peculiarly precious.] </p>

<p>We ate chow-chow with chop-sticks in the celestial
restaurants; our comrade chided the moon-eyed damsels in front of
the houses for their want of feminine reserve; we received
protecting Josh-lights from our hosts and &quot;dickered&quot;
for a pagan god or two. Finally, we were impressed with the
genius of a Chinese bookkeeper; he figured up his accounts on a
machine like a gridiron with buttons strung on its bars; the
different rows represented units, tens, hundreds, and thousands.
He fingered them with incredible rapidity - in fact, he pushed
them from place to place as fast as a musical professor's fingers
travel over the keys of a piano. </p>

<p>They are a kindly-disposed, well-meaning race, and are
respected and well treated by the upper classes, all over the
Pacific coast. No Californian gentleman or lady ever abuses or
oppresses a Chinaman, under any circumstances, an explanation
that seems to be much needed in the East. Only the scum of the
population do it - they and their children; they, and, naturally
and consistently, the policemen and politicians, likewise, for
these are the dust-licking pimps and slaves of the scum, there as
well as elsewhere in America. </p>

<h1>Confessions of an English Opium Eater </h1>

<p> <b>by Thomas de Quincey</b> </p>

<p> <b>THE PLEASURES OF OPIUM</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> It is so long since I first took opium, that if it had been a
trifling incident in my life, I might have forgotten its date:
but cardinal events are not to be forgotten; and from
circumstances connected with it, I remember that it must be
referred to the autumn of 1804. During that season I was in
London, having come thither for the first time since my entrance
at college. </p>

<p> And my introduction to opium arose in the following way. From
an early age I had been accustomed to wash my head in cold water
at least once a day: being suddenly seized with toothache, I
attributed it to some relaxation caused by an accidental
intermission of that practice; jumped out of bed; plunged my head
into a basin of cold water; and with hair thus wetted went to
sleep. </p>

<p> The next morning, as I need hardly say, I awoke with
excruciating rheumatic pains of the head and face, from which I
had hardly any respite for about twenty days. On the twenty-first
day, I think it was, and on a Sunday, that I went out into the
streets; rather to run away, if possible, from my torments, than
with any distinct purpose. By accident I met a college
acquaintance who recommended opium. Opium! dread agent of
unimaginable pleasure and pain! I had heard of it as I had of
manna or of Ambrosia, but no further: how unmeaning a sound was
it at that time! what solemn chords does it now strike upon my
heart! what heart-quaking vibrations of sad and happy
remembrances! Reverting for a moment to these, I feel a mystic
importance attached to the minutest circumstances connected with
the place and the time, and the man (if man he was) that first
laid open to me the Paradise of Opium-eaters. It was a Sunday
afternoon, wet and cheerless: and a duller spectacle this earth
of ours has not to show than a rainy Sunday in London. My road
homewards lay through Oxford-street; and near &quot;the /stately/
Pantheon,&quot; (as Mr. Wordsworth has obligingly called it) I
saw a druggist's shop. The druggist -- unconscious minister of
celestial pleasures! -- as if in sympathy with the rainy Sunday,
looked dull and stupid, just as any mortal druggist might be
expected to look on a Sunday; and, when I asked for the tincture
of opium, he gave it to me as any other man might do: and
furthermore, out of my shilling, returned me what seemed to be
real copper halfpence, taken out of a real wooden drawer.
Nevertheless, in spite of such indications of humanity, he has
ever since existed in my mind as the beatific vision of an
immortal druggist, sent down to earth on a special mission to
myself. And it confirms me in this way of considering him, that,
when I next came up to London, I sought him near the stately
Pantheon, and found him not: and thus to me, who knew not his
name (if indeed he had one) he seemed rather to have vanished
from Oxford-street than to have removed in any bodily fashion.
The reader may choose to think of him as, possibly, no more than
a sublunary druggist: it may be so: but my faith is better: I
believe him to have evanesced,{1} or evaporated. So unwillingly
would I connect any mortal remembrances with that hour, and
place, and creature, that first brought me acquainted with the
celestial drug. </p>

<p> Arrived at my lodgings, it may be supposed that I lost not a
moment in taking the quantity prescribed. I was necessarily
ignorant of the whole art and mystery of opium-taking: and, what
I took, I took under every disadvantage. But I took it: -- and in
an hour, oh! Heavens! what a revulsion! what an upheaving, from
its lowest depths, of the inner spirit! what an apocalypse of the
world within me! That my pains had vanished, was now a trifle in
my eyes: -- this negative effect was swallowed up in the
immensity of those positive effects which had opened before me --
in the abyss of divine enjoyment thus suddenly revealed. Here was
a panacea - a [pharmakon nepenthez] for all human woes: here was
the secret of happiness, about which philosophers had disputed
for so many ages, at once discovered: happiness might now be
bought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat pocket: portable
ecstasies might be had corked up in a pint bottle: and peace of
mind could be sent down in gallons by the mail coach. But, if I
talk in this way, the reader will think I am laughing: and I can
assure him, that nobody will laugh long who deals much with
opium: its pleasures even are of a grave and solemn complexion;
and in his happiest state, the opium-eater cannot present himself
in the character of /Il Allegro/: even then, he speaks and thinks
as becomes /Il Penseroso/. Nevertheless, I have a very
reprehensible way of jesting at times in the midst of my own
misery: and, unless when I am checked by some more powerful
feelings, I am afraid I shall be guilty of this indecent practice
even in these annals of suffering or enjoyment. The reader must
allow a little to my infirm nature in this respect: and with a
few indulgences of that sort, I shall endeavour to be as grave,
if not drowsy, as fits a theme like opium, so anti-mercurial as
it really is, and so drowsy as it is falsely reputed. </p>

<p> And, first, one word with respect to its bodily effects: for
upon all that has been hitherto written on the subject of opium,
whether by travelers in Turkey (who may plead their privilege of
lying as an old immemorial right), or by professors of medicine,
writing /ex cathedra/, -- I have but one emphatic criticism to
pronounce -- Lies! lies! lies! I remember once, in passing a
book-stall, to have caught these words from a page of some
satiric author: -- &quot;By this time I became convinced that the
London newspapers spoke truth at least twice a week, viz. on
Tuesday and Saturday, and might safely be depended upon for --
the list of bankrupts.&quot; In like manner, I do by no means
deny that some truths have been delivered to the world in regard
to opium: thus it has been repeatedly affirmed by the learned,
that opium is a dusky brown in colour; and this, take notice, I
grant: secondly, that it is rather dear; which I also grant: for
in my time, East-India opium has been three guineas a pound, and
Turkey eight: and, thirdly, that if you eat a good deal of it,
most probably you must -- do what is particularly disagreeable to
any man of regular habits, viz. die.{2} These weighty
propositions are, all and singular, true: I cannot gainsay them:
and truth ever was, and will be, commendable. But in these three
theorems, I believe we have exhausted the stock of knowledge as
yet accumulated by man on the subject of opium. And therefore,
worthy doctors, as there seems to be room for further
discoveries, stand aside, and allow me to come forward and
lecture on this matter. </p>

<p> First, then, it is not so much affirmed as taken for granted,
by all who ever mention opium, formally or incidentally, that it
does, or can, produce intoxication. Now reader, assure yourself,
/meo periculo/, that no quantity of opium ever did, or could
intoxicate. As to the tincture of opium (commonly called
laudanum) /that/ might certainly intoxicate if a man could bear
to take enough of it; but why? because it contains so much proof
spirit, and not because it contains so much opium. But crude
opium, I affirm peremptorily, is incapable of producing any state
of body at all resembling that which is produced by alcohol; and
not in /degree/ only incapable, but even in /kind/: it is not in
the quantity of its effects merely, but in the quality, that it
differs altogether. The pleasure given by wine is always
mounting, and tending to a crisis, after which it declines: that
from opium, when once generated, is stationary for eight or ten
hours: the first, to borrow a technical distinction from
medicine, is a case of acute - the second, of chronic pleasure:
the one is a flame, the other a steady and equable glow. But the
main distinction lies in this, that whereas wine disorders the
mental faculties, opium, on the contrary (if taken in a proper
manner), introduces amongst them the most exquisite order,
legislation, and harmony. Wine robs a man of his self possession:
opium greatly invigorates it. Wine unsettles and clouds the
judgment, and gives a preternatural brightness, and a vivid
exaltation to the contempts and the admirations, the loves and
the hatreds, of the drinker: opium, on the contrary, communicates
serenity and equipoise to all the faculties, active or passive:
and with respect to the temper and moral feelings in general, it
gives simply that sort of vital warmth which is approved by the
judgment, and which would probably always accompany a bodily
constitution of primeval or antediluvian health. Thus, for
instance, opium, like wine, gives an expansion to the heart and
the benevolent affections: but then, with this remarkable
difference, that in the sudden development of kind-heartedness
which accompanies inebriation, there is always more or less of a
maudlin character, which exposes it to the contempt of the
by-stander. Men shake hands, swear eternal friendship, and shed
tears -- no mortal knows why: and the sensual creature is clearly
uppermost. But the expansion of the benigner feelings, incident
to opium, is no febrile access, but a healthy restoration to that
state which the mind would naturally recover upon the removal of
any deep- seated irritation of pain that had disturbed and
quarrelled with the impulses of a heard originally just and good.
True it is, that even wine, up to a certain point, and with
certain men, rather tends to exalt and to steady the intellect: I
myself, who have never been a great wine-drinker, used to find
that half a dozen glasses of wine advantageously affected the
faculties -- brightened and intensified the consciousness -- and
gave to the mind a feeling of being &quot;ponderibus librata
suis:&quot; and certainly it is most absurdly said, in popular
language, of any man, that he is /disguised/ in liquor: for, on
the contrary, most men are disguised by sobriety; and it is when
they are drinking (as some old gentleman says in Athenaeus), that
men [eantonz emfanixondin oitinez eidin]. -- display themselves
in their true complexion of character; which surely is not
disguising themselves. But still, wine constantly leads a man to
the brink of absurdity and extravagance; and, beyond a certain
point, it is sure to volatilize and to disperse the intellectual
energies: whereas opium always seems to compose what had been
agitated, and to concentrate what had been distracted. In short,
to sum up all in one word, a man who is inebriated, or tending to
inebriation, is, and feels that he is, in a condition which calls
up into supremacy the merely human, too often the brutal, part of
his nature: but the opium-eater (I speak of him who is not
suffering from any disease, or other remote effects of opium)
feels that the diviner part of his nature is paramount; that is,
the moral affections are in a state of cloudless serenity; and
over all is the great light of the majestic intellect. </p>

<p> This is the doctrine of the true church on the subject of
opium: of which church I acknowledge myself to be the only member
-- the alpha and the omega: but then it is to be recollected,
that I speak from the ground of a large and profound personal
experience: whereas most of the unscientific{3} authors who have
at all treated of opium, and even of those who have written
expressly on the materia medica, make it evident, from the horror
they express of it, that their experimental knowledge of its
action is none at all. I will, however, candidly acknowledge that
I have met with one person who bore evidence to its intoxicating
power, such as staggered my own incredulity: for he was a
surgeon, and had himself taken opium largely. I happened to say
to him, that his enemies (as I had heard) charged him with
talking nonsense on politics, and that his friends apologized for
him, by suggesting that he was constantly in a state of
intoxication from opium. Now the accusation, said I, is not
/prima facie/, and of necessity, an absurd one: but the defence
/is/. To my surprise, however, he insisted that both his enemies
and his friends were in the right: &quot;I will maintain,&quot;
said he, &quot;that I /do/ talk nonsense; and secondly, I will
maintain that I do not talk nonsense upon principle, or with any
view to profit, but solely and simply, said he, solely and
simply, -- solely and simply (repeating it three times over),
because I am drunk with opium; and /that/ daily.&quot; I replied
that, as to the allegation of his enemies, as it seemed to be
established upon such respectable testimony, seeing that the
three parties concerned all agreed in it, it did not become me to
question it; but the defence set up I must demur to. He proceeded
to discuss the matter, and to lay down his reasons: but it seemed
to me so impolite to pursue an argument which must have presumed
a man mistaken in a point belonging to his own profession, that I
did not press him even when his course of argument seemed open to
objection: not to mention that a man who talks nonsense, even
though &quot;with no view to profit,&quot; is not altogether the
most agreeable partner in a dispute, whether as opponent or
respondent. I confess, however, that the authority of a surgeon,
and one who was reputed a good one, may seem a weighty one to my
prejudice: but still I must plead my experience, which was
greater than his greatest by 7000 drops a day; and, though it was
not possible to suppose a medical man unacquainted with the
characteristic symptoms of vinous intoxication, it yet struck me
that he might proceed on a logical error of using the word
intoxication with too great latitude, and extending it
generically to all modes of nervous excitement, connected with
certain diagnostics. Some people have maintained, in my hearing,
that they had been drunk on green tea: and a medical student in
London, for whose knowledge in his profession I have reason to
feel great respect, assured me, the other day, that a patient, in
recovering from an illness, had got drunk on a beef-steak. </p>

<p> Having dwelt so much on this first and leading error, in
respect to opium, I shall notice very briefly a second and a
third; which are, that the elevation of spirits produced by opium
is necessarily followed by a proportionate depression, and that
the natural and even immediate consequence of opium is torpor and
stagnation, animal and mental. The first of these errors I shall
content myself with simply denying; assuring my reader, that for
ten years, during which I took opium at intervals, the day
succeeding to that on which I allowed myself this luxury was
always a day of unusually good spirits. </p>

<p> With respect to the torpor supposed to follow, or rather (if
we were to credit the numerous pictures of Turkish opium-eaters)
to accompany the practice of opium-eating, I deny that also.
Certainly, opium is classed under the head of narcotics; and some
such effect it may produce in the end: but the primary effects of
opium are always, and in the highest degree, to excite and
stimulate the system: this first stage of its action always
lasted with me, during my novitiate, for upwards of eight hours;
so that it must be the fault of the opium-eater himself if he
does not so time his exhibition of the dose (to speak medically)
as that the whole weight of its narcotic influence may descend
upon his sleep. Turkish opium-eaters, it seems, are absurd enough
to sit, like so many equestrian statues, on logs of wood as
stupid as themselves. But that the reader may judge of the degree
in which opium is likely to stupify the faculties of an
Englishman, I shall (by way of treating the question
illustratively, rather than argumentively) describe the way in
which I myself often passed an opium evening in London, during
the period between 1804-1812. It will be seen, that at least
opium did not move me to seek solitude, and much less to seek
inactivity, or the torpid state of self- involution ascribed to
the Turks. I give this account at the risk of being pronounced a
crazy enthusiast or visionary: but I regard /that/ little: I must
desire my reader to bear in mind, that I was a hard student, and
at severe studies for all the rest of my time: and certainly had
a right occasionally to relaxations as well as the other people:
these, however, I allowed myself but seldom. </p>

<p> The late Duke of Norfolk used to say, &quot;Next Friday, by
the blessing of Heaven, I purpose to be drunk:&quot; and in like
manner I used to fix beforehand how often, within a given time,
and when, I would commit a debauch of opium. This was seldom more
than once in three weeks: for at that time I could no have
ventured to call every day (as I did afterwards) for &quot;/a
glass of laudanum negus, warm, and without sugar/.&quot; No: as I
have said, I seldom drank laudanum, at that time, more than once
in three weeks: this was usually on a Tuesday or a Saturday
night; my reason for which was this. In those days Grassini sang
at the Opera: and her voice was delightful to me beyond all that
I had ever heard. I know not what may be the state of the Opera-
house now, having never been within its walls for seven or eight
years, but at that time it was by much the most pleasant place of
public resort in London for passing an evening. Five shillings
admitted one to the gallery, which was subject to far less
annoyance than the pit of the theatres: the orchestra was
distinguished by its sweet and melodious grandeur from all
English orchestras, the composition of which, I confess, is not
acceptable to my ear, from the predominance of the clangorous
instruments, and the absolute tyranny of the violin. The choruses
were divine to hear: and when Grassini appeared in some
interlude, as she often did, and poured forth her passionate soul
as Andromache, at the tomb of Hector, &amp;c. I question whether
any Turk, of all that ever entered the Paradise of opium-eaters,
can have had half the pleasure I had. But, indeed, I honour the
Barbarians too much by supposing them capable of any pleasures
approaching to the intellectual ones of an Englishman. For music
is an intellectual or a sensual pleasure, according to the
temperament of him who hears it. And, by the bye, with the
exception of the fine extravaganza on that subject in Twelfth
Night, I do not recollect more than one thing said adequately on
the subject of music in all literature: it is a passage in the
/Religio Medici/{4} of Sir T. Brown; and, though chiefly
remarkable for its sublimity, has also a philosophic value,
inasmuch as it points to the true theory of musical effects. The
mistake of most people is to suppose that it is by the ear they
communicate with music, and, therefore, that they are purely
passive to its effects. But this is not so: it is by the
re-action of the mind upon the notices of the ear, (the /matter/
coming by the senses, the /form/ from the mind) that the pleasure
is constructed: and therefore it is that people of equally good
ear differ so much in this point from one another. Now opium, by
greatly increasing the activity of the mind generally, increases,
of necessity, that particular mode of its activity by which we
are able to construct out of the raw material of organic sound an
elaborate intellectual pleasure. But, says a friend, a succession
of musical sounds is to me like a collection of Arabic
characters: </p>

<p> I can attach no ideas to them. Ideas! my good sir? there is
no occasion for them: all that class of ideas, which can be
available in such a case, has a language of representative
feelings. But this is a subject foreign to my present purposes:
it is sufficient to say, that a chorus, &amp;c. of elaborate
harmony, displayed before me, as in a piece of arras work, the
whole of my past life -- not, as if recalled by an act of memory,
but as if present and incarnated in the music: no longer painful
to dwell upon: but the detail of its incidents removed, or
blended in some hazy abstraction; and its passions exalted,
spiritualized, and sublimed. All this was to be had for five
shillings. And over and above the music of the stage and the
orchestra, I had all around me, in the intervals of the
performance, the music of the Italian language talked by Italian
women: for the gallery was usually crowded with Italians: and I
listened with a pleasure such as that with which Weld the
traveller lay and listened, in Canada, to the sweet laughter of
Indian women; for the less you understand of a language, the more
sensible you are to the melody or harshness of its sounds: for
such a purpose, therefore, it was an advantage to me that I was a
poor Italian scholar, reading it but little, and not speaking it
at all, nor understanding a tenth part of what I heard spoken. </p>

<p> These were my Opera pleasures: but another pleasure I had
which, as it could be had only on a Saturday night, occasionally
struggled with my love of the Opera; for, at that time, Tuesday
and Saturday were the regular Opera nights. On this subject I am
afraid I shall be rather obscure, but, I can assure the reader,
not at all more so than Marinus in his life of Proclus, or many
other biographers and auto-biographers of fair reputation. This
pleasure, I have said, was to be had only on a Saturday night.
What then was Saturday night to me more than any other night? I
had no labours that I rested from; no wages to receive: what
needed I to care for Saturday night, more than as it was a
summons to hear Grassini? True, most logical reader: what you say
is unanswerable. And yet so it was and is, that, whereas
different men throw their feelings into different channels, and
most are apt to show their interest in the concerns of the poor,
chiefly by sympathy, expressed in some shape or other, with their
distresses and sorrows, I, at that time, was disposed to express
my interest by sympathising with their pleasures. The pains of
poverty I had lately seen too much of; more than I wished to
remember: but the pleasures of the poor, their consolations of
spirit, and their reposes from bodily toil, can never become
oppressive to contemplate. </p>

<p> Now Saturday night is the season for the chief, regular, and
periodic return of rest to the poor: in this point the most
hostile sects unite, and acknowledge a common link of
brotherhood: almost all Christendom rests from its labours. It is
a rest introductory to another rest: and divided by a whole day
and two nights from the renewal of toil. On this account I feel
always, on a Saturday night, as though I also were released from
some yoke of labour, had some wages to receive, and some luxury
of repose to enjoy. For the sake, therefore, of witnessing, upon
as large a scale as possible, a spectacle with which my sympathy
was so entire, I used often, on Saturday nights, after I had
taken opium, to wander forth, without much regarding the
direction or the distance, to all the markets, and other parts of
London, to which the poor resort on a Saturday night, for laying
out their wages. Many a family party, consisting of a man, his
wife, and sometimes one or two of his children, have I listened
to, as they stood consulting on their ways and means, or the
strength of their exchequer, or the price of household articles.
Gradually I became familiar with their wishes, their
difficulties, and their opinions. Sometimes there might be heard
murmurs of discontent: but far oftener expressions on the
countenance, or uttered in words, of patience, hope, and
tranquility. And taken generally, I must say, that, in this point
at least, the poor are far more philosophic than the rich - that
they show a more ready and cheerful submission to what they
consider as irremediably evils, or irreparable losses. Whenever I
saw occasion, or could do it without appearing to be intrusive, I
joined their parties; and gave my opinion upon the matter in
discussion, which, if not always judicious, was always received
indulgently. If wages were a little higher, or expected to be so,
or the quartern loaf a little lower, or it was reported that
onions and butter were expected to fall, I was glad: yet, if the
contrary were true, I drew from opium some means of consoling
myself. For opium (like the bee, that extracts its materials
indiscriminately from roses and from the soot of chimneys) can
overrule all feelings into a compliance with the master key. </p>

<p> Some of these rambles led me to great distances: for an
opium-eater is too happy to observe the motion of time. And
sometimes in my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical
principles, by fixing my eye on the pole-star, and seeking
ambitiously for a north-west passage, instead of circumnavigating
all the capes and head-lands I had doubled in my outward voyage,
I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys, such
enigmatical entries, and such sphynx's riddles of streets without
thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of
porters, and confound the intellects of hackney- coachmen. I
could almost have believed, at times, that I must be the first
discoverer of some of these /terrae incognitae/, and doubted,
whether they had yet been aid down in the modern charts of
London. For all this, however, I paid a heavy price in distant
years, when the human face tyrannized over my dreams, and the
perplexities of my steps in London came back and haunted my
sleep, with the feeling of perplexities moral or intellectual,
that brought confusion to the reason, or anguish and remorse to
the conscience. </p>

<p> Thus I have shown that opium does not, of necessity, produce
inactivity or torpor; but that, on the contrary, it often led me
into markets and theatres. Yet, in candour, I will admit that
markets and theatres are not the appropriate haunts of the
opium-eater, when in the divinest state incident to his
enjoyment. In that state, crowds become an oppression to him;
music even, too sensual and gross. He naturally seeks solitude
and silence, as indispensable conditions of those trances, or
profoundest reveries, which are the crown and consummation of
what opium can do for human nature. I, whose disease it was to
meditate too much, and to observe too little, and who, upon my
first entrance at college, was nearly falling into a deep
melancholy, from brooding too much on the sufferings which I had
witnessed in London, was sufficiently aware of the tendencies of
my own thoughts to do all I could to counteract them. -- I was,
indeed, like a person who, according to the old legend, had
entered the cave of Trophonius: and the remedies I sought were to
force myself into society, and to keep my understanding in
continual activity upon matters of science. But for these
remedies, I should certainly have become hypochondriacally
melancholy. In after years, however, when my cheerfulness was
more fully re-established, I yielded to my natural inclination
for a solitary life. And, at that time, I often fell into these
reveries upon taking opium; and more than once it has happened to
me, on a summer-night, when I have been at an open window, in a
room from which I could overlook the sea at a mile below me, and
could command a view of the great town of Liverpool, at about the
same distance, that I have sate, from sun-set to sun-rise,
motionless, and without wishing to move. </p>

<p> I shall be charged with mysticism, behmenism, quietism,
&amp;c. but /that/ shall not alarm me. Sir H. Vane, the younger,
was one of our wisest men: and let my readers see if he, in his
philosophical works, be half as unmystical as I am. -- I say,
then, that it has often struck me that the scene itself was
somewhat typical of what took place in such a reverie. The town
of Liverpool represented the earth, with its sorrows and its
graves left behind, yet not out of sight, nor wholly forgotten.
The ocean, in everlasting but gentle agitation, and brooded over
by a dove-like calm, might not unfitly typify the mind and the
mood which then swayed it. For it seemed to me as if then first I
stood at a distance, and aloof from the uproar of life; as if the
tumult, the fever, and the strife, were suspended; a respite
granted from the secret burthens of the heart; a sabbath of
repose; a resting from human labours. Here were the hopes which
blossom in the paths of life, reconciled with the peace which is
in the grave; motions of the intellect as unwearied as the
heavens, yet for all anxieties a halcyon calm: a tranquility that
seemed no product of inertia, but as if resulting from mighty and
equal antagonisms; infinite activities, infinite repose. </p>

<p> Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of
poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for
&quot;the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel,&quot; bringest
and assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that with thy potent rhetoric
stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for
one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed
pure from blood; and to the proud man, a brief oblivion for
Wrongs unredress'd, and insults unavenged; that summonest to the
chancery of dreams, for the triumphs of suffering innocence,
false witnesses; and confoundest perjury; and dost reverse the
sentences of unrighteous judges: -- thou buildest upon the bosom
of darkness, out of the fantastic imagery of the brain, cities
and temples, beyond the art of Phidias and Praxiteles -- beyond
the splendour of Babylon and Hekatompylos: and &quot;from the
anarchy of dreaming sleep,&quot; callest into sunny light the
faces of long-buried beauties, and the blessed household
countenances, cleansed from the &quot;dishonours of the
grave.&quot; Thou only givest these gifts to man; and thou hast
the keys of Paradise, oh, just, subtle, and mighty opium! </p>

<p> ----- </p>

<p> {1} /Evanesced:/ -- this way of going off the stage of life
appears to have been well known in the 17th century, but at the
time to have been considered a peculiar privilege of blood-royal,
and by no means to be allowed to druggists. For about the year
1686, a poet of rather ominous name (and who, by the bye, did
ample justice to his name), viz. Mr. Flat-man, in speaking of the
death of Charles II. expresses his surprise that any prince
should commit so absurd an act as dying; because, says he, </p>

<p> Kings should disdain to die, and only /disappear./ </p>

<p> They should /abscond/, that is, into the other world. </p>

<p> {2} Of this, however, the learned appear latterly to have
doubted: for in a pirated edition of Buchan's /Domestic
Medicine/, which I once saw in the hands of a farmer's wife who
was studying it for the benefit of her health, the Doctor was
made to say -- &quot;Be particularly careful never to take above
five- and-twenty /ounces/ of laudanum at once;&quot; the true
reading being probably five- and-twenty /drops/, which are held
equal to about one grain of crude opium. </p>

<p> {3} Amongst the great herd of travellers, &amp;c. who show
sufficiently by their stupidity that they never held any
intercourse with opium, I must caution my readers especially
against the brilliant author of /&quot;Anastasius.&quot;/ This
gentleman, whose wit would lead one to presume him an
opium-eater, has made it impossible to consider him in that
character from the grievous misrepresenta-tion which he gives of
its effects, at pp. 215-17, of vol. I. - Upon consideration it
must appear such to the author himself: for, waiving the errors I
have insisted on in the text, which (and others) are adopted in
the fullest manner, he will himself admit, that an old gentleman
&quot;with a snow-white beard,&quot; who eats &quot;ample doses
of opium,&quot; and is yet able to deliver what is meant and
received as very weighty counsel on the bad effects of that
practice, is but an indifferent evidence that opium either kills
people prematurely, or sends them into a madhouse. But, for my
part, I see into this old gentleman and his motives: the fact is,
he was enamoured of &quot;the little golden receptacle of the
pernicious drug&quot; which Anastasius carried about him; and no
way of obtaining it so safe and so feasible occurred, as that of
frightening its owner out of his wits (which, by the bye, are
none of the strongest). This commentary throws a new light upon
the case, and greatly improves it as a story: for the old
gentleman's speech, considered as a lecture on pharmacy, is
highly absurd: but, considered as a hoax on Anastasius, it reads
excellently. </p>

<p> {4} I have not the book at this moment to consult: but I
think the passage begins -- &quot;And even that tavern music,
which makes one man merry, another mad, in me strikes a deep fit
of devotion,&quot; &amp;c. <br>

<p> Another important claimant for credit in bringing about the
legislation was a young Conservative in Vancouver, H. H. Stevens.
Stevens became a very vocal MP during the narcotics debates of
the 1920s, and personally introduced several important
amendments. His zeal for narcotic drug prohibition was kindled
during his early investigations of the problem. </p>

<p> According to his own account, when he learned about the
gambling and opium trade being carried on in Vancouver's
Chinatown, he took the following actions: </p>

<p> I took it up with the Chief of Police, but he just brushed me
off. Then I went down into Chinatown itself, and visited the
gambling joints and also saw personally the Chinese preparing raw
opium for the market. When the Chief of Police refused to take
any action, I used to publish in the _Vancouver News Advertiser_
exactly what I had seen the night before. This I did for several
weeks. It created quite a sensation in Vancouver, and as a result
the civic authorities discharged the Chief and appointed Mr.
Chamberlain. This man, when he became Chief of Police, did an
excellent job in clearing up Chinatown(29). </p>

<p> He described his role in bringing about the first opium Act
as follows: </p>

<p> (In 1908) I was responsible for the matter being brought to
the attention of the then government. I remember taking some very
prominent eastern gentlemen around Pacific Coast cities and
showing them the effects and use of these drugs. They returned to
Ottawa and put it up to Sir Wilfred Laurier, and the result was
the Bill that was introduced(13d,p.2899). </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The motives of H. H. Stevens and of the city councils are
open to question. They appear in this instance to have been
concerned about moral reform and civic order but all were
associated with anti-Chinese policies in other contexts. Stevens
came to be recognized as the &quot;the city's leading
anti-Oriental spokesman&quot; (30, p.91), in Parliament as at
local rallies. Civic politicians, too, had an anti-Chinese
rhetoric as part of their election kit and, once elected, usually
supported the use of municipal ordinances and licensing powers
for discriminatory purposes. </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The League's (Vancouver Anti-Opium League) representations to
King(Mackenzie) included an urgent telegram at the time when the
Bill was being sent to the Senate and the opium manufacturers
were lobbying for a moratorium to protect their financial
interests. </p>

<p> INFORM GOVERNMENT NOT TO LET MANUFACTURERS DELAY LEGISTAION.
CHINESE AT LARGE FAVOUR IMMEDIATE SUPPRESSION(2d). </p>

<p> &lt;End pgs 66-68&gt; </p>

<p> &lt;Begin pg 203&gt; </p>

<p> THE PUBLIC </p>

<p> Interested sections of the public became very vocal and
active during the same period in in demanding more severe
penalties. The cry for heavier punishment was the result of a
drug scare created almost entirely by alarmist stories in the
mass media. The stories, of which Emily Murphy's articles in
_Maclean's_ were a prime example, reinforced pre-existing
hostility to Orientals and augmented the horrifying spectre of
the &quot;dope fiend.&quot; The negative racial stereotypes and
alarming drug mythology, spread by people who claimed to have
first-hand knowledge, were accepted uncritically. The immediate
result of these fears and hostility was the emergence of a
British Columbia drug lobby in 1921, with the straightforward
goals of compulsory imprisonment and whipping for all traffickers
and, where possible, deportation. Public fears about narcotic
drugs were particularly intense in British Columbia, the province
with the largest concentration of Chinese immigrants.
Accordingly, the greatest pressure on legislators for severe
penalties originated in that province. Much of the demand for
greater punitiveness was linked to animus against the Chinese and
a desire to get rid of them, seen most clearly in the proposal
for deportation. </p>

<p><font size="3">AN &quot;OPIUM JOINT&quot; RAIDED.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">LEE YOUNG'S PLACE ON PARK STREET CLEANED OUT BY
THE POLICE.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">All the Chinese resorts in the Sixth Precinct
are closely watched to note visits of girls of tender age, who
are, in a certain sense, wards of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. So last evening, when a girl of twelve
years halted in front of Lee Young's opium joint, 104 Park
Street, looked up and down the street in a half- scared way, and
went swiftly into the place, which is one step down, Detective
Joseph Schirmer was alert, and when, ten minutes later, she came
out she was followed until out of sight of those who were
lounging about the den, and then accosted and taken to the
Elizabeth Street Station House.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">She began to tell a number of stories and
endeavored to make Capt. Brooks believe that she was enticed into
the place. No harm befell her, she said, but a Chinaman chatted
with her while she watched a number of his countrymen who were
smoking opium. This was evidence enough to warrant a raid, and
the reserve force of the precinct was called out and a descent
was made on the den.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Lee Young and fourteen other Celestials were
arrested and locked up. Eleven pipes, 15 bowls, 8 pots, and 5
boxes of opium, 6 &quot;lay outs,&quot; 4 trays, scales, 2
revolvers, and $82 in money were seized. Then the girl, who is
Catherine Schuyler of 123 Monroe Street, was again questioned and
she admitted that she was sent to the den to buy 10 cents worth
of opium for Annie Golden of Jefferson and Monroe Streets. No
such person was found and after Catherine's parents had been
visited the police were of the opinion that a woman in their
house sent the child for the drug.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Catherine was sent to the headquarters of Mr.
Gerry's society, and will be at the Tombs today, when the
prisoners are arraigned.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Young's &quot;joint&quot; was raided a short
time ago, when it was kept by Hung Lung. Nineteen persons were
arrested, and six of them who were found smoking opium were fined
$25 each. No one was smoking when the police burst into the
place, which is about 8 by 14 feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opinions of over 100 Physicians on the use of
Opium in China</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Compiled by William Hector Park</font></p>

<p><font size="3">American Presbyterian Mission Press, Shanghai,
1899</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Alcohol and Opium Compared.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By W.H. Park, M.D.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[ALCOHOL] 1. Of the millions of regular users
of alcohol a lamentably large number become slaves to the alcohol
habit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2. Numbers of people boast of their
&quot;personal liberty&quot; and claim that they can drink or not
just as they choose. All moderate drinkers (people who never get
drunk, and yet who take wine or beer daily with their meals and
social glasses of something stronger as occasions arise) claim
that they are not slaves to alcohol, that they are not weakened
by it physically, and that its withdrawal entails no special
inconvenience; and they would be highly insulted if any one
should intimate that they are being thereby morally or socially
degraded.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">3. Nevertheless, every one nipping alcohol
occasionally is in danger of forming the alcohol habit, and if
one takes it daily for any length of time the danger is
increased. The only safe rule is never to touch it. The slavish
appetite is developed gradually in most cases, and, in strong
willed people, its confirmation may be a matter of years.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">4. People take to drink on account of trouble
and sorrow, and sometimes for pain and disease, some claiming
that it is prophylactic against certain diseases.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">5. I had a classmate who said his father told
him he might take a little whiskey whenever he felt ill, and he
had not experienced a well day since.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">6. A sailor once told me how he alone of a
whole ship's company escaped yellow fever in a certain South
American city by lying ashore &quot;dead drunk&quot; the whole
time the ship was in port.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">7. The claim is constantly made that a moderate
amount of alcohol consumed daily can be reckoned as food and that
it is only excess that is injurious. Some recent French
authorities have set one liter of wine per day as the maximum
amount a healthy man can imbibe without injury.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">8. &quot;All excess is injurious. North-pole
voyages, military expeditions (experiences in India and the
Ashantee march), and the diminished power of resistance to the
cold shown by drunkards, have conclusively demonstrated that
alcohol does not supply the place of other foods; and that those
habituated to its use, damaged as they are in their vital organs,
do not possess the same endurance of fatigue and the same power
of resistance to external morbific influences as do the healthy.
Furthermore, clinical experience has amply proved that topers do
not bear chloroform well, that they succumb more quickly to
injuries and surgical operations, and that they possess much less
power of resistance than the temperate to the inroads of acute
disease.&quot;--Bartholow.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">9. That the drunkard wastes his time is no
small indictment against the alcohol habit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">10. In this country if a drinker falls ill, as
a rule, he stops his allowance, and if the disease proves a
chronic one, he never goes back to it. 11. A physician can direct
his patient to abstain from drink with a fair prospect of being
obeyed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">12. Persons who give way to drink, and become
inebriates, are in these days regarded by some as moral imbeciles
who if they did not drink would take up some other vice just as
bad or perhaps worse. Banish the saloon, however, and in my
opinion the majority of them would become respectable citizens.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">13. We look down on saloons and underground
places where liquor is sold and gambling allowed, and often refer
to them as &quot;hells.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">14. In most drunkards there still seems to be
some spark of manhood left, still something to which we can
appeal, still some hope of reformation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">15. Alcohol is not often used for suicidal
purposes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">16. The drunkard neglects wife and children,
pawns their clothes for drink, beats, and on occasion murders
them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">17. The drunkard is aggressive, quarrelsome and
ready to fight.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">18. The drunkard becomes befuddled and loses
all the money he has on his person, or grows generous and gives
it away, or wastes his substance in riotous living.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">19. Alcoholism tends to beggary, and nearly all
beggars, thieves and tramps are given to drink.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">20. Alcohol has been used all over China from
time immemorial and yet drunkards are comparatively rare.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">[OPIUM]</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1. Of the million of regular users of opium all
become slaves to the opium habit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2. A few Chinese, who only smoke occasionally,
in transacting business or on meeting a friend, claim that they
can smoke or not just as they choose, but no one who smokes
daily, be the amount ever so small, makes any such claim. When a
man admits that he &quot;smokes a pipe or two&quot; he knows, and
his friends know, that he is a confirmed opium smoker. He also
knows that he is weakened physically and that he cannot give it
up without inconvenience--nay, even suffering--and he is not
insulted if you tell him he is being thereby morally and
physically degraded.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">3. Every one &quot;hitting the pipe&quot;
occasionally is in danger of forming the opium habit, and if one
smokes daily for any length of time the danger is not simply
increased--it becomes absolute. The habit is certain and the
confirmation thereof sure. The habit is formed quickly. Not one
in a thousand, be the will ever so strong, can smoke opium daily
for a year (I might almost say for three months) without forming
the opium habit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">4 and 5. People take opium on account of
trouble and sorrow, and as for pain and disease it is the
greatest earthly soother. That opium will relieve pain and may be
prophylactic against certain disease is no argument in favor of
allowing its unrestricted sales among any people. On the
contrary, the opium habit being so much worse than the diseases
it may alleviate or prevent, this is the strongest possible
argument in favor of its restriction. If it permanently cured all
pain and prevented all disease all would be tempted to take to it
and the human race would be in danger of extermination.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">6. How would one's parents and friends at home
feel if he should write that he had rendered himself proof
against all the deadly diseases of the East by becoming an opium
smoker!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">7. Opium can never be reckoned as a food. It is
true that the opium smoker eats less, but this is because his
secretions are diminished so that he becomes constipated, and as
it were uses his food over and over again. Ugh! It makes me sick
to think about it. No wonder he suffers from auto-toxaemia, and
becomes yellow, weak and emaciated. The amount of opium a healthy
person can consume daily without injury is absolutely nil. There
is no room for the comparative degree in opium smoking. Any
amount is already too much.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">8. All opium smoking is injurious. An opium
smoking soldier is not worth the powder and lead it would take to
kill him. The weakness and the diminished power of endurance
shown by opium smokers have conclusively demonstrated that opium
does not supply the place of the food it supplants; and that
those habituated to its use, damaged as they are in every fiber,
do not possess the same endurance of fatigue and the same power
of resistance to external morbific influences as to the healthy.
Furthermore, clinical experience has amply proved that opium
smokers do not bear chloroform well, that they succumb more
quickly to injuries and surgical operations, and that they
possess much less power of resistance than non-smokers to the
inroads of acute disease.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">9. Many rich Chinese smoke all night and sleep
nearly all day. Artisans, coolies, etc., waste from one to four
hours at the pipe, and this waste occurs not once or twice a week
but every day in the year without curtailment and without fail.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">10. If a smoker gets ill, except in some acute
violent sickness such as pneumonia, he smokes more and more, and
the more chronic the disease the more firmly established the
habit.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">11. A physician directing an opium smoker to
stop smoking is only wasting his breath--he might as well talk to
the winds.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">12. In this country nearly all moral imbeciles
are opium smokers, but it by no means follows that all opium
smokers are moral imbeciles. Without opium in China 80 percent of
the present smokers would, in all probability, be respectable
citizens.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">13. A friend of mine once asked a beggar, who
slept next door to an opium den, where he lived, and he replied,
&quot;Next door to hell.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">14. In the opium smoker there does not seem to
be one spark of manhood left, nothing to which we can appeal. In
pleading with him we feel utterly helpless and hopeless. It is
well for Job's reputation that he never had to deal with opium
smokers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">15. Opium is the handiest of all suicidal
agents. Mr. Bourne, acting chief justice of Shanghai, says, in
speaking of Yunnan:--&quot;Another bad result of the opium being
so ready at hand is the frequency of suicides, especially among
women. We heard of a case in which a mother and daughter-in-law
both took opium and died, because of a quarrel over the breaking
of a tea cup.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">16. The opium smoker neglects wife and
children, pawns their clothes for opium, drives them to commit
suicide and on occasion sells them, it may be, into something
worse than slavery.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">17. If the smoker can get his allowance he is
quiet and retiring, but an opium-smoking chair coolie or boatman
will out-quarrel creation to get the wherewithal to fill his
pipe, and no greater sharks disgrace the earth than the yamen
runners of China, who are all the time &quot;raising the autumn
wind&quot; to get the money to buy opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">18. The smoker keeps a clear head in regard to
money matters, and except for wasting it for opium he is often
more careful in spending it than non-smokers. Rich, stingy
fathers, whose sons are spending money fast and furious with wine
and women, sometimes hire parasites to lead them into opium
smoking with a hope to saving money.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">19. Opium smoking tends to beggary, and in
China nearly all beggars, thieves and sharpers are given to
opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">20. Opium has been used all over China for only
about sixty years and yet, according to the Encyclopedia
Britannica, one-fourth to three- tenths of the people are already
opium smokers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">What Shall They Do to Be Saved?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have just returned from forty-eight hours'
friendly and professional attendance at a bedside where I would
fain place every young person in this country for a single hour
before the Responsibilities of Life have become the sentinels and
Habit the jailor of his Will.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">My patient was a gentleman of forty, who for
several years of his youth occasionally used opium, and, for the
last eight has habitually taken it. During these eight years he
has made at least three efforts to leave it off, in each instance
diminishing his dose gradually for a month before its entire
abandonment, and in the most successful one holding the enemy at
bay but for a single summer. In two cases he had no respite of
agony from the moment he dropped till he resumed it. In the third
case, a short period of comparative repose succeeded the first
fiery battle, but in the midst of felicitations on his victory he
was attacked by the most agonizing hemicranial headaches
(resulting from what I now fear to have been already permanent
disorganization of the stomach), and went back to his nepenthe in
a state of almost suicidal despair, only after the torture had
continued for weeks without a moment's mitigation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He had first learned its seductions, as happens
with the vast majority of Anglo-Saxon opium-eaters, through a
medical prescription. An attack of inflamed cornea was treated
with caustic applications, and the pian assuaged by internal
doses of M'Munn's Elixir. When my friend came out of his dark
room and bandages at the end of a month he had consumed twenty
ounces of this preparation, whose probable distinction from the
tincture known as laudanum I point out below in the note. [FN*]</font></p>

<p><font size="3">________</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Mr. Frank A. Schlitz has kindly made for me a
special analysis of M'Munn's Elixir which seems to prove that the
process of its preparation amounts to more than the
denarcotization of opium, which is spoken of on the wrapper of
each vial. As nearly as can be ascertained, M'Munn's Elixir is
simply an aqueous infusion of opium--procured by the ordinary
maceration--and preserved from decomposing by the subsequent
addition of a small portion of alcohol. Narcotin being absolutely
insoluble in water is eliminated as the circular says. This face
along would not account for the difference between its action and
that of laudanum. This is explained by the fact that all the
other alkaloids possess diverse rates of solubility in water, and
exist in M'Munn's Elixir in very different relative proportions
from those which they bear to each other in the alcoholic
tincture called laudanum. _____</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Here it may not be superfluous to say that the
former preparation has all the essential properties of the
latter, save certain of the constipatory and stupefying
tendencies which, by a private process known to the assigns of
the inventor, have been so masked or removed that it possesses in
many cases an availableness which the practitioner can not
despise, though compelled by the secrecy of its formula to rank
it among quack medicines. The amount of it which my friend had
taken during this month's eclipse represents an ounce of dry gum
opium--in rough measurement a piece as large as a French billiard
ball. I thus particularize because he had never previously been
addicted to the drug; had inherited a sound constitution, and
differed from any other fresh subject only in the intensity of
his nervous temperament. I wish to emphasize the fact that the
system of a mere neophyte, with nothing to neutralize the effects
of the drug save the absorbency, so to speak, of the pain from
which it was given, could so rapidly adapt itself to them as to
demand an increase of the dose in such an alarming ratio. There
are certain men to whom opium is as fire to tow, and my friend
was one of these. On the 1st of October he sensibly perceived the
trifling dose of fifty drops; on the first of November he was
taking, without increased sensation, an ounce vial of
&quot;M'Munn&quot; daily.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From that time--totally ignorant of the
terrible trap which lay grinning under the bait he dabbled
with--he continued to take opium at short intervals for several
years. When by the physician's orders he abandoned
&quot;M'Munn,&quot; on the subsidence of the eye-difficulty, his
symptoms were uneasy rather than distressing, and disappeared
after a few days' oppression at the pit of the stomach and a few
nights' troubled dreaming. But he had not forgotten the sweet
dissolving views at midnight, the great executive achievements at
noonday, the heavenly sense of a self-reliance which dare go
anywhere, say anything, attempt anything in the world. He had not
forgotten the nonchalance under slight, the serenity in pain, the
apathy to sorrow, which for one month set him calm as Boodh in
the temple-splendors of his darkened room. He had not forgotten
that the only perfect peace he had ever experienced was there,
and he remembered that peace as something which seemed to blend
all the assuaged passion and confirmed dignity of old age with
that energy of high emprise which thrills the nerves of manhood.
He had tasted as many sources of earthly pleasure as any man I
ever knew; but the ecstasies of form and color, wine, Eros,
music, perfume, all the luxuries of surrounding which wealth
could purchase or high-breeding appreciate, were as nothing to
him in comparison with the memory of that time on which his
family threw away their sympathy when they called it his
&quot;month of suffering.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Accordingly, without much more instinct of
concealment than if it were an occasional tendency to some slight
convivial excess, he had resort to M'Munn, in ounce doses,
whenever the world went wrong with him. If he had a headache or a
toothache; if the weather depressed him; if he had a certain
&quot;stint&quot; of work to do without the sense of native vigor
to accomplish it; if he was perplexed and wished to clear his
head of passion; if anxieties kept him awake; if irregularities
disturbed his digestion--he had always one refuge certain. No
fateful contingency could pursue him inside M'Munn's enchanted
circle. He was a young and wealthy bachelor, living the life of a
refined bon vivant; an insatiable traveler, surrounded by
flatterers, and without a single friend who loved him enough to
warn him of his danger excepting those who, like himself, were
too ignorant to know it. After three years of dalliance he became
an habitual user of opium, and had been one for eight years when
I was first called to him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By the time that the daily habit fastened
itself he had learned of other opiate preparations than M'Munn's,
and finding a certain insufficiency characterize that tincture as
he increased the size of the dose, had recourse to laudanum,
which contains the full native vigor of the drug unmodified. This
nauseated him. He had the same experience with gum opium, opium
pills, and opium powder; so that he was driven to that form of
exhibition which sooner or later naturally strikes almost every
opium-eater as the most portable, energetic, and
instantaneous--morphia or one of its salts. My friend usually
kept the simple alkaloid in a paper, and dissolved it as he
needed it in clear water, sometimes substituting an equivalent of
&quot;Magendie's Solution,&quot; which contains sixteen grams of
the salt diffused through an ounce of water by the addition of a
few drops of sulfuric acid. When I first saw him he had reached a
daily dose of twelve grains of sulphate of morphia, and on
occasions of high excitement had increased his dose without
exaggerating the sensible effect to nearly twenty. The twelve
which formed his habitual per diem were divided into two equal
doses, one taken immediately after rising, the other just before
sundown.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As yet he had not begun to feel the worst
physical effects which sooner or later visit the opium-eater. His
digestion seemed unimpaired so long as he took his morphia
regularly; he was sallow and somewhat haggard, but thus far no
distressing biliary symptoms had manifested themselves; his sleep
was always dreamy, and he woke at short intervals during the
night, but invariably slept again at once, and had so adjusted
himself to the habit as to show no signs of suffering from
wakefulness; his hand was steady; his muscular system easily
exhausted, but by no means what one would call feeble. As he
himself told me, he had come to the conclusion to emancipate
himself because opium-eating was a horrible mental bondage. The
physical power of the drug over him he only realized when
attempting its abandonment. Its spiritual thralldom was his
hourly misery. He was connected by blood and marriage with
several of the best families in the land. Money had not been
stinted in his education, and his capabilities were as great as
his advantages. He was one of the bravest, fairest, most generous
natures I ever came in contact with; was versatile as a Yankee
Crichton; had ridden his own horse in a trotting match and beaten
Bill Woodruff; had carried his own little 30-ton schooner from
the Chesapeake to the Golden Gate through the Straits of
Magellan; had swum with the Navigators' Islanders, shot buffalo,
hunted chamois, and lunched on mangosteens at Penang. Through all
his wanderings the loftiest sense of what was heroic in human
nature and divine in its purified form, the monitions of a most
tender conscience, and the echoes of that Puritan education which
above all other schemes of training makes human responsibility
terrible, had gone with him like his tissue. He saw the good and
great things within reach of a fulfilled manhood, and of a sudden
waked up to feel that they could on earth never be his. He was
naturally very truthful, and, although the invariable tendency of
opium-eating is to extirpate this quality, could not flatter
himself. Other minds around him responded to a sudden call as his
own did not. Every day the need of energy took him more by
surprise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The image-graving and project-building
characteristic of opium, which comes on with a sense of genial
radiation from the epigastrium about a quarter of an hour after
the dose, had not yet so entirely disappeared from its effect on
him, as it always does at a later stage of the indulgence. But
instead of being an instigation to the delightful reveries which
ensued on his earlier doses, this peculiarity was now an
executioner's knot in the hands of Remorse. He was daily and
nightly haunted by plans and pictures whose feverish unreal
beauty he remembered having seen through a hundred times. Those
Fata Morgana plans, should he again waste on them the effort of
construction? The result had been a chaos of aimless, ineffectual
days. Those pictures, why were they brought again to mock him?
Were they not horrible impossibilities? Were they not, through
the paralysis of his executive faculties, mere startling
likenesses of Disappointment? In his opium dreams he had seen his
own ships on the sea; commerce bustling in his warehouse; money
overflowing in this bank; babies crowing on his knee; a wife
nestling at his breast; a basso voice of tremendous natural power
and depth scientifically cultivated to its utmost power of
pleasing artists or friends; a country estate on the Hudson, or
at Newport, with emerald lawns sloping down to the amber river on
the leek-green sea; the political and social influence of a great
landholder. How pleasurably he had once perceived all these
possible joys and powers! How undeludedly he now saw their
impossible execution!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">So, coming to me, he told me that his object in
trying to leave off opium was to escape from these horrible
ghosts of a life's unfulfilled promise. Only when he tried to
abandon opium did he realize the physical hold the drug had on
him. Its spiritual thralldom was his hourly misery.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For three months I tried to treat him in his
own house, here in the city. A practitioner of any experience
need not be told with what success. I could reduce him to a dose
of half a grain of sulphate of morphia a day, keep him there one
week, and making a morning call at the expiration of that time
discover that some nocturnal nervous paroxysm had necessitated
either a return to five grains or a use of brandy (which, though
no drinker, he tried to substitute) sufficient to demand a much
larger dose of opium in its reaction. He had lost most of his
near connections, and not for one hour could any hired attendant
have withstood his appeal, or that marvelous ingenuity by which,
without appeal, the opium-eater obtains the drug which, to him,
is like oxygen to the normal man.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This ingenuity manifests itself in subterfuges
of a complicated construction and artistic plausibility which
might have puzzled Richelieu; but it is really nothing to wonder
at when we recollect the law of nature by which any extreme
agony, so long as it continues remediable, sharpens and
concentrates all a man's faculties upon the one single object of
procuring the remedy. If my house is on fire, I run to the
hydrant by a mere automatic operation of my nerves. If my leg is
caught in the bite of a paying-out hawser, my whole brain focuses
at once on that single thought, &quot;an axe.' If I am enduring
the agony which opium alone can cause and cure, every faculty of
my mind is called to the aid of the tortured body which wants it.
When a man has used opium for a long time the condition of his
brain supervening on his deprivation of the drug for a period of
twenty-four hours is such as very frequently to render him
suicidal. Cottle tells us how Coleridge one day took a walk along
Bristol wharves, and sent his attendant down the pier to inquire
the name of a vessel, while he slipped into a druggist's on the
quay and bought a quart of laudanum; but in no fibre of his
nature could Cottle conceive the awful sense of a force
despotizing it over his will, a degradation descending on his
manhood, which Coleridge felt as he concentrated on that one
single cry of his animal nature and the laudanum which it spoke
for, fall the faculties of construction and insight which had
created the &quot;Ancient Mariner&quot; and the &quot;Aids to
Reflection.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Likewise I suppose there are very few people
who could patiently regard the fact that one of the very purest
and bravest souls I ever knew had become so demoralized by the
perseverance of disease and suffering as to deal like a lawyer
with his best friends, and shuffle to the very edge of falsehood,
when his nature clamored for opium. I was particular to tell him
whenever I detected any evasion (an occasion on which his shame
and remorse were terrible to witness) that I, personally, had
nonetheless respect for him. I knew he was dominated, and in no
sense more responsible for breaking his resolution than he would
have been had he vowed to hold his finger in the gas-blaze until
it burned off. In this latter case the mere translation of
chemical decomposition into pain, and round the automatic
nerve-arc into involuntary motion, would have drawn his finger
out of the blaze, as it did in the cases of Mutius Sevola and
Cranmer, if they ever attempted the feat credited them by
tradition. In his case the abandonment of opium brought on an
agony which took his actions entirely out of voluntary control,
eclipsing the higher ideals and heroisms of his imagination at
once, and reducing him to that automatic condition in which the
nervous system issues and enforces only those edicts which are
counseled by pure animal self- preservation. Whatever may have
been the patient's responsibility in beginning the use of
narcotics or stimulants (and I usually find, the case of
opium-eaters, that its degree has been very small indeed,
therapeutic use often fixing the habit forever before a patient
has convalesced far enough even to know what he is taking)
habituation invariably tends to reduce the man to the automatic
plane, in which the will returns wholly to the tutelage of
sensation and emotion, as it was in infancy; while all the
Intellectual, save Memory, and the most noble and imperishable
among the Moral faculties may survive this disorganization for
years, standing erect above the remainder of a personality
defrauded of its completion to show what a great and beautiful
house might have been built on such strong an shapely pillars.
Inebriates have been repeatedly known to risk imminent death if
they could not reach their liquor in any other way. The grasp
with which liquor holds a man when it turns on him, even after he
has abused it for a lifetime, compared with the ascendancy
possessed by opium over the unfortunate habituated to it for but
a single year, is as the clutch of an angry woman to the embrace
of Victor Hugo's Pieuvre. A patient whom, after habitual use of
opium for ten years, I met when he had spent eight years more in
reducing his daily dose to half a grain of morphia, with a view
to its eventual complete abandonment, once spoke to me in these
words:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;God seems to help a man in getting out of
every difficulty but opium. There you have to claw your way out
over red-hot coals on your hands and knees, and drag yourself by
main strength through the burning dungeon- bars.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This statement does not exaggerate the feeling
of many another opium- eater whom I have known.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now, such a man is a proper subject, not for
reproof, but for medical treatment. The problem of his case need
embarrass nobody. It is as purely physical as one of small-pox.
When this truth is as widely understood among the laity as it is
known by physicians, some progress may be made in staying the
frightful ravages of opium among the present generation. Now,
indeed, it is a difficult thing to prevent relatives from
exacerbating the disorder and the pain of a patient, who, from
their uninformed standpoint, seems as sane and responsible as
themselves, by reproaches at which they would shudder, as at any
other cruelty, could they be brought to realize that their friend
is suffering under a disease of the very machinery of volition;
and no more to be judge harshly for his acts than a wound for
suppurating or the bowels for continuing the peristaltic motion.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Finding--as is common with all physicians I
have found so many times before--that no control of the case
could be obtained while the patient stayed at home, and deeply
renewing my often-experienced regret that the science and
Christian charity of this country have perfected no scheme by
which either inebriates or opium-eaters may be properly treated
in a special institution of their own, I was at length
reluctantly compelled to send my friend to an ordinary water-cure
at some distance from town.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The cause of my reluctance was not the prospect
of a too liberal use of water, for by arrangement with the heads
of the establishment I was able to control that as I chose;
moreover, an employment of the hot-bath in what would ordinarily
be excess is absolutely necessary as a sedative throughout the
first week of the struggle. I have had several patients whom
during this period I plunged into water at 110 degrees Fahrenheit
as often as fifteen times in a single day--each bath lasting as
long as the patient experienced relief. In some cases this
Elysium coming after the rack has been the only period for a
month in which the sufferer had anything resembling a doze. My
reluctance arose from the necessity of sending a patient in such
an advanced state of the opium disease so far away from me that I
must rely on reports written by people without my eyes, for
keeping personally au courant with the case; that I must consult
and prescribe by letter, subject to the execution of my plans by
men, who, though excellent and careful, were ignorant of my
theories of treatment, and had never made this particular disease
a specialty. I accordingly sent Mr. A. away to the water-cure,
all friendless and alone to fight the final battle of his life
against tougher odds than he had ever before encountered. At no
time in my life have I realized with greater bitterness the
helplessness of a practitioner who has no institution of his own
to take such cases to than when I shook his poor, dry sallow hand
and bade him goodbye at the station.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">As I said in the beginning, I am just home from
seeing the result. Mr. A. has fared as special cases always do
where there is no special provision for them. To speak plainly,
he had been badly neglected; and that, undoubtedly, without the
slightest intention on the part of the heads of the house to do
other than their duty. Six weeks ago I heard from the first
physician that any friend was entirely free from opium, and,
though still suffering, was steadily on the mend. I had no
further news from him till I was called to his bedside by a note
which said he feared he was dying, penciled in a hand as
tremulously illegible as the confession of Guy Fawkes. I was with
him by the earliest train I could take, after arranging with a
neighbor for my practice, and found him in a condition which led
him to say, as I myself said at the commencement of this article:
&quot;Would to God that every young person could stand for a
single hour by this bedside before Life's responsibilities have
become the sentinels and Habit the jailer of the Will!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I had not been intelligently informed
respecting the progress of his case. He had been better at no
time when I was told he was so, though his freedom from opium had
been of even longer duration than I was advised. For ninety days
he had been without opium in any form. The scope of so
untechnical an article leaves no room to detail what had been
done for him as alleviation. His prostration had been so great
that he could not correspond with me himself until the moment of
his absolutely extremity; and only after repeated entreaties to
telegraph to myself and his family had been refused on the ground
that his condition was not critical, he managed to get off the
poor scrawl which brought me to his side.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For the ninety days he had been going without
opium he had known nothing like proper sleep. I desire to be
understood with mathematical literalness. There had been periods
when he had been semi-conscious; when the outline of things in
his room grew vaguer and for five minutes he had a dull sensation
of not knowing where he was. This temporary numbness was the only
state which in all that time simulated sleep. From the hour he
first refused his craving, and went to the battlefield of bed, he
had endured such agony as I believe no man but the opium-eater
has ever known. I am led to believe that the records of fatal
lesion, mechanical childbirth, cancerous affection, the stake
itself, contains no greater torture than a confirmed opium-eater
experiences in getting free. Popularly this suffering is supposed
to be purely intellectual-- but nothing can be wider of the
truth. Its intellectual part is bad enough, but the physical
symptoms are appalling beyond representation. The look on the
face of the opium sufferer is indeed one of such keen mental
anguish that outsiders may well be excused for supposing that is
all. I shall never forget till my dying day that awful Chinese
face which actually made me rein my horse at the door of the
opium hong where it appeared, after a night's debauch, at six
o'clock one morning when I was riding in the outskirts of a
Pacific city. It spoke of such a nameless horror in its owner's
soul that I made the sign for a pipe and proposed, in
&quot;pigeon English,&quot; to furnish the necessary coin. The
Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing
medicine proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot,
and made a gesture, palms downward, toward the ground, as one who
said, &quot;It has done its last for me--I am paying the matured
bills of penalty.&quot; The man had exhausted all that opium
could give him; and now, flattery past, the strong one kept his
goods in peace. When the most powerful alleviative known to
medical science has bestowed the last Judas kiss which is
necessary to emasculate its victim, and, sure of the prey,
substitutes stabbing for blandishment, what alleviative, stronger
than the strongest, shall soothe such doom? I may give
chloroform. I always do in the denouement of bad
cases--ether--nitrous oxide. In employing the first two agents I
secure rest, but I induce death nine cases out of ten. Nothing is
better known to medical men than the intolerance of the system to
chloroform or ether after opium. Nitrous oxide I am still
experimenting with, but its simple undiffused form is too
powerful an agent to use with a patient who for many days must be
hourly treated for persevering pain. So the opium-eater is left
as entirely without anesthetic as the usual practice leaves him
without therapeutic means. Both here and abroad opium-eaters have
discovered the fact that, in an inveterate case, where opium
fails to act on the brain through the exhausted tissues of the
stomach, bichloride of mercury in combination with the dose
behaves like a mordant in the presence of a dye, and, so to
speak, precipitates opium upon the calloused surfaces of the
mucous and nervous layers. This expedient soon exhausts itself in
a death from colliquative diarrhea, produced partly by the final
decompositions of tissue which the poisonously antiseptic
property of opium has all along improperly stored away; partly by
the definite corrosions of the new addition to the dose. But in
no case is there any relief to a desperate case of opium-eating
save death.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Remembering that Chinaman's faced I can not
wonder at the popular notion regarding the abandonment of opium.
Men say it is a mental pain; because spiritual woe is the
expression of the sufferer's countenance. And so it is, but this
woe is underlain by the keenest brute suffering. Let me sketch
the opium-eater's experience on the rugged road upward.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Let us suppose him a resolute man, who means to
be free, and with that intent has reduced to a hundred drops the
daily dose which for several years had amounted to an ounce of
laudanum. I am not supposing an extreme case. An ounce of
laudanum is a small per diem for any man who has taken his
regular rations of the drug for a twelvemonth. In the majority of
cases I have found an old habitue's daily portion to exceed
three, or the equivalent of that dose in crude opium or morphia;
making seventy-two grains of the gum or twelve of its most
essential alkaloid. In one most interesting case I found a man
who having begun on the first of January with one half a grain of
sulphate of morphia for disease, at the end of March was, to all
appearance, as hopeless an opium-eater as ever lived, taking
thirty-two grains of the salt per day in the form of Magendie's
Solution. This, however, was an unusual case. According to my
experience the average opium-eater reaches twelve grains of
morphia [microfiche illegible]... and may live after that to
treble the amount: the worst case I ever knew attaining a dose of
ninety grains, or one and a half of the drachm vials ordinarily
sold. I am happy, in passing, to add that for more than two years
both the extreme cases just mentioned have been entirely cured.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If the opium-eater has been in the habit of
dividing his daily dose he begins to feel some uneasiness within
an hour after his first deprivation, but it amounts to nothing
more than an indefinite restlessness. In any case his first
well-marked opium torments occur early after he has been without
the drug for twenty-four hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the expiration of that time he begins to
feel a peculiar corded and tympanic tightness about the
epigastrium. A feverish condition of the brain, which sometimes
amounts to absolute phantasia, now ensues, marked off into
periods of increasing excitement by a heavy sleep, which, after
each interval, grows fuller of tremendous dreams, and breaks up
with a more intensely irritable waking. I have held a man's hand
while he lay dreaming about the thirty-sixth hour of his
struggle. His eyes were closed for less than a minute by the
watch, but he awoke in a horrible agony of fear from what seemed
to have been a year-long siege of some colossal and demoniac
Vicksburg.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After the opium-eater has been for forty-eight
hours without his solace this heavy sleep entirely disappears.
While it stays it never lasts over half an hour at a time, and is
so broken by the crash of stupendous visions as not to amount to
proper slumber. During its period of continuance the opium-eater
woos its approaches with an agony which shows his instinct of the
coming weeks of sleeplessness. It never rests him in any valid
sense. It is a congestive decomposition rather than any normal
reconstruction of the brain. He wakes out of it each time with a
heart more palpitating; in a perspiration more profuse; with a
greater uncertainty of sense and will; with a more confused
memory; in an intenser agony of body and horror of hopelessness.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Every nerve in the entire frame now suddenly
awakes with such a spasm of revivification that no parallel agony
to that of the opium-eater at this stage can be adduced, unless
it be that of the drowned person resuscitated by artificial
means. Nor does this parallel fully represent the suffering, for
the man resuscitated from drowning re-oxidizes all his surplus
carbon in a few minutes of intense torture, while the anguish
which burns away that carbon and other matter, properly effete,
stored away in the tissues by opium, must last for hours, days,
and weeks. Who is sufficient for this long, long pull?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From the hour this pain begins to manifest
itself it continues (in any average case of a year's previous
habituation to the drug) for at least a week without one second's
lull or exhaustion. A man may catch himself dozing between spasms
of tic-douloureux or toothache; he never doubts whether he is
awake one instant in the first week after dropping his opium. One
patient whom I found years ago at a watercure followed the
watchman all night on crutches through his tour of inspection
around the establishment. Other people, after walking a long
time, shift from chair to chair in their rooms, talking to
anybody who may happen to be present in a low-voiced, suicidal
manner, which inexperience finds absolutely blood-freezing. Later
such rock to and fro, moaning with agony, for hours at a time,
but saying nothing. Still others go to their beds at once, and
lie writhing there until the struggle is entirely decided. I have
learned that this last class is generally the most hopeful.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The period during which this pain is to
continue depends upon two elements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1st. How long has the patient habitually taken
opium?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2d. How much constitutional strength remains to
throw it off?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;How much has he taken in the
aggregate?&quot; is practically not an equivalent of the first
question. I have found an absolutely incurable opium-eater who
had never used more than ten grains of morphia per diem; but he
had been taking it habitually for a dozen years. In another case
the patient had for six months repeated before each meal the
ten-grain dose which served the other all day; but he was a man
whose pluck under pain equaled a woman's, and after a fortnight's
anguish of such horror that one could scarcely witness it without
being moved to tears came out into perfect freedom. The former
patient, although he had never in any one day experienced such
powerful effects from opium as the latter, had used the drug so
long that every part of his system had reconstructed itself to
meet the abnormal conditions, and must go through a second
process of reconstruction, without any anodyne to mask the pain
resulting from its decomposition, before it could again tolerate
existence of the normal kind. If opium were not an anodyne the
terrible structural changes which it works would cause no
surprise; it would be felt eating out its victim's life like so
much nitric acid. During the early part of the opium-eater's
career these structural changes go on with a rapidity which
partly accounts for the vast disengagements of nervous force, the
exhilaration, the endurance of effort, which characterize this
stage, later to be substituted by utter nervous apathy. By the
time the substitution occurs something has taken place throughout
the physical structure which may be rudely likened to the final
equilibrium of a neutral salt after the effervescence between an
acid and an alkali. So to speak, the tissues have now combined
with their full equivalent of all the poisonous alkaloids in
opium. Further use of it produces no new disengagements of
nervous force; the victim may double, quadruple his dose, but he
might as well expect further ebullition by adding more
aqua-fortis to a satisfied nitrate as to develop with opium
exhilarating currents in a tissue whose combination with that
drug have already reached their chemical limit. FN* _____ *FN I
say &quot;chemical&quot; because so much it is possible to known
experientally; and the very interesting examination of such
higher forces as constantly seem to intrude in any nervous
disturbance would here involve the discussion of a theoretical
&quot;vital principle&quot;-- something apart from and between
the soul and physical activities--which scientific men are
universally abandoning. ___</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The opium-eater now only continues his habit to
preserve the terrible static condition to which it has reduced
him, and to prevent that yet more terrible dynamic condition into
which he comes with every disturbance of equilibrium; a condition
of energetic and agonizing dissolutions which must last until
every fiber of wrongly changed tissue is burned up and healthily
replaced. Though I have called the early reactions of opium
rapid, they are necessarily much less so than those produced by a
simple chemical agent. No drug approaches it in the possession of
cumulative characteristics; its dependence on the time element
must therefore be always carefully considered in treating a case.
This fact leads us to understand the other element in the
question, how long the torments of the opium-fighter must
continue. Having ascertained the chronology of his case, we must
say, &quot;Given this period of subjection, has the patient
enough constitutional vigor left to endure the period of
reconstruction which must correspond to it?&quot; ** FN -------
** (FN) Not correspond day by day. At that rate a reforming
opium-eater (I use the particle in the physical sense, for very
few opium-eaters are more to blame than any other sick persons)
must pay a &quot;shent per shent&quot; which no constitution
could survive. The correspondence is simply proportional. -------</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am naturally sanguine, and began my study of
opium-eaters with the belief that none of them were hopeless.
Experience has taught me that there is a point beyond which any
constitution--especially one so abnormally sensitive as the
opium-eater's--can not endure keen physical suffering without
death from spinal exhaustion. I once heard the eminent Dr.
Stevens say that he made it a rule never to attempt a surgical
operation if it must consume more than an hour. Similarly, I have
come to the conclusion never to amputate a man from his
opium-self if the agony must last longer than three months.
Uneasiness--corresponding to the irritations of dressing a
stump--may continue a year longer; and few victims of the habit
outlive a certain opium-prurience, which has also its analogue in
the occasional titillation of a healed wound--these are
comparatively tolerable; but, if we expect to save a patient's
life, we must not protract an agony which so absolutely
interferes with normal sleep as that of the opium-eater's for
longer than three months in the case of any constitution I have
thus far encountered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Usually as early as the third day after its
abandonment (unless the constitution has become so impaired by
long habituation that there will probably be no vital reaction)
opium begins to show its dissolutions from the tissue by a
profuse and increasingly acrid bilious diarrhea, which must not
be checked if diagnosis has revealed sufficient constitutional
vigor to justify any attempt at abandonment of the drug.
Hemorrhoids may result; they must be topically treated; mild
astringents may be used when the tendency seems getting out of
eventual control; bland foods must be given as often as the
usually fastidious appetite will tolerate them; the only tonic
must be beef-tea--diffusible stimulus invariably increasing the
agony, whether in the form of ale, wine, or spirits. Short of
threatened collapse, the bowels must not be retarded. There is
nothing in the faintest degree resembling a substitute for opium,
but from time to time various alleviates, which can not be
discussed in an untechnical article, may be administered with
benefit. The spontaneous termination of the diarrhea will
indicate that the effete matters we must remove have been mainly
eliminated, and that we may shortly look for a marked mitigation
of the pain, followed by conditions of great debility but
increasingly favorable to the process of reconstruction. That
process, yet more than the alleviate, demands a book rather than
an article.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have intentionally deferred any description
of the agony of the opium struggle as a sensation, until I
returned from depicting general symptoms, to relate the
particular case which is my text. The sufferings of the patient,
from whom I have just returned, are so comprehensive as almost to
be exhaustively typical.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When simple nervous excitement had for two days
alternated with the already mentioned intervals of delirious
slumber, a dull, aching sensation began manifesting itself
between his shoulders and in the region of the loins. Appetite
for food had been failing since the first denial of that for
opium. The most intense gastric irritability now appeared in the
form of an aggravation of the typantic tightness, corrosive acid
ructations, heartburn, water-brash, and a peculiar sensation, as
painful as it is indescribable, of self-consciousness in the
whole upper part of the digestive canal. The best idea of this
last symptom may be found by supposing all the nerves of
involuntary motion which supply that tract with vitality,
suddenly to be gifted with the exquisite sensitiveness to their
own processes which is produced by its correlative object in some
organ of special sense--the whole organism assimilating itself to
a retina or a finger-tip. Sleep now disappeared. This initiated
an entire month during which the patient had not one moment of
even partial unconsciousness.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In less than a week from the beginning the
symptoms indicated a most obstinate chronic gastritis. There was
a perpetual sense of corrosion at the pit of the stomach very
like that which characterizes the fatal operation of arsenic.
There was less action of the liver than usually indicates a
salvable case, and no irritation of the lowest intestines. Pari
passu with the gastritic suffering, the neuralgic pain spread
down the extremities from an apparent center between the kidneys,
through the trunk, from another line near the left margin of the
liver, and through the whole medullary substance of the brain
itself. Although I was so unfortunate as not to be beside him
during this stage, I can still infallibly draw on my whole
experience for information regarding the intensity of this pain.
Tic-douloureux most nearly resembles it in character. Like that
agonizing affection, it has periods of exacerbation; unlike it,
it has no intervals of continuous repose. Like tic-douloureux,
its sensation is a curiously fluctuating one, as if pain had been
fluidized and poured in trickling streams through the tubules of
nerve tissue which are affected by it; but, unlike that, it
affects every tubule in the human body--not a single diseased
locality. Charles Reade chaffs the doctors very wittily in
&quot;Hard Cash&quot; on their penchant for the word
&quot;hyperaesthesia,&quot; but nothing else exactly defines that
exaggeration of nervous sensibility which I have invariably seen
in opium-eaters. Some of them were hurt by an abrupt slight
touch, and cried out at the jar of a heavy footstep like a
patient with acute rheumatism. Some developed sensitiveness with
the progress of expurgating the poison, until their very hair and
nails felt sore, and the whole surface of the skin suffered from
cold air or water like the lips of a wound. After all, utterly
unable to convey an idea of the kind of suffering, I must content
myself by repeating, of its extent, that no prolonged pain of any
kind known to science can equal it. The totality of the
experience is only conceivable by adding this physical torture to
a mental anguish which even the Oriental pencil of De Quincey has
but feebly painted; an anguish which slays the will, yet leaves
the soul conscious of its murder; which utterly blots out hope,
and either paralyzes the reasoning faculties which might suggest
encouragements, or deadens the emotional nature to them as
thoroughly as if they were not perceived; an anguish which
sometimes includes just, but always a vast amount of unjust
self-reproach which brings every failure and inconsistency, every
misfortune or sin of a man's life as clearly before his face as
on the day he was first mortified or degraded by it--before his
face, not in one terrible dream, which is once for all over with
sunrise, but as haunting ghosts, made out by the feverish eyes of
the soul down to the minutest detail of ghastliness, and never
leaving the side of the rack on which he lies for a moment of
dark or daylight, till sleep, at the end of a month, first drops
out of heaven on his agony.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A third element in the suffering must briefly
be mentioned. It results directly from the others. It is that
exhaustion of nervous power which invariably ensues on protracted
pain of mind or body. it proceeds beyond reaction to collapse in
a hopeless case; it stops this side of that in a salvable one.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On reaching his room I found my friend
bolstered upright in bed, with a small two-legged crutch at hand
to prop his head on when he became weary of the perpendicular
position. This had been his attitude for fifty days. Whether from
its impeding his circulation, the distribution of his nervous
currents, or both, the prostrate posture invariably brought on
cessation of the heart and the sense of intolerable strangling.
His note told me he was dying of heart disease, but, as I
expected, I found that malady merely simulated by nervous
symptoms, and the trouble purely functional. His food was
arrowroot or sago, and beef-tea. Of the vegetable preparation he
took perhaps half a dozen tablespoonfuls a day; of the animal
variable quantities, averaging half a pint per diem. This, though
small, was far from the minimum of nutriment upon which life has
been supported through the most critical periods. Indeed, I have
known three patients tided over stages of disease otherwise
desperately typhoid by beef-tea baths, in which the proportion of
ozmazone was just perceptible, and the sole absorbing agency was
a faint activity left in the pores of the skin. But these
patients had suffered no absolute disorganization. The
practitioner had to encounter a swift specific poison, not to
make over tissues abnormally misconstructed by its long insidious
action. On examination I discovered facts which I had often
feared, but never before absolutely recognized, in my friend's
case. The stomach itself, in its most irreproducible tissue, had
undergone a partial but permanent disorganization. The substance
of the organ itself had been altered in a way for which science
knows no remedy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hereafter, then, it can only be rechanged by
that ultimate decomposition which men call death. Over the
opium-eater's coffin at least, thank God! a wife and sister can
stop weeping and say, &quot;He's free.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I called to my friend's bedside a consultation
of three physicians and the most nearly related survivor of his
family. I laid the case before them; assisted them to a full
prognosis; and invited their views. I spent two nights with my
friend. I have said that during the first month of trial he had
not a moment of even partial unconsciousness. Since that time
there had been perhaps ten occasions a day, when for a period
from one minute in length to five, his poor, pain-wrinkled
forehead sank on his crutch, his eyes fell shut, and to outsiders
he seemed asleep. But that which appeared sleep was internally to
him only one stupendous succession of horrors which confusedly
succeeded each other for apparent eternities of being, and ended
with some nameless catastrophe of woe or wickedness, in a waking
more fearful than the stage volcanically ruptured by it. During
the nights I sat by him these occasional relaxations, as I
learned, reached their maximum length, my familiar presence
acting as a sedative, but from each of them he woke bathed in
perspiration from sole to crown; shivering under alternate
flushes of chill and fever; mentally confused to a degree which
for half an hour rendered every object in the room unnatural and
terrible to him; with a nervous jerk, which threw him quite out
of bed, although in his waking state two men were requisite to
move him; and with a cry of agony as loud as any under
amputation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The result of our consultation was a unanimous
agreement not to press the case further. Physicians have no
business to consider the speculative question, whether death
without opium is preferable to life with it. They are called to
keep people on the earth. We were convinced that to deprive the
patient longer of opium would be to kill him. This we had no
right to do without his consent. He did not consent, and I gave
him five grains of morphia** FN ----- ** (FN) To the younger men
of the profession rather than to the public generally I need here
to say that this dose is not as excessive as it would naturally
appear to be in the case of a man who had used no form of opium
for ninety days. When you have to resume the drug go cautiously.
But you will generally find the amount of it required to produce
the sedative effects in any case which returns to opium, after
abandonment of a long habituation, startlingly large, and slow in
its effects. ----- between 8 and 12 o'clock on the morning of the
day I had to return here. He was obliged to eat a few mouthfuls
of sago before the alkaloid could act upon his nervous system. I
need only point out the significance of this indication. The
shallower lying nervous fibers of the stomach had become
definitely paralyzed, and such digestion as could be perfected
under these circumstances was the only method of getting the
stimulant in contact with any excitable nerve-substance. In other
words, mere absorbent and assimilative tissue was all of him
which for the purpose of receiving opium partially survived
disorganization of the superficial nerves. Of that surviving
tissue, one mucous patch was irredeemably gone. (This particular
fact was the one which cessation from opium more distinctly
unmasked.) At noon he had become tolerably comfortable; before I
left (7 p.m.) he had enjoyed a single half hour of something like
normal slumber.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He will have to take opium all his life.
Further struggle is suicide. Death will probably occur at any
rate not from an attack of what we usually consider disease, but
from the disintegrating effects on tissue of the habit itself.
So, whatever he may do, his organs march to death. He will have
to continue the habit which kills him only because abandoning it
kills him sooner; for self-murder has dropped out of the purview
of the moral faculties and become a mere animal question of time.
The only way left him to preserve his intellectual faculties
intact is to keep his future daily dose at the tolerable minimum.
Henceforth all his dreams of entire liberty must be relegated to
the world to come. He may be valuable as a monitor, but in the
executive uses of this mighty modern world henceforth he can
never share. Could the immortal soul find itself in a more
inextricable, a more grisly complication?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In publishing his case I am not violating that
Hippocratic vow which protects the relations of patient and
adviser; for, as I dropped my friend's wasted hand and stepped to
the threshold, he repeated a request he had often made to me,
saying:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It is almost like Dives asking for a
messenger to his brethren; but tell them, tell all young men,
what it is, 'that they come not into this torment.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Already perhaps--by the mere statement of the
case--I might be considered to have fulfilled my promise. But
since monition often consists as much in enlightenment as
intimidation, let me be pardoned for briefly presenting a few
considerations regarding the action of opium upon the human
system while living, and the peculiar methods by which the drug
encompasses its death.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What is Opium?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is the most complicated drug in the
Pharmacopeia. though apparently a simple gummy paste, it
possesses a constitution which analysis reveals to contain no
less than 25 elements, each one of them a compound by itself, and
many of them among the most complex compounds known to modern
chemistry. Let me concisely mention these by classes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">First, at least three earthy salts--the
sulphates of lime, alumia, and potassa. Second, two organic and
one simpler acid--acetic (absolutely vinegar), meconic (one of
the most powerful irritants which can be applied to the
intestines through the bile), and sulfuric. All three exist
uncombined in the gum, and free to work their will on the mucous
tissues. A green extractive matter, which comes in all vegetal
bodies developed under sunlight, next deserves a place by itself,
because it is one of the few organic bodies of which no rational
analysis has ever been pretended. Though we cannot state the
constitution of this chlorophyll, we know that, except by turning
acid in the stomach, it remains inert on the human system, as one
might imagine would happen if he swallowed a bunch of green
grass. Lignin, with which it is always associated, is mere woody
fiber, and has no direct physical action. In no instance has any
stomach been found to digest it save an insect's-- some
naturalists thinking that certain beetles make their horny wing-
cases of that. I believe one man did think he had discovered a
solvent for it in the gastric juice of the beaver, but that view
is not widely entertained. So far as it exists in opium it can
only act as a foreign substance and a mechanical irritant to the
human bowels. Next come two inert, indigestible, and very similar
gummy bodies, mucilagin and bassorin. Sugar, are powerfully
active volatile principle, and a fixed oil (probably allied to
turpentine) are the only other invariable constituents of opium
belonging to the great organic group of the hydro- carbons.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I now come to a group by far the most important
of all. Almost without exception the vegetable poisons belong to
what are called the &quot;nitrogenous alkaloids.&quot; Strychnia,
brucia, ignatia, calabarin, woovarin, atropine, digitalin, and
many others, including all whose effect is most tremendous upon
the human system, are in this group. Not without insight did the
early discoverers call nitrogen azote, &quot;the foe to
life.&quot; It so habitually exists in the things our body finds
most deadly that the tests for it are always the first which
occur to a chemist in the presence of any new organic poison. The
nitrogenous alkaloids owe the first part of their name to the
fact of containing this element; the second part to that of their
usually making neutral salts with acids, like an alkaline base.
The general reader may sometimes have asked himself why these
alkaloids are diversely written-- as, e.g., sometimes
&quot;morphia,&quot; and sometimes &quot;morphine.&quot; The
chemists who regard them as alkalies write them in the one way,
those who consider them neutrals, in the other. Of these
nitrogenous alkaloids, even the nuts of the tree, which furnishes
the most powerful, swift poison of the world, contains but
three--the above-named strychnia, brucia, and ignatia--principles
shared in common with its pathological congener, the St. Ignatius
bean. Opium may be found to contain twelve of them; but as one of
these (cotarnine) may be a product of distillation, and the other
(pseudo-morphia) seems only an occasional constituent, I treat
them as ten in number--rationally to be arranged under three
heads.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">First, those whose action is merely acrid--so
far as known expending themselves upon the mucous coasts.
(Pseudo-morphia when it occurs belongs to these.) So do
porphyroxin; narceine; probably papaverine also; while meconin,
whose acrid properties in contact with animal tissue are similar
to that of meconic acid, forms the last of the group.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second head comprises but a single
alkaloid, variously called paramorphia or thebaine. (It may
interest amateur chemists to know that its difference from
strychnia consists only in having two less equivalents of
hydrogen and six of carbon--especially when they know how closely
its physical effects follow its atomic constitution.) A dose of
one grain has produced tetanic spasms. Its chief action appears
to be upon the spinal nerves, and there is reason to suppose it a
poison of the same kind as nux vomica without the concentration
of that agent. How singular it seems to find a poison of this
totally distinct class--bad enough to set up the reputation of
any one drug by itself--in company with the remaining principles
whose effect we usually associate with opium and see clearest in
the ruin of its victim!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The remainder, five in number, are the opium
alkaloids, which act generally upon the whole system, but
particularly, in their immediate phenomena, upon the brain. I
mention them in the ascending order of their nervine power:
narcotine; codeine; opianin; metamorphia, and morphia.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first of these the poppy shares in common
with many other narcotic plants--tobacco the most conspicuous
among the number. In its anti- periodic effects on the human
system it has been found similar to quinia, and it is an
undoubted narcotic poison acting on the nerves of organic life,
though, compared with its associates in the drug, comparatively
innocent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The remaining four act very much like morphia,
differing only in the size of the dose in which they prove
efficient. Most perfectly fresh constitutions feel a grain of
morphia powerfully; metamorphia is soporific in half-gain doses
(American Journal of Pharmacy, September, 1861); opianin in its
physical effects closely approximates morphia; codeia is about
one-fifth as powerful; a new subject may not get sleep short of
six grains; its main action is expended on the sympathetic
system. It does not seem to congest the brain as morphia does;
but its action on the biliary system is probably little less
deadly than that of the more powerful narcotic.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Looking at the marvelous complexity of opium we
might be led to the a priori supposition that its versatility of
action on the human system must be equally marvelous.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Miserably for the opium-eater, fortunately for
the young person who may be dissuaded from following in his
footsteps, we are left in no doubt of this matter by the
conclusions of experience. In practical action opium affects as
large an area of nervous surface, attacks it with as much
intensity, and changes it in as many ways as its complexity would
lead us to expect. I have pointed out the existence in opium of a
convulsive poison congeneric with brucia. The other chief active
alkaloids, five in number, are those which specially possess the
cumulative property. Poisons of the strychnia and hydro-cyanic
acid classes (including this just mentioned opium alkaloid,
thebaine), are swifter agents; but this perilous opium quintette
signs to every sense a lulling song from which it may not awake
for years, but wakes a slave. Every day that a man uses opium
these cumulative alkaloids get a subtler hold on him. Even a
physician addicted to the practice has no conception how their
influence piles up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At length some terrible dawn rouses him out of
a bad sleep into a worse consciousness. Though the most
untechnical man, he must already know the disorder which has
taken place in his moral nature and his will. For a knowledge of
his physical condition he must resort to his medical man, and
what, when the case is ten years old, must a practitioner tell
the patient in any average case?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Sir, the chances are entirely against
you, and the possession of a powerfully enduring constitution, if
you have it, forms a decided offset in your favor.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He then makes a thorough examination of him by
ear, touch, conversation. If enough constitution responds to the
call, he advises an immediate entrance upon the hard road of
abnegation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If the practitioner finds the case hopeless he
must tell the patient so, in something like these words:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You have either suffered a
disorganization of irreproducible membranes, or you have
deposited so much improper material in your tissue that your life
is not consistent with the protracted pain of removing it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;One by one you have paralyzed all the
excretory functions of the body. Opium, aiming at all those
functions for their death, first attacked the kidneys, and with
your experimental doses you experienced a slight access of
dysuria. As you went on, the same action, progressively paralytic
to organic life, involved the liver. Flatulence, distress at the
epigastrium, irregularity of bowels, indicated a spasmodic
performance of the liver's work, which showed it to be under high
nervous excitement. your mouth became dry through a cessation of
the salivary discharge. Your lachrymal duct was parched, and your
eye grew to have an arid look in addition to the dullness
produced by opiate contraction of the pupil.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">All this time you continued to absorb an agent
which directly acts for what by a paradox may be called fatal
conservation of the tissues. Whether through its complexity
combined nitrogen, carbon, or both, the drug has interposed
itself between your very personal substance and those oxidations
by which alone its life can be maintained. It has slowed the
fires of your whole system. It has not only interposed but in
part it has substituted itself; so that along with much effete
matter of the body stored away there always exists a certain
undecomposed quantity of the agent which sustains this morbid
conservation. **FN ----- ** (FN): I frequently use what
hydropaths call &quot;a pack&quot; to relieve opium distress, and
with great benefit. After an hour and a half of perspiration, the
patient being taken out of his swaddlings, I have found in the
water which was used to wash out his sheet enough opium to have
intoxicated a fresh subject. This patient had not used opium for
a fortnight. -----</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;When this combination became established,
you began losing your appetite because no substitution of fresh
matter was required by your body for tissue wrongly conserved.
The progressive derangement of your liver manifested itself in
increased sallowness of face and cornea; the organ was working on
an inadequate vital supply because the organic nervous system was
becoming paralyzed; the veins were not strained of that which is
the bowels' proper purgative and the blood's dire poison. You had
sealed up all but a single excretory passage--the pores of the
skin. Perhaps when you had opium first given you you were told
that its intent was the promotion of perspiration but did not
know the rationale. The only way in which opium promotes
perspiration is by shutting up all the other excretory processes
of the body, and throwing the entire labor of that function upon
the pores. (When the skin gives out the opium- eater is shut up
like an entirely choked chimney, and often dies in delirium of
blood-poisoning.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;For a while--the first six years,
perhaps--your skin sustained the work which should have been
shared by the other organs--not in natural sweat, but violent
perspiration, which showed the excess of its action. Then your
palms became gradually hornier--your whole body yellower--at the
same time that your muscular system grew tremulous through
progressively failing nervous supply.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;About this time you may have had some
temporary gastric disturbance, accompanied with indescribable
distress, loathing at food, and nausea. This indicated that the
mucous lining of the stomach had been partially removed by the
corrosions of the drug, or that nervous power had suddenly come
to a standstill, which demanded an increase of stimulation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Since that time you have been taking your
daily dose only to preserve the status in quo. The condition both
of your nervous system and your stomach indicate that you must
always take some anodyne to avoid torture, and your only anodyne
is opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The rest of your life must be spent in
keeping comfortable, not in being happy.:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opium-eaters enjoy a strange immunity from
other disease. They are not liable to be attacked by miasma in
malarious countries; epidemics or contagions where they exist.
They almost always survive to die of their opium itself. And an
opium death is usually in one of these two manners:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The opium-eater either dies in collapse through
nervous exhaustion (with the blood poisoning and delirium
above-mentioned), sometimes after an overdose, but oftener
seeming to occur spontaneously; or in the midst of physical or
mental agony, as great and irrelievable, as men suffer in hopeful
abandonment of the drug, and with a colliquative diarrhea, by
which--in a continual, fiery, acrid discharge--the system
relieves itself during a final fortnight of the effete matters
which have been accumulating for years.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Either of these ends is terrible enough; let us
draw a curtain over their details.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opium is a corrosion and paralysis of all the
noblest forms of life. The man who voluntarily addicts himself to
it would commit in cutting his throat a suicide only swifter and
less ignoble. The habit is gaining fearful ground among our
professional men, the operatives in our mills, our weary sewing
women, our fagged clerks, our disappointed wives, our former
liquor-drunkards, our very day-laborers, who a generation ago
took gin; all our classes, from the highest to the lowest, are
yearly increasing their consumption of the drug. The terrible
demands, especially in this country, made on modern brains by our
feverish competitive life, constitute hourly temptations to some
form of the sweet, deadly sedative. Many a professional man of my
acquaintance, who twenty years ago was content with his
tri-diurnal &quot;whiskey,&quot; ten years ago, drop by drop,
began taking stronger &quot;laudanum cocktails,&quot; until he
became what he is now--an habitual opium-eater. I have tried to
show what he will be. If this article shall deter any from an
imitation of his example, or excite an interest in the
question--&quot;What he shall do to be saved?&quot;--I am
content. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Demon of the Orient </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Allen S. Williams New York: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Published by the Author,&quot; 1883</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter IV. An American's Palace Joint</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The fact of an American deliberately investing
his money in the business of propagating a body-killing,
soul-destroying vice like this one of opium smoking is sufficient
to evoke a feeling of disgust, and should call down the strongest
condemnation from principled individuals, as it will shortly do
in all probability from the courts of justice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The pioneer in this business was Frederick D.
Hughes. He began joint keeping on a large scale in apartments
adjoining the Cremorne Garden on West Thirty-second street, he
being the principal of the firm who carried on the disreputable
business of the former resort. He is a devoted yachtsman, having
preference for catamarans, and of those craft he has owned and
sailed the swiftest of the swift. Among the fiends he is
considered a good fellow. To the entrance to his joint a short
flight of stone steps led; there was an inner-glazed door and a
long hall. The smoking-room was entered from the rear; it was an
extensive apartment, presenting a rich and gorgeous interior to
eyes accustomed to the gloomy dens of Chinatown. The walls were
covered with heavy gilt and brown paper, with tasteful dado and
frieze. At either end of the room were rich mural hangings
falling from the ceiling, and from the window cornices hung
handsome lambrequins and heavy curtains. Two brazen chandeliers
were provided with globes of colored glass, which softened the
dimly-burning lights, and rested the visual organs of the
smokers, while it enhanced the aesthetic beauty of their
surroundings. Costly imported carpets covered the oiled floor;
they gently sank beneath the feet but returned no sound.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the northern end of the room was a
fireplace, beneath a carven, colored mantel. In the long Winter
nights there glowed an anthracite coal fire, and the fuel slowly
consuming seemed a not inapt simile to the physical and mental
organizations of the smokers. They seemed to have no such
gruesome reflections, but contented lay and gazed into its fiery
recesses and imagined them to be unearthly grottoes, and conjured
up a host of jolly salamanders to people them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Reaching the length of the room on either side,
and separated by a broad isle, were platforms about three feet in
height. These were strewn with soft, warm and yielding Smyrna
rugs. Circular inflated rubber pillows were used for the head
instead of the barbarous neck-stiffening stools of Chinese
origin.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this place can, at the present writing, be
found from ten to thirty habitues of a night. There lie they
throughout the long dream-night of enervating intoxication. To
the neophyte the toned softness of the light, the graceful
abandon of the forms, negligent and lapped in lazy luxury upon
their Oriental couches, the silent footsteps of the attendants as
they move to and fro in the misty air, the dulcet and beautifully
modulated tones in which the fiends murmur, all creep upon the
mind like a vision from another world, and the imagination,
reeking with the seductive fumes, yields itself up helplessly to
the beatitude of the hour.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Apparently no vicious impulse, no harsh
thought, no remorseful recollection, disturbs the perfect harmony
of the surroundings; and the after memory of the Circean
enthrallment of Emotion and Reason appalls the senses at the
terrible fascination of the gulf upon whose brink the opium
smoker stands.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Occasionally throughout the night demands are
made for beverages either harmless or intoxicating. Seltzer
lemonade appears to be a favorite with the smokers at Cremorne,
but that does not preclude their indulgence in vinous spirituous
or malt liquors.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The smoking habit is claimed by its infatuated
serfs to nullify the &quot;curse o'rum.&quot; If they have no
desire for it they drink it just the same, perhaps through pure
&quot;cussedness.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The joint is kept open all night and a good
part of the day. Some of the most vicious fiends stay there from
the opening to the closing hour, and at the last feel indisposed
to leave. As is well-known, it is characteristic of the habit to
hate exertion of any kind.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To one under the god Opien's influence time is
nil. So long as his money holds out, he will &quot;hang
out.&quot; This joint used to be kept open all the time, but its
proprietor now has the consideration to close up long enough
occasionally to sweep out and ventilate his palace.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As the proprietor has truly said all classes
have patronized his place; when he first opened, he was,
according to his own statement, overrun with Wall street brokers,
who, he says, are always after a new sensation. He once said to
an inquiring visitor in whom he had confidence: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You would be astonished if I should name
over some of the people of both sexes who patronize my place. I
have private rooms upstairs for the high toned ones, so that they
can come and go without seeing anyone but the cooks and the man
at the door.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It was the night of my debut in this palace,
out from which the Chinese were barred, and all there were
&quot;sovereigns in their own right&quot;--being
Americans--although their pretense of ruling themselves was a
shallow and pitiable mockery. I had not smoked enough to arrive
at that blissful state which cold Northern English cannot
express; which warm Southern Italian comes nearer to describing
with its dolce far niente, but which the kief of the Orientals
comprehensively and tersely tells. It is a perfect ease of body,
brain, and conscience, a carelessness for what may come. The
subject knows not fear, and wants nothing. I had not reached this
paradise, purchasable far from fifty cents to a dollar, however,
and lazily reclined gazing at the proprietor, who was an
entertaining and companionable host.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He did not look half a bad fellow, and I
reflected that he must be a lover of nature, like all Corinthian
sailors; by an easily followed step of thought the host's
personality gave place to Henry D. Thoreau's. My pleasant
reflections upon the simple life of the hermit of Walden Pond,
who was among nature's most ardent lovers, were rudely
interrupted by the host's voice uttering with a laugh, the
following sentiment: &quot;Well, if I have got to send souls to
hell, I am going to send lots of them.&quot; And the fiends
laughed too. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Outdoor, Feb. 6, 1909, vol. 91, p275</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Warfare Against Opium-Smoking in America</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Last week the United States Senate passed the
Anti-Opium Bill. When it was brought up in the House, immediate
consideration was prevented by certain leaders, chiefly because
the bill, if passed, would involve a loss in revenue! The bill
forbids the importation into the United States, after April 1,
1909, of smoking opium in any form or any preparation or
derivative thereof. Opium, other than smoking opium, may be
imported for medicinal purposes only, under regulations which the
Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to establish.
Transgressors of the law are to be punished by the forfeiture of
the property and a fine of a sum not exceeding five thousand
dollars or less than fifty dollars, or by imprisonment for any
time not exceeding two years, or both. The Outlook has already
shown the necessity for the passage of such a bill. The special
necessity at the present time is evident from a telegram just
received by the Right Rev. Charles H. Brent, D.D., Bishop of the
Philippine Islands and Chairman of the American delegates to the
International Opium Conference which is about to meet at
Shanghai, China. Bishop Brent cables that, if this bill is not
immediately passed, every other nation of the twelve
participating nations will be in a better light as to recent
action in its own constituency than is our own. And yet our own
Department of State was the originator of the Conference! We urge
our readers to telegraph to their Congressmen requesting the
speedy enactment of the Anti-Opium Bill as passed by the Senate.
The provisions of the bill, which now awaits the action of the
House, give ample leeway for all necessary use of opium by
scientific or medical men.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">How the Opium Habit is Acquired </font></p>

<p><font size="3">by Virgil G. Eaton</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am not one of the persons who raise a great
cry about the evils of the &quot;opium-habit.&quot; I have no
doubt that the continued use of narcotics, whether they be
tobacco or opium, is injurious to the nervous system; but I also
firmly believe that the recuperative powers of the body are such
that they can largely overcome any harmful results coming from
the regular use of these substances. For instance, I know a
stonecutter who resides at Cape Elizabeth, Me., who for the past
twenty years has used twenty cents' worth of black &quot;navy
plug&quot; tobacco every day. He is a large, vigorous man,
weighing over two hundred pounds. His appetite is good; he sleeps
well, and, save for a little heart disturbance caused by
overstimulation, he is perfectly healthy, and is likely to live
until he is fourscore. He is now fifty-one years of age, and he
assures me he has used tobacco since he was fourteen, and never
had a fit of &quot;swearing off&quot; in his life. A peculiar
and, I should say, a rather troublesome habit of his, is to go to
bed every night with a big &quot;quid&quot; of hard
&quot;plug&quot; tobacco between his molars. As this is always
gone in the morning, and the pillow shows no traces of the weed,
he thinks he chews it and swallows it in his sleep, though he
never knows anything about the process.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is a widow who keeps a lodging-house in
Oak Street, Boston, Mass., who takes three drachms of morphia
sulphate every day, in three one- drachm doses, morning, noon,
and night. When it is remembered that an eighth of a grain is the
usual dose for an adult, while two grains are sufficient to kill
a man, the amount she takes seems startling. I asked her why she
did not try and substitute tobacco, or bromide, or chloral
hydrate for morphine, and she said they made her stick, so she
could not use them. This woman is sixty years old, very pale and
emaciated. Her appetite is poor. She attends to her duties
faithfully, however, and is able, with the help of a girl, to
carry on a large lodging-house.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I might give scores of instances similar to the
above, but these will do for my purpose. I believe that the
person who takes liquor or tobacco or opium, in regular
quantities at stated intervals, is able to withstand their effect
after getting fixed in the habit, and that it is the irregular,
spasmodic use of these articles which brings delirium and death.
It is the man who goes on a &quot;spree,&quot; and then quits for
a time, who has the weak stomach and aching head. His neighbor,
who takes his regular toddy and his his usual smoke, feels no
inconvenience.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For the past year or more I have studied the
growth of the opium-habit in Boston. It is increasing rapidly.
Not only are there more Chinese &quot;joints&quot; and
respectable resorts kept by Americans than there were a year ago,
but the number of individuals who &quot;hit the pipe&quot; at
home and in their offices is growing very fast. A whole opium
&quot;lay-out,&quot; including pipe, fork, lamp, and spoon, can
now be had for less than five dollars. This affords a chance for
those who have acquired the habit to follow their desires in
private, without having to reveal their secret to anyone. How
largely this is practiced I do not know, but, judging from the
telltale pallor of the faces I see, I feel sure the habit is
claiming more slaves every day.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In order to approximate to the amount of opium
in its various forms which is used in Boston, I have made a
thorough scrutiny of the physicians' recipes left at the
drugstores to be filled. As is well known, all recipes given by
physicians are numbered, dated, and kept on file at the
drugstores, so that they may be referred to at any time. To these
I went in search of information.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I was surprised to learn how extensively opium
and its alkaloids-- particularly sulphate of morphia--are used by
physicians. I found them prescribed for every ailment which flesh
is heir to. They are used for headache, sore eyes, toothache,
sore throat, laryngitis, diphtheria, bronchitis, congestion,
pneumonia, consumption, gastritis, liver- complaint, stone in the
gall-duct, carditis, aneurism, hypertrophy, peritonitis,
calculus, kidney trouble, rheumatism, neuralgia, and all general
or special maladies of the body. It is the great panacea and
cure-all.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During my leisure time I have looked up more
than 10,000 recipes. It has been my practice to go to the files,
open the book, or take up a spindle at random, and take 300
recipes just as they come. The first store I visited found 42
recipes which contained morphine out of the 300 examined. Close
by, a smaller store, patronized by poorer people, had 36. Up in
the aristocratic quarters, where the customers call in carriages,
I found 49 morphine recipes in looking over 300. At the North
End, among the poor Italian laborers, the lowest proportion of 32
in 300 was discovered. Without detailing all the places visited,
I will summarize by saying that, in 10,200 recipes taken in 34
drugstores, I found 1,481 recipes which prescribed some
preparation of opium, or an average of fourteen and one half
percent of the whole.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This was surprising enough; but my
investigations did not end here. Of the prescriptions furnished
by physicians I found that forty-two percent were filled the
second time, and of those refilled twenty-three percent contained
opium in some form. Again, twenty-eight percent of all
prescriptions are filled a third time; and of these, sixty-one
percent were for opiates; while of the twenty percent taken for
the fourth filling, seventy-eight percent were for the narcotic
drug, proving, beyond a doubt, that it was the opiate qualities
of the medicine that afforded relief and caused the renewal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From conversations with the druggists, I
learned that the proprietary or &quot;patent&quot; medicines
which have the largest sales were those containing opiates. One
apothecary told me of an old lady who formerly came to him as
often as four times a week and purchased a fifty-cent bottle of
&quot;cough-balsam.&quot; She informed him that it &quot;quieted
her nerves&quot; and afforded rest when everything else had
failed. After she had made her regular visits for over a year, he
told her one day that he had sold out of the medicine required,
and suggested a substitute, which was a preparation containing
about the same amount of morphine. On trial, the woman found the
new mixture answered every purpose of the old. The druggist then
told her she had acquired the morphine-habit, and from that time
on she was a constant morphine-user.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It was hard to learn just what proportion of
those who began by taking medicines containing opiates became
addicted to the habit. I should say, from what I learned, that
the number was fully twenty-five percent-- perhaps more. The
proportion of those who, having taken up the habit in earnest,
left it off later on, was very small--not over ten percent. When
a person once becomes an opium-slave, the habit usually holds
through life.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I was told many stories about the injurious
effects of morphine and opium upon the morals of those who use
it. One peculiarity of a majority is that, whenever a confirmed
user of the narcotic obtains credit at the drugstore, he at once
stops trading at that place and goes elsewhere. All the druggists
know this habit very well, and take pains to guard against it.
Whenever a customer asks for credit for a bottle of morphine, the
druggist informs him that the store never trusts anyone; but if
he has no money with him the druggist will gladly give him enough
to last a day or two. In this way the druggist keeps his
customer, whereas he would have lost his trade if the present had
not been made at the time credit was refused.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Of course, I heard much about the irresistible
desire which confirmed slaves to the habit have for their
delight. There is nothing too degrading for them to do in order
to obtain the narcotic. Many druggists firmly believe that a
majority of the seemingly motiveless crimes which are perpetrated
by reputable people are due to this habit. In pursuit of opium
the slaves will resort to every trick and art which human
ingenuity can invent. There is a prisoner now confined in the
Concord (Mass.) Reformatory who has his opium smuggled in to him
in the shape of English walnuts donated by a friend. The friend
buys the opium and, opening the walnut-shells, extracts the meat,
and fills up the spaces with the gum. Then he sticks the shells
together with glue and sends them to the prison.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At present our clergymen, physicians, and
reformers are asking for more stringent laws against the sale of
these narcotics. The law compelling every person who purchases
opium or other poisons to &quot;register,&quot; giving his name
and place of residence to the druggist, has been in force in
Massachusetts for several years, and all this time the sales have
increased. No registration law can control the traffic.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The parties who are responsible for the
increase of the habit are the physicians who give the
prescriptions. In these days of great mental strain, when men
take their business home with them and think of it from waking to
sleeping, the nerves are the first to feel the effects of
overwork. Opium effects immediate relief, and the doctors,
knowing this, and wishing to stand well with their patients,
prescribe it more and more. Their design is to effect a cure. The
result is to convert their patients into opium-slaves. The
doctors are to blame for so large a consumption of opium, and
they are the men who need reforming.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Two means of preventing the spread of the habit
suggest themselves to every thoughtful person:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1. Pass a law that no prescriptions containing
opium or its preparations can be filled more than once at the
druggist's without having the physician renew it. The extra cost
of calling on a doctor when the medicine ran out would deter many
poor people from acquiring the habit. Such a law would also make
the doctors more guarded in prescribing opiates for trivial
ailments. With the law in force, and the druggists guarded by
strict registration laws, we could soon trace the responsibility
to its proper source, and then, if these safeguards were not
enough, physicians could be fined for administering opiates save
in exceptional cases.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2. The great preventive to the habit is to keep
the body in such a state that it will not require sedatives or
stimulants. The young men and women in our cites have too big
heads, too small necks, and too flabby muscles. They should
forsake medicine, and patronize the gymnasium. Let them develop
their muscles and rest their nerves, and the family doctor, who
means well, but who cannot resist the tendency of the age, can
take a protracted vacation. Unless something of the kind is done
soon, the residents of our American cities will be all
opium-slaves.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">AN ENTERPRISING TURK.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">HE TRAVELS MANY MILES TO FIND HIS OCCUPATION
GONE.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The long-prevalent impression that the people
of the United States rank first among the nations in the spirit
of enterprise must be modified in the light of the
recently-discovered fact that the &quot;unspeakable Turk&quot;
has unsuspected stores of the article bottled up under his tanned
and inexpressive countenance. The fact was revealed by the
journey of a Turk all the way from Smyrna to this city to set up
the business of adulterating opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Immediately on his arrival he called on a
member of the firm of McKesson &amp; Robbins and proposed to
start the business on the co-operative plan, he to furnish the
experience and McKesson &amp; Robbins the capital. It must have
been a severe shock to his Oriental habits of thought when he was
politely informed that he was in the wrong house for that kind of
business. But he was not dismayed, and fortune was more than
kind. After further search he fell in with a relative, who had
preceded him to this country, and by the latter's help operations
were immediately begun. The drug was materially increased in
volume, but correspondingly reduced in strength, by the addition
of liberal quantities of fig paste, colored with a decoction of
yellow berries. The product of this new industry was placed upon
the market at a very moderate price by a commission house outside
of the drug trade, but in communication with the retail branch of
it through the furnishing of kindred articles.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When the adulterated drug began to attract
attention, which it quickly did, little difficulty was
encountered in tracing the manufacture to its source, and
although there was no law under which the offenders could be made
to discontinue business or be punished, yet a very effectual
remedy was found in exposure. This was employed with so much
success that after a few months the adulterated article was
practically unsalable, the new industry was paralyzed, and the
gentleman from Smyrna retired in disgust to his native town. The
collapse of this international venture insures to the people of
this country the continued use of pure opium, as the precautions
of the United States Government effectually prevent the
importation of the adulterated article. It is said by authorities
on the drug that the adulteration of opium cannot be detected
except by analysis, and that special skill is required even in
analyzing it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The New York Times March 29, 1896, p. 28</font></p>

<p><font size="3">IN THE LAND OF OPIUM</font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE IMMENSE AREAS GIVEN TO THE GROWTH OF THE
POPPY.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Drug's History Traced from the Plant to the
Pipe--The Scenes in the Indian Fields--Processes Through Which
the Opium Goes--The Monopoly of Finishing for Smoking in the
Hands of Chinese--View of a Lucknow Smoking Den.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Few people have any idea of the vast areas
given over wholly to the cultivation of opium. The consumption
and the manufacture of this drug, far from being on the decline,
are on the increase to an almost incredible extent. The greed for
gold is far more predominant in the human make-up than is the
philanthropic spirit which seeks to elevate mankind, though its
purse may suffer in so doing. England, this great moral nation,
&quot;ever ready to take the sword, &amp;c., for the oppressed
and for the elevation of mankind in general,&quot; reaps more
benefit from the cultivation of opium than all other nations put
together.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the district of Bengal alone there are
nearly 1,000,000 acres devoted exclusively to the cultivation of
the poppy. Its cultivation is legalized and in every way
encouraged by the British Government, which has an absolute
monopoly of this industry in India. The two principal districts
are presided over by and under the direct control of English
officials residing at Patna and Ghazipur. The Bahar agency
embraces an opium field of about 500,000 acres, and that of
Benares is a close second with 478,500 devoted to the cultivation
of this much-talked-of drug.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is a fierce dispute going on just now as
to the relative merits or demerits of opium. Many eminent men in
the scientific world openly declare that opium is a blessing. The
Government experts in the country where it grows go so far as to
say that opium is a blessing instead of being a curse to the
natives. However, the vast majority of mankind will long be of
the undivided opinion that opium is the most all-crushing curse
that afflicts man. The enthusiasts, or, rather, extremists, of
the International Anti-Opium Society picture the condition of
India under the ban of opium in the most dreadful manner
possible. According to one of these men, all of the 600,000,000
of human beings in Asia are exposed to the evils of the opium
trade as legalized by the British Government. In order to derive
a revenue from it the Indian Government issues licenses for the
sale and consumption of this poisonous drug in vile places in all
large cities, like Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Lucknow, and
Maulmain, and in all towns and villages of India and Burmah.
These licenses are not issued for the purpose of limiting the
sale of something that cannot be prohibited, but they are issued
with the requirement that the holder of the license must sell a
stipulated quantity or pay a forfeit!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The more sold the more revenue the English
Crown will receive. As the opium is bought from the Government
agents, of course it is known how much the holder of the license
sells. A member of the Parliament who was most bitterly opposed
to this traffic has been traveling through India gathering facts
and seeing for himself what the condition of the natives is under
an unrestricted use of opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One of the opium dens at Lucknow is graphically
described. There is no secrecy about selling or purchasing the
drug: it is handled as would be sugar, flour, or the other
necessities of life. Entering with the customers, you will find
yourself in a spacious but very dirty courtyard, around which are
ranged fifteen or twenty small rooms. This is the establishment
of the Government collector--the opium farmer. The stench is
sickening, and the swarm of flies intolerable. Enter one of the
small rooms. It has no windows and is very dark, but in the
centre is a small charcoal fire, the glow of which lights up the
faces of nine or ten human beings--men and women--lying on the
floor like pigs in a sty. A young girl fans the fire, lights the
opium pipe, and holds it to the mouth of the last comer till his
head falls heavily on the body of the inert man or woman who
happens to lie near him. In no groggery, in no lunatic or idiot
asylum, will one see such utter, helpless depravity as appears in
the countenances of those in the preliminary stages of opium
drunkenness. Here one may see some handsome young married women,
nineteen or twenty years of age, sprawling over the senseless
bodies of men. Here is a much younger girl sitting among a group
of newly arrived customers singing lewd songs as they hand around
the pipes. At night these dens are all crowded to excess, and it
is estimated that there are some 14,000 people in Lucknow abject
slaves of this hideous vice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There are those, however, who have radically
different opinions on the opium question. The use of the drug in
America or Europe under vastly different climatic conditions has
nothing in common with the use of it in its native land. The
Bishop of Calcutta, on being asked for an opinion on this
subject, said among other things that, &quot;while admitting that
there are evils arising from the use of opium, we are of the
opinion that they are not sufficiently great to justify us in
restricting the liberty which all men should be permitted to
express in such matters. Medical testimony [illeg.] to show that
opium used in moderation is in this country harmless and under
certain conditions of life distinctly beneficial.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One distinguished native, a high official of
the Indian Museum, was rather sarcastic when asked his opinion on
this subject. He said that the opium habit was much preferable to
the alcoholism of America and Europe, and recommended the
introduction of the drug as a substitute for alcohol.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is worth a long journey to visit the poppy
fields when the season begins. In February, as a rule, the plant
is in full flower and has attained a height of three or four
feet. Each stem has from two to five capsules of the size of a
duck's egg. This is the time for the all- important operation of
gathering the juice. Before the capsules are pierced the fallen
petals of the flowers are carefully gathered and sorted,
according to condition, in three grades, They are heated over a
slow fire and formed into thin cakes, to be used for the covering
of the drug when collected. This done, the piercing of the pods
begins. This requires great skill, as the yield greatly depends
on the exactness of this operation. The opium farmer and his
assistants to about armed with a small lancet-like affair, which
is provided with three or four short, sharp prongs. With this a
half dozen perpendicular cuts are made in each capsule or seed
pod. The juice begins to flow at once, but quickly congeals. The
day after all the thickened juice is carefully gathered, being
scraped off with a small iron trowel expressly made for this
purpose.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The mass thus gathered is put into an earthen
vessel and kept carefully stirred for a month or more, great care
being taken to have it well aired, but not exposed to the sun.
This finished, the opium examiner comes along with this
assistant, an expert tester. These two pass upon the grade
produced, and when this is done the whole is put into a large
box. Now it is worked very much in the same fashion as baker's
dough, to give it the required consistency. After this operation
is finished, the opium is put up into balls for exportation. This
is a very interesting sight. The natives wade about in the large
vats containing the pastelike drug and hand out the stuff to
hundreds of ballmakers sitting around the room. Every man has a
spherical brass cup, lined with the petals mentioned, before him.
Into this is pressed the regulation quantity of opium. From this
brass cup, when properly pressed, the opium ball is transferred
to another man who gives it a coating of clay. This gives the
drug, when ready for shipment, the appearance of a fair-sized
cannon ball. When well prepared in this manner, opium will keep
its properties for fifteen years or more.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this condition it is as yet raw opium and
unfit for smoking. For some unexplained reason the final
preparation of the drug to make it marketable for smoking is
almost a monopoly in the hands of the Chinese. These people pay
an enormous bonus for this privilege, but their profits are in
proportion. The Chinese seem to be the most successful in giving
this subtle drug the finishing touches. There are large
establishments devoted to the preparation of the crude opium.
Outside of these factories there are pyramids of opium balls
which at first glance remind one far more of an artillery park
than of an opium factory. The balls are broken, and after being
removed are remoistened with a little water and allowed to stand
abut fourteen hours. They are then put into pans, two and a half
balls with ten pints of water. After this has boiled for about
ten hours it is reduced to a thin paste of uniform consistency.
This is then transferred to a larger vessel and allowed to stand
for fifteen hours. Then it is put through a great deal of
filtering and various other processes and finally put over a
brisk fire. At a certain period it is quickly taken away from the
fire and vigorously stirred until cold, the cooling being
accelerated by coolies with large fans. When quite cold it is
taken to a special room and kept there for some months before it
is considered in prime condition for smoking. Prepared this way,
the opium is of the consistency of a very thick syrup. It is put
up in small boxes or jars of graduated weights to suit the
customers. All such boxes have the name of the maker stamped on
each package. In this condition the drug is exceedingly valuable,
and all the employees are searched for hidden opium before they
leave the factory.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Review of Reviews 5 June (1892), p. 604</font></p>

<p><font size="3">SAN FRANCISCO OPIUM JOINTS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The CALIFORNIA ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE for May
prints a valuable article on &quot;Opium and Its Votaries,&quot;
by F. J. Masters, who has studied the subject in San Francisco at
first hand. An added air of authority is given to the paper by
the illustrations of opium dens and smokers in various phases of
dilapidation. These pictures are copies of flash-light
photographs taken in the underground joints of San Francisco by a
party which the magazine sent out for that purpose, and who,
backed up by a crack detective, accomplished their end in spite
of John Chinaman's vigorous remonstrances against being
&quot;took&quot; in such circumstances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">While the opium evil is a huge one and dreadful
in its consequences, the immediate physical effects of the drug,
Dr. Masters tells us, has been greatly exaggerated. &quot;It is a
mistake to suppose that when a man begins to smoke the drug he
begins to lose strength and waste away. Opium is no doubt
responsible for the widespread misery and destitution seen in
many of the poorer districts of China; but the concomitant evils
have to be distinguished from the direct effects upon the
individual.&quot; There are degrees of opium, and the penurious
Chinaman can often only afford to smoke a vile adulteration,
which is doubly ruinous.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Masters describes in very interesting
detail the manner of carrying on the San Francisco joints, of
which there are a great number: &quot;In China the most unbiased
and trustworthy opinions give thirty per cent of those who are
addicted to the habit and ten per cent of confirmed opium sots. I
am inclined to believe that the same figures will hold good for
the Chinese in San Francisco, though Colonel Bee, the Chinese
Consul, places the percentage much lower.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nor is it only the Chinese who use the
demoralizing drug. The vice is spreading among Americans to a
serious extent. But they do not go to the joints. &quot;If done
at all,&quot; says Dr. Masters, &quot;it must be very secretly.
The movements of white people about Chinatown are so carefully
watched, and the different hells under almost half-hourly
surveillance, that it would be impossible for them to frequent
these places without soon attracting the attention of the police.
There is plenty of smoking done by American people, but it is
carried on in private houses or in rooms secretly kept by white
people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Notwithstanding the constant increase of the
tax on opium it continues to come into the country in greater and
greater quantities; and last year, under the $12 per pound tax of
the McKinley tariff, the importations amounted to 63,189 pounds
of prepared opium. Crude opium is not imported in such a
proportion as formerly, because the heavy duties make it
impossible to manufacture or &quot;cook&quot; the product in this
country and compete with the foreign prepared variety. But this
fact fosters numerous illicit establishments, which now and then
come to light.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In San Francisco a city ordinance attempts to
regulate the selling of smoking opium by a high license
proportional to the gross business done, and in 1889 another
ordinance made it &quot;illegal to sell any extract of opium
except on a written order of a practicing physician, and
requiring that the amounts sold, with the name, sex, color and
residence of the purchaser, and the name of the prescribing
physician, be entered in a book. The City Council thus passes an
ordinance practically declaring a business illegal which it has
already legalized, and from which it is not ashamed to draw a
revenue.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The right way to deal with the problem, Dr.
Masters thinks, is to follow the advice of the better class of
Chinese, and remove prepared opium from the tariff list, declare
it contraband, and confiscate it wherever found.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;For the last thirty years,&quot; he says,
&quot;from pulpit, platform and press, we have been thundering
denunciations against Great Britain for importing crude opium
into China and deriving a revenue therefrom, which some have
called a revenue of blood, and yet during the last eight years we
have been importing, at this port alone, half a million pounds of
opium, prepared only for smoking purposes, and which have brought
to our national treasury a revenue drawn from human vice
amounting to five millions of dollars. Yet this is only for the
last eight years, and this a period, it will be observed, marked
by the exaction of heavy import duties, and added to this a
steadily decreasing Chinese population.&quot; The disgusting and
horrible effects of regular opium smoking are too well known
already, and that part of the article before us which deals with
them scarcely adds to the reputation of the pernicious drug. But
the thought of the introduction of the habit among Americans must
be a potent factor in our &quot;Chinese Question,&quot; and it is
an added reason why that problem must be largely solved by the
Americans of the Pacific Coast.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE OPIUM INDUSTRY IN AMERICA</font></p>

<p><font size="3">BY C.F. HOLDER</font></p>

<p><font size="3">An attempt to raise the opium poppy has been in
progress for several years in California. The hot days seemed
altogether favorable for the production of the plant and drug,
but the accompanying cold nights and the absence of cheap labor
proved fatal to the project, and it has been given up as a
failure. The value of the drug as a means of money making was, of
course, the incentive, and the extraordinary and growing demand
for opium in all countries tells a suggestive story of the habit
that has obtained a firm hold among the people of all races.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the very oldest books of the Arabs the poppy
is mentioned, showing that the use of the gum is one of the most
ancient of practices. The poppy used for the purpose is Papaver
somniferum, a plant discovered, in all probability, by the Arabs
and carried from Arabia by man over large portions of the globe.
At first opium was used as a medicine. Theophrastus was familiar
with it, and Dioscorides, in 77 A.D., wrote a learned paper on
its properties. Up to the twelfth century Asia Minor was the
source of supply, and from then on it was gradually distributed
over the globe. The Chinese first obtained the drug in the
thirteenth century, it being used purely as medicine; but
gradually its insidious effects were realized and it became so
important a drug in a commercial sense that in 1757 the great
monopoly was secured in India by the East India Company. The
business rapidly increased from one thousand chests in 1776 to
nearly five thousand in 1790. At this time the emperor Kea King
fully realized the effect the drug was having upon his people,
and in 1786 its importation was forbidden. Chinese caught smoking
were flogged and severely punished. This not having the desired
effect, those who were found using it were transported or
beheaded. Even this did not affect the sale, and in 1825 the
importation of opium into China had increased to 16,877 chests.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1839 the Chinese government made a desperate
effort to drive off the English opium sellers by ordering off the
English opium ships. This not being complied with, nearly thirty
thousand chests of opium were destroyed, entailing a loss of ten
million dollars. This led to the war and final treaty of Nankin
in 1842.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Chinese government appreciates the
dangerous nature of the drug and its effect upon the nation, and
has never ceased its endeavors to stamp it out; but without
avail, and today China is probably the largest poppy producing
nation. The provinces famous for it are Chekeang, Yunnan, While
southwestern China produces 224,000 peculs, against 100,000
peculs from India. Today over half the provinces of China produce
opium, and the habit of opium smoking seems confirmed. Turkey is
noted for its production, and the best opium used in the United
States by druggists comes from there.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Some idea of the importance of the trade and
the amount used can be obtained from the following: In Macedonia
the crop is estimated at 140,000 pounds per annum. In Bengal,
where it is a government monopoly, the output is equal to about
90,000 chests, valued at $55,000,000. Persia produces about
10,000 chests: Egypt about $10,000 worth annually, and Mozambique
has 60,000 acres under cultivation. Opium has been raised in
Virginia and Tennessee, as well as California, but owing to the
lack of cheap labor and the uncertainty of the crops, due to
frosts, the business is unprofitable.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nearly all the opium smoked by the Chinese in
this country comes from the Fook Hing Company, of Hong-Kong,
which pays the government $300,000 per year for the privilege of
carrying on the business. The opium is packed in five-tael tins,
which bring in San Francisco $8 each. Some excessive smokers use
from four to eight dollars' worth a week.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It has been estimated that in San Francisco
thirty per cent of the Chinese are addicted to smoking and that
ten per cent of the entire population of Chinatown are habitual
&quot;opium drunkards.&quot; The drug is smoked as freely as
tobacco. First, there are the opium dens. There are scores of
these dens in the Chinese quarter of every large city. There the
Chinaman can buy his pipe and smoke in peace. In San Francisco
white people are forbidden to visit these dens, but they have
such places of their own, which are well known to the police, and
the vice is ever spreading and increasing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is somewhat difficult to determine the
amount of opium received in San Francisco, but during the past
decade about 600,000 pounds has been taken into that port. In one
year the importations for smoking purposes amounted to 100,000
pounds. Previous to 1883 the duty was but $6 per pound. At that
time it was increased to $10 per pound on the smoking extract and
$1 per pound for crude opium. This had little or no effect upon
the trade, as consumers were obliged to have the drug at any
price. In 1889 the McKinley bill raised the duty to $12 per pound
on opium of all kinds which contained less than nine per cent of
morphia. Even under this restriction, and despite the fact that
the exclusion bill was in full force, over 63,000 pounds of opium
were legitimately introduced in that year, and probably twice as
much more smuggled in, the government receiving nearly a million
dollars from the duties.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the present time the importation of crude
opium is decreasing. This is due to the law of 1889, which states
that only native Americans can legally manufacture the extract,
and the law also demands a tax of $10 per pound. The duty on the
best Patna opium is $12 per pound, and as it requires two and
one-half pounds of this to equal one of the extract, this would
make the latter cost about $30 per pound. To this would have to
be added $10 per pound revenue tax, which makes a total of $40
per pound on American made opium extract. It need not be said
that very little is made, as the Chinese preparation can be had
for $18 per pound. The great demand for the extract has induced
smuggling, and illicit stills were started everywhere. Opium was
and is still smuggled in at the Canada and Mexican lines. It is
landed at the islands off shore and brought in by Chinese
fishermen, smuggled in on steamers, dropped into the bay and the
law evaded in numerous ways familiar to the &quot;heathen
Chinee.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In San Francisco hundreds of &quot;opium
kitchens&quot; were started. These were extremely difficult to
find. Some were established in boats, others in dark cellars,
others in the rear of private dwellings. Scores have been closed
up by the police, yet some undoubtedly thrive, just as the whisky
[sic] distillers escape the law in the wilds of Kentucky and
Tennessee. The city of San Francisco has aided the government in
restricting the sale. In 1881 the city passed a bill declaring it
unlawful for any one to sell opium for smoking purposes without a
license, the amount of the license being gagged by the amount of
business. Thus if a den did a business of $5,000, the owner was
charged $150 for the privilege. In 1889, at the earnest request
of reformers, an ordinance was passed making it illegal to sell
opium without a physician's prescription. There is also a law
which makes it illegal for any one to keep or even visit an opium
house. Three months' imprisonment is the punishment, but this has
no effect. The dens are crowded, as every tourist who goes
through Chinatown knows, and the only result is that whites are
not found in the Chinese dens; they start dens of their own.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The difficulty of conviction lies in the
universality of the habit, as it pervades the home and business.
Wherever the Chinese are found there will be the odor of opium.
They smoke it as Americans do tobacco. Nearly every well
regulated Chinese home has its opium smoking outfit, where the
guest is invited to smoke. Many of the merchants have such a
retreat in the rear of their shops, into which a customer may be
asked to smoke as an American merchant is invited to take a
cigar. The difficulty, then, lies in the impossibility of drawing
the line between professional and private opium dens.</font></p>

<h1>Are The Drug Laws Constitutional? </h1>

<p> <b>A Historical Perspective</b> </p>

<p> From _Our Right To Drugs_ by Thomas Szasz, Praeger
Publishers, NY (1992): </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>*The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906* </h2>

<p> Before 1907, all drugs could be sold and bought like any
other consumer good. The manufacturer did not even have to
disclose the contents of his concoction. Hence the name patent
medicine, the adjective alluding to the fact that the composition
was a trade secret, protected by a patented name. </p>

<p> Although there is no evidence that the American consumer ever
complained about the free market in drugs, there is plenty of
evidence that his self appointed protectors complained bitterly
and loudly. The first landmark event in the federal regulation of
drugs (and foods) was the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. What did
Congress intend to achieve with this seemingly laudable
legislation? To protect people from the sale of
&quot;adulterated&quot; or &quot;misbranded&quot; foods or drugs,
that is, &quot;assur[ing] the customer of the identity of the
article purchased, not of its usefulness.&quot; </p>

<p> I say Congress's aim in enacting this legislation was
seemingly laudable because, while it is desirable that people
know what drugs they buy, forcing manufacturers by law to list
the ingredients of their products is an unnecessary infringement
on the free market -- the foot in the door of
paternalistic-statist protectionism. If Great American Drugs,
Inc., wants to market a mystery product, there is no reason why
the government should prevent it from doing so. And if I want to
buy such a pig in a poke, why should the government prevent me
from making that choice? People who want to be informed about the
drugs they buy and use would abstain from purchasing mystery
products, and market forces would then create a supply of
truthfully labeled drugs. In short, there would be no need to
prohibit the non-disclosure of the contents of medicinal (or
other) products. It is enough to prohibit false disclosure and to
punish it, as fraud, by both criminal and civil penalities. As
for nondisclosure, it would be &quot;punished&quot; by the
invisible hand of the market. The truth is that behind Congress's
ostensible aim of combating drug misbranding lay its growing
antagonism to the habit of pharmacological self-pleasuring,
manifested by the act's specifically mandating the listing on the
label of what were then the main ingredients of Americans'
favorite nostrums: alcohol, hypnotics, and sedatives. The
relevant lines of the Food and Drugs Act read as follows: </p>

<p> That for purposes of this Act an article shall also be deemed
misbranded: ... if the package fails to bear a statement on the
label of the quantity or proportion of any alcohol, morphine,
opium, cocaine, heroin, alpha or beta eucaine, chloroform,
cannabis, chloral hydrate, or acetanilide. </p>

<p> It is implicit in this sentence that, back then, Congress
took for granted the legality of a free market in drugs,
including cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and morphine. </p>

<p> [...] </p>

<h2>*The Harrison Act (1914) and It's Aftermath* </h2>

<p> In 1914, Congress enacted another landmark piece of anti-drug
legislation: the Harrison Narcotic Act. Originally passed as a
record-keeping law, it quickly became a prohibition statute. In
the course of the next seven years, by a curious coincidence of
history -- if, indeed, it is a coincidence -- in Russia the
Soviet Union replaced the czarist empire, while in the United
States the free market in drugs was replaced by federal drug
prohibition possessing unchallengeable authority. Excerpts from
two key Supreme Court decisions quickly tell the story. </p>

<p> In 1915, in a test of the Harrision Act, the Court upheld it
but expressed doubts about its constitutionality: &quot;While the
Opium Registration Act of December 17, 1914, may have a moral
end, as well as revenue, in view, this court, in view of the
grave doubt as to its constitutionality except as a revenue
measure, construes it as such.&quot; </p>

<p> Yet, only six years later the Court considered objection to
federal drug prohibition a taboo. In Whipple v. Martinson the
justices declared, </p>

<p> &quot;There can be no question of the authority of the State
in the exercise of its police power to regulate the
administration, sale, prescription, and use of dangerous and
habit-forming drugs.... </p>

<p> The right to exercise this power is so manifest in the
interest of public health and welfare, that it is unnecessary to
enter upon a discussion of it beyond saying that it is too firmly
established to be successfully called in question. </p>

<p> In 1914, trading in and using drugs was a right. In 1915,
limited federal drug controls were a constitutionally
questionable tax revenue measure. By 1921, the federal government
had gained not only complete control over so-called dangerous
drugs, but also a quasi-papal immunity to legal challenge of its
authority. Thus has the rejection of one of our most basic
constitutional rights become transformed into reverence for one
of our most baneful therapeutic-religious dogmas. Once ignited,
the fire of &quot;progressive&quot; drug protectionism spread and
soon enveloped the whole contry, transforming the Harrison Act
into the legislative embodiment of the &quot;moral principle that
taking narcotics for other than medicinal purposes was harmful
and should be prevented.&quot; That threw the monkey wrench
medicinal purpose into the machinery of the trade in drugs; this
undefined and undefinable concept has haunted us ever since. In
1920, drug prohibitionists won another major victory: America
was, at last, alcohol-free -- if not de facto, then at least de
jure. Since 1924, when Congress made it illegal to manufacture,
possess, or sell heroin, America has been free from heroin as
well -- if not in practice, then at least in theory. </p>

<p> [...] </p>

<p> In retelling this tale, it is impossible to overemphasize
that, although initially the drug laws were intended to protect
people from being &quot;abused&quot; by drugs others wanted to
sell them, this aim was soon replaced by that of protecting them
from &quot;abusing&quot; drugs they wanted to buy. The government
thus succeeded in depriving us not only of our basic right to
ingest whatever we choose, but also of our right to grow,
manufacture, sell, and buy agricultural products used by man
since antiquity. <br>

<h1>EVIDENCE FOUND OF ANCIENT MARIJUANA USE </h1>

<p>Albany (NY) Times Union, 20 May 1993 </p>

<p>(attributed to Newsday) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The first physical evidence that marijuana was used as a
medicine in the ancient Mideast was reported Wednesday by Israeli
scientists who found residue of the drug with the skeleton of a
girl who apparently died in childbirth 1,600 years ago. </p>

<p>The researchers said the marijuana probably was used by a
mid-wife trying to speed the birth, as well as ease the pain.
Until now, the researchers wrote in a letter to the journal
Nature, &quot;physical evidence of cannabis (marijuana) use in
the ancient Middle East has not yet been obtained.&quot; </p>

<p>The seven researchers -- from Hebrew University, the Israel
Antiquities Authority and the National Police Headquarters
forensic division -- said references to marijuana as a medicine
are seen as far back as 1,600 B.C. in Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek
and Roman writings. But physical evidence that the hemp weed,
cannabis sativa, was used for that purpose has been missing. </p>

<p>The researchers' examination of an undisturbed family tomb
near Jerusalem dating to the fourth century AD indicated the
girl, about 14, died because her pelvis was too small to permit
normal birth. <br>

<h1>From Mr Sin to Mr Big </h1>

<p> Auth: Desmond Manderson </p>

<p> Published: 1993 </p>

<p> Publisher: Oxford University Press Australia </p>

<p> ISBN: 0 19 553531 6 </p>

<h2>Background to the Book. </h2>

<p> (From back cover) </p>

<p> From Mr Sin to Mr Big is a compelling legal and social
history of the origins and development of drug laws in Australia.
It argues that the selective enactment of 'drug' laws has been
driven by fear, racism, powerful international pressures, and the
vested interests of the medical profession, bureaucrats and
politicians, rather than by genuine concerns about the welfare of
users. </p>

<p> Behind the emotion and contoversy that surround the use of
illegal drugs lie previously unexamined assumptions about how and
why certain substances - such as opium, herion and cannabis -
have been prohibited, while others - such as alcolhol and tobacco
- have not. This book challenges these assumptions, while also
examining the power and efficacy of law as a means of achieving
social change. </p>

<p> Desmond Manderson traces the legislative developments, from

<h2>Interesting quotes from the book. </h2>

<p> (page 7) </p>

<p> In nineteenth-century Australia, opium was the preserve of
neither the creative few nor the urban poor. It was freely
available and freely used. Furthermore, perhaps partly as a
consequence of the weakness of the medical profession, the line
which is now seen to divide medical 'use' form non-medical
'abuse' was not yet apparent. Many people who consumed opium
undoubtedly did so out of habit. Indeed, temperance activists who
would rather forfiet their lives than drink a nip of whiskey, but
who were addicted to opium, were the butt of many jokes. 'I
believe the teetotalers have too little pleasure in this world,
whatever they may hope for in the next,' said Godfrey Carter, a
member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly well known for his
opposition to the temperance movement, in 1898, &quot;and when I
think what little joy they have here at present is derived, to a
great extent, from the use of morphine, chlorodyne, painkiller,
and a variety of other preparations of opium, why should we
prevent them from going to their chemists and getting these
things?&quot; </p>

<p> (page 19) </p>

<p> As the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, whose masthead proudly
proclaimed 'Australia for the White Man', stated in 1889: </p>

<p> &quot;The badness of the Chinaman, socially and morally, is
the outcome of his low wages ... If Chinamen will tomorrow refuse
to work for less wages, man for man, than Britons, and will
refuse to work longer hours, the head and front of the objections
to their presence will disappear.&quot; </p>

<p> For the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, the Chinese were
'jaundice-coloured apostles of unlimited competition'. </p>

<p> The proponents of a 'White Australia', however, slid with
ease from arguments of economic protectionism to visceral racism.
The Chinese were painted as living squalidly and in filth, their
habits depraved and their lives degraded. The absence of Chinese
women was seen as a threat to the honor and chastity of innocent
European women and girls (and prostitution certainly flourished
in the Chinatowns of large communities). That the Chinese men
worked on Sundays was portrayed as an indication of the
infiltration of paganism and devil-worshipping into god-fearing
Australian society. In the slandering of the Chinese, almost
anything went, as this extract from a tract written by someone
who went by the ironic pseudonym 'Humanity' shows: </p>

<p> &quot;The Chinese amidst their evil surroundings, and their
filthy and sinful abodes of sin and swinish devilry [will be]
entered into by the servants of the Most High God! May the
wayside scattering of the seed of holiness and truth take root in
the hotbed of all unholy and unclean vices! ... It would never be
believed that our Saxon and Norman girls could have sunk so low
in crime as to consort with such a herd of Gorilla
Devils...&quot; </p>

<p> (page 23-24) </p>

<p> Opium was seen as a pollutant, moral as well as physical; it
was tainted by the environment of its consumption and by its
connections with the Chinese themselves. The potency of these
separate aesthetic revulsions-against dirtiness, the Chinese, and
the smell of opium-was compounded by their mutual association, as
can be seen from the description of an opium den contained in the
'Bulletin's&quot; 1886 feature on 'The Chinese in Australia': </p>

<p> &quot;Down from the fan-tan den are stairs leading to lower
and dirtier abodes: rooms darker than and more greasy than
anything on the ground floor: rooms where the legions of
aggressive stinks peculiar to Chinamen seems to linger ... Yet
the rooms are not naturally repulsive, nor would they be so when
occupied by other tenants; but the Chinaman has defiled their
walls with his filthy touch; he has vitiated what was once a
reasonably pure atmosphere with his presence, and he has polluted
the premises with his disgusting habits; and so it is that nought
save suggestions of evil, incentives of disgust and associations
of vice, now seems to move in the fetid atmosphere ... The very
air of the alley is impregnated with the heavy odour of the
drug.&quot; </p>

<p> From being seen as a dirty habit in dirty people, opium
smoking came to be seen as an immoral habit in hated people. It
was a small step readily taken: from a symbol of depravity, opium
became a cause of it; from a sign of evil, it became an active
agent of it. </p>

<p> (page 32) </p>

<p> Sub-title: 'They all go to the Chinaman': Aboriginal Opium
Laws and the Chinese In fact, the first laws specifically to
prohibit opium did not seem to deal with the Chinese use of it at
all. The Queensland &quot;Sale and Use of Poison Act 1891&quot;
penalised &quot;any person who supplies, or permits to be
supplied, any opium to any aboriginal native of Australia or
half-caste of that race ... except for medicinal purposes
...&quot; </p>

<p> (page 36) </p>

<p> A man named Corbett, 'speaking for all other farmers',
complained that 'they could not get the blacks to work when they
wanted them, while the Chinese', who farmed half of the
surrounding land, could always get them, a fact which he
accounted for by saying that the Celestial paid their Aboriginal
employees in opium'. The solution seemed simple. As the local
carpenter argued, 'the blacks should be taken from the Chinese
and compelled to work for any European who might require their
services'. Opium was, as ever, a scapegoat. The local White
farmers, wanting cheap Black labour, could not understand why
they would rather work for the Chinese. The use of opium was
fastened upon as the only possible explanation for such a
perverse choice. </p>

<p> The more likely truth was that the Chinese treated the
Aboriginal with a modicum of respect. Roth reported the local
police as saying that is the White population ceased starving and
mistreating its Black employees, it could get as many workers as
it wanted. But even the crudest kind of decency appears to have
been beyond some of the locals. A man named Putt expressed his
grievance with incredulity: </p>

<p> &quot;I have shot thirteen or fourteen niggers in this
District and this is all the Government has done for me:-I can't
get a _____ nigger when I want one. They all go to the
Chinaman.&quot; </p>

<p> (page 204-205) </p>

<p> Senator Peter Baume, amongst others, has spoken with more and
more conviction as the years have passed. In one of his last
parliamentary speeches on the subject, before retiring to take up
an appointment as Professor of Community Medicine at the
University of New South Wales, he said: &quot;Our strategies seek
to prevent the production of certain designated illegal
substances, and fail to do so; they seek to prevent the
importation of substances, and fail to do so; they seek to
prevent the distribution of substances, and fail to do so; they
seek to prevent the sale and use of substances, and fail to do
so.&quot; </p>

<p> (page 207) </p>

<p> One thing is apparent. 'Drugs' is a subject which people
approach with many erroneous preconceptions, and a little
knowledge can change people's opinions profoundly. Both Peter
Baume and Peter Cleeland, chairmen of influential parliamentary
committees on the subject, have stressed to me how much their
thinking began to change when they first started to read and to
listen. <br>

<h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FEDERAL FIREARMS ENFORCEMENT </h1>

<p><b>Frederick S. Calhoun. Ph.D.</b> </p>

<p>Historian </p>

<p>Federal Law Enforcement Training Center </p>

<p>This is Appendix G from the David Koresh Investigation. It is
included because it contains interesting information on the
background of Federal law enforcement. </p>

<hr>

<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is a
relatively young law enforcement organization, having been
created formally in 1972. Yet, measured by the federal laws
related to the regulation and taxing of alcohol, tobacco, and
firearms-the laws ATF now enforces-the history of the bureau's
duties and responsibilities stretches across the full two
centuries of American history. As early as 1791, revenue acts
taxed both alcohol and tobacco and created the offices of tax
inspector, collector, and supervisor. During the next century,
the offices changed names as frequently as the tax rates changed,
but the federal interest in raising revenues from alcohol and
tobacco remained strong. Indeed, the formal organization of an
independent bureau within the Department of Treasury specializing
in alcohol, tobacco, and firearms law enforcement belatedly
recognized the distinct need for such an agency. </p>

<p>After the Civil War, revenue agents battled moonshiners
throughout the South in some of the bloodiest opposition ever to
federal law enforcement. Revenue agents and deputy U.S. marshals
by the score were killed as they roamed the hills and hollows
searching out illicit stills. Prohibition changed the
government's focus from taxing whiskey to banning it, yet the
revenue agent's job remained as dangerous. After experimenting in
social adjustment a dozen years, Prohibition was rescinded.
Spawned by the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, the Alcohol Tax Unit
was established as a tax-collecting branch within the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Continued concern over the violent,
organized mobs that plagued the major cities compelled the
federal government to try to curb the gangsters' ability to arm
themselves. Rather than ban outright the purchase of machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns-the weapons of choice for the
mobsters-Congress in 1934 simply imposed a tax those weapons.
Paying the tax required registering the weapon. The registration
requirement was intended to discourage ownership of such weapons
without outlawing them. No self-respecting gangster would want to
register, much less pay the tax, on his Tommygun. Their evasion
of the tax gave the government another legal tool to use in
arresting the gangsters and breaking up the mobs. </p>

<p>Because it was a tax rather than a prohibition, it fell to
Treasury to enforce the law as part of Treasury's role in
collecting all funds due the government. Within Treasury, the
Alcohol Tax Unit seemed the logical branch to enforce the new
law. Registering and taxing stills required many of the same
procedures and investigatory talents that would be needed to
register and tax weapons. In the end, the new assignment proved
comparatively easy. The unit was not overwhelmed with
registrations nor by the 1940s were the investigations into
evasions of the tax very time-consuming. As the gangsters
declined in number and power, so did their use of machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns. Enforcing the alcohol taxes again
occupied most of the unit's attention. </p>

<p>In 1951, the Alcohol Tax Unit began enforcing federal taxes on
tobacco, thus prompting a name change in 1952 to the Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax Division. Once again, the logic seemed to be that
collecting the tax on tobacco closely resembled the work
necessary to collect the tax on alcohol, machine guns, and
sawed-off shotguns. The 1968 passage of the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act and the Gun Control Act expanded the IRS
unit's jurisdiction to the criminal use of explosives and bombs.
The new laws also defined specific federal offenses involving
firearms, including transportation across state lines and use in
organized crimes. In recognition of this new enforcement
responsibility, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division changed its
name to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division (ATFD). Two
years later, Congress passed the Explosives Control Act defining
certain bombings and acts of arson as federal crimes. It assigned
jurisdiction for enforcing this new law to ATFD. With these
expanded responsibilities. the Treasury Department on July 1,
1972 created the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms under
the general oversight of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
for Enforcement, Tariffs and Trade, and Operations. For the past
twenty-one years, ATF has enforced the collection of federal
taxes on alcohol and tobacco and the federal controls and
regulations on firearms, with particular attention to their use
by criminals. </p>

<p>Although on its face the bureau seems a discordant collection
of separate duties, the techniques for enforcing the taxes and
ferreting out the illicit products, whether cases of whiskey,
cartons of cigarettes, crates of automatic weapons, or containers
of bombs, are strikingly similar. </p>

<p>Subsequent laws have expanded ATF's jurisdiction. The 1976
Arms Export Control Act focused the Bureau's attention on
international gun smuggling. The 1982 Anti-Arson Act gave ATF
authority to investigate the destruction of property by fire as
well as by explosives. Increased taxes on cigarettes and alcohol,
and enhanced regulatory measures such as the 1978 Contraband
Cigarette Act, have also enhanced the bureau's responsibility to
ensure the government receives its lawful taxes. </p>

<p>The bureau has been an effective force in law enforcement.
Supplies of illicit alcohol and smuggled tobacco have steadily
decreased, and tax revenues have risen. During 1991, for example,
ATF collected $7.7 billion in alcohol taxes and $4.8 billion in
tobacco taxes. ATF agents have also focused on tracking down
armed career criminals and criminal gang members. Investigations
in Florida resulted in the arrest of 45 Warlock motorcycle gang
members in 1991. Members of the Gullymen Posse, a gang of
Jamaican drug dealers known for its propensity to commit murder,
were arrested in New York by ATF agents in January 1991.
Similarly, an ATF investigation into the activities of the Born
to Kill gang culminated in the arrest of a dozen gang members in
August 1991. Sixteen members of the San Diego chapter of the
Hells Angels were convicted in 1992. As a result of these and
similar investigations, ATF has become the nation's principal
repository for gang-related information and intelligence. </p>

<p>The bureau has also earned an excellent reputation for working
well with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. ATF
agents also specialize in identifying anonymous bombers by their
&quot;signature&quot; habits in making bombs. For example, in
1990, the assassin of Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge
Robert Vance was ultimately identified by ATF agents who
recognized the way the bomb was constructed. Similarly, in the
midst of the tragedy in Waco, Texas, ATF agents investigating the
World Trade Center bombing helped to identify the van that was
used to hold the bomb. This early identification led FBI agents
to the rental car company and thereafter to arrests of the
terrorists before they could escape the country. </p>

<p>The bureau has developed considerable expertise in arson
investigations. At the request of the National Fire Protection
Agency, ATF began developing nationwide standards for fire
investigators. The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service
invited ATF to develop a protocol establishing an International
Response Team of investigators trained to search blast scenes
involving U.S. property abroad. Despite a rather eclectic array
of duties, ATF has succeeded in developing considerable expertise
in each area of its enforcement responsibilities. </p>

<p>The raid by ATF agents on the Branch Davidian compound
resulted from its enforcement of contemporary federal firearms
laws. In a larger sense, however, the raid fit within an
historic, well-established and well-defended government interest
in prohibiting and breaking up all organized groups that sought
to arm or fortify themselves. The 1934 law taxing weapons was
only the first time the federal government addressed private
ownership of weapons; it was not the first federal effort to
control firearms. From its earliest formation, the federal
government has actively suppressed any effort by disgruntled or
rebellious citizens to coalesce into an armed group, however
small the group, petty its complaint, or grandiose its ambition.
The collection of large arsenals by organized groups lent itself,
ultimately, to the violent use of those weapons against the
government itself or portions of its citizenry. Indeed, federal
agents who tried to disband the groups frequently became the
targets. </p>

<p>The discomfort over armed organizations predated the
Constitution. </p>

<p>The outbreak of what became known as Shays' Rebellion in 1786
gave added urgency to the establishment of a strong national
government. During the rebellion, hundreds of angry Massachusetts
farmers, most veterans of the Revolution and facing foreclosures
on their farms, banded together to keep the courts from issuing
any executions. Calling themselves Regulators, the farmers
quickly organized into a small army. Significantly, their first
foray was to capture the arsenal at Springfield. Although the
Regulators failed, the specter survived. Five months, delegates
from each of the thirteen states met in Philadelphia to design a
new experiment in government. </p>

<p>The lesson of Shays' Rebellion was not forgotten, even after
the new government was formed. In 1792, Congress passed a law
empowering the president to call out the state militias to
suppress insurrections if either an associate justice of the
Supreme Court or a local district court judge certified that
opposition to the laws was beyond the powers of the civil
authority to suppress. Ironically, the first occasion to resort
to that law grew out of the violent, organized, and armed
resistance to the federal government's whiskey tax. Thus, two of
the duties that ATF would later inherent-enforcing alcohol taxes
and controlling firearms-combusted in 1794 into the Whiskey
Rebellion, the first violent opposition to the new federal
government.[1] </p>

<p>Across the next century, succeeding presidents had sporadic,
though no less fearsome, occasion to dispatch the Army and the
state militias to suppress various outbreaks of armed opposition
to federal laws, taxes. and interests. In 1799, Fries Rebellion
against a federal tax on houses forced President John Adams to
muster the militia. Fugitive slave rescues during the 1850s
prompted the government to call out the military. Organized
resistance in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and
Wisconsin raised a troublesome specter. &quot;The main
opposition,&quot; President Millard Fillmore warned Congress in
December 1851, &quot;is aimed against the Constitution
itself.&quot; At the end of the decade, John Brown's ill-fated
raid on Harper's Ferry,. Virginia, sparked the government to
decisive action. Brown chose Harper's Ferry because of the
federal arsenal there. His intent was to distribute the weapons
among Southern slaves and lead them in revolt for their freedom.
Federal troops, however, thwarted the plan.[2] </p>

<p>After the Civil War, the federal government battled
unrepentant Southerners to protect the rights of the freedmen.
Nonetheless. federal officials acted only after the innumerable
Klan-style attacks were finally perceived as organized.
&quot;Outrages of various descriptions.&quot; Attorney General
George Williams advised southern U.S. Attorneys and Marshals in
1874. &quot;and in some cases atrocious murders have been
committed in your district by bodies of armed men. sometimes in
disguise and with the view it is believed of overawing and
intimidating peaceable and law abiding citizens and depriving
them of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and
laws of the United States.&quot; The attorney general ordered his
attorneys and marshals &quot;to detect, expose. arrest, and
punish the perpetrators of these crimes.&quot;[3] </p>

<p>Throughout the western territories and along the Mexican
border, the federal government found occasional need to suppress
armed bands of outlaws, ganged together to steal cattle or rob
the mails. General William Tecumseh Sherman. sent to the Arizona
border in April 1882 to investigate the outlaw troubles there,
advised President Chester A. Arthur that &quot;the Civil Officers
have not sufficient forces to make arrests, to hold prisoners for
trial or punish when convicted.&quot; The President promptly
proclaimed on May 31 that the areas plagued by the outlaws were
in a state of rebellion.[4] </p>

<p>The federal government looked no more kindly on the labor
strikes that broke out in the closing years of the nineteenth
century and the opening years of the twentieth. What seemed so
dangerous about events such as the 1894 Pullman strike was not
just the disruption of he mails, which was the legal basis on
which the government relied to break the strike, but the fact
that the mails were being violently disrupted by organized
groups. &quot;We have been brought to the ragged edge of
anarchy,&quot; Attorney General Richard Olney frantically
explained when he ordered that the trains be kept running.
Eventually, Eugene Debs and his colleagues in the American
Railway Union, which took the lead in the strike, were indicted
and convicted. Once again, it was the volatile mixture of
violence and organization-combinations determined difficult to
suppress-that evoked the full power of the federal government.[5]
</p>

<p>The passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, the first
federal effort to control private ownership of firearms, grew out
of this historic fear of armed organizations. The various
collections of gangsters that proliferated during Prohibition
were the true targets of the law, which required a tax and
registration on the sale of their weapons of choice-machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns. Subsequent federal firearms laws have
been of a piece. Oher than the 1968 ban on mail-order sales,
which was in direct, though delayed, response to the
assassination of President Kennedy, federal gun laws have
typically been concerned with the weapons of considerable
destructive power generally preferred by organized groups-bombs,
machine guns, and automatic weapons. </p>

<p>In recent times, the federal government has shown itself even
less patient with armed groups than it had historically. Radical
extremists of both the Right and the Left have been pursued
aggressively once they began breaking the law. For instance,
after the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) launched its
self-styled &quot;people's war&quot; by kidnapping newspaper
heiress Patty Hearst and committing a number of daring bank
robberies, the federal government dedicated its full resources to
tracking the group down. Within approximately three months, FBI
agents and Los Angeles police closed in on the group at a house
just outside what was then known as Watts. During an intense gun
battle and fire, every member of the SLA in the house was
killed.[6] </p>

<p>Gordon Kahl, who stood at the opposite end of the political
spectrum from the SLA, met a similar end. Kahl belonged to the
Posse Comitatus which refused to recognize the authority of any
government above the county level. Accordingly, Kahl consistently
refused to pay his federal taxes, even after he served time in
prison for not doing so. When U.S. Marshals attempted to arrest
him for violating the terms of his probation, Kahl killed two of
them. For the next five months, Kahl hid among his friends and
sympathizers until FBI agents located him in a farmhouse just
outside Smithville, Arkansas. After refusing to surrender, Kahl
was killed, and the farmhouse was burned down.[7] </p>

<p>Robert Matthews, the head of a group of right-wing fanatics
known as the Order, embraced many of Kahl's beliefs. Unlike Kahl,
whose resistance was essentially passive until the marshals tried
to arrest him, Matthews and the Order launched an aggressive
private war against the country. Like the SLA, the Order
committed a series of bank and armored car robberies, netting
$3.6 million in one heist alone. The Order also assassinated Alan
Berg, a radio talk show host in Denver, Colorado. </p>

<p>The FBI began an equally aggressive pursuit. After a brief,
violent skirmish in Idaho and another in Portland, Oregon, FBI
agents finally closed in on Matthews hiding out among three
adjoining houses on Whidbey Island, some fifty miles north of
Seattle. After ngotiating his surrender for two days, Matthews
began firing on an FBI Hostage Response Team that attempted to
enter the house. Protected by a full suit( of body armor,
Matthews ran from the first floor to the second floor firing
automatic weapons. The FBI dropped a magnesium flare from a
helicopter. The flare landed on the roof of the house and burned
through it to the room where Matthews had stored his ammunition
and explosives. These ignited, setting off a roaring, exploding
fire that consumed Matthews.[8] </p>

<p>A year later, in the spring of 1985. ATF collected
considerable evidence that an 80-member group styling itself the
Covenant of the Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) had
stockpiled a large arsenal at its fortified compound in Arkansas.
The group had collected over 150 firearms, (including 35 machine
guns), two anti-personnel mines, three anti-aircraft rockets, 50
pounds of military plastic explosives, 300 blasting caps, 2,000
feet of detonating cord, and around 100 explosive devices. CSA
had also stockpiled food, water, and supplies. TF led the assault
on the CSA compound on April 20, 1985. CSA members retreated
farther into the compound, barricading themselves behind their
defenses. The agents set up a siege perimeter and settled in to
wait. The group used the wait to destroy many of the weapons (and
hence evidence) illegally obtained. Negotiators from the FBI
arrived and began the tedious, frustrating process of talking the
group out. Three days later, on April 22, 1985, James D. Ellison
and the 75 members of the CSA surrendered.[9] </p>

<p>As both history and recent events clearly show, the United
States has never tolerated armed groups residing within its
borders. The intent of the particular organization, whether
ideological or criminal, mattered little. If the group was
building an illegal arsenal, the group was subject to a federal
enforcement action. To this day, ATF's enforcement focus retains
the flavor of that historic concern with armed organizations. The
agency has developed considerable expertise and success in
investigating the activities of motorcycle, street, and drug
gangs, all of which share in common a proclivity to amass large
arsenals of powerful weapons. The raid on the Branch Davidian
compound occurred in the context of that historical background. </p>

<p>---------------------- </p>

<p>C O N T E N T S </p>

<p>---------------------- </p>

<p>Part1: What's all this fuss about hemp? </p>

<p>1c) Where did the word `marijuana' come from? </p>

<p>2a) How can hemp be used as a food? </p>

<p>2b) What are the benefits of hemp compared to other food
crops? </p>

<p>2c) How about soy? </p>

<p>1) How and why was hemp made illegal? </p>

<p>2) OK, so what the heck does all this other stuff have to do
with hemp? </p>

<p>3) Now wait, just hold on. You expect me to believe that they
wouldn't have thought to pass a better law, one that banned
marijuana and allowed commercial hemp, instead of throwing the
baby out with the bath water? </p>

<p>4) Is there a lesson to be learned from all this? </p>

<p>Part 3: Does it? Doesn't it? Is it true that? </p>

<p>1) Doesn't marijuana stay in your fat cells and keep you </p>

<p>high for months? </p>

<p>2) But ... isn't today's marijuana much more potent than it </p>

<p>was in the Sixties? </p>

<p>(Or, more often ... Marijuana is 10 times more powerful than </p>

<p>it was in the Sixties!) </p>

<p>3a) Doesn't Marijuana cause brain damage? </p>

<p>3b) If it doesn't kill brain cells, how does it get you
`high'? </p>

<p>7) Is it true that marijuana makes you lazy and unmotivated? </p>

<p>8) Isn't marijuana a gateway drug? </p>

<p>Doesn't it lead to use of harder drugs? </p>

<p>9a) I don't want children (minors) to be able to smoke
marijuana. </p>

<p>How can I stop this? </p>

<p>9b) Won't children be able to steal marijuana plants that </p>

<p>people are growing? </p>

<p>10a) Hey, don't you know that marijuana drops testosterone </p>

<p>levels in teenage boys causing [various physical and </p>

<p>developmental problems]? </p>

<p>10b) Doesn't heavy marijuana use lower the sperm count in
males? </p>

<p>10c) I heard marijuana use by teenage girls may impair hormone
</p>

<p>production, menstrual cycles, and fertility. Is this true? </p>

<p>11) Go away. </p>

<p>12) Isn't smoking marijuana worse for you than smoking
cigarettes? </p>

<p>13) Don't children born to pot-smoking mothers suffer from </p>

<p>``Fetal Marijuana Syndrome?'' </p>

<p>14) Doesn't marijuana cause a lot of automobile accidents? </p>

<p>15) Aren't you afraid everyone will get hooked? </p>

<p>16a) Is urine testing for marijuana use as a terms of </p>

<p>employment a good idea? </p>

<p>I want to make sure my business is run safely. </p>

<p>16b) Isn't all this worth the trouble, though, in order to </p>

<p>reduce accident risks and health care costs? </p>

<p>17) Wouldn't it be best to just lock the users all up? </p>

<p>18) I heard that there are over 400 chemicals in marijuana... </p>

<p>Wellllll...? </p>

<p>19) Doesn't that stuff mess up your immune system and make </p>

<p>it easier for you catch colds? </p>

<p>Part 4: Why is it still illegal? </p>

<p>1) Why is it STILL illegal?: </p>

<p>2) What can I do to bring some sense into our marijuana laws? </p>

<p>3a) Where can I get more information? </p>

<p>3b) Umm, I'm computer illiterate, so that just went way over </p>

<p>my head. Are there any good books I could go get instead? </p>

<p>4) Do you have any advice for people who want to organize </p>

<p>their own group? </p>

<p>Part 5: Sources by question number </p>

<p>Part 6: About the alt.hemp FAQ. </p>

<p>---------------------- </p>

<p>P A R T O N E </p>

<p>---------------------- </p>

<p>WHAT'S ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT HEMP? </p>

<p>1a) What is hemp? </p>

<p>For our purposes, hemp is the plant called `cannabis sativa.'
There are other plants that are called hemp, but cannabis hemp is
the most useful of these plants. In fact, `cannabis sativa' means
`useful (sativa) hemp (cannabis)'. </p>

<p>`Hemp' is any durable plant that has been used since
pre-history for many purposes. Fiber is the most well known
product, and the word `hemp' can mean the rope or twine which is
made from the hemp plant, as well as just the stalk of the plant
which produced it. </p>

<p>1b) What is cannabis? </p>

<p>Cannabis is the most durable of the hemp plants, and it
produces the toughest cloth, called `canvass.' (Canvass was
widely used as sails in the early shipping industry, as it was
the only cloth which would not rot on contact with sea spray.)
The cannabis plant also produces three other very important
products which the other hemp plants do not (in usable form, that
is): seed, pulp, and medicine. </p>

<p>The pulp is used as fuel, and to make paper. The seed is
suitable for both human and animal foods. The oil from the seed
can be used in as a base for paints and varnishes. The medicine
is a tincture or admixture of the sticky resin in the blossoms
and leaves of the hemp plant, and is used for a variety of
purposes. </p>

<p>1c) Where did the word `marijuana' come from? </p>

<p>The word `marijuana' is a Mexican slang term which became
popular in the late 1930's in America, during a series of media
and government programs which we now refer to as the `Reefer
Madness Movement.' It refers specifically to the medicine part of
cannabis, which Mexican soldiers used to smoke. </p>

<p>Today in the U.S., hemp (meaning the roots, stalk, and stems
of the cannabis plant) is legal to possess. No one can arrest you
for wearing a hemp shirt, or using hemp paper. </p>

<p>Marijuana (The flowers, buds, or leaves of the cannabis plant)
is not legal to possess, and there are stiff fines and possible
jail terms for having any marijuana in your possession. The seeds
are legal to possess and eat, but only if they are sterilized
(will not grow to maturity.) </p>

<p>Since it is not possible to grow the hemp plant without being
in possession of marijuana, the United States does not produce
any industrial hemp products, and must import them or, more
often, substitute others. (There is a way to grow hemp legally,
but it involves filing an application with the Drug Enforcement
Administration and the DEA very rarely ever gives its
permission.) This does not seem to have stopped people from
producing and using marijuana, though. In many of the United
States, marijuana is the number one cash crop, mostly because it
fetches a very high price on the black market. </p>

<p>2a) How can hemp be used as a food? </p>

<p>Hemp seed is a highly nutritious source of protein and
essential fatty oils. Many populations have grown hemp for its
seed -- most of them eat it as `gruel' which is a lot like
oatmeal. The leaves can be used as roughage, but not without
slight psycho-active side-effects. Hemp seeds do not contain any
marijuana and they do not get you `high.' </p>

<p>Hemp seed protein closely resembles protein as it is found in
the human blood. It is fantastically easy to digest, and many
patients who have trouble digesting food are given hemp seed by
their doctors. Hemp seed was once called `edestine' and was used
by scientists as the model for vegetable protein. </p>

<p>Hemp seed oil provides the human body with essential fatty
acids. Hemp seed is the only seed which contains these oils with
almost no saturated fat. As a supplement to the diet, these oils
can reduce the risk of heart disease. It is because of these oils
that birds will live much longer if they eat hemp seed. </p>

<p>With hemp seed, a vegan or vegetarian can survive and eat
virtually no saturated fats. One handful of hemp seed per day
will supply adequate protein and essential oils for an adult. </p>

<p>2b) What are the benefits of hemp compared to other food
crops? </p>

<p>Hemp requires little fertilizer, and grows well almost
everywhere. It also resists pests, so it uses little pesticides.
Hemp puts down deep roots, which is good for the soil, and when
the leaves drop off the hemp plant, minerals and nitrogen are
returned to the soil. Hemp has been grown on the same soil for
twenty years in a row without any noticeable depletion of the
soil. </p>

<p>Using less fertilizer and agricultural chemicals is good for
two reasons. First, it costs less and requires less effort. </p>

<p>Second, many agricultural chemicals are dangerous and
contaminate the environment -- the less we have to use, the
better. </p>

<p>2c) How about soy? </p>

<p>Is hemp competitive as a world source of protein? </p>

<p>Hemp does not produce quite as much protein as soy, but hemp
seed protein is of a higher quality than soy. Agricultural
considerations may make hemp the food crop of the future. In
addition to the fact that hemp is an easy crop to grow, it also
resists UV-B light, which is a kind of sunlight blocked by the
ozone layer. Soy beans do not take UV-B light very well. If the
ozone layer were to deplete by 16%, which by some estimates is
very possible, soy production would fall by 25-30%. </p>

<p>We may have to grow hemp or starve -- and it won't be the
first time that this has happened. Hemp has been used to `bail
out' many populations in time of famine. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, because of various political factors, starving
people in today's underdeveloped countries are not taking
advantage of this crop. In some places, this is because
government officials would call it `marijuana' and pull up the
crop. In other countries, it is because the farmers are busy
growing coca and poppies to produce cocaine and heroin for the
local Drug Lord. This is truly a sad state of affairs. Hopefully
someday the Peace Corps will be able to teach modern hemp seed
farming techniques and end the world's protein shortage. </p>

<p>3a) How can hemp be used for cloth? </p>

<p>The stalk of the hemp plant has two parts, called the bast and
the hurd. The fiber (bast) of the hemp plant can be woven into
almost any kind of cloth. It is very durable. </p>

<p>In fact, the first Levi's blue jeans were made out of hemp for
just this reason. Compared to all the other natural fibers
available, hemp is more suitable for a large number of
applications. </p>

<p>Here is how hemp is harvested for fiber: A field of closely
spaced hemp is allowed to grow until the leaves fall off. The
hemp is then cut down and it lies in the field for some time
washed by the rain. It is turned over once to expose both sides
of the stalk evenly. During this time, the hurd softens up and
many minerals are returned to the soil. This is called `retting,'
and after this step is complete, the stalks are brought to a
machine which separates the bast and the hurd. We are lucky to
have machines today -- men used to do this last part by hand with
hours of back-breaking labor. </p>

<p>3b) Why is it better than cotton? </p>

<p>The cloth that hemp makes may be a little less soft than
cotton, (though there are also special kinds of hemp, or ways to
grow or treat hemp, that can produce a soft cloth) but it is much
stronger and longer lasting. (It does not stretch out.)
Environmentally, hemp is a better crop to grow than cotton,
especially the way cotton is grown nowadays. In the United
States, the cotton crop uses half of the total pesticides. (Yes,
you heard right, one half of the pesticides used in the entire
U.S. are used on cotton.) </p>

<p>Cotton is a soil damaging crop and needs a lot of fertilizer. </p>

<p>4a) How can hemp be used to make paper? </p>

<p>Both the fiber (bast) and pulp (hurd) of the hemp plant can be
used to make paper. Fiber paper was the first kind of paper, and
the first batch was made out of hemp in ancient China. Fiber
paper is thin, tough, brittle, and a bit rough. Pulp paper is not
as strong as fiber paper, but it is easier to make, softer,
thicker, and preferable for most everyday purposes. The paper we
use most today is a `chemical pulp' paper made from trees. Hemp
pulp paper can be made without chemicals from the hemp hurd. Most
hemp paper made today uses the entire hemp stalk, bast and hurd.
High-strength fiber paper can be made from the hemp baste, also
without chemicals. </p>

<p>The problem with today's paper is that so many chemicals are
used to make it. High strength acids are needed to make quality
(smooth, strong, and white) paper out of trees. These acids
produce chemicals which are very dangerous to the environment.
Paper companies do their best to clean these chemicals up (we
hope.) Hemp offers us an opportunity to make affordable and
environmentally safe paper for all of our needs, since it does
not need much chemical treatment. </p>

<p>It is up to consumers, though, to make the right choice --
these dangerous chemicals can also be used on hemp to make a
slightly more attractive product. Instead of buying the whiter,
brighter role of toilet paper, we will need to think about what
we are doing to the planet. </p>

<p>Because of the chemicals in today's paper, it will turn yellow
and fall apart as acids eat away at the pulp. This takes several
decades, but because of this publishers, libraries and archives
have to order specially processed acid free paper, which is much
more expensive, in order to keep records. Paper made naturally
from hemp is acid free and will last for centuries. </p>

<p>4b) Why can't we just keep using trees? </p>

<p>The chemicals used to make wood chemical pulp paper today
could cause us a lot of trouble tomorrow. Environmentalists have
long been concerned about the effects of dioxin and other
compounds on wildlife and even people. Beyond the chemical
pollution, there are agricultural reasons why we should use
cannabis hemp instead. When trees are harvested, minerals are
taken with them. Hemp is much less damaging to the land where it
is grown because it leaves these minerals behind. </p>

<p>A simpler answer to the above question is: Because we are
running out! It was once said that a squirrel could climb from
New England to the banks of the Mississippi River without
touching the ground once. The European settler's appetite for
firewood and farmland put an end to this. When the first wood
paper became a huge industry, the United States Department of
Agriculture began to worry about the `tree supply.' That is why
they went in search of plant pulp to replace wood. Today some
`conservatives' argue that there are more forests now than there
ever were. This is neither true, realistic nor conservative:
these statistics do not reflect the real world. Once trees have
been removed from a plot of land, it takes many decades before
biological diversity and natural cycles return to the forest, and
commercial tree farms simply do not count as forest -- they are
farm land. As just mentioned, many plant fibers were investigated
by the USDA -- some, like kenaf, were even better suited than
cannabis hemp for making some qualities of paper, but hemp had
one huge advantage: robust vitality. Hemp generates immense
amounts of plant matter in a three month growing season. When it
came down to producing the deluge of paper used by Americans,
only hemp could compete with trees. In fact, according to the
1916 calculations of the USDA, one acre of hemp would replace an
entire four acres of forest. And, at the same time, this acre
would be producing textiles and rope. </p>

<p>Today, only 4% of America's old-growth forest remains standing
-- and there is talk about building roads into that for logging
purposes! Will our policy makers realize in time how easy it
would be to save them? </p>

<p>5a) How can hemp be used as a fuel? </p>

<p>The pulp (hurd) of the hemp plant can be burned as is or
processed into charcoal, methanol, methane, or gasoline. The
process for doing this is called destructive distillation, or
`pyrolysis.' Fuels made out of plants like this are called
`biomass' fuels. This charcoal may be burned in today's
coal-powered electric generators. </p>

<p>Methanol makes a good automobile fuel, in fact it is used in
professional automobile races. It may someday replace gasoline. </p>

<p>Hemp may also be used to produce ethanol (grain alcohol.) The
United States government has developed a way to make this
automobile fuel additive from cellulosic biomass. Hemp is an
excellent source of high quality cellulosic biomass. </p>

<p>One other way to use hemp as fuel is to use the oil from the
hemp seed -- some diesel engines can run on pure pressed hemp
seed oil. However, the oil is more useful for other purposes,
even if we could produce and press enough hemp seed to power many
millions of cars. </p>

<p>5b) Why is it better than petroleum? </p>

<p>Biomass fuels are clean and virtually free from metals and
sulfur, so they do not cause nearly as much air pollution as
fossil fuels. Even more importantly, burning biomass fuels does
not increase the total amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's
atmosphere. When petroleum products are burned, carbon that has
been stored underground for millions of years is added to the
air; this may contribute to global warming through the
`Greenhouse Effect', (a popular theory which says that certain
gases will act like a wool blanket over the entire Earth,
preventing heat from escaping into space.) In order to make
biomass fuels, this carbon dioxide has to be taken out of the air
to begin with -- when they are burned it is just being put back
where it started. </p>

<p>Another advantage over fossil fuels is that biomass fuels can
be made right here in the United States, instead of buying them
from other countries. Instead of paying oil drillers,
super-tanker captains, and soldiers to get our fuel to us, we
could pay local farmers and delivery drivers instead. Of course,
it is possible to chop down trees and use them as biomass. This
would not be as beneficial to the environment as using hemp,
especially since trees that are cut down for burning are `whole
tree harvested.' This means the entire tree is ripped up and
burned, not just the wood. </p>

<p>Since most of the minerals which trees use are in the leaves,
this practice could ruin the soil where the trees are grown. In
several places in the United States, power companies are starting
to do this -- burning the trees in order to produce electricity,
because that is cheaper than using coal. They should be using
hemp, like researchers in Australia started doing a few years
ago. (Besides, hemp provides a higher quality and quantity of
biomass than trees do.) </p>

<p>6a) How can hemp be used as a medicine? </p>

<p>Marijuana has thousands of possible uses in medicine.
Marijuana (actually cannabis extract) was available as a medicine
legally in this country until 1937, and was sold as a nerve tonic
-- but mankind has been using cannabis medicines much longer than
that. Marijuana appears in almost every known book of medicine
written by ancient scholars and wise men. It is usually ranked
among the top medicines, called `panaceas', a word which means
`cure-all'. </p>

<p>The list of diseases which cannabis can be used for includes:
multiple sclerosis, cancer treatment, AIDS (and AIDS treatment),
glaucoma, depression, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma,
pruritis, sclerodoma, severe pain, and dystonia. This list does
not even consider the other medicines which can be made out of
marijuana -- these are just some of the illnesses for which
people smoke or eat whole marijuana today. </p>

<p>There are over 60 chemicals in marijuana which may have
medical uses. It is relatively easy to extract these into food or
beverage, or into some sort of lotion, using butter, fat, oil, or
alcohol. One chemical, cannabinol, may be useful to help people
who cannot sleep. Another is taken from premature buds and is
called cannabidiolic acid. It is a powerful disinfectant.
Marijuana dissolved in rubbing alcohol helps people with the skin
disease herpes control their sores, and a salve like this was one
of the earliest medical uses for cannabis. The leaves were once
used in bandages and a relaxing non-psychoactive herbal tea can
be made from small cannabis stems. </p>

<p>The most well known use of marijuana today is to control
nausea and vomiting. One of the most important things when
treating cancer with chemotherapy or when treating AIDS with AZT
or Foscavir, being able to eat well, makes the difference between
life or death. Patients have found marijuana to be extremely
effective in fighting nausea; in fact so many patients use it for
this purpose even though it is illegal that they have formed
`buyers clubs' to help them find a steady supply. In California,
some city governments have decided to look the other way and
allow these clubs to operate openly. </p>

<p>Marijuana is also useful for fighting two other very serious
and wide-spread disabilities. Glaucoma is the second leading
cause of blindness, caused by uncontrollable eye pressure.
Marijuana can control the eye pressure and keep glaucoma from
causing blindness. Multiple Sclerosis is a disease where the
body's immune system attacks nerve cells. </p>

<p>Spasms and many other problems result from this. Marijuana not
only helps stop these spasms, but it may also keep multiple
sclerosis from getting worse. </p>

<p>6b) What's wrong with all the prescription drugs we have? </p>

<p>They cost money and are hard to make. In many cases, they do
not work as well, either. Some prescription drugs which marijuana
can replace have very bad, even downright dangerous,
side-effects. Cannabis medicines are cheap, safe, and easy to
make. </p>

<p>Many people think that the drug dronabinol should be used
instead of marijuana. Dronabinol is an exact imitation of one of
the chemicals found in marijuana, and it may actually work on a
lot of the above diseases, but there are some big problems with
dronabinol, and most patients who have used both dronabinol and
marijuana say that marijuana works better. </p>

<p>The first problem with Dronabinol is that it is even harder to
get than marijuana. Many doctors do not like to prescribe
dronabinol, and many drug stores do not want to supply it,
because a lot of paperwork has to be filed with the Drug
Enforcement Administration. Secondly, dronabinol comes in pills
which are virtually useless to anyone who is throwing up, and it
is hard to take just the right amount of dronabinol since it
cannot be smoked. Finally, because dronabinol is only one of the
many chemicals in cannabis, it just does not work for some
diseases. Many patients do not like the effects of dronabinol
because it does not contain some of the more calming chemicals
which are present in marijuana. </p>

<p>7) What other uses for hemp are there? </p>

<p>One of the newest uses of hemp is in construction materials.
Hemp can be used in the manufacture of `press board' or
`composite board.' This involves gluing fibrous hemp stalks
together under pressure to produce a board which is many times
more elastic and durable than hardwood. Because hemp produces a
long, tough fiber it is the perfect source for press-board.
Another interesting application of hemp in industry is making
plastic. Many plastics can be made from the high-cellulose hemp
hurd. Hemp seed oil has a multitude of uses in products such as
varnishes and lubricants. </p>

<p>Using hemp to build is by no means a new idea. French
archeologists have discovered bridges built with a process that
mineralizes hemp stalks into a long-lasting cement. </p>

<p>The process involves no synthetic chemicals and produces a
material which works as a filler in building construction. Called
Isochanvre, it is gaining popularity in France. Isochanvre can be
used as drywall, insulates against heat and noise, and is very
long lasting. `Bio-plastics' are not a new idea, either -- way
back in the 1930's Henry Ford had already made a whole car body
out of them -- but the processes for making them do need more
research and development. Bio-plastics can be made without much
pollution. Unfortunately, companies are not likely to explore
bio-plastics if they have to either import the raw materials or
break the law. (Not to mention compete with the already
established petrochemical products.) </p>

<p>----------------------- </p>

<p>P A R T T W O </p>

<p>----------------------- </p>

<p>WELL WHY AREN'T WE USING HEMP, THEN? </p>

<p>1) How and why was hemp made illegal? </p>

<p>Tough question! In order to explain why hemp, the most useful
plant known to mankind, became illegal, we have to understand the
reasons why marijuana, the drug, became illegal. In fact, it
helps to go way back to the beginning of the century and talk
about two other drugs, opium (the grandfather of heroin) and
cocaine. </p>

<p>Opium, a very addictive drug (but relatively harmless by
today's standards) was once widely used by the Chinese. The
reasons for this are a whole other story, but suffice to say that
when Chinese started to immigrate to the United States, they
brought opium with them. Chinese workers used opium to induce a
trance-like state which helped make boring, repetitive tasks more
interesting. It also numbs the mind to pain and exhaustion. By
using opium, the Chinese were able to pull very long hours in the
sweat shops of the Industrial Revolution. During this period of
time, there was no such thing as fair wages, and the only way a
worker could make a living was to produce as much as humanly
possible. </p>

<p>Since they were such good workers, the Chinese held a lot of
jobs in the highly competitive industrial work-place. Even before
the Great Depression, when millions of jobs disappeared
overnight, the White Americans began to resent this, and Chinese
became hated among the White working class. Even more than today,
White Americans had a very big political advantage over the
Chinese -- they spoke English and had a few relatives in the
government, so it was easy for them to come up with a plan to
force Chinese immigrants to leave the country (or at least keep
them from inviting all their relatives to come and live in
America.) This plan depended on stirring up racist feelings, and
one of the easiest things to focus these feelings on was the
foreign and mysterious practice of using opium. </p>

<p>We can see this pattern again with cocaine, except with
cocaine it was Black Americans who were the target. Cocaine
probably was not especially useful in the work-place, but the
strategy against Chinese immigrants (picking on their drug of
choice) had been so successful that it was used again. In the
case of Blacks, though, the racist feelings ran deeper, and the
main thrust of the propaganda campaign was to control the Black
community and keep Blacks from becoming successful. Articles
appeared in newspapers which blamed cocaine for violent crime by
Blacks. Black Americans were painted as savage, uncontrollable
beasts when under the influence of cocaine -- it was said to make
a single Black man as strong as four or five police officers. <br>

<h1>Cannabis 1988 Old Drug, New Dangers, The Potency Debate </h1>

<p><b>Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, Vol 20(1), Jan-Mar, 1988 pg
47. Mikuriya, Tod H. and Aldrich, Michael.,</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Summary and Conclusions:</b> </p>

<p>Observation of the real world of social and marijuana use,
where autotitration is the norm, renders the scare tactics of the
<u>new marijuana</u> proponents not only inaccurate but
irrelevant (*). There is much published evidence about the
availability of highly potent varieties of cannabis from the
nineteenth century through the present day. The effects
attributed to the <u>new marijuana</u> are the same ones debated
for centuries in many different cultures. The assertion that
&quot;all marijuana research to date has been done on 1 or 2
percent THC material&quot; (Cohen 1968) ignores several thousand
years of human experience with the drug. The old medical cannabis
extracts were stronger than most of the forms now available,
though the potency of illicit hash oils by the mid-1970's was
approaching the level of medicinal preparations available before
their removal from the USP. </p>

<p>While it may be true that sinsemilla is more widely available
than 10 or 15 years ago, its potency has not changed
significantly from the 2.4 to 9.5 percent THC materials available
in 1973-1974 (see Table I), or the five to 14 percent sinsemilla
of 1975 (Perry 1977). The range of potencies available then
(marijuana at 0.1% to 7.8% THC, averaging 2.0% to 5.0% THC by
1975) was approximately the same as that reported now. With such
a range, the evidence simply cannot support the argument by Cohen
(1986) that marijuana is &quot;ten or more times more potent than
the product smoked ten years ago.&quot; And to say that marijuana
potency has increased 1,400 percent since <u>any</u> date in
history is patent nonsense. </p>

<p>It is not legitimate to imply that <u>average</u> low
potencies represent the <u>full range</u> of potencies available
in reality. </p>

<p>Neither is it valid to cite the <u>low end of the range then</u>
as a baseline to compare with the <u>high end of the range now.</u>
</p>

<p>The claimed baseline for THC content in the early 1970's would
appear to be too low, probably because confiscated, stored police
samples were utilized; and this low baseline makes the claimed
difference in potency appear to be greater than it has been in
reality. </p>

<p>In sum, the new marijuana is not new and neither is the
hyperbole surrounding this issue. The implications of the new
disinformation campaign are serious. Many people, particularly
the experienced users of the 1960's and their children, will once
again shrug off the warnings of drug experts and not heed more
reasonable admonishments about more dangerous drugs. This is not
only abusive to those who look to science, the medical
profession, and government for intelligent leadership, but will
sully the reputations of drug educators who wittingly cry wolf,
and will inevitably diminish the credibility of drug abuse
treatment professionals who pass on such flawed reports. </p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MARIJUANA USE </h2>

<h1>What is DEP? </h1>

<p>The Drug Education Project (DEP) is an attempt to clear up the
misinformation being propagated in the U.S. by organizations and
individuals more interested in creating works of propaganda and
fear than objective pieces of education. DEP is founded upon the
same two basic principles Andrew Weil bases his book, From
Chocolate to Morphine, upon: (1) &quot;People make decisions on
the basis of information available to them. The more accurate the
information, the better their decisions will be&quot; [68, p.
179]; and (2) &quot;There are no good or bad drugs; there are
only good and bad relationships with drugs&quot; [68, p. 27].
This leaflet is the first in a series of sixteen that will
attempt to summarize for everyone what science has to say about
drug use. The grunt work has been done for you. DEP only requests
of you an open mind and the time required to read these leaflets.

<h3>Health Risk Myths and Realities </h3>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
Overdose </h4>

<p>No evidence exists that anyone has ever died of a marijuana
overdose [61, p. 53 - 54]. Tests performed on mice have shown
that the ratio of cannabinoids (the chemicals in marijuana that
make you stoned) necessary for overdose to the amount necessary
for intoxication is 40,000:1 [1]. For comparison's sake, that
ratio for alcohol is generally between 4:1 and 10:1 [61, p.
227-228]. Alcohol overdoses kill about 5,000 yearly [3] but
marijuana overdoses kill no one as far as anyone can tell. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Brain
Damage </h4>

<p>Marijuana is psychoactive because it stimulates certain brain
receptors, but it does not produce toxins that kill them [7]
(like alcohol), and it does not wear them out as other drugs may
[57]. There is no evidence that marijuana use is a cause of brain
damage. Studies by Dr. Robert Heath claimed the contrary in
experiments on monkeys [4], but Heath's work has been sharply
criticized by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy
of Sciences on three primary counts: </p>

<ol>
    <li>its insufficient sample size (only four monkeys), </li>
    <li>its failure to control experimental bias, and </li>
    <li>its misidentification of normal monkey brain structure as
        &quot;damaged&quot; [5]. </li>
</ol>

<p>A far superior experiment by the National Center for
Toxicological Research (NCTR) involving 64 rhesus monkeys that
were exposed to daily or weekly doses of marijuana smoke for a
year found no evidence of structural or neurochemical changes in
the brains of rhesus monkeys [6, 58]. Studies performed on actual
human populations will confirm these results, even for chronic
marijuana users (up to 18 joints per day) after many years of use
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In fact, following the publication of two
1977 JAMA studies, the American Medical Association (AMA)
officially announced its support for the decriminalization of
marijuana. </p>

<p>Contrary to a 1987 television commercial sponsored by the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America (PDFA), marijuana does not
&quot;flatten&quot; brain waves either. In the commercial, a
normal human brain wave was compared to what was supposedly the
(much flatter) brain wave of a 14-year-old high on marijuana. It
was actually the brain wave of a coma patient [2]. PDFA lied
about the data, and had to pull the commercial off of the air
when researchers complained to the television networks [62, p.
74]. </p>

<p>In reality, marijuana has the effect of slightly increasing
alpha-wave activity. Alpha waves are generally associated with
meditative and relaxed states which are, in turn, often
associated with human creativity [13]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Memory
</h4>

<p>Marijuana does impair short-term memory, but only during
intoxication. Although the authoritative studies on marijuana use
seem to agree that there is no residual impairment following
intoxication [5, 6, 13], persistent impairment of short-term
memory has been noted in chronic marijuana smokers up to 6 and 12
weeks following abstinence [70]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Heart
Problems </h4>

<p>It is accepted in medical circles today that marijuana use
causes no evident long-term cardiovascular problems for normal
persons. However, marijuana-smoking does cause changes in the
heart and body's circulation characteristic of stress, which may
complicate preexisting cardiovascular problems like hypertension,
cerebrovascular disease, and coronary atherosclerosis [5, p. 72].
Marijuana's effects upon blood pressure are complex and
inconsistent [5, p. 66 - 67]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Hormones
</h4>

<p>Chronic marijuana use has not been found to alter testosterone
or other sex hormone levels, despite the conclusions of Dr. R.C.
Kolodony's 1974 study. Seven similar studies have been performed
since then, the most recent by a Dr. Robert Block at the
University of Iowa [14], and none have reproduced Kolodony's
results. In contrast, heavy alcohol use is known to lower these
same testosterone levels [65]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Reproductive
Damage </h4>

<p>No trustworthy study has ever shown that marijuana use damages
the reproductive system, or causes chromosome breakage. Dr.
Gabriel Nahas reached the opposite conclusion in his experiments
performed in the early 1980s, but did so in part using the in
vitro (i.e., in test tubes and petrii dishes) cells of rhesus
monkeys. His rather unjustified claim that these changes would
also occur in human bodies in vivo (in the body) was criticized
by his colleagues and, in 1983, he renounced his own results. </p>

<p>Studies of actual human populations have failed to demonstrate
that marijuana adversely affects the reproductive system [61, 5].
Wu et al. found in 1988 a correlation between marijuana use and
low sperm counts in human males. But this is misleading because
(1) a decrease in sperm count has not been shown to have a
negative effect on fertility, and (2) the sperm count returned to
normal levels after marijuana use had ceased [5]. </p>

<p>Claims that marijuana use may impair hormone production,
menstrual cycles, or fertility in females are both unproven and
unfounded [43]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">The
Immune System </h4>

<p>Studies in which lab rats were injected with extremely large
quantities of THC have found that marijuana (in such
unrealistically huge quantities) does have an
&quot;immunosuppressive effect&quot; in those lab rats, in that
it temporarily shuts off certain cells in the liver called
lymphocytes and macrophages. These macrophages are useful in
fighting off bacterial, not viral, infections. But this is only
for the duration of intoxication [46]. There also exists some
evidence that marijuana metabolites stay in the lungs for up to
seven months after smoking has ceased, possibly affecting the
immune system of the lungs (but not by turning the cells off)
[47]. This said, doctors and researchers are still not sure that
the immune system is actually negatively affected in realistic
situations since there are no numbers to support the idea [15].
In fact, three studies showed that THC may have actually
stimulated the immune system in the people studied [16, 17, 18]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Birth
Defects </h4>

<p>Unlike alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco, studies show that there
exists no evident link between prenatal use of marijuana and
birth defects [5, p. 99] or fetal alcohol syndrome [72] in
humans. In fact, marijuana use during the third trimester has
been found to have a positive impact on birthweight [73]. It is
known that Delta-9-THC does enter the placenta [45], so mothers
are advised against consuming large quantities. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Cancer
</h4>

<p>Smoking marijuana has the potential to cause both bronchitis
and cancer of the lungs, throat, and neck, but this is generally
no different than inhaling any other burnt carbon-containing
matter since they all increase the number of lesions (and
therefore possible infections) in your airways. There are a
couple of studies that claim on the basis of carcinogens that
smoking marijuana is worse for your body than smoking a cigarette
[44], but these are rather simplified. There are actually some
very convincing reasons to believe that smoking cigarettes is
relatively more dangerous to the body than smoking marijuana on
more than one count: (1) It is accepted by a growing number of
scientists today that all American cigarettes contain significant
levels of polonium-210 [22], the same sort of radiation given off
by the plutonium of atom bombs (ionizing alpha radiation). It
just so happens that the tobacco plant's roots and leaves are
especially good at absorbing radioactive elements from
uranium-containing phosphate fertilizers that are required by
U.S. law, and from naturally occurring radiation in the soil,
air, and water [48]. It is the opinion of C. Everette Koop that
this radioactivity, not tar, accounts for at least 90% of all
smoking-related lung cancer [29]. Other estimates that have been
made are, about 50% according to Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza of the
Univ. of Mass. Medical Center [48] and according to Dr. Edward
Martell, a radiochemist with the National Center for Atmospheric
Research, 95% [35]. Dr. R.T. Ravenholt, former director of World
Health Surveys at the Centers for Disease Control, agrees with
the risk, asserting that &quot;Americans are exposed to far more
radiation from tobacco smoke than from any other source&quot;
[49]. Supporting the radioactivity notion is the finding that (a)
Relatively high levels of polonium-210 have been found in both
cigarette smoke [59] and the lungs of both smokers and nonsmokers
alike [60]; (b) Smokers of low-tar-and-nicotine cigarettes die of
lung cancer just as much as smokers of other cigarettes [39]; and
also, (c) Even the most potent carcinogen that has been found in
cigarettes, benzopyrene, is only present in quantities sufficient
to account for about 1% of the lung cancer cases that occur from
smoking[49]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Why
don't you know any of this? </h4>

<p>Because the tobacco industry is suppressing the information.
(2) Tobacco smoke is theorized to work as a kind of
&quot;magnet&quot; for airborne radioactive particles such as
radon, causing them to deposit in your lungs instead of on walls,
rugs, or draperies [48]. (3) Tobacco, unlike marijuana, contains
nicotine, which may harden arteries and cause many of the cases
of heart disease associated with tobacco use. It also breaks down
into cancer-promoting chemicals called N Nitrosamines when
burned, and perhaps even when it is inside the body [37]. (4) THC
is a bronchial dilator, which means it works like a cough drop by
opening up your lungs and therefore aiding in the clearance of
smoke and dirt. Nicotine has the exact opposite effect. (5)
Unlike the chemicals in marijuana, nicotine has a paralyzing
effect on the tiny hairs along the body's air passages. These
hairs normally work to keep foreign matter out of the lungs. This
means that carcinogenic tar from cigarette smoke is relatively
much harder to purge from your lungs than is that from marijuana.
And finally, (6) Marijuana users smoke significantly less than
cigarette smokers do because of both marijuana's psychoactive
properties (this is called &quot;auto-titration&quot;) and
nicotine's high potential for physical addiction [21]. It is
important to note that the NCTR study found no signs of lung
cancer in its autopsied rhesus monkeys who had smoked marijuana
for one year [6]. </p>

<p>Smoking cigarettes and smoking marijuana negatively affect
different areas of the body, and therefore cause different
problems. But everything considered, marijuana-only smokers who
average 3 - 4 joints per day show similar symptoms to cigarette
smokers who polish off 20 in a day [74]. Although one well-done
study tells us that frequent marijuana smokers have a 19% greater
risk of respiratory diseases than people who smoke nothing at all
[66], it seems that neck and throat cancers are much more likely
to result than lung cancer or emphysema. This is because, unlike
tobacco, marijuana does not penetrate deeply into the lung. In
order to minimize the risk of acquiring neck or throat cancer
from marijuana smoke, it is best to (1) avoid as much as possible
cigarette-smoking and heavy drinking while smoking marijuana, and
(2) eat plenty of vegetables (such as carrots, broccoli, squash,
and sprouts) or vitamin supplements of beta carotene, vitamins A,
C and E, and selenium [65]. These are believed to impede cancer's
progress. </p>

<p>In addition, there are actually things that can be done to
reduce and even entirely eliminate the bodily harm that may
potentially result from smoking marijuana. This is possible
because all of the principle psychoactive ingredients of
marijuana (THC and the cannabinoids) are neither mutagenic
(gene-mutating) nor carcinogenic (cancer-causing) [65]. </p>

<p>Legalizing marijuana would make (better) water bongs and
marijuana foods, drinks, and pills both less expensive and more
accessible. Smoking marijuana through a water-filled bong will
cool the smoke and there is reason to believe that it will filter
some of the carcinogens [69, 36]. Eating or drinking marijuana
effectively eliminates all negative effects. In addition, it is
conceivable that an aerosol contraption or vaporizer, commonly
called a tilt pipe, could easily be constructed that would
surpass joints in efficiency, match them in onset and control of
effects, and yet would be effectively harmless to the body. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Fat
Cells </h4>

<p>One of the more ridiculous myths being circulated is that
marijuana stays in your fat cells and can keep you high for
months. Even though they may have similar names, the psychoactive
THC (Delta-9-THC) is different from the metabolites (for
instance, 11-OH-THC and 11-nor) that your body breaks it down
into in that the latter will not get you stoned. It is the
metabolites that stay in your fatty cells and show up on drug
tests. Your body is depleted of Delta-9-THC only hours after
ingestion [40, 41]. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<h3>Other MJ Myths and Realities </h3>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Amotivational
Syndrome </h4>

<p>Amotivational syndrome is defined as a condition in which a
person loses ambition or motivation to complete tasks that he
would normally like to have completed. Claims made in the 60's
that marijuana use resulted in amotivational syndrome were
predominantly founded on stereotypes. But more recently, the
carefully-designed NCTR study has actually confirmed these
suspicions under certain conditions. It found that marijuana use
may consistently produce something akin to amotivational syndrome
in adolescent monkeys. It did not however prove that marijuana
makes adolescents apathetic or depressed. A full recovery to
normal motivation levels was typically observed to occur between
two to three months following cessation of exposure. For unknown
reasons, one monkey was observed to never fully recover.
Surprisingly, the willingness to work appeared to be equally
affected in both the daily and weekend rhesus smokers in the
study [6]. Other studies have failed to prove amotivational
syndrome in adults [42], so there is much reason to believe that
this effect only occurs during adolescent use. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
Potency </h4>

<p>Marijuana is not significantly more potent today than it has
been in the past [23]. It is generally agreed that this myth was
the result of bad data. The researchers making the claims used as
their baseline the THC content of marijuana seized by police in
the early 1970's, which had deteriorated since then because of
poor storage conditions [23]. In reality, it seems that domestic
marijuana's average potency probably doubled in the 70's with the
advent of sinsemilla, but has remained more or less constant
since then [65]. Scare tactics claiming that marijuana potency
has increased are rather irrelevant anyways since marijuana users
typically stop smoking when the desired effect is achieved (once
again, &quot;auto-titration&quot;). Contrary to one of DARE's
allegations [28], it is generally agreed that marijuana does not
create a tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, or physical dependence
in the user. Lester Grinspoon adds, &quot;there are many who
assert that there is nevertheless drug dependence because of
[marijuana's] capacity to generate psychic dependency. However it
is not at all clear that this type of dependency is essentially
any different from that which a man may develop with respect to
his trousers, his automobile, or his wife&quot; [61, p. 234]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Driving
</h4>

<p>Driving in any inebriated state is adding complication to what
already amounts to a constant life-threatening situation. That
said, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
(NHTSA) summarized all of its studies by saying that there was
&quot;no indication that marijuana by itself was a cause of fatal
accidents,&quot; and that alcohol was by far the &quot;dominant
problem&quot; in drug-related accidents [32]. The Victorian
Institute of Forensic Pathology and Monash University's
Department of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne, Australia have
found that drivers who use cannabis are actually less likely to
cause fatal accidents than drug-free drivers, and are no more
likely than other drivers to be killed or seriously injured in
road accidents [33]. One experiment tested marijuana-intoxicated
drivers on both a closed course and on a crowded city street. It
found that the elements of driving most affected were
concentration and judgment [52]. An experiment involving a
driving simulator that tested actual driving ability according to
how many mistakes are incurred by sober, drunk, and high subjects
found that marijuana, unlike alcohol, does not significantly
affect driving ability. It was found that these results hold true
for even higher doses (within reason) and inexperienced marijuana
users. In fact, the only significant difference reported by the
stoned subjects was an altered perception of time, which
effectively made them drive relatively slower [50]. A similar
study found that marijuana additionally impairs the driver's
ability to attend to peripheral stimuli [71]. One theory
attempting to explain these surprising findings states that
marijuana users, in instances requiring seriousness, are in fact
able to willingly &quot;bring themselves down,&quot; such that
they are no longer high [51]. Studies that in the past have shown
that marjuana-intoxicated drivers cause significantly more
accidents than sober drivers are typically unreliable on one or
more of the following counts: (1) They use drug tests to
determine whether or not a person is high, and drug tests in use
only indicate use over the past 30 days; (2) Some studies have
not corrected for alcohol use, or do not provide a control group;
and (3) In many studies there were relatively more stoned drivers
killed, but it was not their fault. And when the police
&quot;culpability scores&quot; were tallied and factored in,
marijuana was generally not to blame for the accidents. It must
be emphasized however that one study shows that daily marijuana
smokers tend to have a 30% higher risk of injuries than non-users
[66]. In fact, accidents resulting from intoxication are thought
to be &quot;the number one hazard of marijuana use&quot; [67]. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">The
Gateway Effect </h4>

<p>Marijuana use has not been found to act as a gateway drug to
the use of harder drugs. Studies show that when the Dutch
partially legalized marijuana in the 70's, heroin and cocaine use
substantially declined, despite a slight increase in marijuana
use [24]. If the stepping stone theory were true, use should have
gone up rather than down. In reality, it appears that marijuana
use tends to substitute for the use of relatively more dangerous
hard drugs like cocaine and heroin, rather than lead to their
use. Thus, oftentimes strict marijuana laws themselves are the
most significant factor involved in moving on to harder drugs
like cocaine. Such is the case in Nevada and Arizona, the states
toughest on marijuana use [65]. A recent study by Columbia
University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse attempts to
show, like many past studies have, that marijuana users are more
likely to use heroin or cocaine. But what the study actually does
show is that a large number of heroin or cocaine users have used
marijuana, not the reverse. What is not mentioned is that just as
many or even more had probably also drank alcohol, smoked
cigarettes, had sex, or eaten sandwiches prior to their hard drug
use. In fact, a National High School survey tells us that in
1990, 40.7% of all high school students had tried marijuana or
hashish at least once, whereas only 9.4% and 1.3% had ever used
cocaine and heroin, respectively [25]. Thus, at maximum, only 23%
of marijuana users go on to use cocaine, and only 3% go on to use
heroin. Thus, the stepping stone theory fails on even empirical
grounds. </p>

<h4><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" width="22" height="22">Marijuana
and Crime </h4>

<p>DARE literature would have you believe that there exists a
strong correlation between marijuana use and juvenile and young
adult crime [28]. And a recent study attempts to present a link
between marijuana use and violence by stating that 2/3 of all
students who admit to taking a gun to school at least once had
smoked marijuana. In fact, DEA head Thomas Constantine recently
stated in a Washington Times interview that &quot;Many times
people talk about the nonviolent drug offender. That is a rare
species. There is not some sterile drug type not involved in
violence who is contributing some good to the community; that is
ridiculous. They are contributing nothing but evil.&quot; But
these allegations are unsupported by research because test
results show that changes in personality resulting from marijuana
use, even though they are not relatively significant, include
among other things a lessening of aggressive trends [34]. And
large population studies such as the La Guardia report [10] have
found that, if anything, marijuana use inhibits antisocial
activity such as violence [20]. The drug-inspired violence myth,
including a comprehensive history of its conception, is discussed
at great length in Lester Grinspoon's book, where it is shown to
be based largely on a distorted Persian story that is hundreds of
years old [61]. The problem inherent in drawing conclusions based
on correlations such as the 2/3 statistic above is that causality
cannot be inferred from correlation. In other words, there is no
way of determining whether marijuana use contributed in some way
to the existence of certain traits of marijuana users, i.e.
bringing a gun to school, or, as seems entirely more likely,
people with such traits are drawn to marijuana use. One study
found that chronic marijuana users had significantly higher WAIS
IQ scores (113.08) than both moderate users (102.15) and nonusers
(103.26) [30]. It is simply impossible to make sense of such
statistics as presented. </p>

<h1>The Myth of Marijuana's Gateway Effect </h1>

<p><b>by John P. Morgan, M.D. and Lynn Zimmer, Ph.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, in cooperation with
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the White House
Office of Drug Control Policy, recently announced a new anti-drug
campaign that specifically targets marijuana. Instead of
featuring horror tales of marijuana-induced insanity, violence
and birth detects, this campaign is built upon the premise that
reducing marijuana use is a practical strategy for reducing the
use of more dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>The primary basis for this &quot;gateway hypothesis&quot; is a
recent report by the center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA), claiming that marijuana users are 85 times more likely
than non-marijuana users to try cocaine. This figure, using data
from NIDA's 1991 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, is
close to being meaningless. It was calculated by dividing the
proportion of marijuana users who have ever used cocaine (17%) by
the proportion of cocaine users who have never used marijuana
(.2%). The high risk-factor obtained is a product not of the fact
that so many marijuana users use cocaine but that so many cocaine
users used marijuana previously. </p>

<p>It is hardly a revelation that people who use one of the least
popular drugs are likely to use the more popular ones -- not only
marijuana, but also alcohol and tobacco cigarettes. The obvious
statistic not publicized by CASA is that most marijuana users --
83 percent -- never use cocaine. Indeed, for the nearly 70
million Americans who have tried marijuana, it is clearly a
&quot;terminus&quot; rather than a &quot;gateway&quot; drug. </p>

<p>During the last few years, after a decade of decline, there
has been a slight increase in marijuana use, particularly among
youth. In 1994, 38 percent of high school seniors reported having
ever tried the drug, compared to about 35 percent in 1993 and 33
percent in 1992. This increase does not constitute a crisis. No
one knows whether marijuana use-rates will continue to rise. But
even if they do, it will not necessarily lead to increased use of
cocaine. </p>

<p>Since the 1970s, when NIDA first began gathering data, rates
of marijuana and cocaine use have displayed divergent patterns.
Marijuana prevalence increased throughout the 1970s, peaking in
1979, when about 60 percent of high school seniors reported
having used it at least once. During the 1980s, cocaine use
increased while marijuana use was declining. Since 1991, when
data for the CASA analysis were gathered, marijuana use-rates
have increased while cocaine use-rates have remained fairly
steady. </p>

<p>The over-changing nature of the statistical relationship
between use-rate for marijuana and cocaine indicates the absence
of a causal link between the use of these two drugs. Therefore,
even if the proposed Partnership campaign were to be effective in
reducing marijuana use it would not guarantee a proportional
reduction in the number of people who use cocaine. To the extent
anti-drug campaigns are effective, they seem to be most effective
in deterring those people who would have been fairly low-level
users. There is no reason to believe that anti-marijuana messages
of any sort would deter many of those marijuana users --
currently 17 percent of the total -- who also develop an interest
in cocaine. </p>

<p>Nor is there reason to believe that the Partnership's new
campaign will actually reduce the overall number of marijuana
users. For a decade now, American youth have been subjected to an
unparalleled assault of anti-drug messages. They have seen
hundreds of Partnership advertisements, on television and in the
print media. They have been urged to &quot;just say no&quot; by
rock stars, sports heroes, presidents and first-ladies. They have
been exposed to anti-drug educational programs in the schools.
Yet this is the same generation of young people that recently
began increasing its use of marijuana. It seems unlikely that
many of them will be deterred by hyperbolic claims of marijuana's
gateway effect, particularly when it contradicts the reality of
drug use they see around them. </p>

<p>If the creators of American drug policy are truly interested
in reducing the risk of marijuana users using other drugs, they
should take a closer look at Holland, where drug policy since the
1970s has been guided by a commitment to diminishing any
potential gateway effect. Wanting to keep young marijuana users
away from cocaine and other &quot;hard drugs,&quot; the Dutch
decided to separate the retail markets by allowing anyone 18
years of age or older to purchase marijuana openly in
government-controlled &quot;coffee shops&quot; which strictly
prohibit the use and sale of other drugs. </p>

<p>Despite easy availability, marijuana prevalence among 12 to 18
year olds in Holland is only 13.6 percent -- well below the 38
percent use-rate for American high school seniors. More Dutch
teenagers use marijuana now than in the past; indeed, lifetime
prevalence increased nearly three-fold between 1984 and 1992,
from </p>

<p>4.8 to 13.6 percent. However, Dutch officials consider their
policy a success because the increase in marijuana use has not
been accompanied by an increase in the use of other drugs. For
the last decade, the rate of cocaine use among Dutch youth has
remained stable, with about .3 percent of 12-18 year olds
reporting having used it in the past month. </p>

<p>In the United States, the claim that marijuana acts as a
gateway to the use of other drugs serves mainly as a rhetorical
tool for frightening Americans into believing that winning the
war against heroin and cocaine requires waging &amp; battle
against the casual use of marijuana. Not only is the claim
intellectually indefensible, but the battle is wasteful of
resources and fated to failure. </p>

<h1>Pharmacology of Marijuana: Just Another Sedative </h1>

<p><b>FREDERICK H. MEYERS, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>Professor of Pharmacology, University of California, San
Francisco, Ca. </p>

<p>The Drug Policy Foundation's CME Seminar </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Change in the laws regulating the use of marijuana-certainly a
primary goal of this group-has been effectively blocked by the
successful efforts of the enforcement industry to convince the
citizenry that the use of marijuana presents a terrible danger to
the user and to society. Efforts to rebut the claims of the
prohibitionists have been enfeebled by the confusion that some of
us feel. Proselytizers insist not on an absence of significant
danger but on some positive, mystic and generally ineffable
benefit from the use of marijuana. Observers with less subjective
overlay also appear at a loss in formulating the pharmacology of
Cannabis, and both groups thus play into the hand of those who
encoded marijuana as an hallucinogen or who plead for delaying
action pending further research. </p>

<p>Even the technical or scientific reviews of the drug by
nominal experts are little more than catalogues suffused with
uncertainty, timidity and even error generated by the confusion
imposed by law and street lore. The defects in the literature are
not due to a lack of data from research but to a failure or
inability to apply any unifying or organizing concept to the
fragments of information. It will not be difficult to supply you
with that key: cannabis in its several forms and essences is just
another member of a large group of drugs, call them for the
moment general <i>anesthetic-sedative-hypnotics, </i>all of which
are used (and abused) at some time and in some form by some
technique by some individuals to relieve anxiety, to provide
surcease from memory and to cross the borders of consciousness
and sometimes even of life. </p>

<p>Members of this group of drugs, exemplified by alcohol,
Valium, and the other agents in the incomplete list in Figure 1,
all have characteristic, identifying effects in common, They
differ one from another largely in their duration of action and
speed of onset of effect. Some of them, especially alcohol, have
important organic toxicity not seen in others. It will also be
necessary to discuss the differences in the slope of the
dose-response relationship, that is the margin of safety.
However, the most important preliminary matter is the effect of
the route of administration on the manifest actions of a drug. </p>

<h2>SMOKE AS A DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM </h2>

<p>Many people, including those smokers of marijuana who use wine
or beer to reinforce and prolong the effect, will resist the
conclusion, established below, that marijuana and alcohol are
comparable pharmacologically. Their intuitive feeling that there
can be no relation between the instantaneous, transient euphoria
from a joint and the more slowly developing and persistent good
feeling after a drink is understandable but mistaken. Before the
similarity of effects can be convincingly presented, however, the
influence of the route of administration on the temporal
relations of the response must be clarified by as brief as
possible a discussion of the distribution and transformation of
THC, the active ingredient of cannabis, after it enters the body
whether swallowed or inhaled. </p>

<p>The differences claimed to exist between marijuana and alcohol
(or Valium or whatever) virtually disappear if the reference drug
is given by mouth and is compared with THC also orally
administered. (Careful metabolic studies of crude drug using
special chocolate cookies are also available.) THC, it turns out,
is actually much more slowly metabolized and excreted than
alcohol (Figure 3 and 6). THC, like phenobarbital or
chlordiazepoxide (Librium), is best given as a cumulative drug,
and the amount in the body at equilibration is enormous compared
to the amount provided by one cigarette. Why then does the
cigarette provide such an immediate and intense effect? </p>

<p>First of all, realize that the particles in the smoke that
carry the drug are colloidal in size; so small that they are
carried by the inspired air to the depths of the lung where the
drug can be instantaneously absorbed across the alveolar
membrane. The efficiency of this process is already apparent to
you by analogy with the two common methods of cocaine delivery.
Smoked free-based (crack) is absorbed with a velocity resulting
in levels comparable to those seen after intravenous injection.
In contrast, the particles of inhaled cocaine salt are relatively
large, are deposited on the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract
and absorption is not much more rapid than after swallowing the
drug. </p>

<p>The THC in smoke is rapidly transferred to the essentially
aqueous blood and carried immediately to the left heart and into
the arteries, that is, the liver is not included in this first
pass and the absorbed THC is diluted by a relatively small volume
of arterial blood that is pumped to the tissues. Difference
vascular beds have differing blood flows. The cerebral blood flow
is relatively large and the brain is a fatty organ in the
chemical sense. THC is partitioned from the blood into the lipids
of the brain tissue. Immediately after inhalation, then, a high
concentration of THC is built up in the brain and the subjective
experience begins. </p>

<p>The THC remaining in the blood undergoes two additional
processes. Some reaches the liver and a fraction is altered
chemically- some accumulates in other fatty organs especially
ordinary adipose tissue. This accumulation slowly removes THC
from the blood. :The accumulation is slow because blood flow to
these depots is low. However, as THC is removed from the blood,
the concentration in the blood falls below that in the brain and
the THC passes from the brain back into the blood and the
behavioral effects at least rapidly diminish (Figure 5). </p>

<p>It is this rapid accumulation of agent in the brain and its
subsequent redistribution rather than its chemical transformation
that explains the brevity and intensity of the effect. The effect
begins before the subject exhales. As an illustration of the
efficiency of smoking consider that in one trial 10-15 mg of
Smoked THC resulted in a peak concentration about eight times as
great as followed 20 mg by mouth (Figure 3). </p>

<p>There are some correlates of THC metabolism unrelated to our
immediate discussion but worth mentioning in passing. THC
accumulates in fat to a concentration at least twenty fold that
in any other organ, and the slow release of the stored substance
explains the persistent appearance of THC and its metabolite in
the urine for weeks. (Figures 4 and 6.) Unlike the blood levels
of the very water soluble alcohol, THC levels do not correlate
with its biological effects. </p>

<p>Now that we are able to adjust to the different routes of the
administration, we can examine the effects of marijuana and
compare them with the effects of other sedatives. </p>

<h2>THE SEDATIVE -HYPNOTIC -GENERAL ANESTHETIC GROUP </h2>

<p>Physicians are conditioned at great expense by the drug
industry to think of available therapeutic agents as thousands of
individual cases properly identified only by a euphonious
tradename. However, the vast amount of information available can
be managed only if drugs are put into classes or categories. The
same properties that make for a useful therapeutic agent may make
for an enticing social drug, and it is not surprising then that
most social drugs fit into known categories. </p>

<p>There are a very large number of drugs that have similar
effects and are fairly included in the category
sedative-hypnotics or anxiolytics although <i>sedative-hypnotic-general
</i>anesthetics would be more accurate. Gases and volatile
liquids are often selected for use as general anesthetics because
their use can be by inhalation and allow minute to minute control
of dosage and rapid recovery. Solids are more easily dispensed
and administered as tablets or capsules and are chosen for use in
treating anxiety or inducing sleep, but pharmacologicaly all are
similar. Figure 1 lists some common drugs from this group. </p>

<p>This exercise will now examine the pharmacology of marijuana
and establish that all of the properties of sedatives are
present. Remember, please, throughout the discussion that effects
are described to establish the drug type. It does not follow that
these effects are induced regularly or even at all as marijuana
is used in our culture, but they are established by quantitative
experiments in the animal laboratory and by controlled clinical
observations. </p>

<h2>EFFECTS OF GRADED DOSE: </h2>

<p>The simplest way to characterize marijuana and equate the
effects with those of all other sedatives and general anesthetics
is to study the effects of doses of increasing size. It is
important to study the drug over a range of doses because the
effects manifested at a single dose level may mislead. Alcohol
even today is regarded as a stimulant by many people because they
see only the excitement and acting out; with larger or smaller
doses it becomes apparent that alcohol is a depressant and that
the excitement is actually disinhibition. The sequence of changes
are those still conveniently described as the stages of
anesthesia. These changes reflect a diffuse depression of the
neuraxis that begins at the highest level of the cortex and at
the caudal segments of the cord. The depression descends and
ascends until it meets at the medulla and even vegetative
function stops. </p>

<p>Stage 1 was long called the stage of analgesia. With small
doses, the subject experiences relief of anxiety or euphoria (a
positively good feeling) and possibly a slight drowsiness.
Psychomotor performance, concentration, short term memory are
progressively impaired in the laboratory situation. Actual
performance (driving on a test course) deteriorates if the dose
is adequate and the timing consonant. The flight simulator is a
useful tool and shows the same prolonged (24 hours) decrement in
performance seen after the acute effects of the barbiturates.
Judgment is obviously difficult to test, but most observers
consider as evidence the inappropriate high humor and confidence
in a fumbling, discursive subject. The one generalization that is
hard </p>

<p>for users of marijuana or of other sedatives to accept is that
users, whose function and ability to judge their function are
both impaired, are the persons least competent to analyze the
effects of a downer. </p>

<p>Stage 2 begins with the appearance of excitement. The degree
of excitement depends not alone on the dose but also on the
expectation of the subject and the setting, that is, on the
amount and nature of stimuli from the surroundings. In a calm
environment the subject may show only an intensification of the
changes listed for Stage 1. In another situation, the patient may
respond to stimuli in an uncontrolled, exaggerated way. This
excitement must not be confused with stimulation. These
&quot;drunks&quot; from whatever drug are disinhibited, that is,
the highest cortical centers are depressed and lower centers and
more primitive behaviors are released from the inhibition from
above that ordinarily controls them. The stage ends with the loss
of consciousness. </p>

<p>The flat dose response curve mentioned above now becomes of
crucial importance in understanding why marijuana does not cause,
as a direct drug effect, the same disinhibited criminal and
antisocial activity as does alcohol. Marijuana is in part benign
in this regard because the brief effect after smoking is achieved
with a small absolute dose. However, even if the subject is
swallowing hashish or THC (which is now marketed), the dangerous
(to self or others) dose is many multiples of the threshold dose
and, so far as I can establish, never achieved in humans in this
country. (There never was any basis for the picture of the
hash-crazed assassin. The assassins were a sect in Islam active
at the time of the crusades who were given to religio-political
murder but not under the influence of hashish. Their
assassinations were carefully planned and sometimes required
years of preparation while, for <u>example</u>, the designated
hit man learned a language and a trade and insinuated himself
into the court of the victim.) </p>

<p>Stage 3, the stage of surgical anesthesia, is easily reached
with cannabis in the animal laboratory, but the dose-effect curve
is so flat that is, so much is required, that it is doubtful if
anyone in the U.S. has ever been anesthetized by cannabis resin
in any form. For our purpose, classification, however, the animal
data are enough. </p>

<p>Stage 4, the stage of medullary paralysis, is demonstrable
with difficulty even in animals. The oral LD50 of THC in rats is
in excess of 600 mg/kg. </p>

<h2>ANOTHER ACUTE EFFECT </h2>

<h3>Dreamy, Fantasizing State </h3>

<p>The law thinks that marijuana is an hallucinogen, and any
number of groups and individuals refer to marijuana as a
&quot;mild hallucinogen&quot; and thus terribly confuse the
perception of the drug by many citizens. </p>

<p>What marijuana does is induce the same state that has been
described in association with every sedative-hypnotic that has
had wide use. The effect is most easily and commonly defined in
hospitals or offices where sedated patients can make known to
doctors and nurses their difficulty in distinguishing dreams and
waking fantasies from reality. The patient may complain bitterly
of the frightening nightmares or may accuse a staff member of
molesting her. At home the nightmares may be equally frightening,
but the erotic dreams cannot be projected onto an attendant and
the dreamy float may actually be pleasurable. The absence of an
exact statement about the associated level of consciousness is
not accidental. The process appears separate from the developing
concept of lucid dreaming. </p>

<p>This effect is also totally different than that of the nominal
hallucinogens such as acid. I say &quot;nominal&quot; because the
dreams of the sedated patient are by definition closer to
hallucinations than the distortions of perception experienced
with what, it appears, we will soon have to call rave drugs.
These magic agents all have the properties of the sympathomimetic
stimulants to a greater (MDA, MDMA) or lesser (LSD) degree. </p>

<p>Where the misconceived labeling of marijuana as hallucinatory
originated, and how it is maintained is a question of interest to
those of us who hope to see the laws regulating marijuana
rationalized. The 1937 enactment, designed to criminalize
marijuana use and thus provide continued federal employment for
redundant prohibition agents and a fiefdom for Anslinger,
classified marijuana as a narcotic. This irrationality, together
with the ruling by the Supreme Court that applying for a tax
stamp to handle an illegal substance constituted self
incrimination and would not fly, forced some revisions at just
about the time the early proselytizers for LSD were active. When
the hallucinogens were added to the index, marijuana was
transferred to that category. The enforcement industry is, of
course, still happy to have it separated from anything familiar.
Unfortunately several groups of professionals and marijuana
advocates are as responsible for maintaining the fallacy as those
from the criminal justice system. </p>

<h2>EFFECTS DURING CONTINUOUS USE </h2>

<h3>Tolerance and Withdrawal </h3>

<p>The tolerance and withdrawal expected of a sedative does
develop with the use of cannabis in concentrated forms. Tolerance
strictly defined has been demonstrated only with the use of
concentrated forms of cannabis or of THC and an analogue.
However, a learning process that is fairly called behavioral
tolerance explains some otherwise puzzling observations that are
made on people who smoke grass. </p>

<p><i>Behavioral Tolerance</i> - The manifest expression of
sedative effect depends not alone on the pharmacological effect
in the strict sense but also on the expectation of the user and
on his reaction to the physiological and behavioral changes
perceived. Taken at bedtime, a downer will shorten sleep latency;
the same dose at five in the afternoon in a situation that
provides stimulation and the need to continue to function may
lead to excitement. An inexperienced user, notably a first time
user or someone unexpectedly experiencing a larger than usual
dose or someone using in an anxiety laden situation, may be
seized by panic. We have no time for case histories, but the
hypomania and paranoia that accompanies the disinhibition and
anxiety can be alarming to all. If the episode is followed by
feelings of guilt or fear of consequences, the anxiety or panic
can be prolonged or recurrent. Possibly these incidents and the
withdrawal state to be described were the origin of the now
discredited claim of a marijuana psychosis. </p>

<p>The experienced drinker or marijuana user will not show these
exaggerated reactions, indeed, he will be able to hide some minor
effects consistently. The effects on psychomotor function and
cognition will not, however, be lessened, that is the tolerance
is more apparent than real. </p>

<p><i>Metabolic Tolerance.- </i>Behavioral tolerance is usually
contrasted with &quot;real&quot; or metabolic tolerance. However,
it seems to me that, in this day of disproportionate interest in
biotransformation and P450, &quot;real&quot; tolerance should be
divided into the metabolic and physiologic. </p>

<p>As we shall see, some kind of tolerance to marijuana clearly
must develop since its correlate, withdrawal, is easily
demonstrable. Tolerance, however, is quantitatively minor, and it
is not necessary to use larger and larger doses to maintain the
same effect, nor do fixed doses lose their effect with continued
administration. The point at this moment is that enzyme induction
cannot be important in this situation since frequent users of
marijuana achieve higher plasma levels after a test dose and
excrete the dose over a longer period than do infrequent users
(Figure 6). </p>

<p><i>Physiologic Tolerance</i> - Small but statistically
significant degrees of tolerance to </p>

<p>the effects on cardiovascular function, amount of REM sleep,
psychomotor performance, intraocular pressure, subjective
judgment of intensity of effect and others developed rapidly
when, to cite one specific paper, 210 mg per day of THC or the
equivalent in the form of crude extract was given for 11-21 days.
</p>

<p>During the above period of drug administration, physical
dependence developed, for, to anticipate the next paragraph, the
abrupt replacement of the drug with a placebo led to signs of
hyperexcitability or stimulation, that is, to withdrawal. The
constant presence in the body of a depressant had led to the
activation of antagonizing, stimulant or excitatory physiologic
systems. </p>

<p><i>Withdrawal</i> - The signs of withdrawal or physical
dependence appear when the stimulant or excitatory adaptations
persist beyond the e effect of the depressant. In the above
trial, weight loss, irritability and an increase in time spent in
REM sleep were prominent and persisted for 96 hours. Another
apparently well executed trial gave large doses of a synthetic
analogue of THC for a month. The withdrawal state described upon
discontinuing the drug was more in the expected pattern in that
it developed on the third day and was characterized by
restlessness and disturbed sleep although one subject did develop
hypomania. Under the same experimental conditions, subjects were
allowed free access to the drug as cigarettes; the average
patient smoked seventeen cigarettes per day, but no withdrawal
state could be demonstrated. </p>

<p>Insofar as our needs for classifying cannabis are concerned,
there remains the question of whether withdrawal from strong
cannabis could be as intense as the delirium tremens of alcohol
withdrawal and explain some of the &quot;psychotic&quot; episodes
alleged to occur. Controlled trials, of course, are not going to
become available. The clinical reports, notably those from
British physicians serving colonial troops, seem convincing to
me. </p>

<h2>Potential for Abuse </h2>

<p>There is no drug of this category that has not been misused
either episodically or compulsively. Relief of anxiety is a
seductive pharmacological reward, and countless patients and
non-patients are unable to resist using a little more than is
prescribed, a little oftener than is necessary. If one looks
outside of our culture to the Muslim world, it appears that a
compulsive pattern of use is possible, but in this country the
mode is the &quot;responsible use&quot; that the consensus
applauds in the case of alcohol. The responsible use of the less
dangerous cannabis is not countenanced because some agency or
forcehas convinced our legislators. that marijuana is somehow
different from all of its congeners. </p>

<h2>Other Effects </h2>

<p>There are a few other minor drug effects common to cannabis
and all other sedatives. In the animal laboratory the
tetrahydrocannabinols are anticonvulsant and comparable to
Phenobarbital. Presumably THC could be used in the human as an
antiepileptic, but also presumably the rapid down and up of
smoked marijuana could destabilize a seizure prone patient. </p>

<p>As is necessary to validate our thesis, marijuana depresses
polysynaptic spinal cord reflexes. In the laboratory this effect
can be demonstrated independent of the behavioral sedation, but
clinically the voluntary muscle relaxant effect of the sedatives
cannot be shown to be useful beyond or independent of the
anxiolytic effect. </p>

<p>A discussion of the therapeutic applications of marijuana or
of THC, which is available on prescription, would contribute to
our argument to the extent that the drug can be shown to act as a
sedative or anxiety relieving agent. The use of synhexyl as an
antidepressant is often mention. Review of the paper by Stockings
usually cited in this regard will establish that he actually used
the drug for the relief of anxiety. He clearly characterizes his
ambulant patients as neurotic and describes the development after
the administration of the analogue of THC of mild intoxication,
euphoria, and dreamy apathy. Given a patient whose vision and
ocular structure has been destroyed by glaucoma no one would
withhold whatever subjective relief a joint would provide, but it
would be misleading to say that marijuana is acting on the
glaucomatous process. Whether marijuana has important therapeutic
applications is an emotional issue that can be settled only by
controlled clinical trials of each proposed application as is
required for any other new drug or new application. In any case,
the questions associated with the use of marijuana as a social
drug are unrelated. </p>

<h2>MECHANISM OF ACTION </h2>

<p>The mechanism of action of this large group of drugs is, as
has been mentioned, a diffuse depression of the entire central
nervous system. However, one action is more specific and is
useful in developing our analogy. The ability of a sedative or
anesthetic to cause loss of consciousness is due to the
sensitivity of the reticular activating system to their
depressant effects. When electrodes are implanted into the
reticular formation and several functionally related areas in the
brain,, the effect of synhexyl cannot be distinguished from that
of thiopental (Pentothal), that is, the barbiturate and the
cannabinoid have a similar mechanism of action. (Synhexyl is a
close analogue of THC that was available in pure form before THC.
Careful, controlled double blind studies have shown that human
subjects are unable to distinguish between the two.) </p>

<p>In summary then marijuana is a drug which is pharmacologicly
similar to all other sedatives. There are differences between the
various sedatives, but these are largely matters of onset and
duration of action. The exception is alcohol which must be
ingested in grams rather than milligrams and which provides empty
calories that replace food that contains protein and vitamins.
and in some people the thiamin deficiency can lead to atrophy of
the brain. Alcohol also has direct toxic effects on the liver,
upper GI and respiratory tracts and brain As a direct effect of
its persistent action and the ease with which a grossly
disinhibiting action can be reached, it is responsible for
massive social and criminal problems. </p>

<p>Having provided you with an outline or framework upon which
you can hang your further studies and experience with marijuana,
I have reached the boundary of my province as a Pharmacologist.
In considering the social problems presented by our societal
reaction to the use of marijuana, I am a citizen with one vote.
However, I believe that the objective pharmacology that I have
presented suggests a well advised direction for change. </p>

<p>People who prefer marijuana to alcohol as a social drug can
fairly point out that the disinhibitory effect is brief, a
dangerously intense effect difficult to achieve and the organic
toxicity infinitely less than is the case with alcohol. From what
I regard as an objective pharmacologic point of view, I do not
see how we can with any hope of useful outcome acknowledge that
prohibition failed in the case of alcohol and at the same time
apply the discredited remedy to marijuana. It would also be
useful to eliminate the market that bleeds dollars into other
economies, and undeniably the criminal justice system would
become more useful if relieved of the burden posed by the huge
number of people who do not feel guilty. </p>

<p>Yet I do not wish to encourage the use of marijuana; we
certainly must not reduce regulation to the point that another
cigarette or liquor industry develops. My suggestion is to
legalize cultivation for personal use. </p>

<h1>The Marijuana Amotivational Syndrome </h1>

<p><b>A Review of The Research of William Slikker, Jr.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Amotivational Syndrome&quot; was hypothesized as a long
term effect of marijuana use -- that is, it was supposed to be an
effect which occured among people who smoke pot, not when they
were stoned, but all the time. Various studies were done to try
to find &quot;Amotivational Syndrome.&quot; Some claimed success.
Others claimed that there was no such animal. But there was one
trend: the more successful studies were done on young persons. </p>

<p>Slikker, Paule, et al. set out to find the effects of
marijuana smoke on the brain, memory, learning, and motivation.
They found that monkees who smoked even just on weekends did not
develop normal clinical motivation -- defined by the willingness
to work for reward. The studies concentrated on adolescense
specifically for this reason, and were extremely well controlled.
</p>

<p>Does this mean that kids who smoke marijuana are lazy?
Probably not. Rhesus monkees are very similar to humans, though,
and it is very likely, especially given the previous empirical
evidence, that smoking marijuana during adolescense will
temporarily impair specific types of motivational development.
The effect is permanantly reversible and normal motivational
development can be obtained by a 3-12 month period of abstinance
(in monkeys -- no time period for humans is available.) </p>

<p>Slikker did not find &quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; but
something less severe which may be at the root of the common
perception that marijuana smokers are lazy. This is a good thing
because it gives us a better argument *against* the existance of
full blown amotivational syndrome. Among the other things Slikker
found which we can be very excited about was no brain or cellular
damage, an actual stimulation of brain cell development by
marijuana smoking (which would fit with the current knowlege of
increased alpha wave activity and blood flow while stoned), no
permanant effects on memory or mental capacity, and lots of good
reasons why marijuana should be more thoroughly researched rather
than feared. </p>

<p>So instead of being so defensive, read the study -- it is very
useful. </p>

<h2>Notes on Marijuana and the Amotivational Syndrome </h2>

<p><b>Copied from p.229-230 of 'Drugs and Behavior' by William A.
McKim. All portions copyright the author.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Amotivational Syndrome</b> </p>

<p>It has sometimes been observed that when a young person starts
smoking marijuana there are systematic changes in that person's
lifestyle, ambitions, motivation, and possibly personality. These
changes have been collectively referred to as the _amotivational
syndrome_, whose symptoms are: </p>

<p>&quot;... apathy, loss of effectiveness, and diminished
capacity or willingness to carry out complex, long-term plans,
endure frustration, concentrate for long periods, follow
routines, or successfully master new material. Verbal facility is
often impaired both in speaking and writing. Some individuals
exhibit greater introversion, become totally involved with the
present at the expense of future goals and demonstrate a strong
tendency toward regressive, childlike, magical thinking[1].&quot;
</p>

<p>There is no doubt that many young individuals have changed
from clean, aggressive, upwardly mobile achievers into the sort
of person just described at about the same time as they started
smoking marijuana. What is not clear, however, is a causal
relationship between the loss of middle class motivations and
cannabis. Which comes first, the marijuana or the loss of
motivations? This is not easy to answer. In fact, there may be no
clearcut answer. To begin with, all we know about the
amotivational syndrome is a result of a few case histories. These
data cannot answer questions about: a) how common the syndrome
is; b) whether the marijuana actually caused the change in
behavior; or c) if the change is caused by marijuana, if it is
best described as a change in all motivations, specific
motivations, or something other than motivation, like ability or
personality. </p>

<p>It does not appear as though the amotivational syndrome is all
that common among marijuana smokers. In one survey[2] a sample of
almost 2000 college students was studied. There was no difference
in grade point average and achievement between marijuana users
and nonusers, but the users had more difficulty deciding on
career goals, and a smaller number were seeking advanced
professional degrees. On the other hand, other studies have shown
lower school averages and higher dropout rates among users than
nonusers. In any case these differences are not great. If there
is such a thing as amotivational syndrome, its affects appear to
be restricted to a few individuals, probably the small percentage
who become heavy users. </p>

<p>Laboratory studies provide additional information on the
causal relationship between motivation and marijuana. The
Mendelson[3] experiment, where hospitalised volunteers worked on
an operant task to earn money and marijuana for 26 days, found
that the dose of marijuana smoked did not influence the amount of
work done by either the casual-user group or the heavy-user
group; all remained motivated to earn and take home a significant
amount of money in addition to the work they did for the
marijuana. It seems clear that marijuana does not cause a loss of
motivation. </p>

<p>While marijuana does not specifically diminish motivation, it
is clear that cannabis affects attention and memory, and these
are intellectual capacities usually considered necessary for
success in educational institutions. We know that a significant
tolerance develops to these effects and they can be suppressed
voluntarily at low doses, but consistent smoking of high doses of
marijuana must impede a successful academic career. In fact,
achievement motivation must be high indeed in any individual who
combines high levels of cannabis use with a successful academic
career. </p>

<p>Since most reports of the amotivational syndrome originated in
the sixties in North America, what they seem to describe is a
tendency for college students to 'drop out' and assume a
lifestyle that rejects traditional achievement motivations of
their parents' generation. In an effort to understand this
rejection it was very easy to believe that it was pharmacological
and to dismiss it as 'amotivational syndrome.' </p>

<h2>From: THE NATURAL MIND by Andrew Weil. </h2>

<p><b>p. 60:</b> </p>

<p>When I was a freshman at Harvard, long before many people
thought of smoking marihuana, there was plenty of amotivation. It
took such forms as sleeping till dinner time and then playing
Monopoly all night instead of working and was indistinguishable
from amotivation now associated with heavy marihuana use. Heavy
marihuana use is a convenient symptom for an amotivated person to
add to his list: it is fun, can be done with other people, angers
grownups, and so on. If it is not too late to find a rural
college where marihuana is still unknown, I would predict that
the amotivated people there would become the heavy marihuana
smokers once the drug appeared on campus. If marihuana were the
cause of amotivation, one would expect that amotivation could be
cured by taking away the marihuana, but this is not the case.
Therefore, it makes more sense to see amotivation as a cause of
heavy marihuana smoking rather than the reverse. <br>

<h1>POT'S TAB IN THE WAR ON DRUGS </h1>

<p><b>The Arkansas Times, September 16, 1993 </b></p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS </p>

<p>While courts send users to prison, scientists at NCTR find
little to support dangers of pot. </p>

<p>The investment: </p>

<p>* Federal matching funds for the &quot;war on drugs&quot; in
Arkansas totaled $4.6 million in 1992. </p>

<p>* State and local agencies kicked in another $1.8 million. </p>

<p>* The Arkansas National Guard received $1.3 million to assist
in marijuana eradication. </p>

<p>* An unknown additional amount of money was generated for drug
investigations by the sale of confiscated property. </p>

<p>* No figures are available for the cost of prosecuting drug
cases and incarcerating offenders. </p>

<p>The return: </p>

<p>* 42 percent of all arrests for the sale and manufacture of
drugs in 1992 were for selling or growing marijuana. </p>

<p>* And 62 percent of all arrests for possession of drugs were
for possession of marijuana. </p>

<p>By Mara Leveritt </p>

<p>The monkeys smoked a joint a day. Actually, they didn't
recline in their cages, puffing a hand-rolled reefer. This being
a scientific experiment, funded by the powerful National
Institute on Drug Abuse, the process was more carefully
controlled. The monkeys were fitted with masks through which
marijuana smoke, machine-puffed in carefully measured doses, was
passed into their nostrils. </p>

<p>The experiment, performed at the National Center for
Toxicological Research near Pine Bluff, was designed to test
whether chronic marijuana use caused brain damage. It lasted for
several years, with the most intensive phase, during which
monkeys were exposed to heavy doses of marijuana smoke, occurring
from 1984 to 1985. </p>

<p>Reports on the study's findings continue to be published in
pharmacology and toxicology journals. But beyond those tight
scientific circles, the results of the NCTR experiment, the most
extensive of its kind yet conducted, have gone almost entirely
unnoticed. </p>

<p>That's not surprising, perhaps. In a world where the political
majority has shown little tolerance for marijuana, the test
results are explosive. </p>

<p>The experiment discovered no adverse impact from marijuana on
monkeys' general health, no sign that heavy exposure to marijuana
smoke caused lung cancer, and, with one exception, no long-term
effects on the animals' behavior from exposure to marijuana. </p>

<p>Before the NCTR study, the largest experiment examining the
effects of marijuana on primates was one conducted at the
Stanford Research Institute. That experiment, focusing on the
brain's electrical activity under the influence of marijuana,
involved 16 monkeys. </p>

<p>By contrast, the experiment at NCTR used 62 monkeys, all
rhesus males. In 1983, the animals were all approximately two to
three years old, the monkey equivalent of teen-agers. </p>

<p>For one year before the start of the experiment, the monkeys
were trained to play &quot;games&quot; designed to test their
perception of the passage of time and their ability to discern
left from right. Only after they were proficient did the exposure
to marijuana begin. </p>

<p>Toxicologists divided the monkeys into four groups. Every day
for a year, 16 monkeys each received what Dr. Merle Paule, head
of NCTR's Behavioral Toxicology Laboratory and Primate Research
Facility, called &quot;a pretty heavy exposure&quot; to
marijuana, the human equivalent, Paule said, of &quot;four or
five joints a day.&quot; </p>

<p>Another group of 16 smoked the same amount of marijuana, but
only two days per week. Staffers called them the &quot;weekend
smokers.&quot; </p>

<p>A third group was administered smoke from cigarettes identical
to the others, except that the psychoactive component of THC had
been removed. And a fourth group received no smoke exposure at
all. </p>

<p>The monkeys smoked for a year, then they were monitored and
tested for another year. </p>

<p>Dr. William Slikker, acting director of NCTR's Division of
Neurotoxicology, explained that the study generated so much data,
it has taken time to compile it and the results have been
released gradually, in several reports since the experiment was
ended. </p>

<p>In 1991, the journal Fundamental and Applied Toxicology
published a report on the effects of marijuana on the monkeys'
general health. Slikker was the lead writer, with Paule
(pronounced Paul) and other NCTR researchers listed as
collaborators. </p>

<p>That report concluded, &quot;The general health of the monkeys
was not compromised by a year of marijuana smoke exposure as
indicated by weight gain, carboxyhemoglobin and clinical
chemistry/hematology values. </p>

<p>&quot;Most clinical parameters ... did not show any
treatment-related changes, and those few that did were of small
magnitude, transient in nature, and were not different at the end
of the five-month postdosing period.&quot; </p>

<p>Last week, in his office at NCTR, Paule explained the health
study's results in more casual terms. &quot;There's just nothing
there,&quot; he said. &quot;They were all fine.&quot; </p>

<p>Last year, the journal Toxicology Letters published a report
by another group of NCTR researchers on the effects of marijuana
on the lungs of the monkeys who smoked. Seven months after the
last exposure to marijuana smoke, some of the monkeys were killed
and their bodies autopsied. Scientists examined the lungs for
signs of disturbances called &quot;carcinogen-DNA adducts,&quot;
considered to be one of the early indications of cancer. </p>

<p>The writers of that study reported that although their
findings were not conclusive, they were &quot;at variance with
earlier work suggesting that fractions of marijuana smoke are
highly genotoxic.&quot; </p>

<p>The seven authors noted that, &quot;It has been suggested that
marijuana smoking is a proximal cause of respiratory cancer.
However, these intimations have not been borne out by
epidemiological investigations, which is surprising considering
the widespread use of marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>Moreover, the journal article noted: &quot;The data presented
here suggest that seven months after the last smoke exposure,
there is not evidence of increased marijuana smoke-induced
carcinogen-DNA adducts in the lungs of exposed monkeys.&quot; </p>

<p>Paule's informal interpretation: &quot;If it's not there, it's
probably not too terrible.&quot; </p>

<p>(The researchers discount the claim that as marijuana has
become increasingly potent, due to refined horticultural
techniques, it has also become more dangerous. Other studies,
they say, have demonstrated that smokers inhale only to the point
of inebriation, so that persons smoking stronger marijuana smoke
considerably less of it.) </p>

<p>Late last year, Paule himself was the lead author of a report
published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental
Therapeutics. It dealt with marijuana's effect on behavior. </p>

<p>This report's findings were more complex. </p>

<p>Before the monkeys were started on their year-long smoke
exposure, Slikker, Paule and other scientists, conducted a
short-term study to determine the immediate effect of THC on the
animals; in other words, how they reacted when they were
&quot;high.&quot; </p>

<p>They found two areas of apparent impact. One was the monkey's
short-term memory. &quot;That's a function that's very
sensitive,&quot; Paule explained, &quot;but only on an acute
basis. If you test them the next day, you see no residual effect
on those behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p>The monkeys sense of time also appeared disrupted. Monkeys, it
turns out, are as good as humans at estimating the passage of
time. Members of both species to equally well at a test that
requires them, for instance, to press down on a lever for more
than 10 seconds but not longer than 14 seconds. </p>

<p>Marijuana has been shown to affect human's ability to perform
the test at normal levels, and the monkeys were no different.
&quot;That time-estimation behavior is exquisitely sensitive to
marijuana,&quot; Paule said, &quot;even at very low doses.&quot; </p>

<p>The NCTR study corroborated human studies showing that time
seems to stretch out for many subjects under the influence of
marijuana. In the monkeys' response to the time-perception test,
Paule explained, &quot;what they said was that eight seconds
feels like ten.&quot; </p>

<p>That phenomenon too, however, quickly dissipated. Testing the
next day showed the monkeys' time perception restored to its
normal acuity. </p>

<p>The main thrust of the study, however, concerned the long-term
effects of exposure to marijuana. To study that, the animals were
tested for cognitive function and motivation 23 hours after each
marijuana exposure. </p>

<p>The cognitive test involved four lights and two levers. The
monkeys were taught that when they saw a red or a yellow light,
they were to hit a lever on their left in order to receive a food
pellet. If a blue or a green light came on, they would get the
pellet by hitting a lever on their right. </p>

<p>The researchers wanted to see if the animals scored any
differently 23 hours after exposure to marijuana than they had
before receiving the drug. &quot;On that test,&quot; Paule said,
&quot;their performance was unaffected.&quot; </p>

<p>The test of motivation, however, showed a definite pattern of
change. This test required the monkeys to put forth an increasing
amount of effort to get food. Since a decrease in motivation or
&quot;work ethic&quot; has been described as one of the effects
of smoking marijuana, the researchers wanted to see &quot;how
much effort the monkeys were willing to put out,&quot; as
compared to the nonsmoking control group. </p>

<p>Their paychecks were banana-flavored food pellets. For the
first pellet, the monkeys had only to depress a lever once. They
had to hit it twice to get the second pellet. And for a third
pellet, they had to pump the lever three times. </p>

<p>Here, the group exposed to THC showed a clear unwillingness to
get worked up about work. Paule pointed out that during the year
the test was being conducted, the monkeys were passing from
adolescence into adulthood, a time for them, as for humans, he
said, when &quot;the work ethic normally goes way up.&quot; </p>

<p>But that improvement didn't show up in the marijuana-smokers.
While the nonsmoking monkeys showed a willingness to work harder
and harder as the year progressed, the marijuana groups stayed at
adolescent levels. </p>

<p>&quot;Our interpretation of this is that marijuana smoking in
monkeys does produce something akin to an amotivational
syndrome,&quot; Paule said. He added, however, that the
phenomenon may have occurred precisely because the monkeys were
at the critical and deliberately chosen stage of adolescence when
the NCTR test was conducted. </p>

<p>Because marijuana use is high among teenagers, depressed
motivation at that stage in life can have serious effects. But
marijuana may not have the same effect on adults. </p>

<p>&quot;We did a search of the literature,&quot; Paule said,
&quot;and we found that those studies that tried to find
amotivational syndrome in adults could not find one. It only
appears in adolescence. Chances are, if we'd done these studies
in adults, we wouldn't have seen this effect. And the good news
is that, even among adolescents, when the exposure to marijuana
was stopped, their motivation jumped right back up to normal
levels.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It took two to three months for them to recover to full
values, but they did recover and they recovered fully.&quot; </p>

<p>Paule noted two other findings related to the motivational
test. One was that the willingness to work appeared to be equally
affected in both the daily and weekend smokers. &quot;That
totally surprised us,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Another finding worthy of note was that, as in most areas of
life, one monkey proved to be an exception. As Paule put it, he
seemed to go &quot;blooey&quot; under the influence of marijuana.
</p>

<p>&quot;Unlike the others, we found that this one particular
animal was severely disrupted by chronic marijuana exposure on
the discrimination task. And he never recovered full from the
amotivational syndrome. We have no understanding of why.
Everything else about him tested normal.&quot; </p>

<p>That one monkey represents a warning. As Paule cautioned,
&quot;There appears to be tremendous individual variation in
susceptibility to marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>Also of interest in the NCTR study, in light of U.S. criminal
sanctions against marijuana, is the researchers' observation that
the animals exposed to marijuana never posed a threat to their
handlers. </p>

<p>&quot;I've never seen anything that suggests marijuana is
responsible for an increase in any violent behavior,&quot; Paule
said, adding, &quot;I would say that the perceived risk to
marijuana is probably overstated.&quot; </p>

<p>That's the scientist speaking. Here's the father. Asked what
he would tell his 9-year-old son about the risks of smoking
marijuana, this was Paule's answer: &quot;I'd tell him he
probably shouldn't smoke dope before he becomes an adult.&quot; </p>

<p>POT RESEARCH LID ABOUT TO BLOW OPEN </p>

<p>Dr. Don McMillan, chairman of the Department of Pharmacology
at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, is also the
school's Wilbur D. Mills professor of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse
Prevention. He led a major study into human tolerance of
marijuana in the early part of his career, and more recently
served as an advisor to the researchers at NCTR in planning of
their study of marijuana's effects on monkeys. </p>

<p>After years during which he said marijuana research was
&quot;stalled,&quot; McMillan is once again excited about
developments in the field. </p>

<p>&quot;It looks like the whole lid on marijuana research is
about to blow wide open,&quot; he said in a recent interview.
&quot;I think we're going to know a tremendous amount more about
the mechanism of action and how it works on the brain in the next
two years.&quot; </p>

<p>As marijuana is studied further, its effects, especially
relative to other, legal drugs, will also become better
understood. For example, marijuana is ranked with heroin and LSD
as a Schedule I drug. The federal government rates its potential
for abuse higher than the risk of abusing cocaine, morphine, PCP,
or methadone. </p>

<p>Asked about that, McMillan said, &quot;The thing you have to
remember is that that schedule is a legal classification, not a
medical one.&quot; </p>

<p>He said the medical understanding of marijuana is that it
poses a lower risk to society and individual health than that of
two legal drugs -- alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p>&quot;Marijuana is probably less harmful than either of those
-- but of course, there's still a lot we don't know about
it.&quot; </p>

<h1>The Legalization Of Marijuana: Part I </h1>

<p>Ole Miss Is The Center For Growing </p>

<p>Legal Marijuana In The U.S. </p>

<p>by </p>

<p>Dennis M. Yates </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>Every person in the United States has heard of the illicit
substance called marijuana. Yet, unknown to most people, there is
one place in the United States where marijuana is grown legally.
That place is the Medicinal Plant Garden, right here at the
University of Mississippi. </p>

<p>The Medicinal Plant Garden, a part of the Research Institute
of Pharmaceutical Sciences (RIPS) is part of the Marijuana Plant
Facility The garden is over 20 years old, but the laboratory was
created only four years ago. </p>

<p>According to Dr. Mahmoud Elsohly, research scientist for RIPS,
the laboratory of the Medicinal Plant Facility is used to study
various applications of marijuana. For example, the scientists
grow marijuana to test its physical makeup, analyze marijuana
confiscated by the DEA, law enforcement agencies, and various
narcotics groups, to find the potency ratings of the drugs, and
extract THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) from plants they
harvested. </p>

<p>One project that the Medicinal Plant Facility is currently
working on is a medicine made from THC for use in a suppository
form to replace Marinol, a capsule made of 95 percent THC and
used for nausea and vomiting problems in cancer patients as well
as fighting the wasting sickness, or anorexia-cachexia, suffered
by 70 to 90 percent of AIDS patients. </p>

<p>Another practice done by the lab is to send marijuana to the
Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina for use in the
Compassionate IND program. This program gives marijuana to people
who use it to allieviate symptoms of their diseases, such as
glaucoma, cancer, and AIDS victims. However, there are only a
small handfull (about eight people) receiving the marijuana, out
of several thousand who have applied. </p>

<p>Marijuana has been used by many cultures for various ailments.
Israeli scientists, for example, found the skeleton of a fourth
century woman who they believed died in childbirth. Ashes nearby
were found to be the burned remains of the cannabis, or
marijuana, plant. The scientists say this suggests that ancient
Middle Eastern women used inhaled marijuana smoke to reduce labor
pains. </p>

<p>These days, the medical profession have found several
applications for the marijuana plant. In medicine, THC (the
active ingredient in marijuana) has been found again and again to
help patients battling the life-threatening diseases of cancer
and AIDS to fight the intense nausea that causes their wasting
sickness. Marijuana also helps glaucoma (an eye disease that
causes blindness) victims by reducing the interocular pressure.
It reduces, sometimes eliminating altogether, the seizures of
epileptic patients, along with reducing nerve disorders of
multiple sclerosis patients. As a final interesting note, a
recent discovery by a South Florida doctor concerns the fact that
if THC is placed in a test tube with the herpes virus, the THC
will kill the herpes virus. </p>

<h2>The Legalization Of Marijuana: Part II </h2>

<p>Many Opposed, But Some Support </p>

<p>Making Marijuana A Legal Crop </p>

<p>by </p>

<p>Dennis M. Yates </p>

<p>On April 6, 1995, ABC News ran a special titled
&quot;America's War On Drugs: Searching For Solutions&quot; in
which an alternative to the currently failing War On Drugs was
given: legalization. It showed the American public a new way to
look at the situation. New for most of America, at least. Several
people have been saying for years that marijuana should be a
legal crop and that possession should no more be a crime than
alcohol. </p>

<p>Take for example the case of Judge James P. Gray, a California
state superior court judge with what most people would consider
conservative views. His proposal to legalize marijuana, along
with heroin and cocaine, has generally been well received from
the people that have heard him speak on the subject. In an
interview, Gray recalled one person in particular. </p>

<p>&quot;I got one letter recently from a man who started out
disagreeing with me but by the time he finished his letter he was
volunteering to go out and speak publicly in favor of
legalization. He basically convinced himself just by going over
it.&quot; </p>

<p>Several other people, both famous and not, agree that
legalization is an answer that deserves consideration. The Board
of Directors of NORML (the National Organization to Reform
Marijuana Laws) reads like a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of science.
The board consists of Dr. Kary Mullis, winner of the 1993 Nobel
Prize in chemistry; Dr. Lester Grinspoon, Harvard Medical School
professor and author of Marijuana: The Forbidden Medicine; Dr.
Louis Lasagna, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences
committee that studied marijuana and dean of the Sackler School
of Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University; Ann Druyan, secretary
of the Federation of Scientists and, along with husband Carl
Sagan, co-producer of the PBS series Cosmos; Dr. John Morgan,
author of the drug abuse section in the Merck Manual of Diagnosis
and Therapy; David Boaz of the Cato Institute; Dr. Barbara
Ehrenreich, columnist for The Guardian in London and essayist for
Time; Richard Evans, Esq.; New York State Senator Joseph Galiber;
Dr. Dale Gieringer of the California NORML chapter; Dr. Ansley
Hamid of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice; Dr. John
Morgan from the City University of New York Medical School; Dan
Viets, Esq., of the Missouri NORML chapter; Dr. Lynn Zimmerman of
Queens College; and Keith Stroup, Esq., founder of NORML. </p>

<p>Three other people who feel marijuana should be legalized are
Robert Randall from Washington and Kenny and Barbra Jenks of
Panama City, Florida. All three receive marijuana cigarettes from
the medical marijuana fields right here in Oxford, Mississippi.
For Randall, the marijuana keeps his glaucoma, a degenerative eye
disease that is the leading cause of blindness, at bay, something
conventional medications failed to do. In 1988, the Jenkses began
AZT treatment for AIDS, a treatment that causes extreme nausea in
its users. It caused Barbra to lose 40 pounds within a month,
one-third of her body weight. With marijuana, the nausea both
suffered from disappeared. </p>

<p>Another person suggesting legalization comes from the Drug
Enforcement Agency's own organization. Francis L. Young,
administrative judge for the DEA, recommended that marijuana be
moved from a Schedule I substance (no therapeudic uses) to
Schedule II (a useful drug that can be prescribed by a doctor).
In his report, he stated that &quot;In layman's terms...in order
to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000
to 40,000 times as much cannabis as is contained in one marijuana
cigarette... A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly
1,500 pounds of cannabis to induce a lethal response...&quot; and
concluded with &quot;The administrative law judge recommends that
the Administrator conclude that the cannabis plant considered as
a whole has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the
United States, that there is no lack of accepted safety for use
of it under medical supervision and that it may be lawfully be
transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II.&quot; Unfortunately,
in docket number 90-1020 in April 1991, the DEA made their
position clear: &quot;The DEA Administrator exercised with a
vengeance his prerogative to reject the recommended
decision.&quot; </p>

<h2>The Legalization Of Marijuana: Part III </h2>

<p>When Prosecuted, Violators </p>

<p>Face Harsh Penalties </p>

<p>by </p>

<p>Dennis M. Yates </p>

<p>There is one overriding danger to today's average marijuana
consumer. It isn't brain damage, it isn't lung cancer, it isn't
going crazy and shooting every thing that moves. No, the largest
danger is the fact that, if they are caught, they will be
arrested. </p>

<p>Marijuana is illegal for one simple reason: marijuana is
illegal. Currently, it is considered by many health officials to
be one of the safest therapudic substances known to man. In a
nationwide survey of cancer therapists, 50 percent of them said
they would prescribe marijuana if it were legal, while 44 percent
admitted they did recommend marijuana to patients. Francis L.
Young, the administrative judge for the Drug Enforcement Agency,
said &quot;Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest
therapeudically active substances known to man.&quot; </p>

<p>Mississippi is a state that has decriminalized marijuana
possession, meaning that a first offense for possession for
personal useage cannot include prison time or a criminal record.
Instead, it is treated much like a traffic violation. For
possession of marijuana with a total weight of less than or equal
to an ounce, the fine is $100 to $250. From one ounce up to a
kilogram, however, the fine goes to $1,000 and jail time for a
year can be served. A kilogram or over can give the possessor up
to 20 years and a fine from $1,000 to $1,000,000. For sale or
delivery of less than one ounce of marijuana, the criminal can be
jailed for up to three years and face fines for $3,000. For
amounts greater than or equal to an ounce, the jail time jumps to
up to 20 years and the fines to $30,000. </p>

<p>Amounts greater than or equal to a kilogram entail jail time
for up to 30 years and fines from $100,000 to $1,000,000. If the
possessor has over ten pounds, the punishment is life in prison
without parole. In addition, the punishment for any sale to a
minor and sale within 1,500 feet of a school will both double the
punishment. </p>

<p>The federal laws on marijuana possession are even more harsh.
Possession of any amount has a fine of $10,000 and a possible one
year prison term. Growing, delivering or selling less than 100
kilograms has a fine of $1,000,000 and up to 20 years in prison,
whereas 100 kilograms or more has a fine of up to $2,000,000 and
a prison term from 5 to 20 years. Over 1,000 kilograms, the fine
becomes $10,000,000 and the prison term jumps to 10 years to
life. Distribution within 1,000 feet of a playground or school
(including public or private colleges or sales to minors) or
within 100 feet of a youth center, public pool, or video arcade,
the penalty doubles with a mandatory minimum of one year in
prison unless the amount is under five grams. </p>

<p>A relatively new practice that flew across the U.S. within the
past few years are what are known as the forfeiture laws. These
rules allow law enforcement to confiscate items from a
marijuana-user's possession if there is a belief the item in
question was bought with &quot;drug money,&quot; money gained
from illegal drug trades. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, many people are frightened from possible abuses
from the forfeiture laws. For example, in Ventura County,
California, District Attorney Michael D. Bradford released a
document titled &quot;Report on the Death of Donald Scott,&quot;
which claimed that Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Gary R.
Spenser filed a false affidavit to receive a search warrant to
the 200-acre ranch of Donald Scott. In the raid following
issuance of the search warrant, Spenser shot the 61-year-old
Scott twice, killing him. The report concluded &quot;Based in
part upon the possibility of forfeiture, Spencer obtained a
search warrant that was not supported by probable cause. This
search warrant became Donald Scott's death warrant.&quot; When
Bradbury was interviewed by ABC's 20/20 and asked if the lure of
revenue gained by the forfeiture laws were corrupting law
enforcement officials, Bradbury said &quot;In my opinion,
yes.&quot; </p>

<p>Another problem with the current marijuana laws is prison
overcrowding. According to the Federal Bureau of Justice
statistics, 59,000 inmates were added to the already overcrowded
prisons in 1992 to a record 833,600 inmates nationwide. This is a
greater than 160 percent increase since 1982 and is mostly
attributed to drug violators. </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Much of the scientific research which purports to show toxic
effects from marijuana has come from one man, Dr. Gabriel Nahas.
Dr. Nahas' research over the years has shown a number of bad
effects, such suppression of the immune system, and various other
toxic effects. </p>

<p>Dr. Nahas, however, is not without his critics. The following
is an abstract of a review of some of Dr. Nahas' work which
appeared in Drug and Alcohol Review. </p>

<p><b>Abstract</b> </p>

<p>A review entitled &quot;The human toxicity of marijuana&quot;
was published in 1992 in the Medical Journal of Australia. The
authors claimed that the adverse effects of cannabis use have
been trivialised and that the effects are much more serious than
earlier reported. We have made a careful study of this review and
examined the claims made. We compared the claims of the authors
with the information contained in the documents they cited and
found that at least 28 of the 35 citations in this article were
cited inaccurately. </p>

<p>Five of these publications were misquoted,or the findings of
the study were not fully reported. Twenty-three citations
contained other errors, leaving only six to eight (two citations
could not be traced because of their obscurity) accurate
citations among the 35. All of these inaccuracies operated in the
direction of finding an adverse effect of marijuana. </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>It is not a pleasant task to make an open criticism of a paper
by colleagues, but we feel compelled to do so in the case of a
paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1992.. .

<h1>MARIJUANA AND THE HUMAN BODY </h1>

<p><b>The Common Sense Series</b> </p>

<p><b>a publication of the National Organization</b> <b>for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The moderate use of marijuana is neither harmless nor
devastating to the user. Unfortunately, the politics of marijuana
has distorted research findings and made it difficult to find out
the truth about marijuana's effect on human health. NORML
believes that honest, verifiable information is the most
effective tool to prevent the abuse of marijuana. This text
examines the effects of marijuana on the human body, as described
by a comprehensive report prepared for the Federal government by
the most respected scientific body in the United States, the
National Academy of Sciences. This text first examines some of
the exaggerated claims made about marijuana and then provides the
truth about marijuana's effects on human health. </p>

<p><b>EXAGGERATED CLAIMS ABOUT MARIJUANA</b> </p>

<p>Despite evidence to the contrary, many individuals and
organizations maintain that marijuana is an extremely dangerous
drug. For example, the National Federation of Parents for Drug
Free Youth attempts to reach its societal and legislative goals
by making the following claims: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Marijuana is a harmful substance because it has 421
        chemicals. </li>
    <li>Marijuana is stronger than it was 10 years ago, and this
        new, potent marijuana presents dangers unrecognized years
        ago. </li>
    <li>Marijuana is far worse for the lungs than tobacco. </li>
    <li>Marijuana causes damage to the reproductive system. </li>
    <li>The psychoactive chemicals in marijuana are fat soluble
        and stay in the human body for a month, increasing the
        danger of exposure. </li>
    <li>Marijuana causes brain damage and a behavioral disorder
        known as amotivational syndrome. </li>
    <li>Any use of marijuana is abuse, and marijuana has no
        medical value whatsoever. </li>
</ol>

<p>The National Federation of Parents supports prohibition of
marijuana because it believes that marijuana is so dangerous that
no one can use it safely. According to the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, which supports the NFP, many parents welcomed
discovery of reports suggesting marijuana's harmfulness because
the claims reinforced their own instincts about marijuana. </p>

<p>In fact, the reports used to justify the above claims have
been found to be inconclusive by other researchers. Hence,
warnings intended to dramatize the supposed ill-effects of
marijuana are often couched with phrases like &quot;marijuana
can...&quot;. &quot;Marijuana may...&quot;, or &quot;If the
experts are right...&quot;. </p>

<p><b>THE TRUTH ABOUT MARIJUANA</b> </p>

<p>The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences
conducted a 15-month study of the health-related effects of
marijuana in 1982. They appointed a 22-member committee to
analyze existing scientific evidence bearing on the possible
hazards to the health and safety of users of marijuana. </p>

<p>The report concludes: &quot;the scientific evidence published
to date indicates that marijuana has a broad range of
psychological and biological effects, some of which, at least
under certain circumstances, are harmful to human health&quot;. </p>

<p>In a companion report providing policy recommendations to the
Academy's National Research Council, regulation of the marijuana
market is advocated as the most effective method of controlling
marijuana. The National Academy of Science's report rebuts many
of the exaggerated claims made about marijuana. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Of the 421 chemicals in marijuana, only 61 are unique to
        marijuana. The chemicals are known as cannabinoids. One
        of them, delta-9 THC, produces the psychoactive effect
        and is the focus of most research. The other 360
        chemicals in the marijuana plant are found throughout
        other natural substances. </li>
    <li>The higher potency marijuana grown in the United States
        represents about half of all the marijuana consumed here.
        Because of it's higher potency many smokers use far less
        of it than less potent marijuana. </li>
    <li>Differences in dosage and frequency of consumption render
        comparisons between marijuana and tobacco consumption
        invalid, despite similarity in the composition of their
        smoke. Marijuana smoke irritates the lungs. Heavy
        exposure of the lungs to irritation such as smoke
        increases the likelihood of lung cancer and other lung
        problems. Marijuana speeds the heartbeat and is unhealthy
        for people with high blood pressure or other
        cardiovascular ailments. </li>
    <li>Marijuana does reduce the sperm count and obstruct sperm
        mobility in males within the normal range. These
        side-effects do not seem to affect human fertility, and
        are completely reversible thirty days after cessation of
        use. Marijuana, like other drugs, crosses the placenta.
        While the effects of this are unknown and there is no
        evidence that marijuana causes chromosome damage, we
        advise women to avoid the use of marijuana, tobacco,
        alcohol, or other drugs not prescribed by their physician
        during pregnancy and nursing. </li>
    <li>The intoxicating chemical, THC, is broken down by the
        human metabolism after two or three hours in the body.
        The by-products of this chemical breakdown are referred
        to as metabolites. These metabolites are fat soluble, and
        take 21-30 days to leave the human body via the urine.
        These metabolites exert no psychoactive effect on the
        human body. </li>
    <li>After reviewing all of the evidence, the Academy
        concluded: &quot;There is not yet any conclusive evidence
        as to whether prolonged use of marijuana causes permanent
        changes in the nervous system or sustained impairment of
        brain function and behavior in human beings&quot;.
        &quot;Interpretation of the evidence linking marijuana to
        'amotivational syndrome' is difficult. Such symptoms have
        been known to occur in the absence of marijuana. Even if
        there is an association between this syndrome and the use
        of marijuana, that does not prove that marijuana causes
        the syndrome. Many troubled individuals seek an 'escape'
        into use of drugs: thus frequent use of marijuana may
        become one more in a series of conterproductive behaviors
        for these unhappy people&quot;. </li>
    <li>&quot;Cannabis and it's derivatives have shown promise in
        the treatment of a variety of disorders. The evidence is
        most impressive in glaucoma, where their mechanism of
        action appears to be different from standard drugs: in
        asthma.... and in the nausea and vomiting of cancer
        chemotherapy... Similar trials have suggested cannabis
        might also be used in seizures, spasticity, and other
        nervous system disorders&quot;. </li>
</ol>

<p><b>N O R M L ' s V I E W</b> </p>

<p>1. NORML favors discouraging marijuana abuse and is opposed to
adolescent drug use. </p>

<p>2. Exaggerated claims about health hazards lack credibility
and encourage adolescents to try marijuana and other drugs.
Government research which relies on animal studies and studies of
adolescent drug abusers presents a skewed perspective of
marijuana's effects. </p>

<p>3. The illegality of marijuana, because it equates use with
abuse, discourages frank discussion of marijuana's effects on
health within the family and with doctors and nurses. </p>

<p>4. Over 35 million adult Americans use marijuana regularly
because they find it a relatively safe way to relax. A regulated
marijuana market would better protect their health than the
unregulated black market. </p>

<h1>Detecting Marijuana Through Urine Testing </h1>

<p><b>Approximate times for testing positive versus frequency of
use.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>In response to questions referring to the time it takes the
body to cleanse itself from detectable urine traces, according to
a national report titled, &quot;Drugs, Crime, and the Justice
System&quot;, (published from the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice): </p>

<p>Single Use : 3 Days </p>

<p>Moderate Use (4 times a week): 5 Days </p>

<p>Heavy Use (Daily smoking): 10 Days </p>

<p>Chronic Heavy Use: 21-30 Days </p>

<p>Although do keep in mind that there are many factors that
effect the outcome of the tests (potency of drug taken, testing
methods, metabolism, etc.) so this is just a estimate figure-so
be careful out there. </p>

        and alcohol when taken alone and in combination on human
        skills performance and mood. </li>
    <li>Four dosage conditions were employed for each drug
        (placebo and three active doses). All possible
        combinations of these dosage conditions were tested (ie
        16 dosage groups). </li>
    <li>Twenty subjects were used for each dosage group, the
        experiment employing 320 subjects in all. Each subject
        attended the laboratory on one occasion only. </li>
    <li>Data collected were for psychomotor performance using a
        battery of computer-presented tests, mood effects,
        subjective assessments of the nature and degree of
        intoxication, and the subjective assessment of the
        effects of the drugs on driving skills and willingness to
        drive a motor vehicle. </li>
    <li>The performance battery included tests of human skills
        related to those considered necessary to drive a motor
        vehicle with safety. </li>
    <li>The population sample were recruited by advertisements on
        two Sydney &quot;Rock music&quot; FM radio stations. All
        volunteers were non-naive as regards marijuana use and
        were indeed heavy to very heavy users of this drug. The
        extent of alcohol use by the volunteers was considered to
        be within the normal range of use of this drug within the
        community. </li>
    <li>The attitudes expressed concerning the dangers associated
        with the use of the two drugs indicated that the
        population sample was heavily biased against alcohol and
        in favor of marijuana </li>
    <li>The subjective assessment of the doses of each drug
        employed indicated that they were comparable. The
        subjects assessed the degree of intoxication by marijuana
        as being of a similar intensity as that produced by
        alcohol. The doses selected therefore appear to be
        relevant to those used within the social experience of
        the volunteer population </li>
    <li>Both drugs produced significant dose-dependent effects on
        the performance measures, on the intoxication rating
        scales and on some of the mood measures. </li>
    <li>However, there were both quantitative and qualitative
        differences between these effects, both on the
        performance measures and on the subjective mood effects
        of the two drugs. </li>
    <li>By far the major effects on these tests were those
        produced by alcohol. </li>
    <li>The effect on skills performance of alcohol and marijuana
        when taken in combination was essentially one of
        addition. Marijuana tended to increase the intensity of
        the performance impairment produced by alcohol. However
        there was evidence to suggest that the lowest dose of
        marijuana produced a degree of antagonism of the effects
        of alcohol. </li>
    <li>Marijuana had no effect on the absorption or metabolism
        of alcohol. The blood alcohol concentration was not
        affected by any of the doses of marijuana used. </li>
    <li>The results of this study indicate clearly that alcohol
        and marijuana are distinctly different drugs. The effects
        produced on the performance measures were qualitatively
        and quantitatively different. In addition, the
        differences in the nature of the drug-induced subjective
        intoxication and the self-reported changes in mood
        effects such as anxiety and alertness, strongly suggested
        different drug actions. </li>
    <li>The ability to discriminate and assess the degree of
        intoxication with alcohol was not affected by marijuana.
        However, the ability to assess the intoxication due to
        marijuana was greatly affected by alcohol. The subjective
        intoxication produced by marijuana appears to be of a
        more subtle nature than that produced by alcohol. </li>
    <li>Evidence is presented which suggests that under the
        influence of alcohol, subjects engage in a
        &quot;speed-accuracy trade-off&quot;. They are prepared
        to make a hasty response to a question rather than to
        spend more time to ensure a correct answer. This effect
        could be related to a risk-taking behaviour. The results
        with marijuana on the other hand suggested a slower and
        more careful approach to the problem, though as with
        alcohol, an increased error rate in responses was
        recorded. </li>
    <li>Evidence is presented which suggests that marijuana
        produces periodic attentional lapses. </li>
    <li>The results strongly suggest that the performance
        deficits and mood changes produced by alcohol are of a
        greater magnitude than those produced by marijuana. </li>
    <li>Recommendations for directions of further research are
        made. </li>

<h1>MARIJUANA (CANNABIS) FACT SHEET </h1>

<h3>ISSUES STUDY COMMITTEE OF THE BRUIN HUMANIST FORUM </h3>

<p>Copyrighted by the Bruin Humanist Forum 1967 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marijuana is not a narcotic. Although California law calls it
a narcotic, it is pharmacologically distinct from the family of
opium derivatives and synthetic narcotics. (Wolstenholme, 1965;
Watt, 1965; Garattini, 1965; 1 Crim 5351 Calif. District Court of
Appeal, 1st Appel. Dist.) </p>

<p>Marijuana is not addicting. The use does not develop any
physical dependence (see below). (Mayor's Committee on Marihuana,
New York City, 1944; Allentuck &amp; Bowman, 1942; Freedman &amp;
Rockmore, 1946; Fort, 1965a, 1965b; Panama Canal Zone Governor's
Committee, 1933; Phalen, 1943; Indian Hemp-Drug Commission, 1894;
Watt, 1965; I Crim 5351 Calif. District Court of Appeal, 1st
Appel. Dist.; United Nations, 1964a, 1964b) </p>

<p>In a small percentage of individuals, a &quot;psychological
dependence&quot; can develop, but a predisposition must be
present. In his paper, &quot;Dependence of the Hashish
Type,&quot; Watt (1965, p. 65) concludes: The habit is gregarious
and is easily abandoned. Personality defect and incipient or
existing psychotic disorder are the essential factors underlying
the formation of the habit. </p>

<p>Marijuana is not detrimental to the user's health. Even when
used over long periods of time, it does not appear to cause
physical or psychological impairment. (Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana, New York City, 1944; Freedman &amp; Rockmore, 1946;
Fort, 1965a, 1965b; Panama Canal Zone Governor's Committee, 1933;
Phalen, 1943; Indian Hemp-Drug Commission, 1894; Becker, 1963) </p>

<p>Marijuana does not tend to release &quot;aggressive
behavior.&quot; On the contrary, its use inhibits aggressive
behavior; it acts as a &quot;tranquilizer.&quot; (Mayor's
Committee on Marihuana, New York City, 1944; Fort, 1965a, 1965b;
Panama Canal Zone Governor's Committee, 1933; Phalen, 1943;
Garattini, 1965) Marijuana does not &quot;lead to&quot; or
&quot;promote&quot; the use of addicting drugs.
&quot;Ninety-eight percent of heroin users started by smoking
tobacco and drinking alcohol firsts&quot; (Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana, New York City, 1944; Fort, 1965a, 1965b; Panama Canal
Zone Governor's Committee, 1933; Phalen, 1943; Garattini, 1965)
Marijuana comes from the Indian hemp plant, which was formerly
grown widely in the United States for the making of rope, and
which still grows wild in many areas. Up until a few years ago it
was a main ingredient in commercial bird-seed. Leaves and
flowering tops provide the cannabis (commonly known in the
Western Hemisphere as marijuana, grass, or pot); the resin and
pollen, in which the active ingredients are highly concentrated,
are the source of &quot;hashish.&quot; (Wolstenholme, 1965) </p>

<p>The effects of smoking marijuana have been described as
follows: &quot;euphoria, reduction of fatigue, and relief of
tension . . . [It will] also increase appetite, distort the time
sense, increase self-confidence, and, like alcohol, can relax
some inhibitions.&quot; (Fort, 1965) A heightened awareness of
color and of esthetic beauty, and the production of rich and
novel mental associations are also commonly reported effects.
Some users report that the marijuana experience is
&quot;psychedelic&quot;: can result in heightened awareness, or
in a consciousness-expanding change in perspective, ideas about
the self, life, etc. Marijuana is not, however, like LSD---a very
powerful psychedelic. Whereas LSD drastically alters thoughts and
perspective, often &quot;jarring&quot; the user into heightened
awareness, marijuana &quot;suggests&quot; or points the way to a
moderately deepened awareness. The user is free to follow these
potentials or not, as they present themselves. (Mayor's Committee
on Marihuana, New York City, 1944; Fort, 1965a, 1965b ; Panama
Canal Zone Governor's Committee, 1933; Goldstein, 1966; Becker,
1963; De Ropp, 1957; Indian Hemp-Drug Commission, 1894)
Pharmacological studies of marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol
(the major active ingredient) are as yet inconclusive, both
because of insufficient research and because of the subtlety and
complexity of its effect on the human mind. Garattini (1965)
tested maze-learning in rats and found that marijuana caused no
change or very slight impairment; Carlini and Kramer (1965) found
that maze-learning was significantly improved by an injection of
a marijuana extract. Multiple active ingredients are present in
the marijuana plant, and these could vary in concentration (e.g.,
one of the components is sedative, and another is
euphoric/psychedelic). (Wolstenholme, 1965; Watt, 1965; Carlini
&amp; Kramer, 1965) </p>

<p>As with other psychedelics, the effects of marijuana depend in
part on how one interprets, uses, and learns to develop them. As
pointed out by many researchers in the area of
philosophical/psychological effects, the environment
(&quot;setting&quot;) is of great importance. Many people have no
effects whatever the first time they smoke a marijuana cigarette,
but do the second or third time---and thereafter. Everyone has to
learn the effects before he can use them to his own benefit.
(Becker, 1963; Fort, 1965a, 1965b; Indian Hemp-Drug Commission,
1894) </p>

<p>Some years ago it was estimated that marijuana users numbered
&quot;several hundred thousand people in the United States,
including many from the middle-class.&quot; (Fort, 1965a, 1965b)
During the 1960's, however, there has been a rapid increase in
the use of marijuana, particularly among &quot;respectable&quot;
people: those in the professions, non-bohemian high school and
college students, artists, writers, intellectuals, etc. One
report on campus use (Goldstein, 1966) estimates that
approximately 15% of college students have used or are using
marijuana, with the percentage at some large, metropolitan
campuses as high as 30-60%. This same report also held that
marijuana use is now becoming &quot;respectable,&quot; and
indulged in by members of student government, campus groups, and
fraternities and sororities. (Fort,1965a, 1965b; Irwin, 1966;
Goldstein, 1966) </p>

<p>Marijuana smoking does not constitute a social hazard. Four
separate official studies have been conducted on this question,
as a part of a larger study: New York City Mayor's Committee in
1944; a committee of the health department of the U. S. Army;
another U. S. Army committee, concerned with discipline effects;
and a very thorough study by a committee established by the
British Government to study the effects in India where it is-and
was-in as widespread use as is alcohol here. All of these studies
came to the conclusion: marijuana is not damaging to the user or
to society, and therefore should not be outlawed. Political and
economic pressures prevented authorities in New York from
carrying out the recommendations of the Mayor's Committee---the
greatest part of the political pressure from Harry J. Anslinger,
former U. S. Commissioner of Narcotics. (Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana, New York City, 1944; Panama Canal Zone Governor's
Committee, 1933; Phalen, 1943 ; Indian Hemp-Drug Commission,
1894) </p>

<p>On the grounds that marijuana is safer and more beneficial
than tobacco or alcohol (both of which are physically toxic; both
of which are addicting), and that there is no basis for
legalizing these two dangerous drugs while outlawing one which is
not dangerous, attorneys are challenging the present laws. In the
wording of one such legal brief: &quot;The appellant contends
that the classification of marijuana as a narcotic in Section
1101 (d) of Health and Safety Code and the marijuana prohibition
law is based upon an arbitrary and unreasonable classification
having no reasonable relation to the public health, safety,
welfare, and morals.... The classification of marijuana as a
narcotic is unconstitutional and void in violation of the Eighth
Amendment provision against cruel and unusual punishment, and the
Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States.&quot; (1 Crim 5351 Calif.
District Court of Appeal, First Appel. Dist., pp. 61-62 and
Appendix 1, p. 6) </p>

<p>Among the authorities favoring legalization of marijuana,
there have been medical doctors, lawyers, psychologists,
sociologists, and even some religious leaders. Bishop Pike, for
example, supports re-legalization. <i>Lancet</i> (1963), the
British journal of medicine, in an editorial in 1963, found no
good reason for marijuana being prohibited, but good reason why
it should be legal. (Irwin, 1966) </p>

<p>Many authorities, however, remain opposed to the
re-legalization of marijuana. Predominantly, these are law
enforcement&quot; authorities, or politicians (e.g., Attorney
General Lynch of California). Although these authorities rarely
give verifiable reasons for their insistence that marijuana be
illegal, the ones which have been offered prove to be either
unsubstantiated &quot;opinions&quot; or out-and-out mistaken
data. In this same area, there was a time when
law-breakers---taking their cue from the law-enforcement
officials---claimed marijuana use as an excuse for their crimes.
The fiction of a marijuana-crime relationship has been thoroughly
detailed (if there is any correlation at all, it is in a negative
direction---crimes of violence are drastically lower than would
be statistically expected among marijuana users). (Fort, 1965a,
1965b; Phalen, 1943; Anslinger, 1932; 1 Crim 5351 Calif. District
Court of Appeal, First Appel. Dist.; Irwin, 1966; Blum &amp;
Wahl, 1965; Boyko, Rotberg, &amp; Disco, 1967; Laurie, 1967) See
also below, pages 337 and 339. </p>

<p>Harry J. Anslinger, not one to be daunted by mere facts,
included the following comments---both of which are in diametric
contradiction to statements by him before committees of the U. S.
Congress: &quot;The section noting that many criminals coming
before the courts who allege that they were under the influence
of marijuana when a crime was committed, and that this defense is
usually without foundation and is used with the idea of obtaining
lenient treatment by the courts, recommends that a defense of
being under the influence of marijuana during the commission of a
crime should not mitigate the penalty for a criminal act.&quot;
(Anslinger, 1932) &quot;The Narcotic Section recognizes the great
danger of marijuana due to its definite impairment of the mental
and the fact that its continuous use leads direct [sic] to the
insane asylum.&quot; Even without the aid of Anslinger, arguments
opposed to free marijuana use are contradictory, confused, and
grossly innocent of verifiable facts. (Fort, 1965a, 1965b;
Phalen, 1943; Anslinger, 1932; 1 Crim 5351 Calif. District Court
of Appeal, First Appel. Dist.; Irwin, 1966; Blum &amp; Wahl,
1965; <i>Washington Bulletin</i>, 1963) In a study of police
attitudes and reasoning on &quot;drugs,&quot; Blum and Wahl
(1965) found much disagreement as to reasons why marijuana should
be suppressed. Some officers simply felt that, although marijuana
was less dangerous than alcohol, society (and the law)
disapproved of marijuana. Reasons given for suppressing marijuana
ran from claims that it caused criminal behavior [which is, ex
post facto, correct-so long as marijuana use is
&quot;criminal&quot;], to the claim that it is more dangerous
than alcohol because it isn't as disruptive of behavior and is
therefore harder to detect. </p>

<p>Many &quot;expert&quot; groups such as WHO Expert Committee on
Addiction Producing Drugs have tended to perpetuate
misinformation on marijuana because of poor data [Anslinger was
the U.S. spokesman for many, many years at the U.N.], and a
conservative reluctance toward &quot;softening&quot; or changing
previous policies. In the last few years, however, the World
Health Organization has progressively modified its view on
marijuana. In 1964 the Expert Committee proposed revised
definitions of types of drug dependence, which were subsequently
adopted. The new definition of &quot;dependence of the Cannabis
type&quot; was as follows: &quot;(1) a desire (or need) for
repeated administrations of the drug on account of its subjective
effects, including the feeling of enhanced capabilities; (2)
little or no tendency to increase the dose, since there is little
or no development of tolerance; (3) a psychic dependence on the
effects of the drug related to subjective and individual
appreciation of those effects; (4) absence of physical dependence
so that there is no definite and characteristic abstinence
syndrome when the drug is discontinued.&quot; (United Nations,
1964b) The Committee actually is saying that there is no reason
to keep marijuana on its list: Its definition of dependence of
the marijuana type would easily satisfy for a definition of
&quot;liking&quot; (i.e., the natural tendency to repeat a
pleasant and rewarding, non-harmful experience). Actual
dependence on marijuana is extremely rare, and depends entirely
on a pre- existing psychological problem-and even this is not
&quot;addicting.&quot; [See above, p. 333] (Watt, 1965; United
Nations, 1964b) </p>

<p>As has been noted by many researchers, scientific as well as
governmental groups which have seriously investigated the effects
of marijuana on the individual and on society have consistently
refused to condemn it or support legislation aimed at suppressing
it; law enforcement-oriented groups, on the other hand, including
the Narcotics Experts, are very slow indeed to admit any of this
evidence into the debate. In spite of this, the Proceedings of
the White House Conference on Narcotic and Drug Abuse, 27-28
September I962, states: &quot;It is the opinion of the Panel that
the hazards of marijuana per se have been exaggerated, and the
long criminal sentences imposed on an occasional user or
possessor of the drug are in poor social perspective. Although
marijuana has long held the reputation of inciting individuals to
commit sexual offenses and other antisocial acts, the evidence is
inadequate to substantiate this. Tolerance and physical
dependence do not develop, and withdrawal does not produce an
abstinence syndrome.&quot; (United Nations, 1965; United States,
1963) </p>

<p>The following, from an editorial in the <i>Washington Bulletin</i>,
is given here both for the illuminating facts uncovered, and as
an example of the more modem approach to the &quot;problem&quot;
of marijuana. &quot;Seventy years of institutional documentation
indicate that this vision [of marijuana's &quot;dangers&quot;]
was a big American fib. Latest such document is the New York
County Medical Society Narcotics Sub-committee Report of May 5,
1966: 'There is no evidence that marijuana use is associated with
crimes of violence in the United States . . . marijuana is not a
narcotic, nor is it addicting . . . New York State should take
the lead in attempting to mitigate the stringent federal laws in
regard to marijuana possession.' Well, everybody knew that 10
years ago. [U.S.] House Marijuana Hearings, Ways and Means
Committee, 1937, page 24, Rep. John Dingall: 'I'm just wondering
whether the marijuana addict [sic] graduates into a heroin, an
opium, or a cocaine user}' Anslinger: 'No sir. I have not heard
of a case of that kind. I think it's an entirely different class.
The marijuana addict [sic] does not go in that direction.'
Nowadays the Narcotics Bureau [headed during this entire period
by Anslinger] propagandizes the idea that marijuana leads
directly to heroin, which is obviously silly, as millions of
college boys can inform their parents. But the Narcotics Bureau
has raised such an unscientific scream on this point that nothing
will suffice to prove the obvious except a giant survey of
comparative statistics showing that millions of pot smokers are
not junkies. When such documents are at hand, timid but
sympathetic medical authorities in key places have declared
themselves ready to move toward legislation, licensing or
reduction of punishment for marijuana possession to the status of
a parking violation.&quot; (<i>Washington Bulletin</i>, I966) </p>

<p>The UCLA Law Review, in March of 1967, published an article on
California's anti-marijuana laws, from which the following is
quoted. &quot;. . . the purpose of this article is to outline the
defects in one area of both federal and state criminal law: the
control of marijuana-specifically, treatment of possession of the
drug, without more, as criminal. The pattern in California,
perhaps more than in any other state, has been one of legislative
intransigence and increasingly harsh penalties for possession and
use of marijuana. The authors take the position that at least a
portion of the existing legislation in California against
marijuana---Health and Safety Code section 11530, imposing
stringent penalties for possession of the drug irrespective of
abuse---is an unwelcome disruption of the delicate balance
between reason and emotion in the state's drug control laws....
Although the United States Supreme Court normally has given the
state legislatures an extended opportunity to clean their own
houses, judicial finger-tapping where marijuana is concerned has
all the signs of continuing indefinitely. But, unbridled
legislative and police suppression of all uses of marijuana,
together with savage sentences for even the most innocent uses,
might prove to be the source of earlier constitutional review....
The characteristics attributed to marijuana by law enforcement
agencies, legislative reports and the communications media are
markedly different from, or not supported by, available
scientific information.... In this country, the only
comprehensive publication at a local or state level
scientifically describing the effects of marijuana is the
so-called 'LaGuardia Report' . . . reactions which are natively
alien to the individual cannot be induced by the ingestion or
smoking of the drug.... An even more subtle claim, asserted
primarily by law enforcement agencies, is that marijuana is a
'stepping stone' to addictive and disabling drugs. Not only is
the alleged causal relationship unsupported in fact, but even the
California Attorney General's Office has suggested that the
evidence leads to a contrary conclusion.... In addition to the
'stepping stone' thesis, the widely promoted claim that marijuana
use causes crime is also lacking in factual support. The
LaGuardia researchers, in direct conflict with the routine alarms
from law enforcement officials, found that the alleged causal
connection does not exist. . . . Indeed, in several subsequent
studies it has been shown that there is a negative correlation
between crime and the use of marijuana. . . . Unlike 'plain
drunk' reckless driving and drunk driving statutes, protecting
only against the abuses of alcohol, section 11530 [marijuana]
declares a crime even when there is no abuse or victim.
Ironically, although it is unlawful to drive under the influence
of any narcotic or any drug within the separate statutory
classification of 'restricted dangerous drugs' (barbiturates,
amphetamine and LSD), these driving offenses are alternatively
punishable as misdemeanors, and the penalties are less severe
than for possession, without use, of marijuana. And it is only a
misdemeanor to 'use' or 'be under the influence of'
marijuana.&quot; (Boyko et al., 1967) </p>

<p>&quot;These 'new' drugs, however, were neither physically
addicting nor illegal; the dangers were considered moderate. In
fact, this moderate element of danger might have added an
intriguing dimension to the undertaking. The increased use of
marihuana on college campuses appears to have a similar
background with one added factor: the legal penalties are quite
severe, even though, like LSD, the drug is not physically
addicting. Students, therefore, rationalize that it is a 'bad'
law which they are not obligated to obey (an attitude somewhat
similar to the reaction to Prohibition).&quot; (Kleber, 1967) </p>

<p>R. D. Laing, M.D., writing in Sigma (Vol. 6), states: &quot;I
would be far happier if my own teenage children would, <i>without
breaking the law</i>, smoke marijuana when they wished, rather
than start on the road of so many of their elders to nicotine and
ethyl alcohol addiction.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Summary of conclusions regarding effects. The Commission
have now examined all the evidence before them regarding the
effects attributed to hemp drugs. It will be well to summarize
briefly the conclusions to which they come. It has been clearly
established that the occasional use of hemp [marijuana] in
moderate doses may be beneficial; but this use may be regarded as
medicinal in character. It is rather to the popular and common
use of the drugs that the Commission will now confine their
attention. It is convenient to consider the effects separately as
affecting the physical, mental or moral nature. In regard to the
physical effects, the Commission have come to the conclusion that
the moderate use of hemp drugs is practically attended by no evil
results at all. There may be exceptional cases in which, owing to
idiosyncracies of constitution, the drugs in even moderate use
may be injurious. There is probably nothing the use of which may
not possibly be injurious in cases of exceptional intolerance....
In respect to the alleged mental effects of the drugs, the
Commission have come to the conclusion that the moderate use of
hemp drugs produces no injurious effects on the mind.... In
regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the Commission are of
the opinion that their moderate use produces no moral injury
whatever. There is no adequate ground for believing that it
injuriously affects the character of the consumer . . . for all
practical purposes it may be laid down that there is little or no
connection between the use of hemp drugs and crime. Viewing the
subject generally, it may be added that the moderate use of these
drugs is the rule, and that excessive use is comparatively
exceptional.&quot; (Indian Hemp-Drug Commission, 1894) </p>

<p>&quot;The psychic habituation to marihuana is not so strong as
to tobacco or alcohol.... There is no evidence to suggest that
the continued use of marihuana is a stepping stone to the use of
opiates. Prolonged use of the drug does not lead to mental,
physical, or moral degeneration, nor have we observed any
permanent deleterious effects from its continued use.&quot;
(Allentuck &amp; Bowman, 1942) </p>

<p>&quot;There are no apparent reasons for cannabis' status as a
Dangerous Drug. It is not addictive, its use does not in Western
society cause crime or unacceptable sexuality, and it does not
lead to addiction to the hard drugs. The major problem with this
drug is that it is illegal. This has three undesirable effects:
first, an underground, cannabis-using sub- culture is created and
maintained that puts the potential heroin addict one step nearer
access to the hard drugs; second, it lessens respect for D.D.A.
[Dangerous Drug Act] drugs in the thousands of young people who
have tried marihuana or hashish and know from personal experience
how harmless the drug is; third, it causes considerable waste of
man-power, either through creative and educated people being sent
to prison for possession of the drug-a Glasgow doctor was
sentenced to six months recently-or through the use of policemen
who would be better otherwise employed, to track down the drug
and its users.&quot; (Laurie, I967) </p>

<p>&quot;The smoking of the leaves, flowers and seeds of Cannabis
sativa [marijuana] is no more harmful than the smoking of tobacco
or mullein or sumac leaves.... The legislation in relation to
marihuana was ill-advised . . . it branded as a menace and a
crime a matter of trivial importance.... It is hoped that no
witch-hunt will be instituted in the military service over a
problem that does not exist.&quot; (Phalen, 1943) &quot;The
controls over marihuana under federal [law] and state laws are
dissimilar. Under the federal law, marihuana is not considered a
narcotic drug. On the other hand, many states have covered
marihuana by including it within the definition of 'narcotic
drug' since adoption of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act in 1932.
Marihuana is equated in many state laws with the narcotic drugs
because the abuse characteristics [under current laws, all use is
'abuse'] of the two types of drugs, the methods of illicit
trafficking [all exchange of pot is 'illicit'], and the types of
traffickers have a great deal in common.... Because marihuana
does not result in physical dependence, the physician need not
apply himself to physical complications of withdrawal.... No
physical dependence or tolerance has been demonstrated. Neither
has it been demonstrated that cannabis causes any lasting mental
or physical changes.&quot; (A.M.A. Committee on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence, 1967) </p>

<p>&quot;Two of the most common and widely used psychic modifiers
are cannabis and alcohol.... First, marijuana is most often used
in a social setting, in a group of users who mutually enjoy the
effects of the drug. Second, the intent is to heighten enjoyment
of outer experiences, e.g., conversation, listening to or
performing music, dancing, joking. Unlike the Brahman priest,
whose vocabulary during his intoxication is limited to repeating
one of the names of his God, the marijuana devotee laughs,
giggles, eats without restraint, tells jokes, participates in
sexual relationships, and takes pleasure in the company of both
men and women, especially if they are also using marijuana.
Third, the effects are interpreted by a marijuana-user as
analogous to those of alcohol. He prefers marijuana because the
effects are more rapid and 'neater'; there is no hangover, and no
debilitating physical consequences of chronic use. Thus, the use
of cannabis in our society is to attain an experience which, far
from renouncing the active life in favor of contemplative,
ascetic ideal, affirms the pleasures of sex, music, food,
laughter, and human companionship.&quot; (Chein et al., 1964) </p>

<p>&quot;A characteristic marihuana psychosis does not exist.
Marihuana will not produce a psychosis de nova . . .&quot;
&quot;But even excessive marijuana use is less likely to lead to
aggressive or anti-social conduct than immoderate consumption of
alcohol.&quot; (Allentuck &amp; Bowman, 1942; Boyko et al., 1967;
Murphy, 1963) </p>

<p>The following excerpt is from a letter to The Princetonian,
Princeton University, by the Director of Counseling Services at
Princeton. &quot;If and when the severe laws governing marijuana
are to receive the review they probably deserve, this will come
about only after a significant level of public interest and
influential desire has been achieved. . . . In the meantime the
underground tide of illegal use will continue to swell and
'lamentable affairs' [arrests] will occur. In judging the
reasonableness of current laws, and indeed current clandestine
marijuana use, the individual should probe the facts, rather than
merely harbor widespread and misinformed assumptions which often
yield a sort of sociological hysteria whenever the subject is
raised. In the confidential settings of the Counseling Services
and the Health Services, whenever the subject of marijuana is
discussed we are pleased to find that factual information usually
helps clear away much of the undue anxiety stemming from the
popular myths surrounding this subject in our society at-large.
Recognizing the reality of existing laws, and recognizing the
fact that every individual must come to terms with such realities
in his own way, we hope we may find ways to be helpful to
students currently faced with such quandaries.&quot;
(MacNaughton, 1967) <br>

<h2>THE EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA ON CONSCIOUSNESS </h2>

<p>ANONYMOUS </p>

<p>From: <i>Altered States of Consciousness</i>, edited by
Charles T. Tart, Doubleday &amp; Co., 1972, Chapter 22 </p>

<hr>

<p>A marijuana high usually lasts two or three hours, during
which a wide range of effects may occur, varying both in
intensity and quality. The usual, most noticeable effect is
intensification of sensation and increased clarity of perception.
Visually, colors are brighter, scenes have more depth, patterns
are more evident, and figure-ground relations both more distinct
and more easily reversible. Other sense modalities do not have
the variety of visual stimuli, but all seem to be intensified.
Sounds become more distinct, with the user aware of sounds he
otherwise might not have noticed. Music, recorded and live, is
heard with increased fidelity and dimension, as though there were
less distance between the source and the listener. Taste and
smell are also enhanced under marijuana. The spice rack is a
treasure of sensation, and food develops a rich variety of
tastes. </p>

<p>Skin receptors are also effected. Heat, cold, and pressure
receptors become more sensitive. Pain produces paradoxical
effects. If attention is not on the area of pain, there is a
reduced sensitivity to the hurt. But awareness of pain from a
lesion, such as a burn or cut, will often persist for a longer
period than usual, even allowing for the changed perception of
time under marijuana. </p>

<p>Awareness of proprioceptive responses is enhanced. The person
using marijuana may become aware of usually automatic,
non-conscious, muscle tensions, small movements, feedback and
control processes, and feelings of physical comfort and
discomfort. These can be perceived with great clarity and
distinctness. </p>

<p>Such effects vary with the individual and the situation.
Sometimes one modality will predominate; sometimes a sequence of
effects will occur; sometimes nothing will seem to happen. The
direction or modality of effect can be often manipulated by the
individual if he deliberately exposes himself to the stimulus,
such as music, or paintings. However, such setting may not affect
the perception if the person is not otherwise ready to respond in
that way. Effects more often call attention to themselves; the
user observes what he is experiencing in the situation and
realizes it is not how he usually experiences the stimuli. On the
other hand, some sense modalities may function in a straight
pedestrian manner, neither being enhanced nor diminished. </p>

<p>The person himself is the most important determinant of how
the enhancement will appear. Some persons orient primarily to
visual stimuli and visual thinking, others to sound, others to
tactile impressions. Visual orientation seems to predominate
among persons in our culture; audile and tactile thinking is less
common. It seems likely that sensory enhancement of a marijuana
high would be most noticed in the predominate sense modality of
the user; it certainly should have a differential response in
relation to less used ways of perceiving. </p>

<p>Another factor which affects the response is that persons
unfamiliar with the marijuana state frequently must
&quot;learn&quot; that they are perceiving experience in a
different way. That is, someone makes them aware of changed
perception by showing them objects, playing music, and calling
their attention to the difference in sights and sounds. Then they
become consciously aware of the perceptual changes. This
initiation procedure has led sociologist H. S. Becker (Becker,
I963; partially reproduced in Solomon, I966) to suggest that most
of the effects of marijuana are learned, not spontaneous. He says
(accurately, I am sure) that the user must learn to notice the
effects, categorize them, and connect them to the total
experience of using the drug. What is learned in most cases is
not a new way of perceiving, but the awareness of a change in
perception. Few persons observe what they are doing in the sense
of observing their seeing, and it is not surprising that many
should have to learn how to become aware of themselves
experiencing by checking current perception against memory and
expectations. </p>

<p>The user's internal psychological needs will also influence
his response. A fear of being overwhelmed by too much input will
often reduce any changes to only those which the user can cope
with or to changes only in certain modes. A fear of losing
control over the perception of experience may suppress most of
the effects and even shut down responses to below normal. On the
other hand, emotional involvement with some part of the
environment may enhance its perception. Internal physical needs
also affect the response, e.g., hunger may be intensified so the
person finds himself ravenous on getting high. </p>

<p>For a person using marijuana for the first few times sensory
changes occur sequentially, rather than all at once. First he may
notice increased brightness and clarity of colors, then sounds,
then visual structures, such as paintings or designs. (Two
dimensional photographs and motion pictures may be seen in three
dimensions in the marijuana high, a perception which can be
transferred to the normal state under certain conditions.) Then
proprioceptive sensations may present themselves. Any order of
the effects may occur during one high state or several. Often
effects will develop to particular levels and then stabilize
without further elaboration. I know some individuals who listen
to music during a high, and this is their major use and
apparently their only enhancement. </p>

<p>There are two states of awareness which relate to these
sensory effects. The basic one can be called pure awareness. In
this state the person is completely and vividly aware of his
experience, but there are no processes of thinking, manipulating,
or interpreting going on. The sensations fill the person's
attention, which is passive but absorbed in what is occurring,
which is usually experienced as intense and immediate. Pure
awareness is experiencing without associations to what is there. </p>

<p>The other state of awareness is one which can be termed
conscious awareness, in which the sensory experience is connected
to meanings, plans, functions, decisions, and possible actions.
This is our normal way of perceiving and how we usually go about
our daily lives. We do not sense the world directly, but with the
incorporation of our memories, meanings, and uses. In the state
of pure awareness objects are experienced as sensory qualities,
without the intrusion of interpretation. There are examples of
this in normal life. The sensation of sexual orgasm may be (and
hopefully is) experienced with pure awareness. Natural beauty,
such as flowers, mountains, oceans, and sunsets, is sometimes
experienced from a point of awareness without adding conscious
thinking. </p>

<p>These two processes of awareness have been described by
Charles Solley and Gardner Murphy (1960, Chapter 14) as
non-reflective consciousness and reflective consciousness. Alan
Watts compares the awareness state to a floodlight of attention,
which shows a broad area and lights up anything that is there.
Consciousness awareness he compares to a spotlight, which is
focused and can be directed, though on a narrower area. This is a
good analogy in pointing out that no deliberate directing is done
in the awareness state, although it is sometimes the case that
the area perceived in awareness may be a small one seen in great
detail. </p>

<p>The awareness state can be called &quot;choiceless&quot;
because choice is a part of consciousness functions. Decisions
made outside of consciousness are not called &quot;by
choice&quot; since choice implies conscious action. In a state of
direct awareness there are no choices made and no decisions or
actions occur. The stream of sensation flows and the person is
aware of what is happening; if he acts he does so without
consciously deciding to move. (That is, action is handled by some
process other than the consciousness monitoring the awareness
experience.) When complicated action becomes necessary conscious
attention is activated and the sensation is used as stimuli,
criteria, or information for the choices, plans, or action. </p>

<p>The awareness is not always experienced purely under
marijuana, but often is mixed with some, though reduced,
conscious attention. Consciousness, conscious awareness, or
conscious attention involves a connecting function which observes
experience in relation to past experience, memory images, memory
recording, expectancies, plans, goals, etc. This type of
consciousness may intrude on the awareness state at a low level.
However, when awareness fills the attention there is a
&quot;becoming lost&quot; in the experience, in which there is
often not even a memory of what occurred. This seems to be a
state in which consciousness functions are not present, and all
experience is at the level of awareness. Consciousness,
attention, and memory recording are apparently not active. (It is
possible that attention was present and either was not remembered
or the memory is not accessible to consciousness.) Such a state
of pure awareness is at one end of a continuum of varying degrees
of conscious activity, with the other end at a state in which the
contents of awareness are used for decisions, plans, inferences,
etc., and are not experienced for their primary sensory
qualities; they are information rather than experiences. </p>

<p>This analysis suggests a reason for sensory enhancement under
marijuana, a movement of attention from consciousness processes
to awareness processes. We usually think of attention as
synonymous with consciousness, but it is an uneasy synonymy.
Consciousness seems to be more than attention, but we cannot
describe a consciousness without attention. Perhaps it is
possible for attention energy to move into sensory processes and
operate less in the decisional, deliberative processes of
consciousness. If this happens it would provide much more energy
for attending to sense data, and we could expect the sensory
experience to be more vivid and more detailed. </p>

<p>Intensity of sensory experience seems related to the total
proportion or amount of attention which is involved in the
process. If attention is used in conscious or unconscious
processes in making decisions, remembering, evaluating, etc.,
then this much is removed from the awareness of the sense
experience. Thus it may be that one of the causes of sensory
enhancement under marijuana is that attention energy moves from
consciousness processes into awareness processes, which amplifies
the experience. </p>

<h4>TIME DISTORTION </h4>

<p>Besides sensory enhancement, the other most immediate effect
of marijuana is a change in the perception of time: events take
longer to occur. Bach's first Brandenburg Concerto lasts hours.
An hour seems to have passed, but the dock records 25 minutes.
The person's internal fantasies are long and involved, but only a
few minutes have passed in government time. In this state the
fantasies and music do not move at a faster pace---they move at
their own usual rate, though often more fluently and more dearly.
The impression is that external time must have slowed down, while
the internal experience continues at the same rate. There is not
the impression of speed or rapidity, but that the time available
to the user is magnified. </p>

<p>There are similar effects in normal experience. Time spent at
a boring talk seems to pass more slowly, and one thinks in
dismay, &quot;What, only five minutes have passed since I looked
at my watch?&quot; </p>

<p>A method used by Linn Cooper (1956) to induce time distortion
under hypnosis is useful to note here. A metronome set at one
beat per second is used. The hypnotized subject is told that the
metronome is slowing down to one beat every two seconds, every
five seconds, once a minute. Verbally or conceptually we can now
say that the subject's internal rate has remained the same, but
external time relative to the subject has slowed down. Has the
subject's own pace actually speeded up? I do not know, and I can
think of no reliable criteria for determining this. Brain wave
research shows that the basic alpha rhythm can be speeded up by a
flickering light (called photic driving), but not very much, and
not even to twice its normal rhythm. Cooper's subjects report
that they do mentally imagine the amount of thoughts appropriate
to the expanded time available, including counting imagined
objects. This may be a convenient hallucination or it may be an
accurate description of what they do. (Even calculation of real
problems would not be a valid test because calculating geniuses
can answer complex mathematical problems almost instantaneously,
and this ability may be available under hypnosis, though it has
never been reported to my knowledge under marijuana or hypnosis.)
In this procedure under hypnosis and also in marijuana the
subjective experience of time is disconnected from the marking of
social or government time. </p>

<p>The effect under marijuana is analogous to effects in visual
and sound modalities. Visual scenes often have more depth, sounds
are heard with more dimension; so too with time-there is an
expansion of the fabric of time so there is a feeling of depth
instead of the usual two dimensional flow. </p>

<p>The explanation of this sometimes given by marijuana users is
that more is happening: they are thinking faster or more thoughts
are occurring in the same time period. This could cause external
time to be relatively slower. Although it need not be the case
that internal processes change at a faster rate it is possible
that a person is aware of more perceptions in a given amount of
time as a result of the enhancement of sensory data. With visual
enhancement more details of the movements of the self and others
are attended to. This means that more information is perceived in
the same amount of time. This is also true of proprioceptive and
tactile responses. Time is somewhat conditioned to a normal rate
of information input in particular contexts. One has a
&quot;standard rate of intake&quot; and if the amount of
information is increased for a unit of time, then one of the
responses may be that time is going slower. To be conscious of
any change in experience there must be a comparison with previous
similar situations. Thus if the time experience while high is
compared with a similar normal experience, or with a time pace
constructed from normal experience, it may be perceived as
slower. </p>

<p>A more important cause for time distortion under marijuana can
be found by noting how persons normally judge the passage of
time, then investigating the changes in these criteria caused by
marijuana. This is rather difficult because no one knows how we
judge time. Nevertheless there are some relevant observations
which can be made.(1) </p>

<p>Notice the situations in which time seems to alter for many
persons in everyday experience and out-of-the-ordinary
experience. These are situations in which the experience itself
is the focus of attention, they are not means to extrinsic goals.
Persons totally involved in making love seem to have no awareness
of how much time may pass. Persons in a state of anger do not
become aware of time lapse until the emotion subsides or ego
controls are invoked. Psychotherapy hours in which emotional
material is covered seem to be out of time awareness. Mystics
become unaware of the passage of time during meditation, as do
persons having peak experiences (Maslow, I964). In dreams,
daydreams, fantasies, ecstasy, and strong emotional states, the
sense of time is absent or changed. And in the state of pure
awareness, as I have used the term, there is no perception of the
rate of time. These are all personal experiences in which
conscious attention is not dominant, and immediate experience,
rather than goals, expectancies, plans, and decisions, is
predominant. Time perception is a socially reinforced response.
The experiences and states I have described are not states which
are socially conscious; they are not internally subordinated to
social time or schedules. Anger cannot be paced with conscious
control, nor can ecstasy. Feelings, fantasies, dreams, and
awareness do not incorporate the sense of time which is built up
by and maintained in the consciousness. Thus when one is
experiencing such content there is no marking of the passage of
time, and to the extent this material is the content of
awareness, the less social time is noted. Immediate experience is
always timeless; time is perceived in relation to the uses of
experience in controlling or predicting the future or
interpreting the past, the present being perceived in relation to
past or future. This is one of the major functions of
consciousness. In a normal conscious state when the internal or
external input is to be changed or manipulated the time required
is automatically projected, based on past experience. This
imposes the knowledge of time on the consciousness. One of the
effects of marijuana is to reduce the strength of expectancies
and goals which are socially reinforced. Thus non-time
experiences are increased in relative strength and time oriented
associations are decreased, which creates the sense that time is
expanded. </p>

<p>Some indication that this is what occurs may be seen in
reports of marijuana users that time passes instantaneously. One
girl reported that when high she suddenly discovered 45 minutes
had passed without her realization of this. And there are reports
of listening to music when the individual realizes the music had
stopped, without his remembering hearing the selection as it was
playing. What happens in these cases is that most of the person's
attention is in non-time processes, so that time passage is not
noted until the social consciousness returns. Then it seems that
no time has passed, since there was no process noting its
passage. Just as in sleep, amnesic hypnosis, or anaesthesia,
there is no consciousness of the duration of the state, and the
conscious time flow seems unbroken from the moment of falling
asleep to the moment of waking. </p>

<p>When observing sensory stimuli, listening to music,
fantasying, etc., there is the feeling of expanded time because
the outside experiences are overwhelmed by the mental, internal
experience which is not marking time and there is no way to gauge
their pace. The quantity of the time change varies. If the user
is almost totally involved with the awareness processes, with
little conscious attention, then there will be little sense of
duration, and long periods of clock time will go by quickly. </p>

<p>Events themselves are timeless, in that they are always in the
present---they do not echo their past nor presage their future
states; we alone do that to them, for ourselves. And we ourselves
do not experience the past or the future; we experience memories
or expectancies, which may be realistic or fantasies. So our
experience of the passage of time is based on our comparison of
present experience with our remembrance of the past, usually the
immediate past, or our anticipation of the future and how we get
there. </p>

<p>Marijuana decreases the strength of the automatic memory,
expectancy, and anticipation processes; thus the perception of an
experience is not surrounded by the usual multitude of past
encounters, future possibilities, and potential uses. In contexts
requiring action on the basis of expectations and plans, such as
driving an automobile, they are available and often with more
focused attention. Given a situation not requiring activity or
decisions, the penumbra of response patterns, functions, and
potentials surrounding experience decreases, and the immediate
experience per se is perceived, rather than its position in a
pattern of change. This decreases comparison of the present with
the past, and again reduces the feeling of duration or passing of
time. (&quot;Passing of time&quot; is a curious phrase, because
time passing cannot be empirically observed. One may conclude the
passage of time by observing changes in experience, but it is not
really an inference either. What seems to be described is the
mental reviewing of the preceding changes which led up to the
present point. Re-running the succession in memory from some
point up to the present gives the sensation of passing time. We
are aware of events which are different from the ones we now
experience but that are connected by physical changes in which we
have participated (directly or through observation). This
awareness may be &quot;awareness of the passage of time.&quot; </p>

<p>In summary, under marijuana, the sense of time is distorted.
First, because mental contents and awareness processes which are
not connected to time needs or markers are strengthened. These
include daydreams, fantasies, event memories, peak experiences,
emotions, and the pure awareness state. Second, because goals,
anticipations, and expectancies are decreased in prominence,
reducing attention given to possible changes in the environment,
which decreases awareness of future states. Third, memory of
immediate past experience is decreased in strength, which reduces
knowledge of change and moves attention to the present. If
consciousness is completely passive, and non-time elements fill
attention, then the experience seems timeless. If some
consciousness processes and associations are maintained time will
seem to have slowed, as attention moves among the various
contents. </p>

<h4>EXPECTANCIES </h4>

<p>Both the intensification of sensory experience and the
expansion of time are part of an increased attentiveness to
immediate experience in contrast to memories of the past or plans
for the future. Memories and plans are experienced but only as
they arise out of the immediate content and needs of the person's
internal and external experience; they do not automatically
operate as in normal consciousness. Every action and potential
action, in the normal state, is evaluated according to its
consequences: what results will follow. Mental processes imagine
as many consequences as they have experience to do so, both
immediate and long range, testing these consequences against
criteria or goals of valued states. The consequences which are
most valued control the action. For example, if a person feels
angry toward another he may want to insult him verbally. He
mentally anticipates the possible consequences of this action,
which may include the release and satisfaction of the anger,
feelings of masculinity, enhanced self concept of strength, etc.,
on the positive side, and the anger or disapproval of the other
person, loss of self control, fear of his own impulses, what his
mother would think of the action, etc. on the negative side.
Depending on the person's past experience, his needs and
strengths of various values, the action will be taken, modified,
or inhibited. Every action a person engages in is surrounded and
extended mentally (consciously and unconsciously) by such
expectancies, and every situation experienced by a person is
responded to by anticipating its potential consequences and
relating them to desirable and undesirable conditions. (Of
course, the opposite of such action---its inhibition---is also
subject to the same processes.) Some of this process is
conscious, especially when the situation is new, unfamiliar, very
important, or ambiguous, but most of the expectancy and
anticipation process is done preconsciously. Normally persons are
not aware of the activity which occurs to determine an action;
expectancies have become incorporated into automatic responses. </p>

<p>The mind is efficient in making its activities automatic.
First an action is consciously made in response to a need or
situation. If it is successful (reinforced) it becomes habitual,
and is taken automatically without the need of conscious
attention, much as driving a car, sewing, tying your shoes, and
smoking a cigarette are all composed of large blocks of now
automatic actions which once had to be done with conscious
attention at every point. Later only the major elements must be
controlled with conscious attention, such as changing lanes when
driving, searching for an ashtray, etc. How can an action be
released without conscious attention? What must happen is that
criteria for action and the particular action are connected by
the conscious mind; then the process can be made automatically.
When the criteria are fulfilled, then the action is made.(2) This
suggests that there is some process or energy which releases
action but which does not need conscious attention. Similarly,
most of the expectancies around experiences are not
conscious---only the more important ones or ones which are so
complex as not to be automatically used. </p>

<p>Such expectancies and anticipations function to keep behavior
consistent, goal directed, and reasonably integrated. They help
avoid conflicts within the personality and with the environment,
including other persons. They have obvious survival value and
undoubtedly are reinforced by our society and our own needs. The
function of reinforcement is clear: The reinforcement value of
the projected consequences of an action come to affect our
decision to take or not to take the action. These expectancies
are responses to possible futures, and orient our actions to the
future} not the present. </p>

<p>One of the major effects of marijuana is to decrease the
strength of these expectancies and anticipations, on both
conscious and preconscious levels. Thus in the high state the
expectancy processes decrease their influence on behavior. Since
these are always oriented to future states, they take attention
away from perception of immediate experience and turn it to
following imagined states. Thus when attention given to imagined
states is reduced, the perception of the present experience will
increase in strength or intensity, either because more energy is
available for such awareness or because there are fewer processes
to attend to, and present experience becomes relatively more
predominant in the mental field. This enhancement of immediate
experience is reflected in the effects of marijuana on sense data
and time perception. Indeed, the decrease in expectancies, which
are connected to goals, may be one of the reasons for the change
in the awareness of time, since time is perceived in terms of
changes, including changes in relation to a potential state of
affairs. If the knowledge provided by expectancies is reduced,
then the immediate experience will not be seen as a point in time
with a future, but more as an event, <i>per se</i>. </p>

<p>The reduction in the strength of expectancies also contributes
to the increase in intensity of sensory experience. Objects as
well as situations and actions are surrounded by our potential
responses to them, such as our past experiences with them, how we
might use them, other forms they have taken, how they are made,
their qualities in other sense modalities, etc. When we perceive
an object, whether a fire in a fireplace, a photograph of a fire,
a fire engine, or a fiery speaker, not only are we aware of the
object, but also we have incorporated in our awareness these
other elements which give structure and meaning to the sense
data. Thus we know that the object is a bird cage or a rib cage,
and we know its qualities, functions, and potentials. Usually
these are keyed to our verbal response, our classification, but
they are known non-verbally as well (e.g., we can have emotional
responses or motor responses without verbal responses). </p>

<h4>FUNCTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS </h4>

<p>Particularly important to us is the function of objects.(3)
One sees this in a child's definition: a hole is to dig. A bridge
is to walk over to get to the other side. Someone said that home
is &quot;A place where when you go there, they have to take you
in.&quot; There is an essential effect of these operational
definitions: they force classifications rather than specificity.
Any hole is to dig and how hole X differs from hole Y is not
important so long as each can be dug. My home is not different
from your home, since they will both take us in. Such definitions
attempt to capture some particular criteria of whatever they
define. The criteria of definition are the only characteristics
which need to be observed in perceiving the object, and we are
trained to perceive in this way. We learn as children to see the
function of objects and to see the similarities of objects,
rather than experience them in all possible ways. The advantage
of this is obvious: we survive because we can use the
environment, we can generalize, we can cooperate within a
socially constructed reality. The disadvantages are obvious: we
may not see reality except in terms of functions, which shuts out
an enormous amount of reality (some of which would be functional
in various contexts). And often persons see objects only in terms
of their own functional needs, which narrows their perspective
considerably. (Psychologists might see persons as experimental
subjects, an insurance salesman might see one as a prospect,
etc.) </p>

<p>This leads, incidentally, to failures of discrimination in
perception, illustrated by the classical occidental observation
that all Chinese look alike, and no doubt Chinese observe the
same about occidentals. One of my friends took an astronomy
course and discovered that stars were not all the same color, as
he had previously perceived, but were red, blue, yellow, and
white. This led him to realize that all trees looked alike to
him. Of course he would not have said that they were identical,
but I doubt if he could have told the differences between an elm
and an oak, even standing in front of them, because a tree is
with leaves and to be shaded by. And after all, which of us could
easily describe essential differences between two holes dug by a
child in the sand at the beach? Though the child probably could. </p>

<p>Under marijuana the functional associations of objects are
decreased in strength. In addition to this specific association,
other associations such as verbal labeling and memory constructs
of such objects are decreased in strength. Normally all these
elements are imposed on the conscious experience of the object,
some incorporated into the perception (such as seeing the object
as a teapot) and some claiming attention on the periphery of
consciousness (such as knowing it is hot and not touching it).
When these associations are decreased there are fewer mental
impositions on the sensory perception of the object. Aspects
which would normally be shut out (such as a blemish on the teapot
or the shape of the handle) are given equal attention, and hence
are seen instead of being ignored. When attention is directed by
goals, as it usually is in the normal state, it is simply not
given to non-functional stimuli, i.e., elements that do not have
anything to do with what the person wants at the moment. </p>

<p>The person under marijuana is not seeing this object as
&quot;flowers&quot; with a mental image of flowers and his
memories of flowers being confirmed by these flowers, which are
to look at and smell and if one can look at and smell these one
has confirmed that they are flowers and that settles that part of
reality, and so on to another. Rather he has a great deal of time
and it is not urgent what uses these have or what consequences
could result and much more of his awareness is filled by these
flowers.. And there are textures, colors, shades, shapes, feels,
crevices, shadows, smells; all things that are there; experienced
rather than used. </p>

<p>An important principle is that you can experience something
only if you do not think in terms of its function. You can know
what it is only if you do not impose what it will be or could be
or ought to be. This often becomes quite evident under marijuana.
</p>

<p>This suggests a principle regarding processes of attention.
When attention is reduced for some elements in perception, the
amount given to other elements increases, as though attention is
a mobile amount of energy, and when a quantity is not needed at
one point it moves to another point. This is consistent with
Freudian theory, which holds that as energy is released from
conflict points it becomes available to the general system. With
marijuana, when association processes reduce their demands on
attention, it flows to whatever else is in the consciousness. (I
am using a fluid metaphor, but other models will do equally well.
Electrically one can speak in terms of activation. Cybernetically
we could refer to homeostatic balancing of elements. Or we could
talk of homunculi leaving the study and going to the patio.) </p>

<h4>ASSOCIATIONS </h4>

<p>This reduction of associations is an important basic effect of
marijuana. It contributes to the expansion of time, to sensory
enhancement, and to the increase in attention which is given to
the focus of consciousness. However, not all association patterns
are decreased in strength in the high state. Well known are the
flights of fantasy and dreaming stimulated by hashish and
cannabis.(4) And in non-fantasy high states users have reported
that they can perceive connections and associations of ideas that
were not accessible to them in the non-high state (usually called
&quot;straight&quot; by users). This seems inconsistent with what
I have just said about the decrease in association strength.
However, while associations, particularly those based on social
learning, are reduced in strength, any association may gain in
strength if it becomes the focus of the detailed attention
possible under marijuana. Thus fantasies and creative thinking
may have increased associations and may be more fully developed
than in the normal state of consciousness. </p>

<p>The associations which are reduced in strength seem to be
those which are learned through social reinforcement: meanings
and behaviors which are taught by society. Functions of objects
are socially taught. Patterns of communication are social.
Language and verbal knowledge (Columbus discovered America in
1492) is social in origin. Inhibitions and controls on behavior
are socially reinforced, and are often incorporated into the
verbal system through &quot;should&quot; and &quot;should
not&quot; statements. When social norms are the same as personal
needs, desires, and meanings, there is consistency in the
response to a situation or object. When conflict between social
and personal directions occurs it must be resolved, and usually
it is resolved in favor of social meanings, functions, and
approved behavior (usually called rational). Thus the social
perception of a situation may exclude many of the potential
meanings, behaviors, and emotions. Under marijuana this excluding
function of socially learned associations is reduced in strength.
The excluding function has certain survival value. It keeps our
consciousness from being dogged up with unnecessary and
distracting contents. Thus a scholar looks at a book and notices
the title but not the binding; for a book binder the opposite is
the case. Associations which contribute to the goals of society
are learned by persons through social reinforcement, and one
effect of these associations is to inhibit other associations.
Marijuana decreases this inhibition and lowers the reinforcement
value of the association. In effect this makes all associations
more equal, and the network of associations is less guided or
channeled in socially reinforced directions. A person who is high
may be aware that an object is a pencil, but he may successively
also see it as a shape, a phallic metaphor, a geometrical solid,
the printing on it, etc. He has more associations once they are
away from the strict control of social perception. </p>

<h4>INHIBITIONS </h4>

<p>The same pattern can be seen in expectancies and
anticipations. Socially oriented behavior makes great use of
expectancies to control behavior in an effort to maximize
approval and minimize or avoid disapproval, which are social
reinforcers.(5) Such behavior thus involves a large amount of
inhibition. By inhibition I mean any kind of control to prevent
activity from reaching a certain level. The activity can be
thoughts, action, fantasies, or emotions. Inhibitions in Freudian
terms are controlled by anti-cathexes, in learning theory by
aversive stimuli, and in terms used here, by expectations of
aversive stimuli. Inhibitions need not be on anti-social acts,
but are often to direct behavior into patterns normal in our
society. Persons maintain appropriate social distances (which are
arbitrary), you do not tug at the beard of someone you have just
met (though the thought may cross your mind), and a man does not
cry in public. These may seem minor but they are controlled with
great power by social reinforcement, as can be seen by the strong
rejection of the behavior if it occurs. Of course, inhibitions
are also placed on behavior which would be dangerous to society,
such as aggressive or destructive acts. </p>

<p>When behavior is inhibited, the psychological tendency is to
inhibit any mental activity which might lead to such behavior.
Feelings, impulses, images, fantasies, etc., may be inhibited and
decreased in strength, or even prevented from entering
consciousness. Such inhibited feelings and impulses may appear in
consciousness in the high state, often without effort of the
person. This may cause anxiety and the person may use ego defense
measures to block their appearance or diminish their threat. On
the other hand, he can also use methods of analysis and
self-therapy in the high state to deal with conflict material,
and may free himself from neurotic responses. </p>

<p>The effects of the reduction of social inhibitions can be seen
in various ways. At marijuana social gatherings persons may not
feel pressure to participate in conversational games, play
behavior increases, physical activity may increase. The decrease
of socially reinforced inhibitions also accounts for the actions
of users which claim public attention: jumping over fireplugs and
parking meters, uninhibited dancing (erotic and non-erotic), and
playful behavior (which is subtly taboo in our society). Here the
person is expressing impulses in behavior which would usually be
inhibited by expectancy of negative social reinforcement (frowns,
rejection, blame, punishment and other expressions of
disapproval). However, this reduction in strength of social
inhibitions does not usually result in anti-social acts (unless
jumping fireplugs is considered anti-social). This is curious
because social inhibitions are usually considered the bulwark
against committing crimes, aggressing against others, raping
women, etc. But we do not have cases of contemporary users of
marijuana burglarizing or attacking others, though such effects
are evident in the use of alcohol, where users are much more
likely to express violent and aggressive behavior. </p>

<p>Why then if inhibitions are reduced in strength do not users
become violent and aggressive? One reason may be that aggression
is usually specific to situations and expectancies about
situations, and the use of marijuana today rarely is in a
conflict situation. With reduced pressure from memories and
expectancies one would also expect less non-relevant feeling.
Beyond this, one of the psychological effects of marijuana is
euphoria. Thus anger and aggressive impulses are less strong and
do not draw much support from the rest of the personality. This
effect may also be related to the decrease in the strength of
social reinforcers, since chronic anger is often the result of
conflicts between social requirements and personal desires. </p>

<h4>ATTENTION </h4>

<p>The process of attention is clearly affected by marijuana. The
most obvious effect is to narrow the amount of diverse contents
in the focus of attention. The person under marijuana usually
perceives fewer objects of attention, which may mean physical
objects, actions, social elements, emotions, etc. We have already
noted this effect: a person who is high may become absorbed in an
object, event, or process to the exclusion of everything else. A
train of fantasy may occupy all of a person's attention. This is
a psychological analogy of tunnel vision, with the contents of
the tunnel expanded. </p>

<p>In the normal, straight state, conscious and non-conscious
processes give continual attentiveness to many internal and
external stimuli, with responses such as awareness, memories,
expectancies, and the many associations we have already noted.
Many of these are conscious, especially those on which decisions
are necessary. Others, and probably the bulk of the responses,
autonomously operate without being consciously attended to, and
come to consciousness only when necessary. These are in a
preconscious state, but nevertheless involve perception,
associations, memories, and expectancies.(6) Such processes often
regulate behavior when consciousness does not intervene (as in
driving a car automatically). But whenever novel stimuli appear
or more than routine decisions must be made, the contents become
part of the conscious state. </p>

<p>In the consciousness processes connections can be made among
several types of information, and in different contexts of
meaning---making connections with the many factors relevant to a
decision or the resolution of conflict.. Conscious attention
moves easily from one interpretation to another interpretation of
information, with the various memories and expectancies which go
with each interpretation, thus obtaining more information for the
decision. These interpretations and associations are drawn from
the preconscious processes, which, alone, cannot make
interconnections among themselves as fluidly as can
consciousness. Connections of ideas are made in preconscious
states, but these seem based on almost any relation, from
contiguity to puns. Consciousness can select the significant or
realistic connections and systematize their use. </p>

<p>We can regard the conscious system as the system which does
just that: selects and interprets information in relation to a
goal or purpose. It does this when it is activated by attention
energy. It may be that attention is the activating energy of
awareness. Attention usually is in the conscious system, which
consists of processes which select information to make decisions.
It can also be activated in preconscious contents, which contain
information, emotional values, and random associations. Most of
the time awareness is of the conscious processes. </p>

<p>Under marijuana attention-awareness energy may move into the
preconscious system and be less in consciousness processes. Since
there are fewer elements in attention the person is more strongly
aware of any individual element of meaning, memory, emotion,
etc., and less of its relation to other elements which would be
relevant in the conscious </p>

<p>system. Whatever is in the center of attention occupies all of
awareness: this may be sensory data, such as visual stimuli, or
imagery, such as fantasies. The effect can be termed a unity of
attention, in that all attention is focused on one subject. In
normal conscious states, several channels can be used at once,
e.g., reading a book while listening to music. Attention may
alternate, but even so keeps all channels of input on the edge of
attention. This does not occur with marijuana, which so far as
awareness goes, fills the attention with one thing at a time. If
one is recalling an experience from the memory, then almost all
attention is on the event, and almost none on the external
environment, expectancies or plans. Processes in normal states
which seem to parallel this would be extreme concentration on a
book or television, exciting conversations, and the state of
romantic love. </p>

<p>It is not the case that there is less attention, for the
quantity seems at least the same. Analogically it is as though a
portion of a photograph were blown up to the size of the original
picture, thus maintaining the size of the print but increasing
the magnification of a smaller relative section. </p>

<p>Some of the processes which contribute to this effect are
obvious. The reduction in expectancies and associations reduces
peripheral contents of consciousness. Many of these elements are
maintained continuously at a low level, appropriate to the
environment and needs of the person. Some items are continuously
monitored, much as a hostess may habitually check how each of her
guests is getting along. Such monitoring takes some attention
away from any central content, just as the hostess may not
concentrate fully on her own conversation if she is attending to
the state of her party. However, without the need for these side
glances, attention flows to the central subject. This means that
the plans, anticipations, etc., are not automatically attended
to, although if such an element enters the central position it
receives the intense central attention and is attended to in
great detail. </p>

<p>Peripheral attention and its contents are reduced in the high
state; central attention receives the energy which would
otherwise be used in peripheral attention. This could be because
each type of attention is different, and thus differentially
affected, or because the peripheral contents are reduced in
strength because of the reduction in the strength of
associations. The latter seems to be true; the former may be
also. </p>

<h4>MEMORY </h4>

<p>One of the processes important in perception is the comparing
of current input with similar past experience. When we see a
friend, a memory image of his face is presented to our
consciousness along with the sensation of his actual present
appearance. This memory image (which can be called a schema)
blends with the current sensation, so that the perception is a
combination of the two. The relative strengths of each source of
information probably vary from person to person. Some primarily
perceive the memory image, with the sensory input serving as
confirmation of the identification. For others, the memory image
may be so weak that reorientation and identification is
continually necessary. Though the construction and recall of this
image is not clearly understood, it must be partially constructed
from previous experience of the stimulus (including verbal
knowledge) up to a point where the person knows all he needs to
know for purposes of his response. After this, encounters with
the stimulus do not add to the memory image appreciably; further
discrimination is unnecessary and the image stabilizes. (Of
course, the person may continue to make discriminations. One of
the valued behaviors in science is to make perceptual
discriminations for which we have no functional need, assuming
that such information is valuable per se or may be valuable
later.) </p>

<p>Most persons rely principally on memory images in perception
unless there are evident differences in the immediate situation,
and their responses are keyed to the memory image. Consequently
we do not respond only to immediate experience. We identify
current experience according to past experience and then respond
on the basis of past experience, modified by whatever differences
we perceive to be significant in the current information. Our
actions originate from past experience, they are connected to the
structures built up in our memories, and these memories are
elicited by the immediate stimulus. In unfamiliar settings, no
memory image is available. Then we must deliberately and
consciously act, randomly act, follow instructions or models, or
act according to the most similar memory image. Any situation is
a combination of elements, and may call for complex combinations
of memories and response patterns, some new, some familiar. </p>

<p>Marijuana has two effects on this process. The first is to
reduce the general automatic availability of memory images; the
second is to increase the strength of memories when they are
relevant to central needs. We have already discussed the general
reduction in strength of memories in response to current
experience, which is principally in the automatic recall of
memory schema. The strength or visibility of the mental image is
reduced, with a resulting increase in the brightness of the data
themselves (there being nothing else to look at). This explains
also why experiences seem new: they are observed without the
feeling of familiarity caused by memory images. For most persons
in straight consciousness it is likely that sensation is checked
against a memory image (at a preconscious level) and what is seen
from the current stimulus is what is necessary to fulfill the
criteria for identification, based on the memory schema. The
relevant elements, the criteria, are affected by the goals or
functions which are important to the person. We do not perceive
dust on a typewriter when we look for something to type on. When
we look for a friend in a crowd we do not look at his face, we
identify it. Similarly, in conversation and daily life we
generally know what we are seeing, so perception is more
identification than observation. However, when fewer memory
images are available, as when high, one must respond to the sense
data as unfamiliar material. This may cause anxiety, depending on
the individual and the environment, or it may result in pleasure
at the enhancement or challenge of current perception. It may
also increase the potential responses, since there is less
pressure for a learned habitual response, which would normally
inhibit other responses. </p>

<p>(This may, incidentally, suggest an explanation for the <i>jamais
vu</i> sensation, in which there is the feeling that a normally
familiar situation is totally unfamiliar. Several experiences of <i>jamais
vu </i>reported to me seem to have occurred when there are
unfamiliar emotional elements present, as though the usual memory
schema and their associated responses were not available.) </p>

<p>At the same time, some memory images may be strengthened if
they are emotionally salient. A person having paranoid fears, for
example, may find his imagery increased in strength. One person
reports that once when high he observed a friend sitting to one
side of him staring directly at him. He turned to face his friend
and found him looking in another direction, his face turned
partially away from him. Apparently a fear activated the image of
a full staring face, which was superimposed on the profile of the
other person. It may be that psychotic or schizophrenic
perceptual projections are partially caused by increased internal
imagery. Under marijuana, at least, emotional force may activate
internal imagery which is used to search for, identify, or
interpret incoming stimuli. </p>

<p>So also if the person deliberately attempts to recall past
experiences there will often be increased recall, either of
events in great detail or Hashes of experiences. This is
particularly true if there is salient emotional content. Recall
which appears to be eidetic may occur under marijuana, and images
which are like playbacks of the original perceptual experience
may become accessible at will to conscious attention. If the
conscious attention is allowed to unfocus, so that only
monitoring is going on, almost instantaneous images can be
obtained of visual and sometimes auditory or tactile stimuli. The
image must be seen when it occurs; if there is an attempt to hold
it in consciousness a mental composite image takes its place. It
is possible that what occurs is an activation of the actual
memory record, selected from the stream of consciousness which is
recorded in the brain.(7) Only one flash comes at a time. This
ability, incidentally, has been transferred to straight, non-high
control after it has been observed under marijuana. The essential
feature seems to be in allowing the conscious attention not to
try to hold on to the image when it appears. One must learn to
see rather than look. </p>

<p>Another type of memory which is strengthened is that for
emotion-laden events. Strong emotional responses, such as grief,
fear, guilt, etc., often arise under marijuana. These are
responses to remembered events, responses which might normally be
suppressed. Usually the person's sense of identity is
functioning, so he can either accept the emotion and be a part of
it, which is usually therapeutic, or reject it, which may produce
dissonance and anxiety. &quot;Bad trips&quot; are sometimes
caused by emotions or pressures which threaten the person's self
concept or his sense of control. While suppression processes are
usually not too effective as defenses, distraction is, because of
the mobile flow of attention under marijuana. For this reason,
movement such as dancing, running, exercise, showers, etc., will
usually change the emotional tone. </p>

<p>One other effect on memory should be noted. Normally we have a
short-term recall process which holds memories in access for
about 20 minutes, and then a long-term storage, which is
permanent. In the high state, short-term memory becomes shorter,
and in very high states the sequence of thoughts is not
remembered past one or two transitions. The sequence can
sometimes be recalled with an effort, or reconstructed, but there
is no automatic remembering as there is normally. On the other
hand, after the high, events within it can be remembered,
indicating that at least some of the experiences are being filed
in long-term memory. </p>

<p>Partly due to the reduction in strength of memory there is
less intellectual control over the stream of consciousness.
Memory seems to be needed to maintain concepts or goals under
which to manipulate thoughts. Another cause of the reduced
control is the lowered inhibition processes, which are used in
thinking to filter irrelevant material and keep it from
cluttering the conscious attention. Logical ideas and connections
may also be enforced by such inhibitions; these would be loosened
by the decrease in association strength. </p>

<h4>VARIABLES </h4>

<p>In general for marijuana to have effects the user must
cooperate with it and facilitate the effects. He must learn to
allow himself to respond. There are some persons whose response
to marijuana is almost unnoticeable; their consciousness seems
not to change. These may be persons who have fears about and
strong defenses against losing control, and elements of their
feeling, thoughts, or action which threaten their control are
strongly rejected. Such personality systems are endangered by
marijuana effects and often maintain their structure against
these effects. Sometimes they will respond, but what effects are
occurring will be blocked from their conscious awareness. The
most noticeable effect is often time distortion, indicated by
long silences and broken often by a comment that nothing is
happening. </p>

<p>The effect of the physical and interpersonal setting on the
response to marijuana is strong and usually controls the tone of
the experience. The basic fact is that the individual creates the
reaction, not the drug. If the person feels under pressure, then
the drug will enhance his feeling of stress, and the effect will
depend on how the person can deal with the stimulus. If he feels
energetic, the drug will enhance his willingness to be active.
Some persons become less self- conscious, others more
self-conscious. Some move physically, others sit quietly. Some
talk, others are silent. Users of marijuana are as individual as
they are. For this reason, one must expect different effects to
occur from different times and varying physical and interpersonal
surroundings. For some the effect is quite different when smoked
alone than with other persons, probably because social situations
elicit different personality elements and present various
pressures. </p>

<p>These variable factors should be noted in considering research
and investigation of the effects of marijuana. The plant probably
does everything anybody has claimed for it, but only in a
situation which enables it to do whatever is claimed for it. One
highly respectable philosopher and author, who has explored a
variety of chemicals, says that marijuana will take a person as
far as LSD. To which I would add, especially if you can go as far
as LSD on it. This is not tautologous, for it cannot be said of
coffee or orange juice; even if you are ready, coffee will not
take you there. </p>

<p>There are further effects of marijuana which relate to complex
structures of association, learning, values, intra-personality
communication, interpersonal perception, and consciousness. It is
difficult to separate the awareness of these effects from the
effects of the awareness. It seems best to stop at this point,
having discussed what seems verbalizable at present. </p>

<p>Given facilitating conditions, the effects I have described
will develop. Sensations are enhanced and clarified: sight,
hearing, taste, touch. Time perception changes. Attention becomes
more unified, and moves more into preconscious material and the
state of pure awareness. The many broad processes of association,
such as social meanings, memory images, expectancies, and plans
are reduced in number and relevance. Inhibitions and suppressions
relax, allowing emotions, thoughts, fantasies, and memories to
How more freely. The development and strength of these effects
will depend on the individual, the times he has used marijuana,
how he has used marijuana, and the environment. </p>

<h1>Cannabis: the brain's other supplier</h1>

<p><b>Rosie Mestel</b> </p>

<p><b>reprinted from the New Scientist 31 July 1993</b> </p>

<p>Introductory Comment by R. Givens. </p>

<p>The fact that THC has naturally occurring analogs in the human
body flies in the face of REEFER MADNESS propaganda. A natural
compound with specific receptors and a non-toxic disposal system
makes it extremely unlikely that marijuana causes any health
damage. This logic is supported by over 5,000 years of recorded
use without a recorded death. Now we know why. Cannabis is as
natural as vitamin C. </p>

<hr>

<p>THREE years ago, Israeli archaeologists stumbled upon a 1600
year-old tragedy: the remains of a narrow hipped teenage girl
with the skeleton of a full term fetus still cradled in her
abdomen. With her were grey ashes that contained traces of
tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient of marijuana. Could
it be that the midwife had administered the plant in a last ditch
effort to bring on labour or to ease her pain? </p>

<p>Today, in nearby Jerusalem, another chemical is in the news-
this one extracted not from ancient ashes but from fresh,
pulverized pig brain. It is anandamide, a newly christened
chemical that might do naturally in our heads what marijuana does
when we choose to smoke it. Anandamide's discovery, along with
that of the molecule it binds to in the brain, has marijuana
researchers buzzing with the best high they have had in years.
The findings provide new hope for therapies that draw on the
weed's long list of anecdotal medical uses: as a pain killer,
appetite stimulant or nausea suppressant, to name a few. They
also throw open the windows onto the mysterious workings of our
brains. </p>

<p>Research into marijuana, or Cannabis sativa , has long been
marginalised by official disapproval of the weed and its use. It
is, after all, classed as a drug with no medical merit, and its
recreational use is widely frowned upon. But it was not always
so. For thousands of years, India revered the plant for its
effects on the mind. In China, where opium was the mind-bending
drug of choice, the cannabis plant was used for medicines and its
tough fibres for making clothes. The West also used marijuana:
Queen Victoria's doctor administered it for Her Majesty's
menstrual cramps; George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both
grew the plant on their southern estates as a source of fibre for
ropes and sails. (History does not record whether either of these
presidents ever tried smoking their crop and, if so, whether they
inhaled or not.) </p>

<p>But as demand for hempen rope and cloth diminished, and the
recreational use of marijuana increased, anti-marijuana feeling
grew, reaching a peak in the 1930s. &quot;If the hideous monster
Frankenstein came face to face with the monster marijuana he
would drop dead of fright,&quot; trumpeted Harry Anslinger,
commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and a leading
anti-cannabis crusader of the times. In 1937, marijuana use was
outlawed in the United States. By 1971 even its medical use was
banned in the US and Britain. </p>

<p>Marijuana may have been outlawed, but marijuana research was
not, though it is not most government's top funding priority. in
1964 Raphael Mechoulam, an Israeli chemist, identified and
synthesised the main mind-altering substance in the plant,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the most abundant of the 60 related
chemicals. Scientists speculated that THC did its deed by
sticking randomly to brain cells, interfering with their ability
to communicate by altering the electrical properties of their
membranes, much as alcohol does. </p>

<p>More recently came other exciting finds: in 1988, Allyn
Howlett of St Louis University Medical School discovered a
specific protein receptor for THC in mouse nerve cells- a protein
that only THC and its relatives dock onto. Two years later, Tom
Bonner's group at the National Institute of Mental Health
pinpointed the DNA that encodes the same receptor in rats. It is
now known that humans have the receptor, too. </p>

<p>Finding a cannabinoid receptor implies that THC-unlike alcohol
- has a quite precise modus operandi that taps into a specific
brain function. Presumably the drug binds to nerves that have the
receptor, and the nerves respond by altering their behavior. The
classic effects of marijuana smoking are the consequences:
changes in mood, memory, appetite, movement and perception,
including pain. Researchers think THC affects so many mental
processes because receptors are found in many brain regions,
especially in those that perform tasks known to be disturbed
during THC intoxication: in the banana-shaped hippocampus,
crucial for proper memory; in the crumpled cerebral cortex, home
of higher thinking; and in the primitive basal ganglion
controller of movement. </p>

<p>Once a specially tailored receptor was found, the next step
was simple- in theory, anyway. &quot;The receptor had to be there
for a purpose -- presumably it didn't evolve so people could
smoke cannabis and get high,&quot; says Roger Pertwee, a
pharmacologist at Aberdeen University. Instead, there had to be a
natural chemical inside of us that fitted onto the receptor and
sent some biochemical signal cascading through the nerve cell to
do who knows what. But plucking that one chemical out of a brain
stuffed with millions of others was never going to be easy. </p>

<p>Blissful thinking </p>

<p>Several laboratories set to work on the problem and ,
fittingly, Mechoulam's was the first to come up with an answer,
in the form of a greasy, hairpin-shaped chemical. The researchers
dubbed it anandamide, from &quot;ananda&quot;, the Sanskrit word
for bliss. &quot;The guy discovers the active ingredient of
marijuana back in the 1960s, and now, almost 30 years later to
the day, he discovers anandamide,&quot; says Paul Consroe, a
neuropharmacologist at the University of Arizona. &quot;Isn't it
great?&quot; </p>

<p>Mechoulam's strategy was to chase after chemicals that, like
THC, are soluble in fat. By teasing these substances away from
those that are water soluble, his group extracted a substance
from pig brain that did indeed bind to the cannabinoid receptor.
But did it act like THC? To find out they sent their specimen to
Pertwee who had devised a test for cannabinoids that involved
monitoring a substance's ability to stop nerve twitching in mouse
tissue, when dropped on certain nerves. &quot;When it arrived,
there was so little of it in the phial I couldn't even see
it,&quot; Pertwee recalls. &quot;We didn't know what it was--
just that it was a greasy substance.&quot; But the tests went
well: anandamide depressed the twitch just like THC, and last
December the researchers published their results in Science. </p>

<p>The mouse result gave Mechoulam and his group the
encouragement they needed to extract more anandamide from pig
brains and then analyse and synthesise the chemical in the lab.
They also wanted more evidence that anandamide docked
specifically onto the cannabinoid receptor and acted like THC,
which has a very different molecular structure. And so, with Zvi
Vogel and colleagues at the Weizmann Institute near Tel Aviv,
they came up with a plan. </p>

<p>They would add the DNA encoding the cannabinoid receptor to
hamster or monkey cells growing in dishes. The cells equipped
with this DNA would then produce masses of receptor, which would
sit in the cell membrane ready and available for any chemical
&quot;key&quot; that should happen along. Vogel's researchers
would add anandamide to the cells and watch what happened. </p>

<p>The results, published in July's issue of the Journal of
Neurochemistry, were clear: anandamide acted as a key, and a
precise one at that, sticking only to the cells containing the
receptor, and not to others. What's more, when anandamide stuck
to the cells, it triggered biochemical changes similar to those
associated with THC and related chemicals. Not only did
anandamide fit the same lock as THC, but it appeared to open
similar doors in the brain. </p>

<p>More tests followed in a number of laboratories, and these
researchers found that in every way that has been tested so far,
anandamide acts very much like THC. But why would we want such a
mind-altering substance in our brains? </p>

<p>Studies on another class of drugs provide a useful parallel.
Opiates such as morphine and heroin act upon the body's nervous
system to cause euphoria and block pain. In 1973, natural opoids,
which behave in the same way as opiates, but have a different
structure, were pulled out of the body. It appears that when the
body is under serious assault, nerve cells spit out these opoids,
which promptly bind to other nerve cells to stop pain signals
dead in their tracks. At the same time, they fasten onto sites in
the brain to induce a feeling of wellbeing. </p>

<p>Anandamide, like the natural opoids, will probably have its
own specific set of jobs to perform in the brain and body. The
effects of THC give a rough guide to what these might be:
involvement in mood, memory and pain are obvious examples. </p>

<p>But what would the brain be without anandamide? Researchers
intend to find out. Bonner is gearing up to produce a genetically
engineered mouse that has no cannabinoid receptors: no receptors,
no anandamide function. Others want to tinker with anandamide to
make a version that binds to the receptor but doesn't trigger any
change in the nerve's behavior. Added to a mouse, it would stop
the body's real, internal anandamide from doing its job. </p>

<p>Researchers are also excited by anandamide's possible role in
mental and neurological disease. There are also other questions
to be asked. If anandamide, like THC, hampers memory, could a
drug with the opposite effects-- a &quot;memory pill&quot;*-- be
made? &quot;It's all speculation for now,&quot; says Steven
Childers, a pharmacologist at Bowman Gray School of Medicine,
North Carolina. </p>

<p>&quot;But we like to think about these things.&quot; It will
take more time before anandamide is firmly established as the
bona fide partner to the cannabinoid receptor. Meanwhile,
Mechoulam's lab has two other anandamide-like chemicals waiting
in the wings. And in the US, Howlett and Childers both have
chemicals of an entirely different kind that bind to the
receptor: they are water soluble, not fat soluble. the importance
of each remains to be seen. </p>

<p>High hopes </p>

<p>Whatever anandamide turns out to be, it provides
pharmacologists with a fresh plan of attack in their hunt for
drugs that act like cannabinoids. Such drugs could be valuable to
help keep at bay the nausea of cancer chemotherapy; to stimulate
appetite in AIDS patients; to dampen tremors in neurological
disorders; to reduce eye pressure inpatients with glaucoma; and
to dull pain in those for whom other painkillers do not work. </p>

<p>Cannabinoids can do at least some of these things, with one
small drawback: they also make the recipient high. The holy grail
of cannabinoid therapeutics has been to separate what causes the
high from the source of the desired effects, by chemical
tinkering with THC or its relations-- shortening a side group on
one part of the molecule, lengthening a carbon chain in
another-in hope that the &quot;undesirable&quot; effects will be
lost in the shuffle. Despite the drug's obvious reputation,
several US pharmaceuticals spent several years trying to make
this work, but without success. Nor did they reach another
equally sought after goal: an antagonist that will block the
effects of THC and similar substances when taken. </p>

<p>Until marijuana researchers succeed in doing something along
these lines, it is unlikely that drugs companies will pay much
attention. &quot;There is a real stigma working with drugs of
abuse,&quot; says Billy Martin, a pharmacologist at the Medical
College of Virginia. &quot;If drugs companies had three choices
of drugs to work on and one was a drug of abuse, they're just not
going to work on the drug of abuse.&quot; This view is shared by
Larry Melvin, who worked on the Pfizer pharmaceuticals company's
now defunct cannabinoid therapeutics programme. &quot;What will
ultimately legitimise the field in a big way is if researchers
can come up with a really good therapeutic ability. then you'll
see the companies turn around.&quot; </p>

<p>But Gabriel Nahas, an anaesthetist from Columbia University in
New York, who has spoken out against marijuana use for many
years, maintains that THC's effects on the brain are too general
and too toxic for this route ever to work. The discovery of
anandamide and its receptor have not changed his mind. &quot;The
brain is a computer,&quot; he says. &quot;To put THC in the brain
is akin to putting a bug in the computer. I'm sticking to my guns
about its harmful effects--not only to man but to society.&quot; </p>

<p>Only time will reveal the value of anandamide and its receptor
to drug therapy. But the importance of these discoveries to brain
research is not in doubt. &quot;We're no longer just dealing with
the pharmacology of a recreational drug,&quot; says Pertwee.
&quot;We're dealing with the physiology of a newly discovered
system in the brain. And that's an enormously bigger field. </p>

<p>Sidebar </p>

<p>Just what the doctor ordered </p>

<p>EVERY month Robert Randall receives a gift from the US
government: a tin box stuffed with 300 marijuana cigarettes. He
gets them because he has glaucoma, a condition which damages the
retina. Marijuana helps to reduce the pressure in his eyes. </p>

<p>Randall and eight others are participants in the Compassionate
Investigative New Drug programme, under which people with
glaucoma, cancer, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and AIDS are
given the drug for its supposed effectiveness in relieving pain,
suppressing nausea from AZT or chemotherapy, and stimulating
appetite. </p>

<p>If the programme seems like an anomaly, given marijuana's
official status as a drug with no medical use, it is no longer.
Only those patients originally on the programme now receive
marijuana from the government. Others must now buy it illegally
off the street. </p>

<p>That is a hardship, says Randall, president of the Alliance
for Cannabis therapeutics (ACT), which lobbies for the medical
use of marijuana. &quot;We get calls from AIDS patients who say
'I can either buy food that I can't eat because I'm so nauseous,
or I can buy marijuana and get hungry because I can't afford to
buy food',&quot; he says. </p>

<p>In 1975, those steep street prices had driven Randall to grow
cannabis plants to treat his glaucoma. This led to his arrest,
followed by an acquittal and ultimately--after he filed a lawsuit
to a legal supply from the government. Later, a handful of
patients with cancer or suffering chronic pain won access, and in
1990 a man known as Steve L became the first person with AIDS to
get the drug, just ten days before he died. Later that year,
Kenny Jenks and his wife Barbara won the same right, after a
fierce fight following their arrest for possessing two marijuana
plants. </p>

<p>Until 1991, anyone wanting to get on the programme had to fill
in forms so complex that it took about 50 hours. then the
government reduced the red tape, cutting the time down to about
one hour--and found itself inundated with applications for
therapeutic marijuana. The US Public Health Service responded by
scrapping the programme. <br>

<p><font size="3">Abstract: This report concerns the effects of
marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. It presents the
results of one pilot and three actual driving studies. The pilot
study's major purpose was to establish the THC dose current
marijuana users smoke to achieve their desired &quot;high&quot;.
From these results it was decided that the maximum THC dose for
subsequent driving studies would be 300 mcg / kg (0.3 mg / kg).
The first driving study was conducted on a closed section of a
primary highway. After smoking marijuana delivering THC doses of
0, 100, 200, and 300 mcg / kg, subjects drove a car while
maintaining a constant speed and lateral position. This study was
replicated with a new group of subjects, but now in the presence
of other traffic. In addition, a car following test was executed.
The third driving study compared the effects of a modest dose of
THC (100 mcg / kg) and alcohol )BAC of 0.04 g %) on city driving
performance. This program of research has shown that marijuana,
when taken alone, produces a moderate degree of driving
impairment which is related to the consumed THC dose. The
impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a
steady lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not
exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal
drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana
retain insight in their performance and will compensate where
they can, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort. As a
consequence, THC's adverse effects on driving performance appear
relatively small.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This report concerns the effects of marijuana
smoking on actual driving performance. It presents the results of
one pilot and three actual driving studies which were conducted
between April 1990 and March 1992. The program was funded by the
U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), with
the exception of the alcohol part of the city driving study which
was sponsored by the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public
Works. The project was conducted by the Institute for Drugs,
Safety and Behavior of the University of Limburg, Maastricht, The
Netherlands. The major objectives of the program were to
determine the dose-response relationship between
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), marijuana's main constituent,
and objectively and subjectively measured aspects of real-world
driving; and, to determine whether it is possible to correlate
driving performance impairment with plasma concentrations of the
drug or a metabolite. A variety of driving tests were employed,
including: maintenance of a constant speed and lateral position
during uninterrupted highway travel, following a leading car with
varying speed on a highway, and city driving. The purpose of
applying different tests was to determine whether similar changes
in performance under the influence of THC occur in all, thereby
indicating a general drug effect on driving ability.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter One provides background information
about the drug, its pharmacological properties, the prevalence of
its use, and a review of marijuana smoking and traffic safety.
THC's effects on the ability of drivers to operate safely in
traffic situations have traditionally been determined in two
ways: from epidemiological surveys of users' involvement in
traffic accidents and from empirical studies to measure the
drug's influence on skills related to driving, or driving itself.
Epidemiology shows that people drive after marijuana use and that
drivers involved in accidents often show the drug's presence. The
results are, however, inconclusive because of the high proportion
of cases which also involve alcohol use and the lack of proper
control groups. There, the extent marijuana contributes to
traffic accident causality remains obscure. Results from driving
simulator and closed-course tests show that THC in single inhaled
doses up to about 250 mcg / kg has relatively minor effects on
driving performance, certainly less than blood alcohol
concentrations (BAC's) in the range of 0.08-0.10 g %.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter Two describes the studies of the
program and certain procedures that were common to all. These
were subject recruiting, compliance with ethical and legal
standards, screening for the presence of other illicit drugs and
alcohol, blood sampling procedures and quantitative analyses.
Subjects in all studies were recreational users of cannabis, i.e.
smoking marijuana or hashish more than once a month but not
daily. They were all healthy, between 21 and 40 years of age, had
normal weight and binocular acuity, and were licensed to drive an
automobile. Subjects were accompanied in every driving test by a
licensed driving instructor, experienced in supervising subjects
who operated under the influence of medicinal drugs in previous
studies. Redundant control system in the test vehicle was
available for controlling the car if emergency situations should
arise. Marijuana and placebo marijuana cigarettes were supplied
by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). [Isn't it
curious that a study done in the Netherlands used NIDA supplied
marijuana? It is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get NIDA supplied marijuana
in the U.S. for these kind of studies or medical studies.]</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter Three presents the results of the pilot
study. It was conducted in a hospital under strict medical
supervision to identify THC doses that recreational marijuana
users were likely to consume before driving. Twenty-four
subjects, twelve males and twelve females, participated. They
were allowed to smoke part or all of the THC content in three
cigarettes until achieving the desired psychological effect.
Cigarettes were smoked through a plastic holder in a manner
determined by the subjects. The only requirement was to smoke
continuously for a perod not exceeding 15 minutes. When subjects
voluntarily stopped smoking, cigarettes were carefully
extinguished and retained for subsequent gravimetric estimation
of THC consumed. Six subjects consumed one cigarette, thirteen
smoked two and four smoked three. The average amount of THC
consumed was 20.8 mg, after adjustment for body weight, 308 mcg /
kg [of body weight]. There was no significant difference between
males and females with respect to the weight adjusted preferred
dose. It was decided that the maximum dose for subsequent driving
studies would be 300 mcg / kg. This is considerably higher than
doses that have usually been administered to subjects in
experimental studies (typically, 100-200 mcg / kg THC).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The study provided the opportunity for
obtaining valuable information about THC's pharmacokinetics and
its pharmacodynamic effects after marijuana smoking. Blood
samples were repeatedly taken for measuring plasma concentrations
of THC and its major inactive metabolite, THC-COOH. The subjects
repeatedly performed certain simple laboratory tests, estimated
their levels of intoxication and indicated their willingnes to
drive under several specified conditions of urgency. Heart rate
was measured at these times. The secondary purpose of the pilot
study was that of specifying relationships between (THC) and
(THC-COOH) with changes in the other physiological, performance
or subjective variables. Other results from the pilot study
showed that perceived &quot;high&quot; and heart rate are very
sensitive measures of marijuana intoxication which confirms prior
findings. Impairments in laboratory tests performance were found
at the time of peak subjective feelings but generally, objective
impairment dissipated more rapidly than lthe feelings themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first driving study, described in Chapter
Four, was conducted on a highway closed to other traffic. One
objective of the study was to determine whether it would be safe
to repeat the study on a normal highway in the presence of other
traffic. The second objective was to define the dose-effect
relationship between inhaled THC dose and driving performance.
The same twelve men and twelve women who participated in the
pilot study served again as the subjects. They were treated on
separate occasions with THC doses of 0, 100, 200, 300 mcg / kg.
Treatments were administered double-blind and in a
counterbalanced order. On each occasion, subjects performed a
road tracking test beginning 40 minutes after initiation of
smoking and repeated one hour later. The test, developed and
standardized by O'Hanlon et al. (1982, 1986), involved
maintaining a constant speed at 90 km / h (56 mph) and a steady
lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the traffic
lane. Subjects drove 22 km (13.6 mi) on a primary highway and
were accompanied by a licensed driving instructor. The latter was
charged with responsibility for ensuring safety at all times and
was able to intervene, if necessary, using redundant vehicular
controls. The primary dependent variable was the standard
deviation of lateral position (SDLP), which has been shown to be
both highly reliable and very sensitive to the influence of
sedative drugs and alcohol. Other dependent variables were mean
speed, and standard deviation of speed and steering wheel angle.
Blood samples were taken prior to each driving test; and,
performance in critical tracking and hand steadiness tests, heart
rate, and blood pressure were measured after its termination.
Questionnaires were repeatedly administered to estimate the
&quot;high&quot; and other subjective feelings. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">All subjects were willing and able to finish
the driving tests without great difficulty. The study
demonstrated that marijuana impairs driving performance as
measured by an increase in SDLP; all three THC doses
significantly affected SDLP relative to placebo. The driving
performance decrement after smoking marijuana persisted almost
undiminished for two hours after smoking while drug plasma
concentrations, perceived &quot;high&quot; and heart rate
elevation had decreased. Marijuana's effects on SDLP were
compared to those of alcohol obtained in a very similar study by
Louwerens et al. (1985, 1987). It appeared that THC's effects on
SDLP were equivalent to those associated with BAC's in the range
of 0.03-0.07 g %. Other driving performance measures were not
significantly affected by THC. Intersubject correlations between
plasma concentrations of the drug and driving performance after
every dose were essentially nil. Thus, driving impairment cannot
be predicted by prevailing plasma concentrations of THC or
THC-COOH. Driving impairment was also not related to performance
in the laboratory tests. Both the observed degree of driving
impairment, and what subjects said and did, indicated that normal
safeguards would be sufficient for ensuring safety in further
testing. Hence, the final conclusion was to repeat this study on
a normal highway in the presence of other traffic.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second driving study, described in Chapter
Five, was conducted to come a step closer to driving reality than
its predecessor. Driving tests were now conducted on a highway in
the presence of other traffic. The major objective of this study
was to confirm the relationship between inhaled THC dose and
lateral position variability in the context of a standard road
tracking test. A secondary objective was to measure performance
in another actual driving test, i.e. car following. The third
objective was to continue efforts to correlate plasma
concentrations of THC and THC-COOH with driving performance
impairment as measured in both tests.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A new group of sixteen subjects, equally
comprised of men and women, participated in this study. A
conservative approach was chosen in designing the present study
in order to satisfy the series design where both active drug and
placebo conditions were administered, double-blind, at each of
three THC dose levels. THC doses were the same as those used in
the previous study, namely 100, 200, and 300 mcg / kg. Cigarettes
appeared identical at each level of treatment conditions and were
smoked through a plastic holder in a fashion determined by the
subject within a time limit of 10 minutes. If any subject would
have reacted in an unacceptable manner to a lower dose, he / she
would not have been permitted to receive a higher dose.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Two subjects at a time commenced smoking.
Thirty minutes after onset of smoking the subjects performed a
battery of laboratory tests (tracking, hand steadiness and body
sway), yielded a blood sample, and rated their &quot;high&quot;
and other subjective feelings. They were then transported to a
primary highway where the driving tests were performed. Two
instrumented vehicles were employed. The subjects performed the
car following test on a 16 km (9.9 mi) segment of the highway for
about twelve minutes. After conclusion of the car following test,
both subjects then commenced the road tracking test in separate
instrumented vehicles. The highway was the same as for the car
following test. Subjects drove 64 km (40 mi) without stopping in
about 50 minutes. At the conclusion of this test, both subjects
participated again in the car following test. Subjects were then
transported back to the laboratory where they rated subjective
feelings, yielded a blood sample, and repeated the test battery.
The subjects' heart rate was registered continuously during both
driving tests.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The road tracking test was the same as in the
previous study except for its duration and the presence of other
traffic. Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant speed of
95 km / h (59 mph) and a steady lateral position between lane
boundaries in the right traffic lane. They were allowed to
deviate from this only if it would become necessary to pass a
slower vehicle in the same lane. Data from the standart test were
analyzed to yield the same performance measures as in the
previous study; i.e. SDLP, mean and standard deviation of speed,
and standard deviation of steering wheel angle. The car following
test measures drivers' ability to perceive changes in a preceding
vehicle's speed and to react in a manner maintaining a constant
headway. It began as the preceding and the following vehicle,
respectively driven by one of the driving instructors and the
subject, operated in tandem on the slower traffic lane while
travelling at a speed of 100 km / h (62 mph). The subject was
instructed to maintain a 50 m (164 ft) headway however the
preceding vehicle's speed might vary. After driving in this
manner for about one minute, the operator of the preceding
vehicle released the accelerator pedal allowing its speed to fall
to 80 km / h (50 mph). Immediately thereafter, the operator of
the preceding vehicle accelerated to 100 km / (62 mph). The
duration of one deceleration and acceleration maneuver was
approximately 50 seconds and six to eight, depending upon traffic
density, were executed during one test. The subject's average
reaction time to the movements of the leading vehicle, mean
headway and coefficient of variation of headway during maneuvers
were taken as the dependent variables from this. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">All subjects were able to complete the series
without suffering any untoward reaction while driving. Road
tracking performance in the standard test was impaired in a
dose-related manner by THC and confirmed the results obtained in
the previous closed highway study. The 100 mcg / kg dose produced
a slight elevation in mean SDLP, albeit nearly significant. The
200 mcg / kg dose produced a significant elevation, of dubious
practical relevance. The 300 mcg / kg dose produced a highly
significant elevation which may be viewed as practically relevant
but unexceptional in comparison with similarly measured effects
of many medicinal drugs. Following marijuana smoking subjects
drove with an average speed that was only slightly lower than
after placebo and very close to the prescribed level.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the car following test, subjects maintained
a headway of 45-50 m (148-164 ft) while driving in the successive
placebo conditions. They lengthened mean headway by 8, 6 and 2 m
(26.2, 19.7 and 6.6 ft) in the corresponding THC conditions after
100, 200 and 300 mcg / kg, respectively. The initially large
drug-placebo difference and its subsequent decline is a
surprising result. Our explanation for this observation is that
the subjects' caution was greatest the first time they undertook
the test under the influence of THC and progressively less
thereafter. Reaction time to changes in the preceding vehicle's
speed increased following THC treatment, relative to placebo. The
administered THC dose was inversely related to the change in
reaction time, as it was to headway. However, increased reaction
times were partly due to longer headway. Statistical adjustment
for this confounding resulted in smaller and non-significant
increases in reaction time following marijuana treatment, the
greatest impairment (0.32 s) being observed in the first test
following the lowest THC dose. Headway variability followed a
similar pattern as mean headway and reaction time; the greatest
impairment was found following the lowest dose.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">An important practical objective of this study
was to determine whether degrees of driving impairment can be
accurately predicted from either measured concentrations of THC
in plasma or performance measured in potential roadside
&quot;sobriety&quot; tests of tracking ability or hand and
posture stability. The results, like many reported before,
indicate that none of these measures accurately predicts changes
in actual driving performance under the influence of THC.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The program then proceeded into the third
driving study, presented in Chapter Six, which involved tests
conducted in high-density urban traffic. There were logical and
safety reasons for restricting the THC dose to 100 mcg / kg. It
was given to a group of regular cannabis users, along with
placebo. For comparative purposes another group of regular
alcohol users were treated with a modest dose of their preferred
recreational drug, and again placebo, before undertaking the same
city driving test. Two groups of sixteen new subjects apiece,
equally comprised of men and women, participated. Subjects in the
alcohol group were regular users of alcohol but not marijuana.
Both groups were treated on separate occasions with active drug
and placebo. Active marijuana was administered to deliver 100 mcg
/ kg THC. The driving test commenced 30 minutes after smoking.
The alcohol dose was chosen to yield a BAC approaching 0.05 g %
when the driving test commenced 45 minutes after onset of
drinking. Active drug and placebo conditions were administered
double-blind and in a counterbalanced order in each group.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Driving tests were conducted in daylight over a
constant 17.5 km (10.9 mi) route within the city limits of
Maastricht. Subjects drove their placebo and active drug rides
through heavy, medium and low density traffic on the same day of
the week, and at the same time of day. Two scoring methods were
employed in the present study. The first, &quot;molar&quot;
approach, required the driving instructor acting as the safety
controller during the tests to retrospectively rate the driver's
performance using a standard scale. The second, a more
&quot;molecular&quot; approach, involved the employment of a
specially trained observer who applied simple and strict criteria
for recording when the driver made or failed to make each in a
series of observable responses at predetermined points along a
chosen route. Immediately prior to and following the driving
tests subjects performed hand steadiness and time perception
tests, yielded a blood sample, and were administered the same
subjective questionnaires used in the previous studies. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The study showed that a modest dose of alcohol
(BAC = 0.04 g %) produced a significant impairment in city
driving as measured by the molar approach, relative to placebo.
More specifically, alcohol impaired vehicle handling and traffic
maneuvers. Marijuana, administered in a dose of 100 mcg / kg THC,
on the other hand, did not signifcantly change mean driving
performance as measured by this approach. Neither alcohol nor
marijuana significantly affected driving performance measures
obtained by the molecular approach indicating that it may be
relatively insensitive to drug-induced changes. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Driving quality as rated by the subjects
contrasted with observer ratings. Alcohol impaired driving
performance according to the driving instructor but subjects did
not perceive it; marijuana did not impair driving performance but
the subjects themselves perceived their driving performance as
such. Both groups reported about the same amount of effort in
accomplishing the driving test following placebo Yet only
subjects in the ;marijuana group reported significantly higher
levels of invested effort following the active drug. Thus, there
was evidence that subjects in the marijuana group were not only
aware of their intoxicated condition but were also attempting to
compensate for it. These seem to be important findings. They
support both the common belief that drivers become overconfident
after drinking alcohol and investigators' suspicions that they
become more cautious and self-critical after consuming low THC
doses by smoking marijuana. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The laboratory performance tests also
discriminated between the drugs' effects. Hand steadiness was
impaired following THC and improved following alcohol, relative
to placebo. The difference between the drugs' effects was
significant, both before and after the driving test. Impairment
after THC was about as much as that produced by the same dose in
the previous study, indicating equivalent sensitivities of the
present and previous groups. Production of time intervals was not
affected by alcohol, but THC significantly shortened interval
production, relative to placebo.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Drug plasma concentrations were neither related
to absolute driving performance scores nor to the changes that
occurred from placebo to drug conditions. With respect to THC,
these results confirm the findings in previous studies. They are
somewhat surprising for alcohol but may be due to the restricted
range of ethanol concentrations in the plasma of different
subjects. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter Seven concludes the report with a
general discussion of the results of the program and ends with
list of conclusions and recommendations. It starts with a
discussion of the THC dose which marijuana users actually prefer
for achieving their desired &quot;high.&quot; Several questions
are raised and discussed, such as: how do people regulate their
THC consumption, what role plays familiarization with the drug,
and what would the preferred dose have been if marijuana of much
higher potency were smoked. The discussion then continues with a
description of the differences between the driving tests in terms
of the type of information processing each requires, automatic vs
controlled, and the relevance of each to traffic safety.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Attention is further focussed on the effects of
THC on driving performance. The results of the studies
corroborate those of previous driving simulator and closed-course
tests by indicating that THC in single inhaled doses up to 300
mcg /kg has significant, yet not dramatic, dose-related impairing
effects on driving performance. Standard deviation of lateral
position in the road tracking test was the most sensitive measure
for revealing THC's adverse effects. This is because road
tracking is primarily controlled by an automatic information
processing system which operates outside of conscious control The
process is relatively impervious to environmental changes but
highly vulnerable to internal factors that retard the flow if
information through the system. THC and many other drugs are
among these factors. When they interfere with the process that
restricts SDLP, there is little the afflicted individual can do
by way of compensation to restore the situation. Car following
and, to a greater extent, city driving performance depend more on
controlled information processing and are therefore more
accesible for compensatory mechanisms that reduce the decrements
or abolish them entirely.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It appears that performance is more affected by
THC in laboratory than actual driving tests. Several reasons that
may account for the apparent discrepancy are discussed. First,
laboratory tests are experimentally controlled by drastic
simplification which may affect a subjects motivation to perform
the test by making it appear &quot;unreal.&quot; Secondly, the
restriction of response options in laboratory performance tests
leave fewer possibilities for compensation. In real life, drivers
always apply numerous skills in parallel and series. Should one
become deficient, they are often able to compensate in a number
of ways to achieve a satisfactory level of proficiency. Finally,
after learning to drive, subjects possess such skills in
abundance and one can only demonstrate how they vary with drug
effects in the real task or a very close approximation thereof.
Profound drug impairment constituting an obvious traffic safety
hazard could as easily be demonstrated in a laboratory
performance test as anywhere else. But THC is not a profoundly
impairing drug. It does affect automatic information processing,
even after low doses, but not to any great extent after high
doses. It apparently affects controlled information processing in
a variety of laboratory tests, but not to the extent which is
beyond the individual's ability to control when he is motivated
and permitted to do so in real driving.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Marijuana's effects on driving performance were
compared to those of many other drugs. It was concluded that
THC's effects after doses up to 300 mcg / kg never exceed
alcohol's at BAC's of 0.08 g %; and were in no way unusual
compared to many medicinal drugs'. Yet THC's effects differ
qualitatively from many other drugs, especially alcohol. Evidence
from the present and previous studies stronly suggests that
alcohol encourages risky driving whereas THC encourages greater
caution, at least in experiments. Another way THC seems to differ
qualitatively from many other drugs is that the former's users
seem better able to compensate for its adverse effects while
driving under the influence. Still one can easily imagine
situations where the influence of marijuana smoking might have an
exceedingly dangerous effect; i.e., emergency situations which
put high demands on the driver's information processing capacity,
prolonged monotonous driving, and after THC has been taken with
other drugs, especially alcohol</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Finally, the relation between driving
impairment following marijuana smoking and plasma concentrations
of THC and THC-COOH is discussed. It appears not possible to
conclude anything about a driver's impairment on the basis of his
/ her plasma concentrations of THC and THC-COOH determined in a
single sample. </font></p>

<p>The Swallow And The Other Birds </p>

<p>It happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seeds in a
field where a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about
picking up their food. &quot;Beware of that man,&quot; quoth the
Swallow. &quot;Why, what is he doing?&quot; said the others.
&quot;That is hemp seed he is sowing; be careful to pick up every
one of the seeds, or else you will repent it.&quot; The birds
paid no heed to the Swallow's words, and by and by the hemp grew
up and was made into cord, and of the cords nets were made, and
many a bird that had despised the Swallow's advice was caught in
nets made out of that very hemp. &quot;What did I tell you?&quot;
said the Swallow. </p>

<p>73. Such, then, is the mode in which the kings are buried: as
for the people, when any one dies, his nearest of kin lay him
upon a wagon and take him round to all his friends in succession:
each receives them in turn and entertains them with a banquet,
whereat the dead man is served with a portion of all that is set
before the others; this is done for forty days, at the end of
which time the burial takes place. After the burial, those
engaged in it have to purify themselves, which they do in the
following way. First they well soap and wash their heads; then,
in order to cleanse their bodies, they act as follows: they make
a booth by fixing in the ground three sticks inclined towards one
another, ^1 and stretching around them woolen felts, which they
arrange so as to fit as close as possible: inside the booth a
dish is placed upon the ground, into which they put a number of
red-hot stones, and then add some hemp-seed. </p>

<p>74. Hemp grows in Scythia: it is very like flax; only that it
is a much coarser and taller plant: some grows wild about the
country, some is produced by cultivation: ^2 the Thracians make
garments of it which closely resemble linen; so much so, indeed,
that if a person has never seen hemp he is sure to think they are
linen, and if he has, unless he is very experienced in such
matters, he will not know of which material they are. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed,
        and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the
        red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such
        a vapour as no Grecian vapour- bath can exceed; the
        Scyths, delighted, shout for joy, and this vapour serves
        them instead of a water-bath; for they never by any
        chance wash their bodies with water. Their women make a
        mixture of cypress, cedar, and frankincense wood, which
        they pound into a paste upon a rough piece of stone,
        adding a little water to it. With this substance, which
        is of a thick consistency, they plaster their faces all
        over, and indeed their whole bodies. A sweet odour is
        thereby imparted to them, and when they take off the
        plaster on the day following, their skin is clean and
        glossy. </li>

<p>It was the place won by his own sword from the Aztecs previous
to the siege of Mexico. It stood on the southern slope of the
Cordilleras, and overlooked a wide expanse of country, the
fairest and most flourishing portion of his own domain. He had
erected a stately palace on the spot, and henceforth made this
city his favorite residence. It was well situated for
superintending his vast estates, and he now devoted himself to
bringing them into proper cultivation. He introduced the
sugar-cane from Cuba, and it grew luxuriantly in the rich soil of
the neighboring lowlands. He imported large numbers of merino
sheep and other cattle, which found abundant pastures in the
country around Tehuantepec. His lands were thickly sprinkled with
groves of mulberry-trees, which furnished nourishment for the
silk-worm. He encouraged the cultivation of hemp and flax, and,
by his judicious and enterprising husbandry, showed the capacity
of the soil for the culture of valuable products before unknown
in the land; and he turned these products to the best account, by
the erection or sugar-mills, and other works for the manufacture
of the raw material. He thus laid the foundation of an opulence
for his family, as substantial, if not as speedy, as that derived
from the mines. Yet this latter source of wealth was not
neglected by him, and he drew gold from the region of
Tehuantepec, and silver from that of Zacatecas. The amount
derived from these mines was not so abundant as at a later day.
But the expense of working them, on the other hand, was much less
in the earlier stages of the operation, when the metal lay so
much nearer the surface. </p>

<p>&quot;But let us imagine to ourselves a country where so great
a difference is not made between the several conditions; where
the life of a nobleman is not made to consist in idleness and
doing nothing, but in a careful preservation of his liberty, that
is, in a due subjection to the laws and the constitution; by a
man's subsisting upon his estate without dependence on any one,
and being contented to enjoy a little with liberty, rather than a
great deal at the price of mean and base compliances: a country,
where sloth, effeminacy, and the ignorance of things necessary
for life, are held in just contempt, and where pleasure is less
valued than health and bodily strength: in such a country, it
will be much more for a man's reputation to plough, and keep
flocks, than to waste all his hours in sauntering from place to
place, in gaming, and expensive diversions.&quot; But we need not
have recourse to Plato's commonwealth for instances of men who
have led these useful lives. It was thus that the greatest part
of mankind lived during near four thousand years; and that not
only the Israelites, but the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the
Romans, that is to say, nations the most civilized, and most
renowned for arms and wisdom. They all inculcate the regard which
ought to be paid to agriculture and the breeding of cattle; one
of which (without saying any thing of hemp and flax, so necessary
for our clothing,) supplies us, by corn, fruits, and pulse, with
not only a plentiful but a delicious nourishment; and the other,
besides its supply of exquisite meats to cover our tables, almost
alone gives life to manufactures and trade, by the skins and
stuffs it furnishes. </p>

Round The World. </p>

<p>Author: Cook, Captain James </p>

<p>Date: 1779 </p>

<p>Part V. </p>

<p>In Eaheinomauwe there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats; at
least, no other were seen by our voyagers, and the rats are so
scarce, that they wholly escaped the notice of many on board. Of
birds the species are not numerous; and of these no one kind,
excepting perhaps the gannet, is exactly the same with those of
Europe. Insects are not in greater plenty than birds. The sea
makes abundant recompense for this scarcity of animals upon the
land. Every creek swarms with fish, which are not only wholesome,
but equally delicious with those in our part of the world. The
Endeavour seldom anchored in any station, or with a light gale
passed any place, that did not afford enough, with a hook and
line, to serve the whole ship's company. If the seine was made
use of, it seldom failed of producing a still more ample supply.
The highest luxury of this kind, with which the English were
gratified, was the lobster, or sea cray-fish. Among the vegetable
productions of the country, the trees claim a principal place;
there being forests of vast extent, full of the straightest, the
cleanest, and the largest timber Mr. Cook and his friends had
ever seen. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were gratified by the
novelty, if not by the variety of the plants. Out of about four
hundred species, there were not many which had hitherto been
described by botanists. There is one plant that serves the
natives instead of hemp and flax, and which excels all that are
applied to the same purposes in other countries. </p>

<p>On The Present Ability Of America. With Some Miscellaneous
Reflections. </p>

<p>In almost every article of defence we abound. Hemp flourishes
even to rankness, so that we need not want cordage. Our iron is
superior to that of other countries. Our small arms are equal to
any in the world. Cannon we can cast at pleasure. Saltpetre and
gunpowder we are every day producing. Our knowledge is hourly
improving. Resolution is our inherent character, and courage hath
never yet forsaken us. Wherefore, what is it that we want? Why is
it that we hesitate? From Britain we can expect nothing but ruin.
If she is once admitted to the government of America again, this
continent will not be worth living in. Jealousies will be always
arising, insurrections will be constantly happening; and who will
go forth to quell them? Who will venture his life to reduce his
own countrymen to a foreign obedience? The difference between
Pennsylvania and Connecticut, respecting some unlocated lands,
shows the insignificance of a British government, and fully
proves that nothing but continental authority can regulate
continental matters. </p>

<p>Single Centres Of Supposed Creation </p>

<p>Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in
the transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how
frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast
distances across the ocean. We may safely assume that under such
circumstances their rate of flight would often be thirty-five
miles an hour; and some authors have given a far higher estimate.
I have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through
the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured
through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the course of
two months, I picked up in my garden twelve kinds of seeds, out
of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and
some of them, which were tried, germinated. But the following
fact is more important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric
juice, and do not, as I know by trial, injure in the least the
germination of seeds; now, after a bird has found and devoured a
large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the
grains do not pass into the gizzard for twelve or even eighteen
hours. A bird in this interval might easily be blown to the
distance of five hundred miles, and hawks are known to look out
for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus
readily get scattered. Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole,
and, after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge
pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the Zoological
Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of the
oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated
after having been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs
of different birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after
having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours.
Fresh-water fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and water
plants; fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds
might be transported from place to place. I forced many kinds of
seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies
to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an
interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or
passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds
retained the power of germination. Certain seeds, however, were
always killed by this process. </p>

<p>Chapter II </p>

<p>Moral And Political Philosophy </p>

<p>Wang Ch'ung, who wrote toward the end of the first century of
our era, occupies in some respects a place apart in the history
of Chinese thought. He may be described as a materialistic
monist, and his physical philosophy somewhat resembles that of
Epicurus and Lucretius. At the beginning there was a homogeneous
vaporous or nebulous chaos. Out of this the lighter and the
heavier elements &quot;spontaneously&quot; - that is, without
intelligence or design - separated; the warm and light (elemental
fire) above, the cold and dark, represented by water, below. So
he adapts the old doctrines of Yang and Yin, fortifying himself
by quotations from the Yih-king and the Li-ki. The Taoist
Lieh-tsze developed a similar theory; but Wang Ch'ung, as pure
materialist, has no use for the mystical Tao nor for the primal
intelligence of Chu Hi and the Sung Confucianists. From the
combination and spontaneous interaction of these principles all
things arise. Man's body is of coarse matter, Yin; his vital
spirit and intelligence are of the fiery nature of the Yang.
Heaven - that is, the sky - is material just as truly as the
earth, only of a different composition, and its operations are
equally without design. It does not take note of men's doings to
punish the bad and reward the good. Heaven does not speak, nor
does it hear what men say; divination is absurd - how can the
shell of a dead tortoise or the stalks of a withered weed elicit
a response from Heaven! &quot;Some people think that Heaven
produces grain for the purpose of feeding mankind, and silk and
hemp to clothe them. That would make Heaven man's farmer or
mulberry-girl!&quot; The philosopher is fond of pricking man's
self-importance. To this vast frame of nature we are no more than
insects crawling on a human body. The struggle for existence is
proof that there is no wise and good purpose in creation.
&quot;If Heaven had produced its creatures on purpose, it ought
to have taught them to love one another, and not to prey upon and
destroy one another&quot; - precisely the argument of Epicurus. </p>

<p>Book: Religions Of Japan </p>

<p>Author: Foot Moore, George </p>

<p>Date: 1913 </p>

<p>Chapter I: Part II </p>

<p>To ward off ills caused by demons, especially the demons of
disease, the ancient Japanese sought the protection of a
particular group of gods, the Sahe no Kami, or &quot;preventive
deities&quot;, who are invoked in an old liturgical text to
defend the worshippers against the &quot;hostile and savage
beings of the root country,&quot; such as the &quot;hags of
Hades&quot; who pursued Izanagi. These deities were represented
by phalli, often of gigantic size, which were set up along
highways and especially at cross-roads to bar the passage against
malignant beings who sought to pass. In the liturgy referred to,
one of these gods is called &quot;No Thoroughfare&quot; (Kunado,
or Funado), the name of the staff which Izanagi threw down to
prevent his pursuing spouse from breaking out from Hades into the
world above; two others are the prince and princess of the eight
cross-roads. They had no temples, and were worshipped at the end
of the sixth and twelfth months - the time of the semiannual
lustration - and on occasion at other times, for example, on the
outbreak of a pestilence. The phallic form of the end post of a
balustrade or a bridge has a similar meaning; it keeps evil
influence from passing. The apotropaic virtue of this symbol - a
virtue which it has in many other countries, notably among the
ancient Greeks - is due to the association of virility with manly
strength, power to overcome invisible foes as well as visible,
and to protect those in need of help. Standing as they did on the
roadside and at cross-roads, these gods became the protectors of
the wayfarers; travellers prayed to them before setting out on a
journey and made a little offering of hemp leaves and rice to
each one they passed. These gods had nothing to do, so far as the
evidence shows, with fertility or the reproductive functions; no
peculiar rites were observed in their worship, and however
objectionable to the taste of a more refined age, the cult was in
no sense immoral or conducive to immorality. In modern times, out
of regard to the prejudices of Europeans who connected obscene
notions with them, they have been generally removed from the
roads, remaining only in out-of-the-way corners of the empire. </p>

<p>From the 13th to the 15th of July an All-Souls feast is kept,
at which time it is believed that the souls are permitted to
return to their kindred and be entertained by them. A staging of
bamboo canes is erected in one of the rooms of the house, on
which food and lanterns are placed for the spirits, and a
Buddhist priest reads a mass before them. On the first evening
fires of hemp leaves are lighted before the entrance of the
house, and incense strewed on the coals, as an invitation to the
spirits. At the end of the three days the food that has been set
out for the spirits is wrapped up in mats and thrown into a
river. Dances of a peculiar kind are a conspicuous feature of the
celebration, which is evidently an old Japanese custom; the
Buddhist elements are adscititious. At this season the graves are
decorated, and frequent visits are paid by the kinsfolk. For
those who have no relatives living a mass is said in all the
temples for &quot;the hungry devils.&quot; </p>

east to west being sixty miles and from north to south fifty. Its
area is thirteen hundred square miles. The highest mountains of
the group are those of Majorca, the loftiest peak attaining a
height of forty-eight hundred feet. The climate is mild and
agreeable, and the extremes of heat and cold are seldom of long
duration. Fires are rarely required, except in the coldest
weather. </p>

<p>The soil of these islands on the average is exceedingly
fertile, and produces good crops of wheat, barley, olives,
almonds, grapes, figs, oranges, beans, and hemp. Besides these, a
great variety of other fruits and vegetables are grown for local
consumption. </p>

<p>Minorca is situated about twenty-seven miles northeast of
Majorca and has an area of about two hundred and ninety square
miles. The coast is much indented with bays on all sides except
the south, and the shore in most places is bold and steep. It has
several excellent harbors, the best one of which is Port Mahon,
the capital of the island. The climate of Minorca is mild, but
not so equable as that of Majorca. The soil in general is not
very fertile, that on the plains being scanty and chalky. The
chief products are wheat, barley, wine, oil, potatoes, <b>hemp</b>,
and flax. Fruits of all kinds abound, including melons,
pomegranates, figs, and almonds. Cattle, sheep, and goats are
raised. Stone is plentiful, and a soft kind is much used in
building. The population numbers about thirty-nine thousand. </p>

<p>This adventure of Cabral's had interesting consequences. It
set in motion the train of events which ended after some years in
placing the name &quot;America&quot; upon the map. On May 14,
1501, Vespucius, who was evidently principal pilot and guiding
spirit in this voyage under unknown skies, set sail from Lisbon
with three caravels. It is not quite clear who was chief captain,
but M. Varnhagen has found reasons for believing that it was a
certain Don Nuno Manuel. ^1 The first halt was made on the
African coast at Cape Verde, the first week in June; and there
the explorers met Cabral on his way back from Hindustan.
According to the letter attributed to Vespucius and published in
1827 by Baldelli, ^2 the wealth stowed away in Cabral's ships was
quite startling. &quot;He says there was an immense quantity of
cinnamon, green and dry ginger, pepper, cloves, nutmegs, mace,
musk, civet, storax, benzoin, porcelain, cassia, mastic, incense,
myrrh, red and white sandalwood, aloes, camphor, amber,&quot;
Indian hemp and cypress, as well as opium and other drugs too
numerous to mention. &quot;Of jewels he saw many diamonds,
rubies, and pearls, and one ruby of a most beautiful colour
weighed seven carats and a half, but he did not see all.&quot; ^3
Verily, he says, God has prospered King Emanuel. </p>

<p>Chapter XXIX. Sardinia, Corsica, And Elba. </p>

<p>Next to Sicily, Sardinia is the largest of the islands in the
Mediterranean Sea, having an area of nearly ninety-three hundred
square miles. It lies directly south of Corsica, from which it is
separated by the Strait of Bonifacio, a channel which in its
narrowest part is only seven miles wide. The country is mostly
mountainous, and some of the peaks of the central chain have an
elevation of over six thousand feet. Many of these peaks are
extinct volcanoes. The coasts are as a rule steep and rugged.
There are many streams of water on the island, but only one of
them is even partially navigable, and none of them has a long
course. </p>

<p>The climate is mild, but in the low marshy lands, particularly
in the neighborhood of some of the lakes, a deadly malaria
prevails, especially in autumn. The inhabitants of these parts,
who can afford to do so, migrate annually during the unhealthy
months. Those who remain never leave their houses till an hour
after sunrise, and return before sunset, carefully closing all
doors and windows to prevent the entrance of the poisonous gas.
Between the mountain ranges are several wide valleys noted for
their beauty and fertility. </p>

<p>The principal products are wheat, barley, maize, oranges and
other fruits, all of which are esteemed for their excellent
quality. Grapes are extensively raised; but from carelessness in
the process of making the wine, it is of an inferior quality.
Olive trees are numerous. Cotton, linseed, flax, and hemp are
also produced. Among the trees which grow on the mountain sides
are cork, chestnut, oak, and pine, which form a considerable item
in the export trade. The manufactories of gunpowder, salt, and
tobacco are also of importance. Sardinia is rich in minerals, but
as yet its mines have been little developed. </p>

<p>Chapter 6 The Era of Suspense: 1825-1829 </p>

<p>Throughout the spring of 1828, debate on the tariff filled the
House and Senate. Much of it was uninspired. Representative John
Taylor complained that &quot;day after day passes without any
sensible advance in the public business. One dull prosing speech
after another &amp; arguments for the fiftieth time repeated are
hashed up &amp; dished in new covers.&quot; And one can picture
the House as it looked to Taylor with, as historian Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr., described it, members &quot;lolling back in
armchairs, laughing, coughing, spitting, rattling newspapers,
while some poor speaker tried to talk above the din.&quot; </p>

<p>Through the din, Jacksonians obediently set about antagonizing
the northern manufacturers with a variety of bedeviling
amendments increasing duties on pig iron, flax, hemp, and so
forth. Everyone supposed that the New England senators would join
with the southern anti-protectionists to kill the measure. Daniel
Webster, who had moved from the House to the Senate in the autumn
elections, emerged, to the consternation of many, as one of the
leaders of the pro-tariff forces. On May 9, he offered an
extraordinary spectacle. He stood in front of his colleagues to
explain why he was about to repudiate all the free-trade
arguments he had made in the House in 1824. He was not eloquent,
not the &quot;great cannon loaded to the lips,&quot; but he was
very honest. He offered no moral or intellectual justifications
for the switch. </p>

<p>Even as the debate raged, disillusioned Filipinos rose in
revolt against the United States which, they believed, had
promised them independence. The ruthless suppression of natives
by American troops and the crushing of the independence movement
intensified congressional soul-searching over this latest stage
of American expansionism. The most eloquent defender of the
president's policy was Indiana's new Republican senator,
thirty-seven-year-old Albert Beveridge, who, with his maiden
speech on the Philippine question, leapt to national fame.
&quot;The Philippines are ours forever,&quot; began Beveridge: </p>

<p>And just beyond the Philippines are China's illimitable
markets. We will not retreat from either. We will not repudiate
our duty in the archipelago. We will not abandon our opportunity
in the Orient. We will not renounce our part in the mission of
our race, trustees under God, of the civilization of the world.
God . . . . has marked us as His chosen people, henceforth to
lead in the regeneration of the world . . . . He has made us the
master organizers of the world to establish system where chaos
reigns. He has made us adept in government that we may administer
government among savages and senile peoples. </p>

<p>Beveridge went on to enumerate with zest the riches of the
islands: rice, coffee, sugar, coconuts, hemp, tobacco,
&quot;mountains of coal&quot; - all awaiting development by
American capital. He lightly brushed aside the objections of the
natives. &quot;It is barely possible that a thousand men in the
archipelago are capable of self-government in the Anglo-Saxon
sense.&quot; </p>

mountain ranges in the distance. He believed it was a strait
through which he might pass into the Indian Ocean so he sailed up
the stream a few miles, and anchored. Natives came to him in
canoes from the shores with fruits and vegetables, and friendly
gestures. The men were athletic the women were graceful and the
young ones often beautiful. All were half-clad in mantles made of
skins or feathers depending from one shoulder and the waist, or
in colored hempen tunics; and some of the women who came in the
canoes, whose hair, long and black, hung loosely over their
shoulders and bosoms, wore fillets ornamented with shells and the
quills of the porcupine. They seemed anxious for friendly

like hemp or grass; and that the mandarins applauded the wisdom
of an emperor who repulsed these Barbarians with golden lances.
This extent of savage empire compelled the Turkish monarch to
establish three subordinate princes of his own blood, who soon
forgot their gratitude and allegiance. The conquerors were
enervated by luxury, which is always fatal except to an
industrious people; the policy of China solicited the vanquished
nations to resume their independence and the power of the Turks
was limited to a period of two hundred years. The revival of
their name and dominion in the southern countries of Asia are the
events of a later age; and the dynasties, which succeeded to

<p>Xerxes commanded two other bridges to be built, one for the
army to pass over, and the other for the baggage and beasts of
burden. He appointed workmen more able and expert than the
former, who constructed it in the following manner: they placed
three hundred and sixty vessels across the strait, some of them
having three benches of oars, and others fifty oars a piece, with
their sides turned towards the Euxine sea; and on the side that
faced the Aegean sea they put three hundred and fourteen. They
then cast large anchors into the water on both sides, in order to
fix and secure all these vessels against the violence of the
winds, and against the current of the water. On the east side
they left three passages or vacant spaces between the vessels,
that there might be room for small boats to pass easily, as there
was occasion, to and from the Euxine sea. After this, upon the
land on both sides they drove large piles into the earth, with
huge rings fastened to them, to which were tied six vast cables,
which went over each of the two bridges; two of which cables were
made of hemp, and four of a sort of reeds, called, which were
used in those times in the manufacture of cordage. Those that
were made of hemp must have been of an extraordinary strength and
thickness, since every cubit of those cables weighed a talent.
The cables, laid over the whole extent of the vessels lengthwise,
reached from one side of the sea to the other. When this part of
the work was finished, quite over the vessels lengthwise, and
over the cables we have been speaking of, they laid the trunks of
trees, cut purposely for that use, and flat boats again over
them, fastened and joined together, to serve as a kind of floor
or solid bottom; all which they covered over with earth, and
added rails or battlements on each side, that the horses and
cattle might not be frightened with seeing the sea in their
passage. Such was the construction of those famous bridges built
by Xerxes. </p>

clothing for his troops, and has woolens woven for them in every
city, the material for which is furnished by the tithe aforesaid.
You should know that the Tartars, before they were converted to
the religion of the idolaters, never practiced almsgiving.
Indeed, when any poor man begged of them they would tell him,
&quot;Go with God's curse, for if He loved you as He loves me, He
would have provided for you.&quot; But the sages of the
idolaters, and especially the Bakshis mentioned before, told the
great Khan that it was a good work to provide for the poor, and
that his idols would be greatly pleased if he did so. And since
then he has taken to do for the poor so much as you have heard. </p>

<p>Now we will quit this matter and I will tell you of another
city called Kwa-chau. But first I must mention a point I had
forgotten. You must know that the vessels on this river, in going
up stream, have to be tracked, for the current is so strong that
they could not make head in any other manner. Now the towline,
which is some three hundred paces in length, is made of nothing
but cane. It is in this way: they have those great canes of which
I told you before that they are some fifteen paces in length;
these they take and split from end to end into many slender
strips, and then they twist these strips together so as to make a
rope of any length they please. And the ropes so made are
stronger than if they were made of hemp. </p>

<p>They burn the bodies of the dead. And when any one dies the
friends and relations make a great mourning for the deceased, and
clothe themselves in hempen garments, and follow the corpse
playing on a variety of instruments and singing hymns to their
idols. And when they come to the burning place, they take
representations of things cut out of parchment, such as
caparisoned horses, male and female slaves, camels, armor, suits
of cloth of gold, and money, in great quantities, and these
things they put on the fire along with the corpse, so that they
are all burnt with it. And they tell you that the dead man shall
have all these slaves and animals of which the effigies are
burnt, alive in flesh and blood, and the money in gold, at his
disposal in the next world; and that the instruments which they
have caused to be played at his funeral, and the idol hymns that
have been chanted, shall also be produced again to welcome him in
the next world; and that the idols themselves will come to do him
honor. </p>

<p>The Era Of Warrior Dominance </p>

<p>Despite the chaos and suffering of the warlord period, there
was much economic and cultural growth. Most of the daimyos
clearly recognized the necessity of building up their petty
states if they were to be strong enough to survive in the long
run. Within the domains of the more able daimyos, attempts were
made to stabilize village life by introducing regular tax
collection, supporting the construction of irrigation systems and
other public works, and building strong rural communities.
Incentives were offered to encourage the settlement of unoccupied
areas, and new tools, the greater use of draft animals, and new
crops - especially soybeans - contributed to the well-being of
the peasantry in the better-run domains. Peasants were also
encouraged to produce items such as silk, hemp, paper, dyes, and
vegetable oils, which were highly marketable and thus potential
sources of household income. Daimyos vied with each other to
attract merchants to their growing castle towns, and a new and
quite wealthy commercial class emerged as the purveyors of goods
for the military elite and the intermediaries in trade between
Japan and overseas areas, especially China. As in medieval
Europe, guild organizations for both craftsmen (carpenters,
thatchers, smiths, potters, etc.) and merchants were strong in
this era. They helped provide social solidarity and group
protection in a time of political breakdown and insecurity. </p>

<p>Introduction </p>

<p>The Making Of The European Global Order </p>

<p>In the industrial era, from roughly 1800 onward, the things
that Europeans sought in the outside world as well as the source
of the insecurities that drove them there changed dramatically.
Raw materials - metals, vegetable oils, dyes, cotton, and hemp -
needed to feed the machines of Europe, not spices or manufactured
goods, were the main products the Europeans sought overseas.
Industrialization made Europe for the first time the
manufacturing center of the world, and overseas markets for
machine-made European products became a key concern of those who
pushed for colonial expansion. Christian missionaries, by then as
likely to be Protestant as Roman Catholic, still sought to win
converts overseas. But unlike the rulers of Portugal and Spain in
the early centuries of expansion, European leaders in the
industrial age rarely took initiatives overseas to promote
Christian proselytization. In part this reflected the fact that
western Europe itself was no longer seriously threatened by the
Muslims or any other non-European people. The fears that fueled
European imperialist expansion in the industrial age arose from
internal rivalries between the European powers. Overseaspeoples
might resist the European advance, but the Europeans feared each
other far more than even the largest non- European empires. </p>

<p>Patterns Of Dominance: Continuity And Change </p>

<p>As increasing numbers of the colonized peoples were drawn into
the production of crops or minerals intended for export to
Europe, colonized areas in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia were
reduced to dependence on the industrializing European economies.
Roads and railways were built primarily to facilitate the
movement of farm produce and raw materials from the interior of
colonized areas to port areas where they could be shipped to
Europe. Benefiting from Europe's technological advances, mining
sectors grew dramatically in most of the colonies. Vast areas
that were previously uncultivated or (more commonly) had been
planted in food crops were converted to the production of
commodities - such as cocoa, palm oil, rubber, and hemp - in
great demand in the markets of Europe and, increasingly, the
United States. </p>

<p>Western Intrusions And The Crisis In The Arab Islamic
Heartlands </p>

<p>Though Muhammad Ali's efforts to introduce reforms patterned
after Western precedents were not confined to the military, they
fell far short of a fundamental transformation of Egyptian
society. To shore up his economic base, he ordered the Egyptian
peasantry to expand their production of cotton, hemp, indigo, and
other crops that were in growing demand in industrial Europe.
Efforts to improve Egyptian harbors and extend irrigation works
met with some success and led to modest increases in the revenues
that could be devoted to the continuing modernization of the
military. Attempts to reform education were ambitious but limited
in what was actually achieved. Many of the most significant
innovations in schooling were linked to Muhammad Ali's military
projects. His frequent schemes to build up an Egyptian industrial
sector were eventually frustrated by the opposition of the
European powers and by the intense competition from imported,
Western-manufactured goods. </p>

<p>Of the Different Employment of Capitals </p>

<p>It is of more consequence that the capital of the manufacturer
should reside within the country. It necessarily puts into motion
a greater quantity of productive labour, and adds a greater value
to the annual produce of the land and labour of the society. It
may, however, be very useful to the country, though it should not
reside within it. The capitals of the British manufacturers who
work up the flax and hemp annually imported from the coasts of
the Baltic, are surely very useful to the countries which produce
them. Those materials are a part of the surplus produce of those
countries which, unless it was annually exchanged for something
which is in demand there, would be of no value, and would soon
cease to be produced. The merchants who export it, replace the
capitals of the people who produce it, and thereby encourage them
to continue the production; and the British manufacturers replace
the capitals of those merchants. </p>

<p>. . . . . . </p>

<p>The foreign goods for home-consumption may sometimes be
purchased, not with the produce of domestick industry, but with
some other foreign goods. These last, however, must have been
purchased either immediately with the produce of domestick
industry, or with something else that had been purchased with it;
for the case of war and conquest excepted, foreign goods can
never be acquired, but in exchange for something that had been
produced at home, either immediately, or after two or more
different exchanges. The effects, therefore, of a capital
employed in such a round-about foreign trade of consumption, are,
in every respect, the same as those of one employed in the most
direct trade of the same kind, except that the final returns are
likely to be still more distant, as they must depend upon the
returns of two or three distinct foreign trades. If the flax and
hemp of Riga are purchased with the tobacco of Virginia, which
had been purchased with British manufactures, the merchant must
wait for the returns of two distinct foreign trades before he can
employ the same capital in re-purchasing a like quantity of
British manufactures. If the tobacco of Virginia had been
purchased, not with British manufactures, but with the sugar and
rum of Jamaica which had been purchased with those manufactures,
he must wait for the returns of three. If those two or three
distinct foreign trades should happen to be carried on by two or
three distinct merchants, of whom the second buys the goods
imported by the first, and the third buys those imported by the
second, in order to export them again, each merchant indeed will
in this case receive the returns of his own capital more quickly;
but the final returns of the whole capital employed in the trade
will be just as slow as ever. Whether the whole capital
employment in such a round-about trade belong to one merchant or
to three, can make no difference with regard to the country,
though it may with regard to the particular merchants. Three
times a greater capital must in both cases be employed, in order
to exchange a certain value of British manufactures for a certain
quantity of flax and hemp, than would have been necessary, had
the manufactures and the flax and hemp been directly exchanged
for one another. The whole capital employed, therefore, in such a
round-about foreign trade of consumption, will generally give
less encouragement and support to the productive labour of the
country, than an equal capital employed in a more direct trade of
the same kind. </p>

<p>Conclusion of the Mercantile System </p>

<p>The first bounties of this kind were those granted, about the
beginning of the present century, upon the importation of naval
stores from America. Under this denomination were comprehended
timber fit for masts, yards, and bowsprits; hemp; tar, pitch, and
turpentine. The bounty, however, of one pound the ton upon
masting-timber, and that of six pounds the ton upon hemp, were
extended to such as should be imported into England from
Scotland. Both these bounties continued without any variation, at
the same rate, till they were severally allowed to expire; that
upon hemp on the 1st of January 1741, and that upon
masting-timber at the end of the session of parliament
immediately following the 24th June 1781. </p>

<p>&#133;&#133;&#133; </p>

<p>The third bounty of this kind was that granted (much about the
time that we were beginning sometimes to court and sometimes to
quarrel with our American colonies) by the 4 Geo. III. chap. 26.
upon the importation of hemp, or undressed flax, from the British
plantations. This bounty was granted for twenty-one years, from
the 24th June 1764, to the 24th June 1785. For the first seven
years it was to be at the rate of eight pounds the ton, for the
second at six pounds, and for the third at four pounds. It was
not extended to Scotland, of which the climate (although hemp is
sometimes raised there, in small quantities and of an inferior
quality) is not very fit for that produce. Such a bounty upon the
importation of Scotch flax into England would have been too great
a discouragement to the native produce of the southern part of
the united kingdom. </p>

<p>&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.. </p>

<p>The seventh and last bounty of this kind, was that granted by
the 19 Geo. III. chap. 37. upon the importation of hemp from
Ireland. It was granted in the same manner as that for the
importation of hemp and undressed flax from America, for
twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1779, to the 24th June 1800.
This term is divided, likewise, into three periods of seven years
each; and in each of those periods, the rate of the Irish bounty
is the same with that of the American. It does not, however, like
the American bounty, extend to the importation of undressed flax.
It would have been too great a discouragement to the cultivation
of that plant in Great Britain. When this last bounty was
granted, the British and Irish legislatures were not in much
better humour with one another, than the British and American had
been before. But this boon to Ireland, it is to be hoped, has
been granted under more fortunate auspices, than all those to
America. </p>

they eat nothing but bran, which they take mixed with hot water.
That is their food: bran, and nothing but bran; and water for

life is one of extraordinary asceticism. They have great idols,
and plenty of them; but they sometimes also worship fire. The
other idolaters who are not of this sect call these people

<p>In Scotland there is no general law which regulates
universally the duration of apprenticeships. The term is
different in different corporations. Where it is long, a part of
it may generally be redeemed by paying a small fine. In most
towns, too, a very small fine is sufficient to purchase the
freedom of any corporation. The weavers of linen and hempen
cloth, the principal manufactures of the country, as well as all
other artificers subservient to them, wheel-makers, reel-makers,
&amp;c. may exercise their trades in any town corporate without
paying any fine. In all towns corporate all persons are free to
sell butcher's meat upon any lawful day of the week. Three years
is in Scotland a common term of apprenticeship, even in some very
nice trades; and in general I know of no country in Europe in
which corporation laws are so little oppressive. </p>

<p>Title: Benjamin Franklin Experiments With Electricity </p>

<p>Author: Bigelow, John;Franklin, Benjamin </p>

<p>Date: 1747 </p>

<p>&quot;It was not till the summer of 1752 that he was enabled
to complete his grand and unparalleled discovery by experiment.
The plan which he had originally proposed was to erect, on some
high tower or other elevated place, a sentry-box, from which
should rise a pointed iron rod, insulated by being fixed in a
cake of resin. Electrified clouds passing over this would, he
conceived, impart to it a portion of their electricity, which
would be rendered evident to the senses by sparks being emitted
when a key, the knuckle, or other conductor was presented to it.
Philadelphia at this time afforded no opportunity of trying an
experiment of this kind. While Franklin was waiting for the
erection of a spire, it occurred to him that he might have more
ready access to the region of clouds by means of a common kite.
He prepared one by fastening two cross sticks to a silken
handkerchief, which would not suffer so much from the rain as
paper. To the upright stick was affixed an iron point. The string
was, as usual, of hemp, except the lower end, which was silk.
Where the hempen string terminated, a key was fastened. With this
apparatus, on the appearance of a thunder-gust approaching he
went out into the commons, accompanied by his son, to whom alone
he communicated his intentions, well knowing the ridicule which,
too generally for the interest of science, awaits unsuccessful
experiments in philosophy. He placed himself under a shed, to
avoid the rain; his kite was raised, a thunder-cloud passed over
it, no sign of electricity appeared. He almost despaired of
success, when suddenly he observed the loose fibres of his string
to move toward an erect position. He now presented his knuckle to
the key and received a strong spark. How exquisite must his
sensations have been at this moment! On this experiment depended
the fate of his theory. If he succeeded, his name would rank high
among those who had improved science; if he failed, he must
inevitably be subjected to the derision of mankind, or, what is
worse, their pity, as a well-meaning man, but a weak, silly
projector. The anxiety with which he looked for the result of his
experiment may be easily conceived. Doubts and despair had begun
to prevail, when the fact was ascertained, in so clear a manner
that even the most incredulous could no longer withhold their
assent. Repeated sparks were drawn from the key, a vial was
charged, a shock given, and all the experiments made which are
usually performed with electricity. </p>

<p>The fifth of June, being in 43 degrees towards the pole
Arctic, we found the air so cold, that our men being grievously
pinched with the same, complained of the extremity thereof; and
the further we went, the more the cold increased upon us.
Whereupon we thought it best for that time to seek the land, and
did so; finding it not mountainous, but low plain land, till we
came within 38 degrees towards the line. In which height it
pleased God to send us into a fair and good bay, with a good wind
to enter the same. In this bay we anchored; and the people of the
country, having their houses close by the water's side, shewed
themselves unto us, and sent a present to our General. When they
came unto us, they greatly wondered at the things that we
brought. But our General, according to his natural and accustomed
humanity, courteously intreated them, and liberally bestowed on
them necessary things to cover their nakedness; whereupon they
supposed us to be gods, and would not be persuaded to the
contrary. The presents which they sent to our General, were
feathers, and cauls of network. Their houses are digged round
about with earth, and have from the uttermost brims of the
circle, clifts of wood set upon them, joining close together at
the top like a spire steeple, which by reason of that closeness
are very warm. Their bed is the ground with rushes strowed on it;
and lying about the house, [they] have the fire in the midst. The
men go naked; the women take bulrushes, and kemb them after the
manner of hemp, and thereof make their loose garments, which
being knit about their middles, hang down about their hips,
having also about their shoulders a skin of deer, with the hair
upon it. These women are very obedient and serviceable to their
husbands. </p>

<p>Volume I </p>

<p>Chapter XVII: Stone's Landing Becomes City Of Napoleon - On
Paper </p>

<p>Twain, Mark; Warner, Charles Dudley , 1873 </p>

<p>About the chief cabin, which was the store and grocery of this
mart of trade, the mud was more liquid than elsewhere, and the
rude platform in front of it and the dry-goods boxes mounted
thereon were places of refuge for all the loafers of the place.
Down by the stream was a dilapidated building which served for a <b>hemp</b>
warehouse, and a shaky wharf extended out from it into the water.
In fact, a flat-boat was there moored by it, its setting poles
lying across the gunwales. Above the town the stream was crossed
by a crazy wooden bridge, the supports of which leaned all ways
in the soggy soil; the absence of a plank here and there in the
flooring made the crossing of the bridge faster than a walk an
offense not necessary to be prohibited by law. </p>

<p>&quot;This, gentlemen,&quot; said Jeff, &quot;is Columbus
River, alias Goose Run. If it was widened, and deepened, and
straightened, and made long enough, it would be one of the finest
rivers in the Western country.&quot; </p>

<p>&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;. </p>

<p>When the conveyance at length drew up to Mr. Thompson's door,
the gentleman descended with great deliberation, straightened
himself up, rubbed his hands, and, beaming satisfaction from
every part of his radiant frame, advanced to the group that was
gathered to welcome him, and which had saluted him by name as
soon as he came within hearing. </p>

<p>&quot;Welcome to Napoleon, gentlemen, welcome. I am proud to
see you here Mr. Thompson. You are looking well Mr. Sterling.
This is the country, sir. Right glad to see you Mr. Brierly. You
got that basket of champagne? No? Those blasted river thieves!
I'll never send anything more by 'em. The best brand, Roederer.
The last I had in my cellar, from a lot sent me by Sir George
Gore - took him out on a buffalo hunt, when he visited our
country. Is always sending me some trifle. You haven't looked
about any yet, gentlemen? It's in the rough yet, in the rough.
Those buildings will all have to come down. That's the place for
the public square, court- house, hotels, churches, jail - all
that sort of thing. About where we stand, the deepo. How does
that strike your engineering eye, Mr. Thompson? Down yonder the
business streets, running to the wharves. The University up
there, on rising ground, sightly place, see the river for miles.
That's Columbus River, only forty-nine miles to the Missouri. You
see what it is, placid, steady, no current to interfere with
navigation, wants widening in places and dredging, dredge out the
harbor and raise a levee in front of the town; made by nature on
purpose for a mart. Look at all this country, not another
building within ten miles, no other navigable stream, lay of the
land points right here; <b>hemp</b>, tobacco, corn, must come
here. The railroad will do it, Napoleon won't know itself in a
year.&quot; </p>

<p>Chapter XVI: Model Railroad Engineer. Survey To Stone's
Landing </p>

<p>The Colonel hitched up his chair close to Harry, laid his hand
on his knee, and, first looking about him, said in a low voice,
&quot;The Salt Lick Pacific Extension is going to run through
Stone's Landing! The Almighty never laid out a cleaner piece of
level prairie for a city; and it's the natural center of all that
region of <b>hemp</b> and tobacco.&quot; </p>

<p>Chapter XXII: The Black Forest </p>

<p>Author: Twain, Mark, 1879 </p>

<p>We found the Black Forest farmhouses and villages all that the
Black Forest stories have pictured them. The first genuine
specimen which we came upon was the mansion of a rich farmer and
member of the Common Council of the parish or district. He was an
important personage in the land and so was his wife also, of
course. His daughter was the &quot;catch&quot; of the region, and
she may be already entering into immortality as the heroine of
one of Auerbach's novels, for all I know. We shall see, for if he
puts her in I shall recognize her by her Black Forest clothes,
and her burned complexion, her plump figure, her fat hands, her
dull expression, her gentle spirit, her generous feet, her
bonnetless head, and the plaited tails of <b>hemp</b>-colored
hair hanging down her back. </p>

<p>Chapter XXVII: The End Of Great Kamehameha </p>

<p>Twain, Mark, 1871 </p>

<p>He was dressed entirely in black - dress-coat and silk hat -
and looked rather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms
about him. On his breast he wore a large gold star, which was
half hidden by the lapel of his coat. He remained at the door a
half-hour, and occasionally gave an order to the men who were
erecting the kahilis before the tomb. He had the good taste to
make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary <b>hempen</b>
rope he was about to tie one of them to the framework with.
Finally he entered his carriage and drove away, and the populace
shortly began to drop into his wake. While he was in view there
was but one man who attracted more attention than himself, and
that was Harris (the Yankee Prime Minister). This feeble
personage had crape enough around his hat to express the grief of
an entire nation, and as usual he neglected no opportunity of
making himself conspicuous and exciting the admiration of the
simple Kanakas. Oh! noble ambition of this modern Richelieu! </p>

<p>Lucia replied with a look which expressed assent as clearly as
words could have done, and with a sweetness which words could not
have conveyed. </p>

<p>'Noble girl!' rejoined the woman. 'And your Curate, too, being
at our village, (for there are numbers assembled from all the
country round to elect four public officers,) the Signor Cardinal
thought it better to send him with us; but he has been of little
use: I had before heard that he was a poor - spirited creature;
but, on this occasion, I couldn't help seeing that he was as
frightened as a chicken in a bundle of <b>hemp</b>.' </p>

<p>Title: Samuel Pepys </p>

<p>Author: Stevenson, Robert Louis </p>

<p>Date: c1886 </p>

<p>A Liberal Genius </p>

<p>The whole world, town or country, was to Pepys a garden of
Armida. Wherever he went, his steps were winged with the most
eager expectation; whatever he did, it was done with the most
lively pleasure. An insatiable curiosity in all the shows of the
world and all the secrets of knowledge, filled him brimful of the
longing to travel, and supported him in the toils of study. Rome
was the dream of his life; he was never happier than when he read
or talked of the Eternal City. When he was in Holland, he was
&quot;with child&quot; to see any strange thing. Meeting some
friends and singing with them in a palace near The Hague, his pen
fails him to express his passion of delight, &quot;the more so
because in a heaven of pleasure and in a strange country.&quot;
He must go to see all famous executions. He must needs visit the
body of a murdered man, defaced &quot;with a broad wound,&quot;
he says, &quot;that makes my hand now shake to write of it.&quot;
He learned to dance, and was &quot;like to make a dancer.&quot;
(He learned to sing, and walked about Gray's Inn Fields
&quot;humming to myself (which is now my constant practice) the
trillo.&quot; He learned to play the lute, the flute, the
flageolet, and the theorbo, and it was not the fault of his
intention if he did not learn the harpsichord or the spinet. He
learned to compose songs, and burned to give forth&quot; a scheme
and theory of music not yet ever made in the world.&quot; When he
heard &quot;a fellow whistle like a bird exceeding all,&quot; he
promised to return another day and give an angel for a lesson in
the art. Once, he writes, &quot;I took the Bezan back with me,
and with a brave gale and tide reached up that night to the Hope,
taking great pleasure in learning the seamen's manner of singing
when they sound the depths.&quot; If he found himself rusty in
his Latin grammar, he must fall to it like a schoolboy. He was a
member of Harrington's Club till its dissolution, and of the
Royal Society before it had received the name. Boyle's
Hydrostatics was &quot;of infinite delight&quot; to him, walking
in Barnes Elms. We find him comparing Bible concordances, a
captious judge of sermons, deep in Descartes and Aristotle. We
find him, in a single year, studying timber and the measurement
of timber; tar and oil, <b>hemp</b>, and the process of preparing
cordage; mathematics and accounting; the hull and the rigging of
ships from a model; and &quot;looking and improving himself of
the (naval) stores with&quot; - hark to the fellow! - &quot;great
delight.&quot; His familiar spirit of delight was not the same
with Shelley's; but how true it was to him through life! He is
only copying something, and behold, he &quot;takes great pleasure
to rule the lines, and have the capital words wrote with red
ink&quot;; he has only had his coal - cellar emptied and cleaned,
and behold, &quot;it do please him exceedingly.&quot; A hog's
harslett is &quot;a piece of meat he loves.&quot; He cannot ride
home in my Lord Sandwich's coach, but he must exclaim, with
breathless gusto, &quot;his noble, rich coach.&quot; When he is
bound for a supper party, he anticipates a &quot;glut of
pleasure.&quot; When he has a new watch, &quot;to see my
childishness,&quot; says he, &quot;I could not forbear carrying
it in my hand and seeing what o'clock it was an hundred
times.&quot; To go to Vauxhall, he says, and &quot;to hear the
nightingales and other birds, hear fiddles, and there a harp and
here a Jew's trump, and here laughing, and there fine people
walking, is mighty divertising.&quot; And the nightingales, I
take it, were particularly dear to him; and it was again
&quot;with great pleasure&quot; that he paused to hear them as he
walked to Woolwich, while the fog was rising and the April sun
broke through. </p>

<p>Book: Story Of The Young King Of The Black Islands </p>

<p>Author: Traditional </p>

<p>Date: c1200 </p>

<p>Translation: Lane, Edward William </p>

<p>My father was king of the city which was here situate: his
name was Mahmud, and he was lord of the Black Islands, and of the
four mountains. After a reign of seventy years, he died, and I
succeeded to his throne; whereupon I took as my wife the daughter
of my uncle; and she loved me excessively, so that when I
absented myself from her, she would neither eat nor drink till
she saw me again. She remaine under my protection five years.
After this, she went one day to the bath; and I had commanded the
cook to prepare the supper, and entered this palace, and slept in
my usual place. I had ordered two maids to fan me; and one of
them sat at my head, and the other at my feet; but I was
restless, because my wife was not with me; and I could not sleep.
My eyes were closed, but my spirit was awake; and I heard the
maid at my head say to her at my feet, O Mes'udeh, verily our
lord is unfortunate in his youth, and what a pity is it that it
should be passed with our depraved, wicked mistress! - Perdition
to unfaithful wives! replied the other: but (added she) such a
person as our lord, so endowed by nature, is not suited to this
profligate woman, who passes every night absent from his bed. -
Verily, rejoined she at my head, our lord is careless in not
making any inquiry respecting her. - Woe to thee! said the other:
hath our lord any knowledge of her conduct, or doth she leave him
to his choice? Nay, on the contrary, she contriveth to defraud
him by means of the cup of wine which he drinketh every night
before he sleepeth, putting bhang (<b>hemp</b>) into it; in
consequence of which he sleepeth so soundly that he knoweth not
what happeneth, nor whither she goeth, nor what she doeth; for,
after she hath given him the wine to drink, she dresseth herself,
and goeth out from him, and is absent until daybreak, when she
returneth to him, and burneth a perfume under his nose, upon
which he awaketh from his sleep. </p>

<p>Economic developments, however, constricted Philippine
independence at the same time that the islands were being
prepared for self-rule. Before the outbreak of World War II,
four-fifths of Philippine exports went to the United States and
three-fifths of its imports came from America. Like most
underdeveloped economies, the export trade was dominated by a
very few products: <b>hemp</b>, sugar, coconuts, and tobacco.
Independence, with its accompanying imposition of tariffs would
have been economically difficult. The United States had prevented
the development of a colonial-type plantation economy by
forbidding non-Filipinos to own plantation lands, but native
landlordism was rampant, and the oppressed peasants launched a
brief uprising in the mid-1930s. </p>

<p>Chapter 3D. Visual Arts </p>

<p>The many and varied traditional handicrafts of Japan enjoyed
official recognition and protection and, owing to the folk art
movement, were much in demand. Each craft carried a group of
specialized skills with it. Textiles, for example, included
weaving silk, <b>hemp</b>, or cotton following the spinning and
dyeing process in a range from timeless folk designs to complex
court patterns. Village crafts evolving from ancient folk
traditions also survived in weaving and indigo dyeing by remote
farming families in northern Japan and in Hokkaido by the Ainu
peoples, whose distinctive designs had prehistoric prototypes.
Silk weaving families can be traced to the fifteenth century in
the famous Nishijin weaving center of Kyoto where they produced
the elegant fabrics worn by the emperor and the aristocracy. </p>

<p>Particularly well known outside the country are the woven
rugs, tablecloths, and tapestries that decorate all rural homes
and many urban ones. Designs are mostly geometric, and particular
designs and color combinations are associated with particular
regions. Well known for their unusual design and warm colors are
Oltenian textiles in which a central animal, human, or floral
design is surrounded by several frames of different colors.
Muntenian textiles, on the other hand, have small geometric
designs spread over the whole surface. Moldavian and
Transylvanian textiles vary a great deal from one location to
another and include both geometric and figurative designs. At one
time, wool was used exclusively for weaving rugs and tapestries,
but since the mid-nineteenth century cotton or <b>hemp</b> warp
has been used in combination with wool. All-cotton and all-<b>hemp</b>
rugs and wall hangings are also produced. </p>

<p>Vegetables </p>

<p>Vegetables are grown in a relatively small area (some 632,000
acres). Peas are the predominant crop; capable of an early
harvest, they allow a second crop, usually of fodder plants, to
be grown on the same ground. Vegetable cultivation is
particularly marked around Bucharest; there is specialization in
the production of early potatoes, tomatoes, onions, cabbages and
green peppers. Similar peripheral areas are found around
Timisoara, Arad, Craiova, Galati, Braila and other cities. The
most important potato-growing area in the country is found in the
Brasov, Sibiu, Harghita and Mures districts. Other related crops
include sugar beets (475,000 acres) and sunflowers (10,300,000
acres), mostly on the Danube, Tisa and Jijia plains. <b>Hemp</b>,
flax, rapeseed, soybeans and tobacco are also grown. </p>

board of the plough - had a significant effect on the

men. A short distance from the sea, the land was covered with
large trees, among which were noble cypresses. From these forest
trees trailed luxuriant vines which were clustered with delicious
grapes, the natives said, in early autumn. The people fled in
fear to the woods. They were fairer than those further south, and
were covered with a light drapery made of &quot;certain plants
which hung down from the branches&quot; - Spanish moss - tied by
threads of wild <b>hemp</b>. Their heads were uncovered. They
lived in huts made of saplings and shrubbery, and navigated

on Great Britain, and they were discouraged. A little earlier a
British author had written &quot;There be fine iron works which
cast no guns no house in New England has above twenty rooms; not
twenty in Boston have ten rooms each; a dancing-school was set up
here but put down; a fencing-school is allowed. There be no
musicians by trade. All cordage, sail-cloth and mats, come from
England; no cloth made there worth four shillings per yard; no
alum, no salt made by their sun. </p>

<p>In 1776, almost the whole agricultural products of our
country, including live-stock, were used for the support of the
million and a half inhabitants; 1876 42,000,000 were fed and
largely clothed from the products of our soil, while a vast
surplus of our cereal and fibrous productions were sent to other
countries. In 1870, there were 189,000,000 acres of improved farm
land in our country, which produced in cereals (in round numbers)
wheat, 288,000,000 bushels rye, 17,000,000 Indian corn,

potato, there were raised 143,000,000 bushels, and of the sweet
potato, 22,000,000 bushels. The hay crop amounted to 28,000,000
tons, and the tobacco crop to 363,000,000 pounds. Of the
principal fibrous products there were raised that year over
1,200,000,000 pounds of cotton. The average annual product, as we
have observed, is now greater. The amount of flax raised was

<p>. The Philippines have a fine, though tropical, climate, while
the soil is very fertile, but lacks labor for its proper
cultivation. The chief article of commerce is <b>hemp</b>, of
which $21,800,000 worth was exported in 1904; the other principal
exports are sugar, tobacco, oil-nuts, and copra. </p>

<p>Gratifying as are these statistics representing the trade
expansion of the Philippine Islands within the brief period of
American possession of them, there are indications that the
economic situation will be vastly improved in the next few years.
</p>

<p>The justification for this surmise arises from the known
wealth of the Islands, not only in valuable forest timber, gum,
and dye woods, but in lignite coal of the best grade, iron ore,
and other minerals, which, like agriculture, are hardly as yet
developed. It is also justified by what is reported of the
efforts being made by the local bureaus, agricultural and
forestry, in establishing experimental farms and distributing for
general cultivation improved quantities of plants, seeds, roots,
etc.; while giving instruction in combating destructive insects,
in raising the grade of live stock, and in suggesting more
scientific methods of curing tobacco and producing a better

<p>Under these stresses American soldiers often did not show up
well by comparison with marines, or with men from the
professional military units sent to Korea by other U.N. nations.
Many soldiers had become POWs shortly after their arrival. Almost
none had strong feelings of belonging to any unit. The enemy's
practice of shuffling men back and forth from camp to camp and
his deliberate policy of breaking down structures of loyalty and
command among the prisoners increased each man's isolation.
Escape from intolerable conditions through fantasy was common,
aided by the widespread smoking of <b>hemp</b> (Cannabis). So was
apathy. Cases were seen of men who apparently willed themselves
to die. &quot;The people who died,&quot; recalled a doctor,
&quot;would first become despondent, then would lie down or cover
their heads with their blankets, then wanted ice water to drink
with their food, eventually no food only water and eventually -
death.&quot; </p>

<p>The Revolutionary War Economy </p>

<p>Because 90 percent of all Americans engaged in farming, the
war's impact on agriculture produced the most widespread results.
Nowhere was that more dramatically true than in the Southern
colonies. The prewar boycotts and the outbreak of hostilities
caused a precipitous drop in Southern exports to England and
Scotland by 1778. As military operations shifted to the Southern
States after 1778, agriculture there suffered further from
capital destruction and the loss of slaves. The profitability of
indigo production collapsed with the termination of the British
bounty, and rice growers, who had much of their capital sunk in
paddy systems, found it difficult to convert to raising sheep, <b>hemp</b>,
or flax - for which there was a great wartime demand. In the
upper South, however, the war stimulated the prewar trend toward
converting from tobacco to grain and livestock (for which the war
increased the domestic demand), and the remaining tobacco crop
soon found ways around the British blockade to profitable
overseas markets. While the lower South therefore suffered
modestly, the Chesapeake area adjusted to new wartime demands and
reestablished good overseas markets. </p>

<h2>Hugh Downs commentary on hemp </h2>

<p><b>ABC News, NY, 11/90:</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Voters in the state of Alaska recently made marijuana illegal
again for the first time in 15 years. If Alaska turns out to be
like the other 49 states, the law will do little to curb use or
production. Even the drug czar himself, William Bennett, has
abandoned the drug war now that his &quot;test case&quot; of
Washington, D.C., continues to see rising crime figures connected
with the drug industry. </p>

<p>Despite the legal trend against marijuana, many Americans
continue to buck the trend. Some pro-marijuana organizations in
fact tell us that marijuana, also known as hemp, could, as a raw
material, save the U.S. economy. That's some statement. Not by
smoking it--that's a minor issue. Would you believe that
marijuana could replace most oil and energy needs? That marijuana
could revolutionize the textile industry and stop foreign
imports? Those are the claims. </p>

<p>Some people think marijuana, or hemp, may be the epitome of
yankee ingenuity. Mr. Jack Herer, for example, is the national
director and founder of an organization called HEMP (that's an
acronym for &quot;Help End Marijuana Prohibition&quot;) located
in Van Nuys, California. Mr. Herer is the author of a remarkable
little book called, &quot;The Emperor Wears No Clothes,&quot;
wherein, not surprisingly, Mr. Herer urges the repeal of
marijuana prohibition. </p>

<p>Mr. Herer is not alone. Throughout the war on drugs, several
organizations have consistently urged the legalization of
marijuana. &quot;High Times&quot; magazine for example, The
National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws or NORML for
short, and an organization called BACH-the Business Alliance for
Commerce in Hemp. </p>

<p>But the reason the pro-marijuana lobby want marijuana legal
has little to do with getting high, and a great deal to do with
fighting oil giants like Saddam Hussein, Exxon and Iran. The
pro-marijuana groups claim that hemp is such a versatile raw
material, that its products not only compete with petroleum, but
with coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, pharmaceutical, timber
and textile companies.[1] </p>

<p>It is estimated that methane and methanol production alone
from hemp grown as biomass could replace 90% of the world's
energy needs.[2] If they are right, this is not good news for oil
interests and could account for the continuation of marijuana
prohibition. The claim is that the threat hemp posed to natural
resource companies back in the thirties accounts for its original
ban. At one time marijuana seemed to have a promising future as a
cornerstone of industry. When Rudolph Diesel produced his famous
engine in 1896, he assumed that the diesel engine would be
powered by a variety of fuels, especially vegetable and seed
oils. Rudolph Diesel, like most engineers then, believed
vegetable fuels were superior to petroleum. Hemp is the most
efficient vegetable. </p>

<p>In the 1930s the Ford Motor Company also saw a future in
biomass fuels. Ford operated a successful biomass conversion
plant, that included hemp, at their Iron Mountain facility in
Michigan. Ford engineers extracted methanol, charcoal fuel, tar,
pitch, ethyl-acetate and creosote. All fundamental ingredients
for modern industry and now supplied by oil-related
industries.[2] </p>

<p>The difference is that the vegetable source is renewable,
cheap and clean, and the petroleum or coal sources are limited,
expensive and dirty. By volume, 30% of the hemp seed contains oil
suitable for high-grade diesel fuel as well as aircraft engine
and precision machine oil. </p>

<p>Henry Ford's experiments with methanol promised cheap, readily
renewable fuel. And if you think methanol means compromise, you
should know that many modern race cars run on methanol. About the
time Ford was making biomass methanol, a mechanical device[3] to
strip the outer fibers of the hemp plant appeared on the market.
These machines could turn hemp into paper and fabrics[4] quickly
and cheaply. Hemp paper is superior to wood paper. The first two
drafts of the U.S. constitution were written on hemp paper. The
final draft is on animal skin. Hemp paper contains no dioxin, or
other toxic residue, and a single acre of hemp can produce the
same amount of paper as four acres of trees.[5] The trees take 20
years to harvest and hemp takes a single season. In warm climates
hemp can be harvested two even three times a year. It also grows
in bad soil and restores the nutrients. Hemp fiber-stripping
machines were bad news to the Hearst paper manufacturing
division, and a host of other natural resource firms.
Coincidentally, the DuPont Chemical Company had, in 1937, been
granted a patent on a sulfuric acid process to make paper from
wood pulp. At the time DuPont predicted their sulfuric acid
process would account for 80% of their business for the next 50
years. </p>

<p>Hemp, once the mainstay of American agriculture, became a
threat to a handful of corporate giants. To stifle the commercial
threat that hemp posed to timber interests, William Randolph
Hearst began referring to hemp in his newspapers, by its Spanish
name, &quot;marijuana.&quot; This did two things: it associated
the plant with Mexicans and played on racist fears, and it misled
the public into thinking that marijuana and hemp were different
plants. </p>

<p>Nobody was afraid of hemp--it had been cultivated and
processed into usable goods, and consumed as medicine, and burned
in oil lamps, for hundreds of years. But after a campaign to
discredit hemp in the Hearst newspapers, Americans became afraid
of something called marijuana. </p>

<p>By 1937, the Marijuana Tax Act was passed which marked the
beginning of the end of the hemp industry. In 1938, &quot;Popular
Mechanics&quot; ran an article about marijuana called, &quot;New
Billion Dollar Crop.&quot;[6] It was the first time the words
&quot;billion dollar&quot; were used to describe a U.S.
agricultural product. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; said, . . . a
machine has been invented which solves a problem more than 6,000
years old. . . . The machine . . . is designed for removing the
fiber- bearing cortex from the rest of the stalk, making hemp
fiber available for use without a prohibitive amount of human
labor. Hemp is the standard fiber of the world. It has great
tensile strength and durability. It is used to produce more than
5,000 textile products ranging from rope, to fine laces, and the
woody &quot;hurds&quot; remaining after the fiber has been
removed, contain more than seventy-seven per cent cellulose, and
can be used to produce more than 25,000 products ranging from
dynamite to cellophane. </p>

<p>Well since the &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; article appeared
over half a century ago, many more applications have come to
light. Back in 1935, more than 58,000 tons of marijuana seed were
used just to make paint and varnish (all non-toxic, by the way).
When marijuana was banned, these safe paints and varnishes were
replaced by paints made with toxic petrochemicals. In the 1930s
no one knew about poisoned rivers or deadly land-fills or
children dying from chemicals in house paint. </p>

<p>People did know something about hemp back then, because the
plant and its products were so common. </p>

<p>All ships lines were made from hemp and much of the sail
canvas. (In fact the word &quot;canvas&quot; is the Dutch
pronunciation of the Greek word for hemp, &quot;cannabis.&quot;)
All ropes, fozzers (sp?) and lines aboard ship, all rigging,
nets, flags and pennants were also made from marijuana stalks.
And so were all charts, logs and bibles. Today many of these
items are made, in whole or in part, with synthetic
petro-chemicals and wood. All oil lamps used to burn hemp- seed
oil until the whale oil edged it out of first place in the mid-
nineteenth century. And then, when all the whales were dead,
lamplights were fueled by petroleum, and coal, and recently
radioactive energy.[7] </p>

<p>This may be hard to believe in the middle of a war on drugs,
but the first law concerning marijuana in the colonies at
Jamestown in 1619, ordered farmers to grow Indian hemp.
Massachussetts passed a compulsory grow law in 1631. Connecticut
followed in 1632. The Chesapeake colonies ordered their farmers,
by law, to grow marijuana in the mid-eighteenth century. Names
like Hempstead or Hemphill dot the American landscape and reflect
areas of intense marijuana cultivation. </p>

<p>During World War II, domestic hemp production became crucial
when the Japanese cut off Asian supplies to the U.S. American
farmers (and even their sons), who grew marijuana, were exempt
from military duty during World War II. A 1942 U.S. Department of
Agriculture film called &quot;Hemp For Victory&quot; extolled the
agricultural might of marijuana and called for hundreds of
thousands of acres to be planted.[8] Despite a rather vigorous
drug crackdown, 4-H clubs were asked by the government to grow
marijuana for seed supply. Ironically, war plunged the government
into a sober reality about marijuana and that is that it's very
valuable. </p>

<p>In today's anti-drug climate, people don't want to hear about
the commercial potential of marijuana. The reason is that the
flowering top of a female hemp plant contains a drug. But from
1842 through the 1890s a powerful concentrated extract of
marijuana was the second most prescribed drug in the United
States. In all that time the medical literature didn't list any
of the ill effects claimed by today's drug warriors.[9] </p>

<p>Today, there are anywhere from 25 to 30 million Americans who
smoke marijuana regularly. As an industry, marijuana clears well
more than $4 billion a year. [This must have been a misreading of
his notes--for 1990, the minimum figure would have been at least
$40 billion for the entire nation. (phone interview with Jack
Herer)] Obviously, as an illegal business, none of that money
goes to taxes. But the modern marijuana trade only sells one
product, a drug. Hemp could be worth considerably more than $4
[$40] billion a year, if it were legally supplying the 50,000
safe products the proponents claim it can. </p>

<p>If hemp could supply the energy needs of the United States,
its value would be inestimable. Now that the drug czar is in
final retreat, America has an opportunity to, once and for all,
say farewell to the Exxon Valdez, Saddam Hussein and a
prohibitively expensive brinkmanship in the desert sands of Saudi
Arabia. </p>

<p>This is Hugh Downs, ABC News, New York. </p>

<h2>HEMP FOR VICTORY </h2>

<p><b>By the US Department of Agriculture </b></p>

<p><b>-- 1942 --</b> </p>

<p>This is the transcript of the film done by the USDA to
encourage farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) during World War II,
because it was a vital resource for such uses as ropes, heavy
cloth, etc. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"> </p>

<p>Long ago when these ancient Grecian temples were new, hemp was
already old in the service of mankind. For thousands of years,
even then, this plant had been grown for cordage and cloth in
China and elsewhere in the East. For centuries prior to about
1850 all the ships that sailed the western seas were rigged with
hempen rope and sails. </p>

<p>For the sailor, no less than the hangman, hemp was
indispensable. A 44-gun frigate like our cherished Old Ironsides
took over 60 tons of hemp for rigging, including an anchor cable
25 inches in circumference. The Conestoga wagons and prairie
schooners of pioneer days were covered with hemp canvas. Indeed
the very word canvas comes from the Arabic word for hemp. In
those days hemp was an important crop in Kentucky and Missouri.
Then came cheaper imported fibers for cordage, like jute, sisal
and Manila hemp, and the culture of hemp in America declined. </p>

<p>But now with Philippine and East Indian sources of hemp in the
hands of the Japanese, and shipment of jute from India curtailed,
American hemp must meet the needs of our Army and Navy as well as
of our Industry. In 1942, patriotic farmers at the government's
request planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp, an increase of several
thousand percent. The goal for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed hemp.
</p>

<p>In Kentucky much of the seed hemp acreage is on river bottom
land such as this. Some of these fields are inaccessible except
by boat. Thus plans are afoot for a great expansion of a hemp
industry as a part of the war program. This film is designed to
tell farmers how to handle this ancient crop now little known
outside Kentucky and Wisconsin. </p>

<p>This is hemp seed. Be careful how you use it. For to grow hemp
legally you must have a federal registration and tax stamp. This
is provided for in your contract. Ask your county agent about it.
Don't forget. </p>

<p>Hemp demands a rich, well-drained soil such as is found here
in the Blue Grass region of Kentucky or in central Wisconsin. It
must be loose and rich in organic matter. Poor soils won't do.
Soil that will grow good corn will usually grow hemp. </p>

<p>Hemp is not hard on the soil. In Kentucky it has been grown
for several years on the same ground, though this practice is not
recommended. A dense and shady crop, hemp tends to choke out
weeds. Here's a Canada thistle that couldn't stand the
competition, dead as a dodo. Thus hemp leaves the ground in good
condition for the following crop. </p>

<p>For fiber, hemp should be sewn closely, the closer the rows,
the better. These rows are spaced about four inches. This hemp
has been broadcast. Either way it should be sewn thick enough to
grow a slender stalk. Here's an ideal stand: the right height to
be harvested easily, thick enough to grow slender stalks that are
easy to cut and process. </p>

<p>Stalks like these here on the left wield the most fiber and
the best. Those on the right are too coarse and woody. For seed,
hemp is planted in hills like corn. Sometimes by hand. Hemp is a
dioecious plant. </p>

<p>The female flower is inconspicuous. But the male flower is
easily spotted. In seed production after the pollen has been
shed, these male plants are cut out. These are the seeds on a
female plant. Hemp for fiber is ready to harvest when the pollen
is shedding and the leaves are falling. </p>

<p>In Kentucky, hemp harvest comes in August. Here the old
standby has been the self-rake reaper, which has been used for a
generation or more. Hemp grows so luxuriantly in Kentucky that
harvesting is sometimes difficult, which may account for the
popularity of the self-rake with its lateral stroke. A modified
rice binder has been used to some extent. This machine works well
on average hemp. Recently, the improved hemp harvester, used for
many years in Wisconsin, has been introduced in Kentucky. This
machine spreads the hemp in a continuous swath. It is a far cry
from this fast and efficient modern harvester, that doesn't stall
in the heaviest hemp. </p>

<p>In Kentucky, hand cutting is practicing in opening fields for
the machine. In Kentucky, hemp is shucked as soon as safe, after
cutting, to be spread out for retting later in the fall. </p>

<p>In Wisconsin, hemp is harvested in September. Here the hemp
harvester with automatic spreader is standard equipment. Note how
smoothly the rotating apron lays the swaths preparatory to
retting. </p>

<p>Here it is a common and essential practice to leave headlands
around hemp fields. These strips may be planted with other crops,
preferably small grain. Thus the harvester has room to make its
first round without preparatory hand cutting. The other machine
is running over corn stubble. When the cutter bar is much shorter
than the hemp is tall, overlapping occurs. Not so good for
retting. The standard cut is eight to nine feet. </p>

<p>The length of time hemp is left on the ground to ret depends
on the weather. The swaths must be turned to get a uniform ret.
When the woody core breaks away readily like this, the hemp is
about ready to pick up and bind into bundles. Well-retted hemp is
light to dark grey. </p>

<p>The fiber tends to pull away from the stalks. The presence of
stalks in the bough-string stage indicates that retting is well
underway. When hemp is short or tangled or when the ground is too
wet for machines, it's bound by hand. A wooden bucket is used.
Twine will do for tying, but the hemp itself makes a good band.
When conditions are favorable, the pickup binder is commonly
used. The swaths should lie smooth and even with the stalks
parallel. The picker won't work well in tangled hemp. After
binding, hemp is shucked as soon as possible to stop further
retting. </p>

<p>In 1942, 14,000 acres of fiber hemp were harvested in the
United States. The goal for the old standby cordage fiber, is
staging a strong comeback. This is Kentucky hemp going into the
dryer over mill at Versailles. </p>

<p>In the old days braking was done by hand. One of the hardest
jobs known to man. Now the power braker makes quick work of it.
Spinning American hemp into rope yarn or twine in the old
Kentucky river mill at Frankfort, Kentucky. Another pioneer plant
that has been making cordage for more than a century. All such
plants will presently be turning out products spun from
American-grown hemp: twine of various kinds for tying and
upholster's work; rope for marine rigging and towing; for hay
forks, derricks, and heavy duty tackle; light duty firehose;
thread for shoes for millions of American soldiers; and parachute
webbing for our paratroopers. </p>

<p>As for the United States Navy, every battleship requires
34,000 feet of rope. Here in the Boston Navy Yard, where cables
for frigates were made long ago, crews are now working night and
day making cordage for the fleet. In the old days rope yarn was
spun by hand. The rope yarn feeds through holes in an iron plate.
This is Manila hemp from the Navy's rapidly dwindling reserves.
When it is gone, American hemp will go on duty again: hemp for
mooring ships; hemp for tow lines; hemp for tackle and gear; hemp
for countless naval uses both on ship and shore. Just as in the
days when Old Ironsides sailed the seas victorious with her
hempen shrouds and hempen sails. Hemp for victory. </p>

<h2><a name="OLE_LINK6">NEW BILLION-DOLLAR CROP</a> </h2>

<p><b>Popular Mechanics</b> </p>

<p><b>February, 1938</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Note: There was so little public attention and notice to the
need for a ban on marijuana, or the resulting legislation (<a
href="taxact/taxact.htm">Marihuana Tax Act of 1937</a>), that the
editors apparently did not realize that it had already been
outlawed when they published this article.</p>

<hr>

<p>AMERICAN farmers are promised a new cash crop with an annual
value of several hundred million dollars, all because a machine
has been invented which solves a problem more than 6,000 years
old. It is hemp, a crop that will not compete with other American
products. </p>

<p>Instead, it will displace imports of raw material and
manufactured products produced by underpaid coolie and peasant
labor and it will provide thousands of jobs for American workers
throughout the land. </p>

<p>The machine which makes this possible is designed for removing
the fiber-bearing cortex from the rest of the stalk, making hemp
fiber available for use without a prohibitive amount of human
labor. Hemp is the standard fiber of the world. It has great
tensile strength and durability. It is used to produce more than
5,000 textile products, ranging from rope to fine laces, and the
woody &quot;hurds&quot; remaining after the fiber has been
removed contain more than seventy-seven per cent cellulose, and
can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from
dynamite to Cellophane. </p>

<p>Machines now in service in Texas, Illinois, Minnesota and
other states are producing fiber at a manufacturing cost of half
a cent a pound, and are finding a profitable market for the rest
of the stalk. Machine operators are making a good profit in
competition with coolie-produced foreign fiber while paying
farmers fifteen dollars a ton for hemp as it comes from the
field. </p>

<p>From the farmers' point of view, hemp is an easy crop to grow
and will yield from three to six tons per acre on any land that
will grow corn, wheat, or oats. It has a short growing season, so
that it can be planted after other crops are in. It can be grown
in any state of the union. The long roots penetrate and break the
soil to leave it in perfect condition for the next year's crop.
The dense shock of leaves, eight to twelve feet above the ground,
chokes out weeds. Two successive crops are enough to reclaim land
that has been abandoned because of Canadian thistles or quack
grass. </p>

<p>Under old methods, hemp was cut and allowed to lie in the
fields for weeks until it &quot;retted&quot; enough so the fibers
could be pulled off by hand. Retting is simply rotting as a
result of dew, rain and bacterial action. Machines were developed
to separate the fibers mechanically after retting was complete,
but the cost was high, the loss of fiber great, and the quality
of fiber comparatively low. </p>

<p>With the new machine, known as a decorticator, hemp is cut
with a slightly modified grain binder. It is delivered to the
machine where an automatic chain conveyor feeds it to the
breaking arms at the rate of two or three tons per hour. The
hurds are broken into fine pieces which drop into the hopper,
from where they are delivered by blower to a baler or to truck or
freight car for loose shipment. The fiber comes from the other
end of the machine, ready for baling. </p>

<p>From this point on almost anything can happen. The raw fiber
can be used to produce strong twine or rope, woven into burlap,
used for carpet warp or linoleum backing or it may be bleached
and refined, with resinous by-products of high commercial value.
It can, in fact, be used to replace the foreign fibers which now
flood our markets. </p>

<p>Thousands of tons of hemp hurds are used every year by one
large powder company for the manufacture of dynamite and TNT. A
large paper company, which has been paying more than a million
dollars a year in duties on foreign-made cigarette papers, now is
manufacturing these papers from American hemp grown in Minnesota.
A new factory in Illinois is producing fine bond papers from
hemp. The natural materials in hemp make it an economical source
of pulp for any grade of paper manufactured, and the high
percentage of alpha cellulose promises an unlimited supply of raw
material for the thousands of cellulose products our chemists
have developed. </p>

<p>It is generally believed that all linen is produced from flax.
Actually, the majority comes from hemp--authorities estimate that
more than half of our imported linen fabrics are manufactured
from hemp fiber. Another misconception is that burlap is made
from hemp. Actually, its source is usually jute, and practically
all of the burlap we use is woven by laborers in India who
receive only four cents a day. Binder twine is usually made from
sisal which comes from Yucatan and East Africa. </p>

<p>All of these products, now imported, can be produced from
home- grown hemp. Fish nets, bow strings, canvas, strong rope,
overalls, damask tablecloths, fine linen garments, towels, bed
linen and thousands of other everyday items can be grown on
American farms. </p>

<p>Our imports of foreign fabrics and fibers average about
$200,000,000 per year; in raw fibers alone we imported over
$50,000,000 in the first six months of 1937. All of this income
can be made available for Americans. </p>

<p>The paper industry offers even greater possibilities. As an
industry it amounts to over $1,000,000,000 a year, and of that
eighty per cent is imported. But hemp will produce every grade of
paper, and government figures estimate that 10,000 acres devoted
to hemp will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of average
pulp land. </p>

<p>One obstacle in the onward march of hemp is the reluctance of
farmers to try new crops. The problem is complicated by the need
for proper equipment a reasonable distance from the farm. The
machine cannot be operated profitably unless there is enough
acreage within driving range and farmers cannot find a profitable
market unless there is machinery to handle the crop. Another
obstacle is that the blossom of the female hemp plant contains
marijuana, a narcotic, and it is impossible to grow hemp without
producing the blossom. Federal regulations now being drawn up
require registration of hemp growers, and tentative proposals for
preventing narcotic production are rather stringent. </p>

<p>However, the connection of hemp as a crop and marijuana seems
to be exaggerated. The drug is usually produced from wild hemp or
locoweed which can be found on vacant lots and along railroad
tracks in every state. If federal regulations can be drawn to
protect the public without preventing the legitimate culture of
hemp, this new crop can add immeasurably to American agriculture
and industry. </p>

<h2>Pinch Hitters for Defense </h2>

<h2>Popular Mechanics, December, 1941 </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Over in England it's saccharine for sugar; on the continent
it's charcoal &quot;gasogenes&quot; in the rumble seat instead of
gasoline in the tank. Here in America there's plenty of sugar,
plenty of gasoline. Yet there's an industrial revolution in
progress just the same, a revolution in materials that will
affect every home. After twelve years of research, the Ford Motor
Company has completed an experimental automobile with a plastic
body. Although its design takes advantage of the properties of
plastics, the streamline car does not differ greatly in
appearance from its steel counterpart. The only steel in the
hand-made body is found in the tubular welded frame on which are
mounted 14 plastic panels, 3/16 inch thick. Composed of a mixture
of farm crops and synthetic chemicals, the plastic is reported to
withstand a blow 10 times as great as steel without denting. Even
the windows and windshield are of plastic. The total weight of
the plastic car is about 2,000 pounds, compared with 3,000 pounds
for a steel automobile of the same size. Although no hint has
been given as to when plastic cars may go into production, the
experimental model is pictured as a step toward materialization
of Henry Ford's belief that some day he would &quot;grow
automobiles from the soil.&quot; When Henry Ford recently
unveiled his plastic car, result of 12 years of research, he gave
the world a glimpse of the automobile of tomorrow, its tough
panels molded under hydraulic pressure of 1,500 pounds per square
inch from a recipe that calls for 70 percent ofcellulose fibers
from wheat straw, hemp and sisal plus 30 percent resin binder.
The only steel in the car is its tubular welded frame. The
plastic car weighs a ton, 1,000 pounds lighter than a comparable
steel car. Manufacturers are already taking a low-priced plastic
car to test the public's taste by 1943. </p>

<h1>MARIJUANA AND THE BIBLE </h1>

<p><b>by</b> </p>

<p><b>The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>OFFERINGS OF DEVOTION </h2>

<p>With offerings of devotion, ships from the isles will meet to
pour the wealth of the nations and bring tribute to his feet. The
Coptic Church believes fully the teachings of the Bible, and as
such we have our daily obligations, and offer our sacrifices,
made by fire unto our God with chants and Psalms and spiritual
hymns, lifting up holy hands and making melody in our hearts. </p>

<p>Herb (marijuana) is a Godly creation from the beginning of the
world. It is known as the weed of wisdom, angel's food, the tree
of life and even the &quot;Wicked Old Ganja Tree&quot;. Its
purpose in creation is as a fiery sacrifice to be offered to our
Redeemer during obligations. The political worldwide
organizations have framed mischief on it and called it drugs. To
show that it is not a dangerous drug, let me inform my readers
that it is used as food for mankind, and as a medicinal cure for
diverse diseases. Ganja is not for commerce; yet because of the
oppression of the people, it was raised up as the only liberator
of the people, and the only peacemaker among the entire
generation. Ganja is the sacramental rights of every man
worldwide and any law against it is only the organized conspiracy
of the United Nations and the political governments who assist in
maintaining this conspiracy. </p>

<p>The Coptic Church is not politically originated, and this was
firmly expressed when we met with the political directorate of
the land during the period of pre-incorporation. We support no
political organization, pagan religion, or commercial
institution, seeing that religion, politics, and commerce are the
three unclean spirits which separate the people from their God.
Because of our non-political stand, the church has received
tremendous opposition from the politicians, who do not want the
eyes of the people to be opened. Through its agency, the police
force, the church has been severely harassed, victimized, and
discriminated. Our members have passed through several acts of
police brutality, our legal properties maliciously destroyed,
members falsely imprisoned, divine services broken up and all
these atrocities performed upon the Church, under the name of
political laws and their justice. </p>

<p>Walter Wells -- Elder Priest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic
Church of Jamaica, West Indies </p>

<h2>THE USE OF MARIJUANA IN ANCIENT TIMES </h2>

<p>The use of marijuana is as old as the history of man and dates
to the prehistoric period. Marijuana is closely connected with
the history and development of some of the oldest nations on
earth. </p>

<p>It has played a significant role in the religions and cultures
of Africa, the Middle East, India, and China Richard E. Schultes,
a prominent researcher in the field of psychoactive plants, said
in an article he wrote entitled &quot;Man and Marijuana&quot;: </p>

<p>&quot;...that early man experimented with all plant materials
that he could chew and could not have avoided discovering the
properties of cannabis (marijuana), for in his quest for seeds
and oil, he certainly ate the sticky tops of the plant. Upon
eating hemp the euphoric, ecstatic and hallucinatory aspects may
have introduced man to an other-worldly plane from which emerged
religious beliefs, perhaps even the concept of deity. </p>

<p>The plant became accepted as a special gift of the gods, a
sacred medium for communion with the spiritual world and as such
it has remained in some cultures to the present.&quot; </p>

<p>The effects of marijuana was proof to the ancients that the
spirit and power of the god(s) existed in this plant and that it
was literally a messenger (angel) or actually the Flesh and Blood
and/or Bread of the god(s) and was and continues to be a holy
sacrament. Considered to be sacred, marijuana has been used in
religious worship from before recorded history. </p>

<p>According to William A. Embolden in his book Ritual Use of
Cannabis Sativa L, p. 235: </p>

<p>&quot;Shamanistic traditions of great antiquity in Asia and
the Near East has as one of their most important elements the
attempt to find God without a vale of tears; that cannabis played
a role in this, at least in some areas, is born out in the
philology surrounding the ritualistic use of the plant. Whereas
Western religious traditions generally stress sin, repentance,
and mortification of the flesh, certain older non-Western
religious cults seem to have employed Cannabis as a euphoriant,
which allowed the participant a joyous path to the Ultimate;
hence such appellations as &quot;heavenly guide&quot;. </p>

<p>According to &quot;Licit and Illicit Drugs&quot; by the
Consumer Union, page 397-398: </p>

<p>&quot;Ashurbanipal lived about 650 B.C., but the cuneiform
descriptions of marijuana in his library &quot;are generally
regarded as obvious copies of much older texts.&quot; Says Dr.
Robert P. Walton, an American physician and authority on
marijuana, &quot;This evidence serves to project the origin of
hashish back to the earliest beginnings of history.&quot; </p>

<h2>THE USE OF MARIJUANA AS INCENSE </h2>

<p>According to the Encyclopedia Britannica:
&quot;Pharmacological Cults&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;...the ceremonial use of incense in contemporary ritual
is most likely a relic of the time when the psychoactive
properties of incense brought the ancient worshipper in touch
with supernatural forces.&quot; </p>

<p>In the temples of the ancient world, the main sacrifice was
the inhalation of incense. Incense is defined as the perfume or
smoke from spices and gums when burned in celebrating religious
rites or as an offering to a deity. Bronze and gold incense
burners were cast very early in history and their forms were
often inspired by cosmological themes representing the harmonious
nature of the universe. </p>

<p>The following piece was taken from &quot;Licit and Illicit
Drugs&quot;, page 31. </p>

<p>&quot;In the Judaic world, the vapors from burnt spices and
aromatic gums were considered part of the pleasurable act of
worship. In proverbs (27:9) it is said that 'Ointment and
perfumes rejoice the heart.' Perfumes were widely used in
Egyptian worship. Stone altars have been unearthed in Babylon and
Palestine, which have been used for burning incense made of
aromatic wood and spices. While the casual readers today may
interpret such practices as mere satisfaction of the desire for
pleasant odors, this is almost certainly an error; in many or
most cases, a psychoactive drug was being inhaled. In the islands
of the Mediterranean 2,500 years ago and in Africa hundreds of
years ago, for example leaves and flowers of a particular plant
were often thrown upon bonfires and the smoke inhaled; the plant
was marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>(Edward Preble and Gabriel V. Laurey, Plastic Cement: The Ten
Cent Hallucinogen, International Journal of the Addictions, 2
(Fall 2967): 271-272. </p>

<p>&quot;The earliest civilizations of Mesopotamia brewed
intoxicating beer of barley more than 5,000 years ago; is it too
much to assume that even earlier cultures experienced euphoria,
accidentally or deliberately, through inhalation of the resinous
smoke of Cannabis?&quot; </p>

<p>(Ritual Use of Cannabis Sativa L, p. 216.) </p>

<p>&quot;It is said that the Assyrians used hemp (marijuana) as
incense in the seventh or eighth century before Christ and called
it 'Qunubu', a term apparently borrowed from an old East Iranian
word 'Konaba', the same as the Scythian name 'cannabis'.&quot;
(Plants of the Gods - Origin of Hallucinogenic Use by Richard E.
Schultes and Albert Hoffman) </p>

<p>&quot;It is recorded that the Chinese Taoist recommended the
addition of cannabis to their incense burners in the 1st century
as a means of achieving immortality.&quot; </p>

<p>(Marijuana, the First Twelve Thousand Years by Earnest Abel,
page 5) </p>

<p>&quot;There is a classic Greek term, cannabeizein, which means
to smoke cannabis. Cannabeizein frequently took the form of
inhaling vapors from an incense burner in which these resins were
mixed with other resins, such as myrrh, balsam, frankincense, and
perfumes.&quot; (Ritual Use of Cannabis Sativa L) </p>

<p>&quot;Herodotus in the fifth century B.C. observed the
Scythians throwing hemp on heated stone to create smoke and
observed them inhaling this smoke. Although he does not identify
them, Herodotus states that when they &quot;have parties and sit
around a fire, they throw some of it into the flames. As it
burns, it smokes like incense, and the smell of it makes them
drunk, just as wine does us. As more fruit is thrown on, they get
more and more intoxicated until finally they jump up and start
dancing and singing.&quot; (Herodotus, Histories 1.202.) </p>

<h2>EVIDENCE INDICATING THE SEMITIC ORIGIN OF CANNABIS </h2>

<p>The name cannabis is generally thought to be of Scythian
origin. Sula Benet in Cannabis and Culture argues that it has a
much earlier origin in Semitic languages like Hebrew, occurring
several times in the Old Testament. He states that in Exodus
30:23 that God commands Moses to make a holy anointing oil of
myrrh, sweet cinnamon, kaneh bosm, and kassia. He continues that
the word kaneh bosm is also rendered in the traditional Hebrew as
kannabos or kannabus and that the root &quot;kan&quot; in this
construction means &quot;reed&quot; or &quot;hemp&quot;, while
&quot;bosm&quot; means &quot;aromatic&quot;. He states that in
the earliest Greek translations of the old testament
&quot;kan&quot; was rendered as &quot;reed&quot;, leading to such
erroneous English translations as &quot;sweet calamus&quot;
(Exodus 30:23), sweet cane (Isaiah 43:24; Jeremiah 6:20) and
&quot;calamus&quot; (Ezekiel 27:19; Song of Songs 4:14). </p>

<p>Benet argues from the linguistic evidence that cannabis was
known in Old Testament times at least for its aromatic properties
and that the word for it passed from the Semitic language to the
Scythians, i.e. the Ashkenaz of the Old Testament. Sara Benetowa
of the Institute of Anthropological Sciences in Warsaw is quoted
in the Book of Grass as saying: &quot;The astonishing resemblance
between the Semitic 'kanbos' and the Scythian 'cannabis' leads me
to suppose that the Scythian word was of Semitic origin. These
etymological discussions run parallel to arguments drawn from
history. </p>

<p>The Iranian Scythians were probably related to the Medes, who
were neighbors of the semites and could easily have assimilated
the word for hemp. The Semites could also have spread the word
during their migrations through Asia Minor. </p>

<p>Taking into account the matriarchal element of Semitic
culture, one is led to believe that Asia Minor was the original
point of expansion for both the society based on the matriarchal
circle and the mass use of hashish.&quot; </p>

<p>The Ancient Israelites were a Semitic people. Abraham, the
father of the Israelite nation, came from Ur, a city of Babylonia
located in mesopotamia. The Israelites migrated throughout Asia
Minor and could easily have spread the religious use of
marijuana. </p>

<h2>THE ISRAELITE USE OF INCENSE </h2>

<p>It was said that Moses, at the direction of Almighty God,
first brought in the use of incense in public worship, and that
the other nations of antiquity copied the practice from him. It
was however a practice that began with Adam. The &quot;Book of
Jubilees&quot;, an Apocryphal book, (the Apocrypha was considered
canonical by the early church and is to this day by the Ethiopian
Zion Coptic Church) states that &quot;on the day when Adam went
forth from the Garden of Eden, he offered as a sweet savour an
offering of frankincense, galbanum, and stacte, and spices, in
the morning with the rising of the sun, from the day when he
covered his shame.&quot; And of Enoch we read that &quot;he burnt
the incense of the sanctuary, even sweet spices, acceptable
before the Lord, on the Mount.&quot; </p>

<p>Incense was assigned miraculous powers by the Israelites. It
was burned in golden bowls or cauldrons placed on or beside the
altar. It was also burned in hand-held censers. In the Blessing
of Moses, a poem belonging to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and
written about 760 B.C., the sacrificial smoke is offered to the
God of Israel. </p>

<p>Let them teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; Let
them offer sacrificial smoke to thy nostrils, and whole burnt
sacrifice upon thy altar. </p>

<p>Throughout the Bible the ancient patriarchs were brought into
communion with God through smoking incense and at Mt. Sinai God
talked to Moses out of a bush that burned with fire (Exodus 3:1-
12). After Moses brought the Israelite people out of Egypt he
returned to Mt. Sinai at which time God made a covenant with
Moses in which the Ten Commandments were revealed. Exodus 19:8
describes the conditions at the time of this covenant. </p>

<p>Exodus 19:8 &quot;And Mount Sinai was altogether on smoke,
because the Lord descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof
ascended as smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked
greatly. </p>

<p>The Mysterious smoke mentioned in the covenant on Mt. Sinai is
also referred to as a cloud. Exodus 24:15 &quot;And Moses went up
into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 16 And the glory
of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six
days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst
of the cloud. </p>

<p>Scriptures make it abundantly clear that the clouds and the
smoke are related to the burning of incense. Exodus 40:26
describes Moses burning incense, a cloud covering the tent of the
congregation and the glory of the Lord filling the tabernacle. </p>

<p>Leviticus 16:2-13 describes how God appeared in a cloud and
refers to it as the clouds of incense. Numbers 16:17-19 describes
how every man of the congregation had a censer full of burning
incense and that the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the
congregation. </p>

<p>Isaiah 6:4 describes how Ezekial saw God in a smoke-filled
inner court. Numbers 11:25 describes how God was revealed to
Moses and the seventy elders in a cloud; that the spirit rested
upon them and that they prophesied and ceased not. </p>

<p>The Book of Grass by Andrew and Vinkenoog includes a section
on Ancient Scythia and Iran by Mircea Eliade, one of the foremost
experts on the history of religions. On pages 11 and 12 is the
following: </p>

<p>&quot;On one document appears to indicate the existence of a
Getic shamanism: It is Straho's account of the Myssian
KAPNOBATAI, a name that has been translated, by analogy with
Aristophanes' AEROBATES, as 'those who walk in clouds'; but it
should be translated as 'those who walk in smoke'! Presumably the
smoke is hemp smoke, a rudimentary means of ecstasy known to both
the Tracians and the Scythians...&quot; </p>

<p>This passage should be carefully noted. Biblical passages make
it abundantly clear that the ancient Isrealites also walked in
clouds and in smoke. In fact it was in the clouds of smoke that
God was revealed to the ancient Isrealites. The words
&quot;smoke&quot; and &quot;smoking&quot; appear fifty times in
the King James Version of the Bible and two separate times the
Bible says of the Lord, &quot;There went up a smoke out of his
nostrils.&quot; II Samuel 22:9, Psalms 18:8. </p>

<p>There are numerous other places in the Bible that mention the
burning of incense, the mysterious cloud, and smoke. This common
thread is found throughout the Bible, including the New
Testament. St. Matthew 24:30 &quot;And then shall appear the sign
of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the
Earth morn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the
clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.&quot; </p>

<p>Revelations 1:7 &quot;Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every
eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all the
kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so,
Amen.&quot; </p>

<p>Revelations 8:3 &quot;And another angel came and stood at the
altar, having a golden censer: and there was given unto him much
incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints
upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 4 And the
smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints,
ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand.&quot; </p>

<p>Revelations 15:8 &quot;And the temple was filled with smoke
from the glory of God, and from his power.&quot; </p>

<h2>THE SYMBOLISM OF FIRE IN THE ANCIENT WORLD </h2>

<p>The word &quot;fire&quot; is mentioned several hundred times
in the King James version of the Bible. The sacrifice of the Lord
is made by fire (Exodus 29:18, 25; Leviticus 2:10-11; Leviticus
6:13; Numbers 28:6; Deuteronomy 4:33; Joshua 13:14; I Samuel
2:28; II Chronicles 2:4; Isaiah 24:15; Matthew 3:11; Luke 1:9;
Revelations 8:4-5) </p>

<p>Abraham, the father of the Israelite nation, came from Ur
which was a city of Ancient Sumer in South Babylonia. For the
Babylonians, fire was essential to sacrifice and all oblations
were conveyed to the gods by the fire god Girru-Nusku, whose
presence as an intermediary between the gods and man was
indispensable. Girru-Nusku, as the messenger of the gods, bore
the essence of the offerings upward to them in the smoke of
sacrificial fire. </p>

<p>At Babylon: &quot;The glorious gods smell the incense, noble
food of heaven; pure wine which no hand has touched do they
enjoy.&quot; (L. Jeremias, in Encyclopedia Biblica, i.v. 4119,
quoting Rawlinson, Cuneif. Inscrip. IV, 19 (59).) </p>

<p>The most important of the ancient Indian gods was Agni, the
god of fire, who like the Babylonian god Girru-Nusku acted as a
messenger between men and the gods. The fire (Agni) upon the
altar was regarded as a messenger, their invoker. </p>

<p>&quot;...For thou, O sage, goest wisely between these two
creations like a friendly messenger between two hamlets.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the section on
&quot;mysticism&quot;: </p>

<p>&quot;The Vedas (Hindu sacred writings) are hymns to the
mystic fire and the inner sense of sacrifice, burning forever on
the 'altar Mind'. Hence the abundance of solar and fire images:
birds of fire, the fire of the sun, and the isles of fire. The
symbol system of the world's religions and mysticisms are
profound illuminations of the human-divine mystery. Be it the
cave of the heart or the lotus of the heart, 'the dwelling place
of that which is the Essence of the Universe, &quot;the third
eye&quot;, or the eye of wisdom' - the symbols all refer back to
wisdom entering the aspiring soul on its way to progressive
self-understanding. 'I saw the Lord with the Eye of the Heart. I
said, &quot;Who art thou?&quot; and he answered,
&quot;Thou&quot;'.&quot; </p>

<p>The ancient Indian mystics said, &quot;...that in the ecstasy
of bhang (marijuana) the spark of the Eternal in man turns into
light the murkiness of matter or illusion and the self is lost in
the central soul fire. Raising man out of himself and above mean
individual worries, bhang makes him one with the divine force of
nature and the mystery 'I am he' grew plain. (Taken from the
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report which was written at the turn
of the twentieth century.) </p>

<p>The concept of spiritual or inner light was found throughout
the ancient world. As we shall see that spiritual light was
directly related to the burning of incense. According to Lucie
Lamy in &quot;Egyptian Mysteries&quot;, page 24: &quot;The
Pharaonic word for light is akh. This word, often translated as
'transfigured', designated transcendental light as well as all
aspects of physical light; and in the funerary text it denotes
the state of ultimate sublimation. </p>

<p>&quot;The word akh, first of all, is written with a glyph
showing a crested ibis, ibis comata. This bird - the name of
which was also akh -- lived in the southern part of the Arabian
side of the Red Sea (near Al Qunfidhah) and migrated to Abyssinia
(Ethiopia) during the winter. Both these places are near the
regions from which sacred incense came, and were called the
&quot;Divine Land&quot;. The bird's crest, together with its dark
green plumage shot with glittering metallic specks justifies the
meanings 'to shine', 'to be resplendent', 'to irradiate'; of the
root akh in the hieroglyphic writing. &quot;Akh indeed expresses
all notions of light, both literally and figuratively, from the
Light which comes forth from Darkness to the transcendental light
of transfiguration. It is also used to designate the 'third eye',
the ureaeus, related in old tradition to the pineal body and to
the spirit.&quot; </p>

<p>In the next chapter we will see that the sacred cloud of
incense was instrumental in the transfiguration of Christ. Note
that Ethiopia was referred to as the &quot;Divine Land&quot; and
that it was the source for the sacred incense. The ancients also
referred to Ethiopia as the &quot;Land of God&quot;. </p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians believed that they had received their
divinities from Ethiopia and have always held to the ancient and
honored tradition of their southern origin. Ethiopia is so
important in ancient history that it is mentioned as being in the
Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:12). </p>

<p>The ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote: &quot;The
Ethiopians conceived themselves to be of greater antiquity than
any other nation; and it is probable that, born under the sun's
path, its warmth may have ripened them earlier than other men.
They supposed themselves to be the inventors of worship, of
festivals, of solemn assemblies, of sacrifice, and every
religious practice.&quot; </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT </h2>

<p>According to Jack Herer in The Emperor Wears No Clothes or
Everything You Wanted to Know About Marijuana But Were Not Taught
in School, &quot;The Essenes, a kabalistic priest/prophet/healer
sect of Judaism dating back to the era of the Dead Sea Scrolls,
used hemp, as did the Theraputea of Egypt, from where we get the
term 'therapeutic'.&quot; </p>

<p>The Theraputea of Egypt were Jewish ascetics that dwelt near
Alexandria and described by Philo (1st century B.C.) as devoted
to contemplation and meditation. Alexandria is where St. Mark is
traditionally held to have established the Coptic Church in 45
A.D. </p>

<p>The Coptic Church has been neglected by Western scholars
despite its historical significance. This has been due to the
various biases and interest of the Catholic Church which claimed
Christianity for its own. The result is that for the Coptic
Church there is very little history. It is however assumed that
the Coptic religious services have their roots in the earliest
layers of Christian ritual in Jerusalem and it is known that the
Coptic church is of ancient origin going back to the time of the
first Christian communities and even before. </p>

<p>Tradition states that &quot;Coptic&quot; was derived from
&quot;Kuftaim&quot;, son of Mizraim, a grandchild of Noah who
first settled in the Nile valley, i the neighborhood of Thebes,
the ancient capital of Egypt. </p>

<p>At one time Thebes was the greatest city in the world and
history records that by 2200 B.C. the whole of Egypt was united
under a Theban prince. The splendor of Thebes was known to Homer,
who called it &quot;the city with a hundred gates&quot;. (Richard
Schultes states that in ancient Thebes marijuana was made into a
drink.) </p>

<p>According to E.A. Wallis Budge in The Divine Origin of the
Herbalist, page 79, &quot;The Copts, that is to say the Egyptians
who accepted the teachings of St. Mark in the first century of
our era, and embraced Christianity, seem to have eschewed medical
science as taught by the physicians of the famous School of
Medicine of Alexandria, and to have been content with the methods
of healing employed by their ancestors.&quot; </p>

<p>The Essenes were an ascetic sect closely related to the
Theraputea that had established a monastic order in the desert
outside of Palestine and were known as spiritual healers. It has
been suggested that both John the Baptist and Jesus may have been
of the Essene sect as they were both heavily dependent on Essene
teachings. The scripture makes no mention of the life of Jesus
from the age of 13 to 30. Certain theologians speculate that
Jesus was being initiated by the Essenes, the last fraternity to
keep alive the ancient traditions of the prophets. </p>

<p>Every prophet, however great, must be initiated. His higher
self must be awakened and made conscious so that his mission can
be fulfilled. Amongst the Essenes' ritual lustrations preceded
most liturgical rites, the most important one of which was
participation in a sacred meal -- an anticipation of the
Messianic banquet. </p>

<p>Throughout the ancient world sacrifice was a sacramental
communal meal involving the idea of the god as a participant in
the meal or as identical with the food consumed. The communion
sacrifice was one in which the deity indwells the oblation so
that the worshippers actually consume the divine. The original
motive of sacrifice was an effort toward communion among the
members of a group, on one hand, and between them and their god,
on the other. </p>

<p>At its best, sacrifice was a &quot;sacrament&quot; and in one
form or another life itself. </p>

<p>The central focus of the early Christian church was the
Eucharist or the &quot;body and blood&quot; of the Lord. This was
interpreted as a fellowship meal with the resurrected Christ. In
meeting the Resurrected One in the Eucharist meal the Christian
community had the expectation of the Kingdom of God and
salvation. Christ communicated life to his disciples through the
Eucharist or Christian sacrament. Christ said in describing the
sacrament, &quot;Take, eat, this is my body, this is my blood. Do
this as often as you will in remembrance of me.&quot; (I
Corinthians 11:24- 25) </p>

<p>Baptism is defined as the Christian sacrament used in
purification and the spiritual rebirth of the individual. I
Corinthians 10:1 makes it clear that the smoking cloud of incense
was directly related to baptism. I Corinthians 10:1
&quot;Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
how that our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through
the sea; 2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the Cloud and in
the sea; 3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat: for they
drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock
was Christ. </p>

<p>In the Biblical story of Creation, God said, &quot;Behold, I
have given you every herb bearing seed and to you it will be for
meat.&quot; (Genesis 1:29) Marijuana is technically an herb and
was considered a spiritual meat in the ancient world. </p>

<p>From this passage in Corinthians we see that the spiritual
cloud resulting from the burning of incense was instrumental in
the baptism of the Israelites. This baptism is also compared to
the &quot;eating and drinking&quot; of the spirit of Christ.
Spirit is defined as the active essence of the Deity serving as
an invisible and life-giving or inspiring power in motion. </p>

<p>Scripture makes it abundantly clear that the sacrificial cloud
or smoke contained the Spirit of God (Christ) and was
instrumental in inspiring, sanctifying, and purifying the
patriarchs. </p>

<p>In Numbers 11:25 the cloud results in the Spirit resting upon
Moses and the seventy elders. This passage indicates that they
prophesied ecstatically. &quot;Prophesy&quot; is defined as
follows: to utter or announce by or as if by divine inspiration;
to speak for God or a deity; to give instruction in religious
matters. </p>

<p>Throughout the Holy Bible prophets of God spake as they were
moved by the Holy Spirit. The smoking burning cloud of incense
contained the spirit and was instrumental in bringing about the
spiritual revelations of the prophets. In the ancient world
marijuana was used to reveal the future. The virtues of marijuana
include speech-giving and inspiration of mental powers.
&quot;Psychoactive&quot; is defined as effecting the mind or
behavior. When we of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church think of
mind or behavior we think of that inward essence or element that
makes up the individual. This is the person's spirit. We are all
spiritual beings. It is just as important to keep the spiritual
part of a person healthy as it is to keep the physical body
healthy and in fact they are related. Hence marijuana and its
relationship to spiritual food. </p>

<p>In the Apocrypha (Book of Jubilees), Chapter 10, God tells an
angel to teach Noah the medicines which heal and protect from
evil spirits. Surely God taught Noah about marijuana. In the
ancient world marijuana played an important role in purification
and protecting from evil influences. </p>

<p>Note the following concerning the transfiguration of Christ:
St. Matthew 17:1 &quot;And after six days Jesus taketh Peter,
James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high
mountain apart. 2 And he was transfigured before them: and his
face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as light. 3
And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
with him. 4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is
good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
tabernacles; one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. 5
When yet he spake, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them; and
behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.&quot; </p>

<p>The Bible Dictionary by John McKenzie, page 898, says
concerning the transfiguration that the cloud and the formula of
the utterance of the Father are derived from the baptism of
Jesus. </p>

<p>He says that the change described in the appearance of Jesus
suggests the change which is implied in the resurrection
narratives. </p>

<p>Some of the synonyms for transfiguration are transformation,
metamorphosis, transubstantiation, and avatar. These terms imply
the change that accompanies resurrection or deification. Across
the world, legends of godlike men who manage to rise, in a state
of perfection go back to an era before human beings had cast away
from the divine source. Hence the gods were beings which once
were men, and the actual race of men will in time become gods.
Christ revealed this to the people of his day when he told them
to whom the word of God came, &quot;Ye are gods.&quot; (St. John
10:34) </p>

<p>St. Matthew 17:2 says that during the transfiguration of
Christ that his face did shine as the sun. The face of Moses also
shone when he returned from the cloud on Mt. Sinai (Exodus
30:34). </p>

<p>The shining countenances are the result of their
resurrections, of their being spiritually illumined in the cloud
of smoking incense. Most people are under the impression that
Christ baptized with water. As you can see from the following
account of John the Baptist this isn't so. John the Baptist
baptized with water and Christ baptized with fire. </p>

<p>St. Matthew 3:11 &quot;I indeed baptize you with water into
repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose
shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy
Spirit and with fire.&quot; </p>

<p>It is only logical that this baptism with the Holy Spirit and
with fire is related to the baptism of Christ in the burning,
smoking cloud of incense and to the baptism of the patriarchs in
which the patriarchs did all eat of the same spiritual meal
(incense). In the section dealing with the &quot;Holy
Spirit&quot; the Encyclopedia Britannica states that Christian
writers have seen in various references to the Spirit of Yahweh
in the Old Testament an anticipation of the doctrine of the Holy
Spirit. It also says that the Holy Spirit is viewed as the main
agent of man's restoration to his original natural state through
communion in Christ's body and, thus, as the principle of life in
the Christian community. The patriarchs were recipients of a
revelation coming directly from the Spirit (incense) and this was
expressed in the heightening and enlargement of their
consciousness. It is clear from Scripture that this spiritual
dimension was also evident in the life of Jesus, in whom the
experience of the Hebrew prophets was renewed. </p>

<p>Through the Eucharist Christ passed this spiritual dimension
on to his apostles. One of the apostles even makes mention in
Philippians 4:18 of a sweet smelling sacrifice that is well
pleasing to God. </p>

<p>Christ compares this baptism to the drinking of a cup. St.
Mark 10:38 &quot;But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye
ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with?&quot; </p>

<p>This cup is referred to as the cup of salvation in Psalms
116:12. </p>

<p>Psalms 116:12 &quot;What shall I render unto the Lord for all
his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation and call
upon the name of the Lord. It is called the cup of blessing in
connection in connection with the eucharist. </p>

<p>1 Corinthians 10:16 &quot;The cup of blessing which we bless,
is it not the communion of the blood and the body of Christ? 17
For we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all
partakers of one bread. Here we see a connection between the cup
of blessing and the communion of the blood of Christ. Blood is
the life-giving substance of the living being. Christ
communicated life to his disciples through the Eucharist or
Christian sacrament. </p>

<p>In I Corinthians 10:16 we note the mention of bread as the
communion of the body of Christ and that we are all partakers of
one bread. This is the spiritual bread or food used by Christ and
his disciples. (A synonym for the Eucharist or the Body and Blood
of the Lord is the bread of life.) It is interesting to note that
the finest marijuana in Jamaica is called Lamb's bread. </p>

<p>1 Corinthians 12:13 &quot;For by one Spirit are we all
baptized into one body, whether we be Jew or Gentiles, whether we
be bond or free; and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.
</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 11:25 &quot;After the same manner also he took
the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the New
Testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread and drink
this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. </p>

<p>If these passages are compared to 1 Corinthians 10:1-4, it is
plain that the &quot;eating of one bread&quot; is the same as the
patriarchs &quot;eating the same spiritual meat&quot; and the
&quot;drinking of one Spirit&quot; (the cup) is the same as the
patriarchs &quot;drinking of the Spiritual Rock that followed
them: and that Rock was Christ.&quot; By making this comparison
we see that the terminology of the Eucharist is directly related
to the smoking cloud of incense used in the baptism of Christ and
the patriarchs. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that smoking was referred to as
&quot;eating&quot; or &quot;drinking&quot; by the early American
Indians. Peter J. Furst in Hallucinogen and Culture states the
following: &quot;Considering its enormous geographic spread in
the Americas at the time of European discovery, as well as the
probable age of stone tobacco pipes in California, the inhaling
(often called &quot;drinking&quot; or &quot;eating&quot;) of
tobacco smoke by the Shaman, as a corollary to therapeutic
fumigation and the feeding of the gods with smoke, must also be
of considerable antiquity.&quot; </p>

<p>In Licit and Illicit Drugs, page 209, the following is quoted:
</p>

<p>&quot;Columbus and other early explorers who followed him were
amazed to meet Indians who carried rolls of dried leaves that
they set afire -- and who then &quot;drank the smoke&quot; that
emerged from the rolls. Other Indians carried pipes in which they
burned the same leaves, and from which they similarly &quot;drank
the smoke&quot;. </p>

<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica states in the section on
&quot;Sacrifice&quot; that the interpretation of sacrifice and
particularly of the Eucharist as sacrifice has varied greatly
within the different Christian traditions because of the
sacrificial terminology in which the Eucharist was originally
described became foreign to Christian thinkers. </p>

<p>We of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church declare that the true
understanding of the Eucharist has been passed down from
generation to generation so that we are able to give an accurate
interpretation of the sacrificial terminology used to describe
the Eucharist. We have shown, using history and Biblical
passages, that his terminology is directly related to burning
smoking incense. We have shown that the &quot;eating&quot; or
&quot;drinking&quot; contained in the terminology concerning the
Eucharist is associated with the inhalation of smoke. We have
shown that marijuana was used as incense and that it was the
number one spiritual plant of the ancient world. </p>

<p>We of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church declare that the cup
that Christ baptized his disciples with in the baptism of the
Holy Spirit and fire was in fact a pipe or chillum in which
marijuana was smoked. This is a bottomless cup and soon as it is
emptied, it is filled again and passed in a circle. There is a
picture of this cup or pipe below, as well as on the cover. Like
the pipe of the ancient North American Indians, this cup was a
portable altar. Christ was the Father of the doctrine of the
Eucharist which is the communion that Jesus gave his brethren.
Jesus taught that the communion is his body and blood. Jesus was
not speaking of His physical body and blood. He was speaking of
His spiritual body and spiritual blood that was the communion of
his holy church. The supper that Jesus celebrated with his
disciples &quot;on the night that he was betrayed&quot; (1
Corinthians 11:23) inaugurated the heavenly meal that was to be
continued. </p>

<p>1 Corinthians 11:23 &quot;For I have received of the Lord that
which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same
night in which he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had
given thanks, he brake it and said, Take, eat, this is my body,
which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. 25 After
the same manner also he took the cup, which he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as
oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye
eat this bread, and drink of this cup, ye do shew the Lord's
death till he come. 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
bread, and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man
examine himself, and let him eat of the bread, and drink of that
cup. 29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. </p>

<p>Christ said, &quot;Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; Here
the original unity of man with God is restored. In general the
reception of the Holy Spirit is connected with the actual
realization, the inward experiencing of God. Marijuana has been
referred to as a mild euphoric (the producer of a feeling of
well-being) that produces a profound religious experience of a
mystical and transcendental nature. This religious experience is
said to be brought about by the stirring of deeply buried,
unconscious sensitivities so that one experiences ultimate
reality or the divine and confirms the feeling of the worshipper
that he has been in the presence of God and has assimilated some
of His powers. </p>

<p>To be lifted above sense to behold the beatific vision and
become &quot;incorporate&quot; in God is the end sought in
ecstasy. The priest or mystic in enthusiasm or ecstasy enjoys the
beatific vision by entering into communion with God and by
undergoing deification. The experience of ecstasy, states Mircea
Eliade, one of the foremost authorities on religion, is a
timeless primary phenomenon. Psychological experience of rapture,
he continues, are fundamental to the human condition and hence
known to the whole of archaic humanity. (Some of the synonyms of
rapture are bliss, beatitude, transport, exaltation.) </p>

<p>Baudelaire, a member of the Club Des Hashichins (Hashish Club)
founded in Paris around 1835 and writer of Artificial Paradises
states the following about hashish: Hashish is the unadulterated
resin from the flowering tops of the female hemp plant. </p>

<p>&quot;One will find in hashish nothing miraculous, absolutely
nothing but an exaggeration of the natural. The brain and
organisms on which hashish operates will produce only the normal
phenomena peculiar to that individual -- increased, admittedly,
in number and force, but always faithful to the original. A man
will never escape from his destined physical and moral
temperament: hashish will be a mirror of his impression and
private thoughts - a magnifying mirror, it is true, but only a
mirror. </p>

<p>He cautions that the user must be in the right frame of mind
to take hashish, for just as it exaggerates the natural behavior
of the individual, so too does hashish intensify the user's
immediate feelings. Baudelaire describes three successive phases
a hashish user will pass through. He says the final stage is
marked by a feeling of calmness, in which time and space have no
meaning, and there is a sense that one has transcended matter. He
says that in this state, one final supreme thought breaks into
consciousness. &quot;I have become God.&quot; </p>

<p>Realization of one's union with God is necessary in
understanding the true Christian sacrament. The understanding of
man's relationship to God and God's relationship to man (God in
Man and Man in God) was quite prevalent in the ancient world,
particularly among the religions that utilized marijuana as part
of their religious practice. </p>

<p>Said the great Hindu sage, Manu, &quot;He who in his own soul
perceives the Supreme Soul in all beings and acquires equanimity
toward them all, attains the highest bliss.&quot; To recognize
oneness of self with God was contained in all the teachings of
Gautama Buddha. In the Liturgy of Mithra (the Persian god of
light and truth) the suppliant prays &quot;abide with me in my
soul; leave me not,&quot; and &quot;that I may be initiated and
the Holy Spirit may breathe within me.&quot; The communion became
so intimate as to pass into identity: &quot;I am thou and thou
art I.&quot; Athanasius, a theologian, ecclesiastical statesman,
and Egyptian national leader who was closely tied to the Coptic
Church in Egypt said, &quot;Even we may become gods walking in
the flesh,&quot; and &quot;God became man that man might become
God.&quot; </p>

<p>Western theology (Catholic and Protestant) teaches that the
spirit created matter but remained aloof of it. In Hinduism and
other Eastern religions, the spirit is the inside, the matter is
the outside; the two are inseparable. Eastern theologians hive
rightly perceived that the God one worships must posses all the
aspects of his worshippers' nature as well as his own divine
nature. Otherwise, how can he create beings whose nature is
entirely foreign to his own? What, then, would be the meaning of
the Biblical phrase: &quot;God made man in his own image&quot;? </p>

<p>The fact that modern Christendom has no sense of union with
God has led to numerous churches without the understanding for
building a Christian culture and kingdom to replace the confusion
of modern politics. This lack of understanding was not lacking in
the ancient church and was a major source of enthusiasm for the
prophets of old. In fact, the power of the early church was
manifested due to this understanding of the spirit of God
dwelling in man, the temple of God. To the ancient prophets it
was not a God above, nor a God over yonder, but a God within.
&quot;Be still and know that I am God&quot; -- for the
visionaries and mystics of every time and place, this has been
the first and greatest of the commandments. </p>

<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:28 Christ said, &quot;Let a man examine
himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the
cup.&quot; Probably the most relevant study to date about what
might be considered typical marijuana experience concludes that
marijuana gives spontaneous insights into self (Dr. Charles Tart,
&quot;On Being Stoned: A Psychological Study of Marijuana
Intoxication&quot;, Science and Behavior, 1971). </p>

<p>The sacramentality of marijuana is declared by Christ himself
and can be understood only when a person partakes of the natural
divine herb. The fact is communion of Jesus cannot be disputed or
be destroyed. Marijuana is the new wine divine and cannot be
compared to the old wine, which is alcohol. Jesus rejected the
old wine and glorified the &quot;new wine&quot; at the wedding
feast of Cana. </p>

<p>Cana is a linguistic derivation of the present day cannabis
and so it is. (Some Biblical scholars -- and there is a certain
amount of support in early tradition of the view -- have looked
upon the miracle of Cana as a sign of the Eucharist.) </p>

<p>Note the references to new wine in the Bible: </p>

<p>Isaiah 65:8 &quot;Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is
found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a
blessing is in it; so will I do for my servant's sake&quot; </p>

<p>Acts 2:13 &quot;Others mocking said, &quot;These men are full
of new wine.&quot; </p>

<p>Isaiah 65:8 declares that the new wine is found in the cluster
and that a blessing is in it. When one mentions clusters, one
thinks of clusters of grapes. Webster's New Riverside Dictionary,
Office Edition, defines marijuana: 1. Hemp 2. The dried flower
clusters and leaves of the hemp plant, esp. when taken to induce
euphoria. </p>

<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica says the following about hemp: </p>

<p>Seed producing flowers form elongate, spike like clusters
growing on the pistillate, or female plants; pollen producing
flowers form many branched clusters or staminate, on male plants.
Here and in Webster's, marijuana fits the description of the new
wine and as history has shown a blessing is in it. Baudelaire
said the following about the effects of hashish: &quot;This
marvelous experience often occurs as if it were the effect of
superior and invisible power acting on the person from
without...This delightful and singular state...gives no advance
warning. It is as unexpected as a ghost, an intermittent haunting
from which we must draw, if we are wise, the certainty of a
better existence. This acuteness of thought, this enthusiasm of
the senses and the spirit must have appeared to man through the
ages as the first blessing.&quot; </p>

<p>In the books of Acts the apostles were accused of being full
of new wine. Acts 2:13 was the time of pentecost when the Holy
Spirit descended upon the apostles. Numerous outpourings of the
Spirit are mentioned in the Acts of the apostles in which
healing, prophesy, and the expelling of demons are particularly
associated with the activity of the Spirit. Incense (marijuana)
was used by the ancients for healing, prophesy, and the expelling
of demons. </p>

<p>When Christ ascended into heaven in the cloud (Acts 1:9-11) he
sent his disciples the Holy Spirit with the &quot;gift of
tongues&quot; (Acts 2:3) and there appeared unto them cloven
tongues like as a fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they
were filled with the Holy Spirit and were given the power to
prophesy or witness. </p>

<p>(Marijuana has been credited with speech giving and
inspiration of mental powers.) </p>

<p>The first two gifts of the Holy Spirit are traditionally said
to be wisdom and understanding, which no doubt are the two things
most needed by the human race. In Jamaica today marijuana is
referred to as the &quot;weed of wisdom&quot; and is reputed to
be the plant that grew on Solomon's grave, a man known for his
great wisdom. Marijuana expands consciousness and enhances the
capacity for mystical and creative inspiration. </p>

<p>In Acts 2:3 Fire speaks figuratively of the Holy Spirit. Fire
was also a means which to transport a saint to heaven. 2 Kings
2:11 &quot;And it came to pass, as they still went on, and
talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and
horses of fire, and parted asunder; and Elijah went up by a
whirlwind into heaven.&quot; </p>

<p>Recent writers have speculated that this passage was in
reference to flying saucers. That is because they look at this
passage physically. This ascension of Elijah like the ascension
of Christ in the cloud into heaven is the &quot;withdrawal&quot;
from the external or physical world, to be the inmost reality of
all. This can be referred to as ecstasy, rapture, or transport
and is a result of the Holy Spirit. Ecstasy, rapture, or
transport therefor agree in designating a feeling or state of
intense, often extreme mental and emotional exaltation. Rapture
is defined as ecstatic joy or delight; joyful ecstasy. Some of
the synonyms of rapture are bliss, beatitude, transport, and
exultation. The true rapture is therefore one in which one is
spiritually transported to the heavens. Don't expect to float up
into the sky. </p>

<p>Marijuana as history has shown is the catalyst used to achieve
the spiritual journey into the heavens. That is why in India it
was referred to as the Heavenly-Guide, the Poor Man's Heaven, and
the Sky-flier. That is why Professor Mircea Eliade, perhaps the
foremost authority on the history of religion, suggested that
Zoroaster may have caused hemp to bridge the metaphysical gap
between heaven and earth. </p>

<p>One dictionary defines marijuana as the leaves and flowering
tops when taken to induce euphoria. Euphoria is defined by the
same dictionary as great happiness or bliss. (In India, marijuana
has been referred to as the joy-giver and the soother of grief.) </p>

<p>Bliss is defined as the ecstasy of salvation, spiritual joy.
Some of the synonyms of bliss are beatitude, transport, rapture,
ecstasy, paradise, heaven. </p>

<p>Throughout the ancient world there is mention of &quot;magical
flight&quot;, &quot;ascent to heaven&quot;, and &quot;mystical
journey&quot;. All these mythological and folklore traditions
have their point of departure in an ideology and technique of
ecstasy that imply &quot;journey in spirit&quot;. </p>

<p>The pilgrimage from earth to heaven is not a journey to some
other place or some other time, but is a journey within. One must
realize that &quot;death&quot; through which we must pass before
God can be seen does not lie ahead of us in time. Rather it is
now that we have a man of sin within us that must be killed and a
new man free from sin that must be born. This is actualized in
baptism and the sacramental life in the church. For as many of
you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ
(Galatians 3:27). The effect of baptism is spiritual regeneration
or rebirth, whereby one is &quot;enChristened&quot;, involving
both union with Christ and remission of sins. In Titus 3:5
baptism is the &quot;bath of regeneration&quot; accompanying
renewal by the Spirit. Some of the synonyms of regeneration are
beatification, conversion, sanctification, salvation,
inspiration, bread of life, Body and Blood of Christ. Sara
Benetowa of the Institute of Anthropological Sciences in Warsaw
is quoted in the Book of Grass as saying: </p>

<p>&quot;By comparing the old Slavic word 'Kepati' and the
Russian 'Kupati' with the Scythian 'cannabis' Shrader developed
and justified Meringer's supposition that there is a link between
the Scythian baths and Russian vapor baths. </p>

<p>&quot;In the entire Orient even today to 'go to the bath'
means not only to accomplish an act of purification and enjoy a
pleasure, but also to fulfill the divine law. Vambery calls
'bath' any club in which the members play checkers, drink coffee,
and smoke hashish or tobacco.&quot; </p>

<p>St. Matthew's account of the institution of the Eucharist
attaches to the Eucharist cup these words: &quot;Drink of it, all
of, for this is the blood of the covenant, which is poured out
for many for the remission of sins (st. Matthew 26:27). Drinking
the sacramental cup therefor serves like baptism (Acts 2:38)
where Peter said unto them, &quot;Repent, and be baptized
everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. We of the
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church declare a three-part doctrine of the
Holy Herb, the Holy Word, and the Holy Man (Woman). </p>

<p>The present and future benefits to the individual communicant
have their importance given them by Jesus, who said, &quot;He who
eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will
raise them up at the last day.&quot; (John 6:54) As such we must
see that the divine person who is active in creation, in renewal,
and in human rebirth and resurrection, is also active in the
Eucharist. There was a profound change in America when marijuana
smoking started on a large scale in the late 1960's. A large
number of people resisted the draft, resisted the war ... started
letting their hair and beards grow ... became interested in
natural foods... the ecology and the environment. What we really
saw was the awakening of our generation to the beginning of
Christian mentality through marijuana smoking. The earmarks of
this mentality are: I don't want to go to war; I really don't
want to be part of the political-military-economic fiasco you
call society. </p>

<p>Like the Indians Hemp Drug Commission three quarters of a
century earlier, the Canadian Le Dain Commission conducted an
inquiry into the use of marijuana. On page 156 of the report is
the following: &quot;In the case of cannabis, the positive points
which are claimed for it include the following: It is a relaxant;
it is disinhibiting; it increases self-confidence and the feeling
of creativity (whether justified by creative results or not); it
increases sensual awareness and appreciation; it facilitates self
acceptance and in this way makes it easier to accept others; it
serves a sacramental function in promoting a sense of spiritual
community among users; it is a shared pleasure; because it is
illicit and the object of strong disapproval from those who are,
by and large, opposed to social change, it is a symbol of protest
and a means of strengthening the sense of identity among those
who are strongly critical of certain aspects of our society and
value structure today.&quot; </p>

<p>On page 144 of the Report, marijuana is associated with peace.
&quot;In our conversation with (students and young people) they
have frequently contrasted marijuana and alcohol effects to
describe the former as a drug of peace, a drug that reduces
tendencies to aggression while suggesting that the latter drug
produces hostile, aggressive behavior. Thus marijuana is seen as
particularly appropriate to a generation that emphasizes peace
and is, in many ways, anticompetitive.&quot; </p>

<p>In a magazine article by G. S. Chopra entitled &quot;Man and
Marijuana&quot; on page 235 is a section dealing with Human
Experiments. One hundred persons with an established marijuana
smoking habit smoked marijuana. They described the symptoms as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;I have done things today which I usually dislike but
which I rather enjoyed doing today.&quot; &quot;Nothing seemed
impossible to accomplish.&quot; &quot;I assumed a cool and
composed attitude and forgot all mental worries.&quot; &quot;I
behaved in a childish and foolish manner.&quot; &quot;It relieves
sense of fatigue and gives rise to feelings of happiness.&quot;
&quot;I feel like laughing.&quot; &quot;My head is dizzy.&quot;
&quot;I feel like taking more food.&quot; &quot;The world is gay
around me.&quot; &quot;I feel inclined to work.&quot; &quot;I am
a friend to all and have no enemy in the world.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, in the section on
&quot;Roman Catholicism&quot;: </p>

<p>&quot;To understand the meaning and use of the Eucharist we
must see it as an act of universal worship, of cooperation, of
association else it loses the greater part of its significance.
Neither in Roman Catholic nor in Protestant Eucharistic practice
does the sacrament retain much of the symbolism of Christian
unity, which clearly it has. Originally, the symbolism was that
of a community meal, an accepted social symbol of community
throughout the whole of human culture.&quot; </p>

<p>Marijuana has been used as sacrifice, a sacrament, a ritual
fumigant (incense), a good-will offering, and as a means of
communing with the divine spirit. It has been used to seal
treaties, friendships, solemn binding agreements and to
legitimize covenants. It has been used as a traditional defense
against evil and in purification. It has been used in divinations
(1. the art or practice that seeks to foresee or foretell future
events or discover hidden knowledge; 2. unusual insight;
intuitive perception.) It has been used in remembrance of the
dead and praised for its medicinal properties. </p>

<p>Most Christians agree that participation in the Eucharist is
supposed to enhance and deepen communion of believers not only
with Christ but also with one another. We must therefor ask the
question, &quot;What substance did the ancients use as a
community meal to facilitate communion with the Lord?&quot; The
answer to that question is marijuana. Hemp as originally used in
religious ritual, temple activities, and tribal rites, involved
groups of worshippers rather than the solitary individual. The
pleasurable psychoactive effects were then, as now, communal
experiences. </p>

<p>Practically every major religion and culture of the ancient
world utilized marijuana as part of their religious observance.
Marijuana was the ambrosia of the ancient world. It was the food,
drink, and perfume of the gods. It was used by the Africans, the
Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Asians, the Europeans, and possibly
the Indians of the Americas. Would it be too much to suggest that
the ancient Israelites also utilized marijuana? </p>

<p>The following information was taken from the most
authoritative books dealing with the history of marijuana. They
are mentioned at the end of this work. </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN INDIA </h2>

<p>In Indian tradition marijuana is associated with immortality.
There is a complex myth of the churning of the Ocean of Milk by
the gods, their joint act of creation. They were in search of
Amrita, the elixir of eternal life. When the gods, helped by
demons, churned the ocean to obtain Amrita, one of the resulting
nectars was cannabis. After churning the ocean, the demons
attempted to gain control of Amrita (marijuana), but the gods
were able to prevent this seizure, giving cannabis the name
Vijaya (&quot;victory&quot;) to commemorate their success. </p>

<p>Other ancient Indian names for marijuana were &quot;sacred
grass&quot;, &quot;hero leaved&quot;, &quot;joy&quot;,
&quot;rejoicer&quot;, &quot;desired in the three worlds&quot;'
&quot;gods' food&quot;, &quot;fountain of pleasures&quot;' and
&quot;Shiva's plant&quot;. </p>

<p>Early Indian legends maintained that the angel of mankind
lived in the leaves of the marijuana plant. It was so sacred that
it was reputed to deter evil and cleanse its user of sin. In
Hindu mythology hemp is a holy plant given to man for the
&quot;welfare of mankind&quot; and is considered to be one of the
divine nectars able to give man anything from good health, to
long life, to visions of the gods. Nectar is defined as the
fabled drink of the gods. </p>

<p>Tradition maintains that when nectar or Amrita dropped from
heaven, that cannabis sprouted from it. In Hindu mythology Amrita
means immortality; also, the ambrosial drink which produced it. </p>

<p>In India hemp is made into a drink and is reputed to be the
favorite drink of Indra (the King of Indian gods.) Tradition
maintains that the god Indra gave marijuana to the people so that
they might attain elevated states of consciousness, delight in
worldly joy, and freedom from fear. </p>

<p>According to Hindu legends, Siva, the Supreme God of many
Hindu sects, had some family squabble and went off to the fields.
He sat under a hemp plant so as to be sheltered from the heat of
the sun and happened to eat some of its leaves. He felt so
refreshed from the hemp plant that it became his favorite food,
and that is how he got his title, the Lord of Bhang. Cannabis is
mentioned as a medicinal and magical plant as well as a
&quot;sacred grass&quot; in the Atharva Veda (dated 2000 - 1400
B.C.) </p>

<p>It also calls hemp one of the five kingdoms of herbs...which
releases us from anxiety and refers to hemp as a &quot;source of
happiness&quot;, &quot;joy-giver&quot; and &quot;liberator&quot;.
Although the holy books, the Shastras, forbid the worship of the
plant, it has been venerated and used as a sacrifice to the
deities. Indian Tradition, writing, and belief is that the
&quot;Siddhartha&quot; (the Buddha), used and ate nothing but
hemp and its seeds for six years prior to announcing
(discovering) his truths and becoming the Buddha. </p>

<p>Cannabis held a preeminent place in the Tantric religion which
evolved in Tibet in the seventh century A.D. Tantrism was a
religion based on fear of demons. To combat the demonic threat to
the world, the people sought protection in plants such as
cannabis which were set afire to overcome evil forces. </p>

<p>In the tenth century A.D. hemp was extolled as indracanna, the
&quot;food of the gods&quot;. A fifteenth-century document refers
to cannabis as &quot;light-hearted&quot;, &quot;joy-full&quot;
and &quot;rejoices&quot;, and claimed that among its virtues are
&quot;astringency&quot;, &quot;heat&quot;,
&quot;speech-giving&quot;, &quot;inspiration of mental
powers&quot;, &quot;excitability&quot; and the capacity to
&quot;remove wind and phlegm&quot;. </p>

<p>Today in the Tantric Buddhism of the Himalayas of Tibet,
cannabis plays a very significant role in the meditative ritual
to facilitate deep meditation and heighten awareness. In modern
India it is taken at Hindu and Sikh temples and Mohammedan
shrines. Among fakirs (Hindu ascetics) bhang is viewed as the
giver of long life and a means of communion with the divine
spirit. Like his Hindu brother, the Musalman fakir reveres bhang
as the lengthener of life and the freer from the bonds of self. </p>

<p>At the turn of the twentieth century, the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission set up to study the use of hemp in India contains the
following report: </p>

<p>&quot;...It is inevitable that temperaments would be found to
whom the quickening spirit of bhang is the spirit of freedom and
knowledge. In the ecstasy of bhang the spark of the Eternal in
man turns into the light the murkiness of matter. </p>

<p>&quot;...Bhang is the Joy-giver, the Sky-filler, the Heavenly-
Guide, the Poor Man's Heaven, the Soother of Grief...No god or
man is as good as the religious drinker of bhang...The supporting
power of bhang has brought many a Hindu family safe through the
miseries of famine. To forbid or even seriously restrict the use
of so gracious an herb as the hemp would cause widespread
suffering and annoyance and to large bands of worshipped
ascetics, deep-seated anger. It would rob the people of a solace
on discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian whose
gracious protection saves them from the attacks of evil
influences... </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN CHINA </h2>

<p>Hemp was so highly regarded in ancient China that the Chinese
called their country &quot;the land of mulberry and hemp&quot;.
Hemp was a symbol of power over evil and in emperor Shen Nung's
pharmacopoeia was known as the &quot;liberator of sin&quot;. The
Chinese believed that the legendary Shen Nung first taught the
cultivation of hemp in the 28th century B.C. Shen Nung is
credited with developing the sciences of medicine from the
curative power of plants. So highly regarded was Shen Nung that
he was deified and today he is regarded as the Father of Chinese
medicine. Shen Nung was also regarded as the Lord of fire. He
sacrificed on T'ai Shan, a mountain of hoary antiquity. </p>

<p>A statement in the Pen-ts'ao Ching of some significance is
that Cannabis &quot;grows along rivers and valleys at T'ai-shan,
but it is now common everywhere.&quot; Mount T'ai is in Shangtung
Privince, where the cultivation of the hemp plant is still
intensive to this day. Whether or not this early attribution
indicates the actual geographic origin of the cultivation of the
Cannabis plant remains to be seen. (An Archeological and
Historical Account of Cannabis in China by Hui-Lin Li) </p>

<p>A chines Taoist priest wrote in the fifth century B.C. that
cannabis was used in combination with Ginseng to set forward time
in order to reveal future events. It is recorded that the Taoist
recommended the addition of cannabis to their incense burners in
the 1st century A.D. and that the effects thus produced were
highly regarded as a means of achieving immortality. In the early
Chinese Taoist ritual the fumes and odors of incense burners were
said to have produced a mystic exaltation and contribution to
well-being. </p>

<p>Webster's New Riverside Dictionary defines marijuana: 1. Hemp
2. The dried flower clusters and leaves of the hemp plant, esp.
when taken to induce euphoria. Euphoria is defined as a strong
feeling of elation or well-being. </p>

<p>Like the practice of medicine around the world, early Chinese
doctoring was based on the concept of demons. The only way to
cure the sick was to drive out the demons. The early priest
doctors used marijuana stalks into which snake-like figures were
carved. </p>

<p>Standing over the body of the stricken patient, his cannabis
stalk poised to strike, the priest pounded the bed and commanded
the demon to be gone. The cannabis stalk with the snake carved on
it was the forerunner to the sign of modern medicine (the staff
with the entwined serpents.) </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN JAPAN </h2>

<p>Hemp was used in Ancient Japan in ceremonial purification
rites and for driving away evil spirits. In Japan, Shinto priests
used a gohei, a short stick with undyed hemp fibers (for purity)
attached to one end. According to Shinto beliefs, evil and purity
cannot exist alongside one another, and so by waving the gohei
(purity) above someone's head the evil spirit inside him would be
driven away. Clothes made of hemp were especially worn during
formal and religious ceremonies because of hemp's traditional
association with purity. </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN ANCIENT IRAN </h2>

<p>Ancient Iran was the source for the great Persian empire, Iran
is located slightly to the northeast of the ancient kingdoms of
Sumeria, Babylonia, and Assyria. According to Mircea Eliade,
&quot;Shamanistic ecstasy induced by hemp smoke was known in
ancient Iran.&quot; Professor Eliade has suggested that
Zoroaster, the Persian prophet, said to have written the
Zend-Avesta, was a user of hemp. </p>

<p>In the Zend-Avesta hemp occupies the first place in a list of
10,000 medicinal plants. One of the few surviving books of the
Zend-Avesta, called the Venidad, &quot;The Law Against
Demons&quot;, calls bhanga (marijuana) Zoroaster's &quot;good
narcotic&quot;, and tells of two mortals who were transported in
soul to the heavens where, upon drinking from a cup of bhang,
they had the highest mysteries revealed to them. </p>

<p>Professor Eliade has theorized that Zoroaster may have used
hemp to bridge the metaphysical gap between heaven and earth. </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN ANCIENT EGYPT </h2>

<p>In the book, Plants of the Gods: Origin of Hallucinogenic Use
by Richard E. Schultes and Albert Hofman, page 72, it is stated
that the specimens of marijuana nearly 4,000 years old have
turned up in an Egyptian site and that in ancient Thebes the
plant was made into a drink. </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN EUROPE </h2>

<p>According to Nikolaas j. van der Merwe (Department of
Archaeology, University of Cape Town, South Africa) the peasants
of Europe have been using cannabis as medicine, ritual material,
and to smoke or chew as far back as oral traditions go. </p>

<p>Marijuana was an integral part of the Scythian cult of the
dead wherein homage was paid to the memory of their departed
leaders. This use of cannabis was found in frozen Scythian tombs
dated from 500 to 300 B.C. Along with the cannabis a miniature
tripod-like tent over a copper censer was found in which the
sacred plant was burned. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that two extraordinary rugs were
also found in the frozen Scythian tombs. One rug had a border
frieze with a repeated composition of a horseman approaching the
Great Goddess who holds the &quot;Tree of Life&quot; in one hand
and raises the other hand in welcome. </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN AFRICA </h2>

<p>The African continent is probably the zone showing the widest
prevalence of the hemp drug habit. When white men first went to
Africa, marijuana was part of the native way of life. Africa was
a continent of marijuana cultures where marijuana was an integral
part of religious ceremony. The Africans were observed inhaling
the smoke from piles of smoldering hemp. Some of these piles had
been placed upon altars. The Africans also utilized pipes. The
African Dagga (marijuana) cults believed that Holy Cannabis was
brought to earth by the gods. (Throughout the ancient world
Ethiopia was considered the home of the gods.) </p>

<p>In south central Africa, marijuana is held to be sacred and is
connected with many religious and social customs. Marijuana is
regarded by some sects as a magic plant possessing universal
protection against all injury to life, and is symbolic of peace
and friendship. Certain tribes consider hemp use a duty. The
earliest evidence for cannabis smoking in Africa outside of Egypt
comes from fourteenth century Ethiopia, where two ceramic
smoking-pipe bowls containing traces of excavation. In many parts
of East Africa, especially near Lake Victoria (the source for the
Nile), hemp smoking and hashish snuffing cults still exist. </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA IN THE NEW WORLD </h2>

<p>According to Richard L. Lingeman in his book Drugs from A to
Z, page 146, &quot;Marijuana smoking was known by the Indians
before Columbus.&quot; After the Spanish conquest in 1521 the
Spaniards recorded that the Aztecs (Mayans) used marijuana. </p>

<p>The present day Cuna Indians of Panama use marijuana as a
sacred herb and the Cora Indians of the Sierra Madre Occidental
of Mexico smoke marijuana in this course of their sacred
ceremonies. </p>

<p>In the Ritual Use of Cannabis Sativa L by William A Emboden,
Jr., pages 229 and 231, is the following: &quot;A particularly
interesting account of a Tepehua (no relationship to
&quot;Tepecana&quot;) Indian ceremony with cannabis was published
in 1963 by the Mexican ethnologist Roberto William Garcia of the
University of Veracruz, northernmost branch of the Maya language
family. </p>

<p>&quot;In his account of Teehua religion and ritual, William
Garcia (1963:215-21) describes in some detail a communal curing
ceremony focused on a plant called santa rose, &quot;The Herb
Which Makes One Speak&quot;, which he identified botanically as
Cannabis Sativa: According to Garcia it is worshipped as an earth
deity and is thought to be alive and comparable to a piece of the
heart of God.&quot; </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA USE BY THE MOSLEMS </h2>

<p>It is interesting to note that the use of hemp was not
prohibited by Mohammed (570-632 A.D.) while the use of alcohol
was. Moslems considered hemp as a &quot;Holy Plant&quot; and
medieval Arab doctors considered hemp as a sacred medicine which
they called among other names kannab. The Sufis (a Moslem sect)
originating in 8th century Persia used hashish as a means of
stimulating mystical consciousness and appreciation of the nature
of Allah. Eating hashish to the Sufis was &quot;an act of
worship&quot;. They maintained that hashish gave them otherwise
unattainable insights into themselves, deeper understanding and
that it made them feel witty. They also claimed that it gave
happiness, reduced anxiety, reduced worry, and increased music
appreciation. </p>

<p>According to one Arab legend Haydar, the Persian founder of
the religious order of Sufi came across the cannabis plant while
wandering in the Persian mountains. Usually a reserved and silent
man, when he returned to his monastery after eating some cannabis
leaves, his disciples were amazed at how talkative and animated
(full of spirit) he seemed. After cajoling Haydar into telling
them what he had done to make him feel so happy, his disciples
went out into the mountains and tried the cannabis themselves. So
it was, according to the legend, that the Sufis came to know the
pleasures of hashish. (Taken from the Introduction to A
Comprehensive Guide to Cannabis Literature by Earnest Abel.) </p>

<h2>SUMMARY </h2>

<p>Due to the prosecution of God's church from the beginning of
the Christian era and due to the persecution against marijuana
the true understanding of the Eucharist has remained hidden from
Christendom and the world, only to be revealed in these times,
the culmination of all human history. </p>

<p>We of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church declare marijuana for
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, and for the
resurrection of mankind. The fruits of the mystery are
remembrance of the passions and death of Christ, propitiation for
sins, defense against temptation, and the indwelling of Christ in
the faithful. </p>

<p>Preparations for communion consist of confession of sins,
fasting from sin, and reconciliation with all mankind. As such
the participant in the Eucharist will be in a condition in which
prayer and meditation are easy and fruitful. He will find his
emotion purified and stimulated, his spirituality quickened and
his heart filled with love. </p>

<p>We of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church decided to publish this

magazines have all done articles, countless newspaper articles
have been written, and various brothers have been on radio and TV
talk shows around the country. </p>

<p>We of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church revere ganja
(marijuana) as our &quot;holy&quot; Eucharist and &quot;spiritual
intensifier&quot; with Biblical, historical and divine
associations for its use. </p>

<p>Ganja is the mystical body and blood of &quot;Jesus&quot; --
the burnt offering made by fire -- which allows a member to see

<h1>HEMP article, </h1>

<p><b>from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed. (1910-1911)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>HEMP (in O. Eng. _henep_, cf. Dutch _hennep_, Ger. _Hanf_,
cognate with Gr. k\'annabis [in Greek letters], Lat. cannabis),
an annual herb (_Cannabis sativa_) having angular rough stems and
alternate deeply lobed leaves. The bast fibres of _Cannabis_ are
the hemp of commerce, but, unfortunately, the products from many
totally different plants are often included under the general
name of hemp. In some cases the fibre is obtained from the stem,
while in others it comes from the leaf. Sunn hemp, Manila hemp,
Sisal hemp, and Phormium (New Zealand flax, which is neither flax
nor hemp) are treated separately. All these, however, are often
classed under the above general name, and so are the
following:---Deccan or Ambari hemp, _Hibiscus cannabinus_, an
Indian and East Indian malvaceous plant, the fibre from which is
often known as brown hemp or Bombay hemp; Pit\'e hemp, which is
obtained from the American aloe, _Agave americana_; and Moorva or
bowstring-hemp, _Sansevieria zeylanica_, which is obtained from
an aloe-like plant, and is a native of India and Ceylon. Then
there are Canada hemp, _Apocynum cannabinum_, Kentucky hemp,
_Urtica cannabina_, and others. </p>

<p>The hemp plant, like the hop, which is of the same natural
order, Cannabinaceae, is dioecious, i.e. the male and female
flowers are borne on separate plants. The female plant grows to a
greater height than the male, and its foliage is darker and more
luxuriant, but the plant takes from five to six weeks longer to
ripen. When the male plants are ripe they are pulled, put up into
bundles, and steeped in a similar manner to flax, but the female
plants are allowed to remain until the seed is perfectly ripe.
They are then pulled, and after the seed has been removed are
retted in the ordinary way. The seed is also a value product; the
finest is kept for sowing, a large quantity is sold for the food
of cage birds, while the remainder is sent to the oil mills to be
crushed. The extracted oil is used in the manufacture of soap,
while the solid remains, known as oil-cake, are valuable as a
food for cattle. The leaves of hemp have five to seven leaflets,
the form of which is lanceolate-acuminate, with a serrate margin.
The loose panicles of male flowers, and the short spikes of
female flowers, arise from the axils of the upper leaves. The
height of the plant varies greatly with season, soil and
manuring; in some districts it varies from 3 to 8 ft., but in the
Piedmont province it is not unusual to see them from 8 to 16 ft.
in height, whilst a variety (_Cannabis setiva_, variety
_gigantea_) has produced specimens over 17 ft. in height. </p>

<p>All cultivated hemp belongs to the same species, _Cannabis
sativa_; the special varieties such as _Cannabis indica_,
_Cannabis chinensis_, &amp;c., owe their differences to climate
and soil, and they lose many of their peculiarities when
cultivated in temperate regions. Rumphius (in the 17th century)
had noticed these differences between Indian and European hemp. </p>

<p>Wild hemp still grows on the banks of the lower Ural, and the
Volga, near the Caspian Sea. It extends to Persia, the Altai
range and northern and western China. The authors of the
_Pharmacographia_ say:---``It is found in Kashmir and in the
Him\'alaya, growing 10 to 12 ft. high, and thriving vigorously at
an elevation of 6000 to 10,000 ft.'' Wild hemp is, however, of
very little use as a fibre producer, although a drug is obtained
from it. </p>

<p>It would appear that the native country of the hemp plant is
in some part of temperate Asia, probably near the Caspian Sea. It
spread westward throughout Europe, and southward through the
Indian peninsula. </p>

<p>The names given to the plant and to its products in different
countries are of interest in connexion with the utilization of
the fibre and resin. In Sans. it is called _goni_, _sana_,
_shanapu_, _banga_ and _ganjika_; in Bengali, _ganga_; Pers.
_bang_ and _canna_; Arab. _kinnub_ or _cannub_; Gr. _kannabis_;
Lat. _cannabis_; Ital. _canappa_; Fr. _chanvre_; Span.
_c\'a\~namo_; Portuguese, _c\'anamo_; Russ. _kon\'opel_; Lettish
and Lithuanian, _kannapes_; Slav. _konopi_; Erse, _canaib_ and
_canab_, A. Sax. _hoenep_; Dutch, _hennep_; Ger. _Hanf_; Eng.
_hemp_; Danish and Norwegian, _hamp_; Icelandic, _hampr_; and in
Swed. _hampa_. The English word _canvas_ sufficiently reveals its
derivation from _cannabis_. </p>

<p>Very little hemp is now grown in the British Isles, although
this variety was considered to be of very good quality, and to
possess great strength. The chief continental hemp-producing
countries are Italy, Russia and France; it is also grown in
several parts of Canada and the United States and India. The
Central Provinces, Bengal and Bombay are the chief centres of
hemp cultivation in India, where the plant is of most use for
narcotics. The satisfactory growth of hemp demands a light rich
and fertile soil, but, unlike most substances, it may be reared
for a few years in succession. The time of sowing, the quantity
of seed per acre (about three bushels) and the method of
gathering and retting are very similar to those of flax; but, as
a rule, it is a hardier plant than flax, does not possess the
same pliability, is much coarser and more brittle, and does not
require the same amount of attention during the first few weeks
of its growth. </p>

<p>The very finest hemp, that grown in the province of Piedmont,
Italy, is, however, very similar to flax, and in many cases the
two fibres are mixed in the same material. The hemp fibre has
always been valuable for the rope industry, and it was at one
time very extensively used in the production of yarns for the
manufacture of sail cloth, sheeting, covers, bagging, sacking,
&amp;c. Much of the finer quality is still made into cloth, but
almost all the coarser quality finds its way into ropes and
similar material. </p>

<p>A large quantity of hemp cloth is still made for the British
navy. The cloth, when finished, is cut up into lengths, made into
bags and tarred. They are then used as coal sacks. There is also
a quantity made into sacks which are intended to hold very heavy
material. Hemp yarns are also used in certain classes of carpets,
for special bags for use in cop dyeing and for similar special
purposes, but for the ordinary bagging and sacking the employment
of hemp yarns has been almost entirely supplanted by yarns made
from the jute fibre. </p>

<p>Hemp is grown for three products---(1) the fibre of its stem;
(2) the resinous secretion which is developed in hot countries
upon its leaves and flowering heads; (3) its oily seeds. </p>

<p>Hemp has been employed for its fibre from ancient times.
Herodotus (iv. 74) mentions the wild and cultivated hemp of
Scythia, and describes the hempen garments made by the Thracians
as equal to linen in fineness. Hesychius says the Thracian women
made sheets of hemp. Moschion (about 200 B.C.) records the use of
hempen ropes for rigging the ship ``Syracusia'' built for Hiero
II. The hemp plant has been cultivated in northern India from a
considerable antiquity, not only as a drug but for its fibre. The
Anglo-Saxons were well acquainted with the mode of preparing
hemp. Hempen cloth became common in central and southern Europe
in the 13th century. </p>

<p>_Hemp-resin._---Hemp as a drug or intoxicant [sic---the word
&quot;intoxicant&quot; implies &quot;something which
poisons&quot;, while it is well known that hemp is not poisonous
in any way] for smoking and chewing occurs in the three forms of
bhang, ganja, and charas. 1. _Bhang_, the Hindustani _siddhi_ or
_sabzi_, consists of the dried leaves and small stalks of the
hemp; a few fruits occur in it. It is of a dark brownish-green
colour, and has a faint peculiar odour and but a slight taste. It
is smoked with or without tobacco; or it is made into a sweetmeat
with honey, sugar and aromatic spices; or it is powdered and
infused in cold water, yielding a turbid drink, _subdschi_.
_Hashish_ is one of the Arabic names given to the Syrian and
Turkish preparations of the resinous hemp leaves. One of the
commonest of these preparations is made by heating the bhang with
water and butter, the butter becoming thus charged with the
resinous and active substances of the plant. </p>

<p>2. _Ganja_, the guaza [???] of the London brokers, consists of
the flowering and fruiting heads of the female plant. It is
brownish-green, and otherwise resembles bhang, as in odour and
taste. Some of the more esteemed kinds of hashish are prepared
from this ganja. Ganja is met with in the Indian bazaars in dense
bundles of 24 plants or heads apiece. The hashish in such
extensive use in Central Asia is often seen in the bazaars of
large cities in the form of cakes, 1 to 3 in. thick, 5 to 10 in.
broad and 10 to 15 in. long. </p>

<p>3. _Charas_, or churrus, is the resin itself collected, as it
exudes naturally from the plant, in different ways. The best sort
is gathered by the hand like opium; sometimes the resinous
exudation of the plant is made to stick first of all to cloths,
or to the leather garments of men, or even to their skin, and is
then removed by scraping, and afterwards consolidated by
kneading, pressing and rolling. It contains about one-third or
one-fourth its weight of the resin. But the churrus prepared by
different methods and in different countries differs greatly in
appearance and purity. Sometimes it takes the form of egg-like
masses of greyish-brown colour, having when of high quality a
shining resinous fracture. Often it occurs in the form of
irregular friable lumps, like pieces of impure linseed oil-cake.
The medicinal and intoxicating [sic] properties of hemp have
probably been known in Oriental countries from a very early
period. An ancient Chinese herbal, part of which was written
about the 5th century B.C., while the remainder is of still
earlier date, notices the seed and flower-bearing kinds of hemp. </p>

<p>Other early writers refer to hemp as a remedy. The medicinal
and dietetic use of hemp spread through India, Persia and Arabia
in the early middle ages. The use of hemp (bhang) in India was
noticed by Garcia d'Orat in 1563. Berlu in his _Treasury of
Drugs_ (1690) describes it as of ``an infatuating quality and
pernicious use.'' Attention was recalled to this drug, in
consequence of Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, by de Sacy (1809)
and Rouger (1810). Its modern medicinal use is chiefly due to
trials by Dr O'Shaughnessy in Calcutta (1838--1842). The plant is
grown partly and often mainly for the sake of its resin in
Persia, northern India and Arabia, in many parts of Africa and in
Brazil. </p>

<p>_Pharmacology and Therapeutics._---The composition of this
drug is still extremely obscure; partly, perhaps, because it
varies so much in individual specimens. It appears to contain at
least two alkaloids---cannabinine and tetano-cannabine---of which
the former is volatile. The chief active principle may possibly
be neither of these, but the substance cannabinon [since then the
active substance has been discovered to be delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol, although marijuana's effects may be further
helped by these other substances]. There are also resins, a
volatile oil and several other constituents. Cannabis indica---as
the drug is termed in the pharmacopoeias---may be given as an
extract (dose 1/4--1 gr.) or tincture (dose 5-15 minims). </p>

<p>The drug has no external action. The effects of its
absorption, whether it be swallowed or smoked, vary within wide
limits in different individuals and races. So great is this
variation as to be inexplicable except on the view that the
nature and proportions of the active principles vary greatly in
different specimens. But typically the drug is an intoxicant,
resembling alcohol in many features of its action, but differing
in others </p>

<p>The early symptoms are highly pleasurable, and it is for
these, as in the case of other stimulants, that the drug is so
largely consumed in the East. There is a subjective sensation of
mental brilliance, but, as in other cases, this is not borne out
by the objective results. It has been suggested that the
incoordination of nervous action under the influence of Indian
hemp may be due to independent and non-concerted action of the
part of the two halves of the cerebrum. Following on a decided
lowering of the pain and touch senses, there comes a sleep which
is often accompanied by pleasant dreams. There appears to be no
evidence in the case of either the lower animals or the human
subject that the drug is an aphrodisiac. Excessive indulgence in
cannabis indica is very rare, but may lead to general ill-health
and occasionally to insanity . The apparent impossibility of
obtaining pure and trustworthy samples of the drug has led to its
entire abandonment in therapeutics. When a good sample is
obtained it is a safe and efficient hypnotic, at any rate in the
case of a European . The tincture should not be prescribed unless
precautions are taken to avoid the precipitation of the resin
which follows its dilution with water. </p>

<p>HEMP, a tough fibre yielded by the large annual plant
_Cannabis sativa_, of the natural order Cannabinaceae. There are,
however, several other fibres known in commerce to which the term
is more or less commonly applied. for example - Jute hemp is
obtained from _Corchorus capsularis_ and _C. olitorius; Manilla
hemp from _Musa textilis_; Brown hemp from _Hibiscus canabinus;
Pite or Pita hemp from several species of agave and aloe; Sunn
hemp, Madras hemp, brown Bombay hemp and Malabar hemp, from
_Crotalaria juncea_; Jubbulpore hemp, from _Crotalaria
tenuifolia_, and several others. </p>

<p>The true hemp (_Cannabis sativa_) has been recognised as a
useful plant from a very early period, although probably not of
the same antiquity as flax. Herodotus is the first writer who
mentions it (iv. 74), but he speaks of it in a manner which shows
it must have been then well-known, for he describes the hempen
garments made by the Thracians as being equal to linen (flax
cloth) in fineness. Its use for making cordage is noted as early
as 200 years B.C. by Moschion, who mentions that a large ship,
the &quot;syracusia,&quot; built by Hiero II, was rigged with
ropes made from hemp brought from the Rhone. The original country
of the hemp-plant is not positively known, but it is generally
believed to have been the mountainous districts in the extreme
north of India, whence it spread westward through Europe, and
southward through the peninsula of India. Its cultivation in each
direction had in all probability a different object; for it is
found to produce under tropical culture an inferior fibre, and a
powerfully intoxicating drug, but in cold and temperate climates
it yields an abundance of strong fibres in great perfection for
textile purposes, and loses its narcotic qualities. The
similarity of its name in various languages is a strong
indication that it has taken the course here indicated; thus, in
the Sanscrit it is called goni_, _sana_, or _shanapu_; Persic,
_canna_; Arabic, _kanneh_ or _kinnub; Greek, kannabis_; Latin,
_cannabis_; Italian, _canapa_; French, _chanvre_ or _chanbre_;
Danish, _kamp_ or _kennep_; Lettish and Lithuanian, _kannapes_;
Slavonic, _konopi_; Erse, _canaib_; Scaninavian, _hampr_;
Swedish, _hampa_; German, _hauf_; Anglo-Saxon, _haenep_; and
English, _hemp_. In India other names are applied, indicative of
its intoxicating or narcotic powers; thus, according to Dr Royle,
it is called the &quot;increaser of pleasure,&quot; the
&quot;exciter of desire,&quot; the &quot;cementer of
friendship,&quot; the &quot;causer of the reeling gait,&quot; the
&quot;laughter mover,&quot; &amp;c.; and he also suggests that it
may have been the _nepenthes_ (&quot;assuager of grief&quot;) of
Homer, given by Helen to Telemachus. </p>

<p>The intoxicating properties of hemp reside in a peculiar
resinous extract naturally secreted by the plant when growing in
a hot climate. So remarkable is this peculiarity, that botanists
until lately insisted upon the hemp of India being a distinct
species (_C. indica_). It is now, however, decided that there is
really no specific difference, the change being simply climatal.
The secretion is deposited by exudation upon the surface of the
leaves, the slender branches, and the flowers. According to Dr
O'Shaughnessy, it is collected during the hot season by men clad
in leathern dresses, who rush with violence through the hemp
fields; the resin adheres to their dresses, from which it is
scraped off and kneaded into lumps which have the appearance of
pieces of linseed oil cake in colour and texture, and a peculiar
and by no means agreeable smell. In this state it is called
&quot;churrus;&quot; and there are evidently several varieties of
the substance, as Dr Pereira describes it as being &quot;in
masses of the shape and size of a hen's egg, or of a small lemon,
and formed by the adhesion of superimposed elongated pieces. It
has dull grayish-brown colour, and not much odour;&quot; whereas
one specimen in the writer's collection differs in being in large
shapeless fragments of the colour of amber, with the loose
friable texture of linseed cake, and a heavy unpleasant odour.
Another specimen has a resinous lustre, a dark brown colour, and
is formed into an elongated oval shape, but not larger than half
a hen's egg. </p>

<p>This is almost odourless, and is probably the _momeea_ or
_waxen churrus_, said to be collected with great care by the
hand, and to be highly prized. The dried plant after it has
flowered, and from which the churrus has not been removed, is
compressed into bundles of twenty-four plants each, and is sold
in the bazaars of India under the name of gunjah. The larger
leaves and capsules, without the stalks, are also compressed into
irregular sized masses, which receive the names of bang, subjee,
or sidhee, in India. The hashish of the Arabians consists of the
tops of the small branchlets after inflorescence, carefully
gathered and dried. Both this and the two previously mentioned
preparations are extensively used for smoking and chewing - the
gunjah and bang in India and Persis, and the hashish in Africa.
When the bushmen of Southern Africa were brought to England, they
passed much of their time in smoking this narcotic in pipes made
of the long teeth of alligators, hollowed out for the purpose.
Its use as a means of intoxication is said to have given rise to
our word assassin, from the fact that the low Saracen soldiery,
called _hashashins_, when intoxicated with hashish, were sent
into the camps of the crusaders for the purpose of killing
whomsoever they met, the drug rendering them quite regardless of
the consequences. The physiological effects of the various
preparations above mentioned are most remarkable, and are unlike
every other narcotic at present known. It produces inebriation
and delirium of decidedly hilarious character, inducing violent
laughter, jumping and dancing. The writer several times witnessed
its effects upon the bushmen. After inhaling the smoke for some
time they rose and began a very slow dance, which was gradually
quickened until they became perfectly frenzied, and finally fell
down in a state of complete insensiblity, from which they were a
considerable time in recovering. Dr O'Shaughnessy relates some
most remarkable effects of the churrus, particularly its power in
producing a state of true catalepsy. The same effects do not
appear to take place upon Europeans, but this point has not yet
been fairly tried, as the drug evidently suffers some change in
its transmission by sea. </p>

<p>But it is not as a narcotic and excitant that the hemp plant
is most useful to mankind; it is as an advancer rather than a
retarder of civilization, that its utility is made most manifest.
Its great value as a textile material, particularly for cordage
and canvas, has made it eminently useful; and if we were to copy
the figurative style of the Sanscrit writers, we might with
justice call it the &quot;accelerator of commerce,&quot; and the
&quot;spreader of wealth and intellect.&quot; for ages man has
been dependent upon hempen cordage and hempen sails for enabling
his ships to cross the seas; and in this respect it still
occupies a most important place in our commercial affairs. </p>

<p>For its valuable fibre hemp is very largely cultivated in
Europe, but chiefly in Russia and Russian Poland. It undergoes
the same process for decomposing the parts of the stem as that
described in the article on FLAX, called _water-retting_, by
which the cellular tissue of the bark and medulla is destroyed,
and the long fibres of the woody part are set free. This is not
done by simply soaking in the waters of ponds and streams, for it
requires to be dried both previously and subsequently to the
retting process; after which it is beaten with wooden beetles or
mallets, or by an apparatus called a _break_ or _brake_ worked by
a treddle. Sometimes, however, this laborious operation is
effected by water or steam-power. Some of the finer kinds of hemp
are more carefully prepared; the seed is sown broad-cast instead
of in drills, by which the stems are grown more slender and the
fibres finer; and after the water-retting each stem is taken in
the hand, and the epidermis is stripped or _peeled_ off, and the
reed or boon is then submitted as before mentioned to the
_breaking_ process. In both cases after _breaking_ the stalks are
conveyed to the _scutching-mills_, where the separation of the
fibres is still further effected by rubbing and striking, after
which it is heckled or hackled - the heckler taking as much as he
can conveniently hold and drawing it through a number of iron
spikes fixed in a board forming a kind of comb. </p>

<p>The process called dew-retting, described in the article on
FLAX, is also adopted for very fine varieties of hemp, such as
the white crown Marienburg, and the Italian garden hemp; and in
Russia and Sweden another method called snow-retting is used.
After the first fall of snow the hemp which has been put up in
stacks is spread out over the snow, and left to be buried by
successive falls. It thus remains covered until the snow
disappears, and is then sufficiently retted. </p>

<p>We have hitherto received the largest quantity of hemp from
Russia - St Petersburg, Memel, and Riga being the chief ports of
shipment; but the late war, which put a stop to the supply from
this source, is likely to produce a beneficial result to our
colonies. The indefatigable exertions of Dr Royle on behalf of
the Indian government have led to the knowledge of various
fibrous substances which are produced in the greatest abundance
in our Indian empire, in the manufacture of cordage and canvas;
so that having been forced into a knowledge of our own resources,
it is not probable we shall ever be so dependent upon Russia in
future for this necessary article. </p>

<p>The best substitute appears to be the Caloee or Rheea fibre
produced by a plant of the nettle tribe (Urticaccae), _Boehmeria
nivea_. The Rheea fibre can, it is expected, be produced very
much cheaper than Russian hemp, and it is nearly twice as strong.
Hitherto hemp has had one great advantage over all other fibres
in the manufacture of cordage, and it remains to be seen whether
the Rheea fibre has this qualification. When a hempen rope is
worn out, if it has not been tarred, it is valuable for making
paper; and if it has been tarred, it is even more useful for
oakum. This is not the case certainly with the fine ropes of
Manilla hemp (_Musa textilis_), which, though stronger than the
best Russian hemp, are almost useless when worn out. The same may
be said of the admirable coir ropes now so extensively used for
ship's hawsers and other corage exposed to water. These ropes are
made of the fibres from the husk of the common cocoa-nut. </p>

<p>The fibre called New Zealand flax, which is procured from the
long sword-shaped leaves of _Phormium tenax_, a liliaceous plant,
has been much recommended of late; but whether from the
difficulty of preparing it, or from the inadequacy of the supply,
it has not yet become a regular article of commerce. The
epidermis of its leaves is more compact and harder than that of
the stalks of the plants previously mentioned, and this may cause
great difficulty both in retting and scutching. We import hemp
from Russia, Italy, Holland, Turkey, the East Indies, and
latterly from the United States. That from America, however, is
of inferior quality and blackish colour. The East Indian hemp is
coarse, and is in small hanks plaited about the thickness of a
man's arm. The Italian hemp is very fine, that variety called
garden-hemp being the longest of any kind; its superiority is
supposed to be the result of spade culture in very suitable soil.
It is also as white and soft as the finest white Russian. </p>

<p>Of the Russian kinds the St Petersburg clean and the Riga rein
(or clean) are the best for general purposes. The variety called
white crown Marienburg is remarkably short, white and soft; it is
only fit for fine canvas. </p>

<p>The quantity of hemp imported into the United Kingdom was- </p>

<p>From Russia | From other countries. </p>

<p>In 1851.........33,229 tons | In 1851..........31,441 tons </p>

<p>.. 1852.........26,857 .... | .. 1852..........26,551 .... </p>

<p>.. 1853.........40,320 .... | .. 1853..........20,619 .... </p>

<p>.. 1854......... 1,044 .... | .. 1854..........35,927 .... </p>

<p>.. 1855......... nil. .... | .. 1855..........28,010 .... </p>

<p>The price of Russian hemp has ranged from L38 to L90 (L=pound)
per ton during the last five years, the maximum price being
caused by the war. Considerable quantities are also raised in
England and Ireland. </p>

<p>Of the figures just given those relating to Russia may be
depended upon, but those referring to the imports from other
countries are by no means satisfactory; for owing to the slovenly
manner in which our commercial statistics are collected by the
government, all articles which bear the trade name of hemp are
included, such as Manilla hemp, and very often even jute. </p>

<p>There is one other useful quality in the hemp plant; it
produces an abundance of seed, which not only yields a valuable
oil, but the seed is extensively used in feeding singing birds.
As the hemp is _diaecious_, only about one half the plants
produce seeds; but these yield it in such abundance that an acre
will yield from three to four quarters at about 40s. per quarter.
As this is independent of the fibre produced it is a profitable
crop in countries like Russia where the land is not too valuable.

Antiquorum_, by James Yates, Esq., M.A. (T.C.A.) </p>

<h1>THE ASSASSINS </h1>

<p><b>by Philip K. Hitti</b> </p>

<p><b>From _The Book of Grass: An Anthology on Indian Hemp_,
edited by George Andrews and Simon Vinkenoog.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The Assassin movement, called the &quot;new propaganda&quot;
by its members, was inaugurated by al-Hasan ibn-al-Sabbah (died
in 1124), probably a Persian from Tus, who claimed descent from
the Himyarite kings of South Arabia. The motives were evidently
personal ambition and desire for vengeance on the part of the
heresiarch. As a young man in al-Rayy, al-Hassan received
instruction in the Batinite system, and after spending a year and
a half in Egypt returned to his native land as a Fatimid
missionary. Here in 1090 he gained possession of the strong
mountain fortress Alamut, north-west of Qazwin. Strategically
situated on an extension of the Alburz chain, 10200 feet above
sea level, and on the difficult by shortest road between the
shores of the Caspian and the Persian highlands, this
&quot;eagle's nest,&quot; as the name probably means, gave
ibn-al-Sabbah and his successors a central stronghold of primary
importance. Its possession was the first historical fact in the
life of the new order. </p>

<p>From Alamut the grand master with his disciples made surprise
raids in various directions which netted other fortresses. In
pursuit of their ends they made free and treacherous use of th
dagger, reducing assassination to an art. Their secret
organization, based on Ismailite antecedents, developed an
agnosticism which aimed to emancipate the initiate from the
trammels of doctrine, enlightened him as to the superfluity of
prophets and encouraged him to believe nothing and dare all.
Below the grand master stood the grand priors, each in charge of
a particular district. After these came the ordinary
propagandists. The lowest degree of the order comprised the
&quot;fida'is&quot;, who stood ready to execute whatever orders
the grand master issued. A graphic, though late and secondhad,
description of the method by which the master of Alamut is said
to have hypnotized his &quot;self-sacrificing ones&quot; with the
use of hashish has come down to us from Marco Polo, who passed in
that neighborhood in 1271 or 1272. After describing in glowing
terms the magnificent garden surrounding the elegant pavilions
and palaces built by the grand master at Alamut, Polo proceeds: </p>

<p>&quot;Now no man was allowed to enter the Garden save those
whom he intended to be his ASHISHIN. There was a fortress at the
entrance to the Garden, strong enough to resist all the world,
and there was no other way to get in. He kept at his Court a
number of the youths of the country, from twelve to twenty years
of age, such as had a taste for soldiering... Then he would
introduce them into his Garden, some four, or six, or ten at a
time, having first made them drink a certain potion which cast
them into a deep sleep, and then causing them to be lifted and
carried in. So when they awoke they found themselves in the
Garden. </p>

<p>&quot;When therefore they awoke, and found themselves in a
place so charming, they deemed that it was Paradise in very
truth. And the ladies and damsels dallied with them to their
hearts' content... </p>

<p>&quot;So when the Old Man would have any prince slain, he
would say to such a youth: 'Go thou and slay So and So; and when
thou returnest my Angels shall bear thee into Paradise. And
shouldst thou die, natheless even so will I send my Angels to
carry thee back into Paradise.'&quot; </p>

<p>(from 'The Book of Ser Marco Polo, the Venetian', translated
by Henry Yule, London, 1875.) </p>

<p>The Assassination in 1092 of the illustrious vizir of the
Saljug sultanate, Nizam-al-Mulk, by a fida'i disguised as a Sufi,
was the first of a series of mysterious murders which plunged the
Muslim world into terror. When in the same year the Saljug Sultan
Malikshah bestirred himself and sent a disciplinary force against
the fortress, its garrison made a night sortie and repelled the
besieging army. Other attempts by caliphs and sultans proved
equally futile until finally the Mongolian Hulagu, who destroyed
the caliphate, seized the fortress in 1256 together with its
subsidary castles in Persia. Since the Assassin books andrecords
were destroyed, our information about this strange and
spectacular order is derived mainly from hostile sources. </p>

<p>As early as the last years of the eleventh century the
Assassins had succeeded in setting firm foot in Syria and winning
as convert the Saljug prince of Aleppo, Ridwan ibn-Tutush (died
in 1113). By 1140 they had captured the hill fortress of Masyad
and many others in northern Syria, including al-Kahf, al-Qadmus
and al-'Ullayqah. Even Shayzar (modern Sayjar) on the Orontes was
temporarily occupied by the Assassins, whom Usamah calls
Isma'ilites. One of their most famous masters in Syria was
Rachid-al-Din Sinan (died in 1192), who resided at Masyad and
bore the title shakkh al-jabal', translated by the Crusades'
chroniclers as &quot;the old man of the mountain&quot;. It was
Rashid's henchmen who struck awe and terror into the hearts of
the Crusaders. After the capture of Masyad in 1260 by the
Mongols, the Mamluk Sultan Baybars in 1272 dealt the Syrian
Assassins the final blow. Since then the Assassins have been
sparsely scattered through northern Syria, Persia, 'Uman,
Zanzibar, and especially India, where they number about 150000
and go by the name of Thojas or Mowlas. They all acknowledge as
titular head the Aga Khan of Bombay, who claims descent through
the last grand master of Alamut from Isma'il, the seventh imam,
receives over a tenth of the revenues of his followers, even in
Syria, and spends most of his time as a sportsman between Paris
and London. </p>

<h1>THE TALE OF TWO HASHISH-EATERS (Traditional) </h1>

<p><b>From 1001 Arabian Nights</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>There was once, my lord and crown upon my head, a man in a
certain city, who was a fisherman by trade and a hashish-eater by
occupation. When he had earned his daily wage, he would spend a
little of it on food and the rest on a sufficiency of that
hilarious herb. He took his hashish three times a day: once in
the morning on an empty stomach, once at noon, and once at
sundown. Thus he was never lacking in extravagent gaity. Yet he
worked hard enough at his fishing, though sometimes in a very
extravagent fashion. </p>

<p>On a certain evening, for instance, when he had taken a larger
dose of his favorite drug than usual, he lit a tallow candle and
sat in front of it, asking himself eager questions and answering
with obliging wit. After some hours of this delight, he became
aware of the cool silence of the night about him and the clear
light of a full moon abouve his head, and exclaimed affably to
himself: &quot;Dear friend, the silent streets and the cool of
the moon invite us to a walk. Let us go forth, while all the
world is in bed and none may mar our solitary exaltation.&quot;
Speaking in this way to himself, the fisherman left his house and
began to walk towards the river; but, as he went, he saw the
light of the full moon lying in the roadway and took it to be the
water of the river. &quot;My dear old friend the fisherman,&quot;
he said, &quot;get your line and take the best of the fishing,
while your rivals are indoors.&quot; So he ran back and fetched
his hook and line, and cast into the glittering patch of
moonlight on the road. </p>

<p>Soon an enormous dog, tempted by the smell of the bait,
swallowed the hook greedily and then, feeling the barb, made
desperate efforts to get loose. The fisherman struggled for some
time against this enormous fish, but at last he was pulled over
and rolled into the moonlight. Even then he would not let go his
line, but held on grimly, uttering frightened cries. &quot;Help,
help, good Mussulmans!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Help me to secure
this mighty fish, for he is dragging me into the deeps! Help,
help, good friends, for I am drowning!&quot; The guards of that
quarter ran up at the noise and began laughing at the fisherman's
antics; but when he yelled: &quot;Allah curse you, O sons of
bitches! Is it a time to laugh when I am drowning?&quot; they
grew angry and, after giving him a sound beating, dragged him
into the presence of the kadi. </p>

<p>At this point Shahrazad saw the approach of morning and
discreetly fell silent. </p>

<p>BUT WHEN THE SEVEN-HUNDRED-AND-NINETY-EIGHTH NIGHT HAD COME
SHE said: </p>

<p>Allah had willed that the kadi should also be addicted to the
use of hashish; recognizing that the prisoner was under that
jocund influence, he rated the guards soundly and dismissed them.
Then he handed over the fisherman to his slaves that they might
give him a bed for calm sleep. After a pleasant night and a day
given up to the consumption of excellent food, the fisherman was
called to the kadi in the evening and received by him like a
brother. His host supped with him; and then the two sat opposite
the lighted candles and each swallowed enough hashish to destroy
a hundred-year-old elephant. When the drug exalted their natural
dispositions, they undressed completely and began to dance about,
singing and committing a thousand extravagances. </p>

<p>Now it happened that the Sultan and his wazir were walking
through the city, disguised as merchants, and heard a strange
noise rising from the kadi's house. They entered through the
unlatched door and found two naked men, who stopped dancing at
their entrance and welcomed them without the least embarrassment.
The Sultan sat down to watch his venerable kadi dance again; but
when he saw that the other man had a dark and lively zabb, so
long that the eye might not carry to the end of it, he whispered
in his wazir's startled ear: &quot;As Allah lives, our kadi is
not as well hung as his guest!&quot; &quot;What are you
whispering about?&quot; cried the fisherman. &quot;I am the
Sultan of this city and I order you to watch my dance
respectfully, otherwise I will have your head cut off. I am the
Sultan, this is my wazir; I hold the whole world like a fish in
the palm of my right hand.&quot; The Sultan and his wazir
realized that they were in the presence of two hashish-eaters,
and the wazir, to amuse his master, addressed the fisherman,
saying: &quot;How long have you been Sultan, dear master, and can
you tell me what has happened to your predecessor?&quot; &quot;I
deposed the fellow,&quot; answered the fisherman. &quot;I said:
'Go Away!' and he went away.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Did he not protest?&quot; asked the wazir. </p>

<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied the fisherman. &quot;He was
delighted to be relased from the burden of kingship. He abdicated
with such good grace that I keep him by me as a servant. He is an
excellent dancer. When he pines for his throne, I tell him
stories. Now I want to piss.&quot; So saying, he lifted up his
interminable tool and, walking over to the Sultan, seemed to be
about to discharge upon him. </p>

<p>&quot;I also want to piss,&quot; exclaimed the kadi, and took
up the same threatening position in front of the wazir. The two
victims shouted with laughter and fled from that house, crying
over their shoulders: &quot;God's curse on all
hashish-eaters!&quot; </p>

<p>Next morning, that the jest might be complete, the Sultan
called the kadi and his guest before him. &quot;O discreet pillar
of our law,&quot; he said, &quot;I have called you to me because
I wish to learn the most convenient manner of pissing. Should one
squat and carefully lift the robe, as religion prescribes? Should
one stand up, as is the unclean habit of unbelievers? Or should
one undress completely and piss against one's friends, as is the
custom of two hashish-eaters of my acquaintance?&quot; </p>

<p>Knowing that the Sultan used to walk about the city in
disguise, the kadi realized in a flash the identity of his last
night's visitors, and fell on his knees, crying: &quot;My lord,
my lord, the hashish spake in these indelicacies, not I!&quot; </p>

<p>But the fisherman, who by his careful daily taking of the drug
was always under its effect, called somewhat sharply: &quot;And
what of it? You are in your palace this morning, we were in our
palace last night.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;O sweetest noise in all our kingdom,&quot; answered the
delighted King, &quot;as we are both Sultans of this city, I
think you had better henceforth stay with me in my palace. If you
can tell stories, I trust that you will at once sweeten our
hearing with a chosen one.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I will do so gladly, as soon as you have pardoned my
wazir,&quot; replied the fisherman; so the Sultan bade the kadi
rise and sent him back forgiven to his duties. </p>

<h1>A SHORT HEMP HISTORY, </h1>

<p><b>The Story you were never told in school</b> </p>

<p><b>By John Birrenbach, Founder</b> </p>

<p><b>The Institute for Hemp</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The World History of Commercial Cannabis Hemp or Marijuana
Cannabis Hemp has a history that goes back to pre-historic time. </p>

<p>Cannabis Hemp has been found in Tombs dating back to 8,000 B.
C. </p>

<p>Hemp Travels The World: </p>

<p>1. 8500BC China 2. 1000BC India </p>

<p>3. 500BC Africa - Asia 4. 500AD Europe </p>

<p>5. 1495 N America 6. 1545 S America </p>

<p>7. 1992 Australia 8. 1993 England </p>

<p>Cannabis use can be documented as far back as 2700 BC (1) in
ancient Chinese writings. These writings tell us that cannabis
was used by the Chinese for a variety of uses. These included
fiber, oil, and as a medicine. By 450 BC history tells us that
hemp was being cultivated in the Mid-East region. From
Afghanistan to Egypt hemp was cultivated for its fiber and drugs.
It appears that hemp was first introduced into Europe around
500-1000 AD. It is known that hemp was in wide cultivation in
Europe by the Sixteenth century. It was cultivated for its fiber
and its seed. The seed was cooked with barley and other grains
and eaten. In 1537 Dioscorides called the plant Cannabis Sativa,
the scientific name that stands today as its true name. He noted
its use in &quot;the stoutest cords&quot; and also its medicinal
properties (2). </p>

<p>Hemp was introduced into Chile about 1545 (3) where it was
grown for fiber. Hemp was introduced in New England soon after
Puritan Immigrants settled, noting that it grew &quot;twice so </p>

<p>high&quot;(4). In Virginia the early legislature passed many
acts to promote the hemp industry. Before the revolution hemp
seems to have flourished in the area around Lancaster PA. Hemp
was first grown in Kentucky in 1775 (5). In 1802 two extensive
Ropewalks were built in Lexington Kentucky. There was also
announced a machine that could break &quot;eight thousand weight
of hemp per day&quot;(6), a huge quantity for the time. Hemp
spread to other states including Missouri by 1835, </p>

<p>Champaign IL by 1875, Nebraska by 1887, California by 1912
(7), Minnesota by 1880 (8), Wisconsin and Iowa by the early
1920Us. The cultivation of hemp was stalled by federal action in
1937 by the imposition of a heavy tax on producers known as the
Marijuana Tax Act. By 1940 the US government reduced the tax so
production could take place during WW II. After WW II, with the
heavy tax, cultivation declined until 1968 when the last legal
crop was grown in Minnesota (9). </p>

    <dd><font size="2"><b>Synonyms</b> - Cannabis Indica; Indian
        Hemp; Ganjah; Guaza.<br>
        </font>Cannabis consists of the dried flowering and
        fruiting tops of the pistillate plant of <i>Cannabis
        sativa</i> Linn. (Fam. Cannabinaceæ), an annual
        dioecious herb indigenous to Central Asia and the
        Northern and Western Himalayas, and cultivated mainly in
        tropical districts of India, Africa, and North America.<br>
        Cannabis occurs in flattened, dull green masses which
        remain more or less compacted together by the adhesive
        resinous secretion. The tops vary in length from about 3
        to 30 centimetres, the smaller tops being preferred; they
        consist of the upper part of the stem with ascending
        branches, which are longitudinally furrowed and bear
        numerous covering and glandular trichomes. The leaves are
        alternate and consist of simple or palmately compound
        bracts, each having two linear stipules and bearing in
        its axil two bracteoles, each of which subtends a single
        pistillate flower or a more or less developed fruit
        occasionally containing an oily seed. The taste is very
        slight and the odour somewhat heavy and narcotic. <br>
        The diagnostic <b>microscopical</b> characters are the
        conical, curved, unicellular cystolith-trichomes with
        enlarged bases; the similar but more slender trichomes
        without cystoliths; the numerous, usually 8-celled,
        rosette-shaped, glandular trichomes with either
        unicellular or multiseriate pedicels; the bracteoles with
        very numerous small cluster-crystals of calcium oxalate;
        the red stigmas with long cylindrical papillæ
        laticiferous tubes with brown contents; occasional, more
        or less lignified, phloem fibres from the stem, and
        brown, thick-walled, pitted cells from the palisade layer
        of the pericarp.<br>
        Cannabis <b>contains</b> a soft, brown resin
        (cannabinone), the chief constituent of which is
        cannabinol, C<font size="1">21</font>H<font size="1">26</font>O<font
        size="1">2</font>, a viscid, reddish oil, possessing a
        powerful narcotic action, but resinifying and becoming
        less active on exposure to air; choline, and traces of
        volatile oil, fat, and wax are also present. Cannabis
        yields to alcohol (90 per cent) from 10 to 22 per cent of
        extractive. The ash is about 15 per cent. The following
        test has been used for the identification of cannabis:
        Shake 0.1 gramme in powder with 5 millilitres of light
        petroleum for three minutes and filter; to 1 millilitre
        of the filtrate add 2 millilitres of a 15 per cent w/v
        solution of hydrogen chloride in dehydrated alcohol; at
        the junction of the two liquids a red colouration
        appears, and, after shaking, the upper layer becomes
        colourless and the lower layer acquires an orange-pink
        colouration which disappears on the addition of one
        millilitre of water.<br>
        <font size="2"><b>Varieties</b>: Tinctures of cannabis,
        prepared from African, American, German, and Indian
        varieties of the drug, when examined by oral
        administration to cats appear to possess about the same
        degree of activity, and this activity is not destroyed by
        long storage of the drug in a dry condition.<br>
        </font><b>Standard</b>: Cannabis contains not more than
        10 per cent of fruits, large foliage leaves, and stems
        over 3 millimetres in diameter, and not more than 2 per
        cent of other foreign organic matter. Acid-insoluble ash,
        not more than 5 per cent. When a mixture of 10 grammes of
        finely powdered cannabis and 100 millilitres of alcohol
        (90 per cent) is shaken occasionally during twenty-four
        hours and then filtered, 20 millilitres of the filtrate,
        evaporated in a flat-bottomed dish, yields a residue
        weighing, when dried at 100 degrees, not less than 0.20
        gramme. Cannabis indicæ herba I.A. consists of the tops,
        in flower and in fruit, of the female plant cultivated in
        the East Indies.<br>
        Cannabis, in powder (Pulvis Cannabis : Pulv. Cannab.),
        contains the constituents and possesses the diagnostic
        microscopical characters of Cannabis, and complies with
        the limits for acid-insoluble ash and residue on
        extraction with alcohol (90 per cent) of the unground
        drug.<br>
        <b>Action and Uses</b>: Cannabis acts chiefly on the
        central nervous system. It first produces excitement with
        hallucinations, a feeling of happiness and indifference
        to surroundings, this stage being followed by deep sleep.
        The hallucinations include inability to estimate time and
        space. In the East the hemp is smoked and almost
        immediately produces symptoms of pleasurable excitement,
        followed by depression and lethargy. Cannabis is used as
        an anodyne sedative or hypnotic in mania, spasmodic
        coughs, phthisis, asthma, and dysmenorrhoea. It has been
        used in the treatment of chorea and paralysis agitans. It
        does not produce constipation or loss of appetite.
        Cannabis is usually <b>administered</b> as the extract in
        pills, or as tincture. In cases of <b>poisoning</b> the
        stomach should be evacuated and the usual methods adopted
        to prevent collapse and respiratory failure.<br>
        <b>CANNABINÆ TANNAS</b>: Cannabine tannate is a brownish
        powder which may be obtained from an aqueous extract of
        cannabis by precipitation with tannic acid. It has been
        used as a hypnotic in nervous insomnia, in dysmenorrhoea
        and in menorrhagia. Dose - 0.25 to 0.5 gramme (4 to 8
        grains).<br>
        <b>CANNABINONUM</b>: Cannabinone, the brown resin
        obtained from cannabis, has been used as a hypnotic in
        hysteria and insomnia. Dose - 0.016 to 0.06 gramme (1/4
        to 1 grain).<br>

<h1>Marijuana and the Pygmies</h1>

<p><b>Carl Sagan, </b><b><u>The Dragons of Eden, Speculations on
the Origin of Human Intelligence</u></b> </p>

<p><b>p 191 footnote (pb edition 1978, copyright 1977)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;In defense of the Pygmies, perhaps I should note that a
friend of mine who has spent time with them says that for such
activities as the patient stalking and hunting of mammals and
fish they prepare themselves through marijuana intoxication,
which helps to make the long waits, boring to anyone further
evolved than a Komodo dragon, at least moderately tolerable.
Ganja is, he says, their only cultivated crop. It would be wryly
interesting if in human history the cultivation of marijuana led
generally to the invention of agriculture, and thereby to
civilization. (The marijuana-intoxicated Pygmy, poised patiently
for an hour with his fishing spear aloft, is earnestly burlesqued
by the beer-sodden riflemen, protectively camouflaged in red
plaid, who, stumbling through the nearby woods, terrorize
American suburbs each Thanksgiving.)&quot; <br>

<h3 align="center">FIBRE PLANTS -- HEMP </h3>

<h4>We all know hemp as a roadside weed, tall, straight, with
whorls of spreading, lady-finger leaves, all pitched at a
downward slant, the flowers clustered at the bases of the leaves,
as happens with all members of the stinging nettle family, to
which hemp belongs.</h4>

<h4>Wild hemp, as it grows escaped from cultivation, and in its
native region, western Asia, has poor fibre. But in the hemp
fields of Russia, Austria, Turkey, Italy, China, Japan, and the
United States, it may reach ten, and even twenty feet in height. </h4>

<h4>The fibres of the inner bark, when properly separated, come
out creamy-white, soft, pliable, and with a silky sheen. It is
substituted for linen in all but the better grades in the north
of Italy, where methods of cultivation and curing produce the
best quality of fibre.</h4>

<h4>The great hemp region of this country is the Blue Grass
region in Kentucky, where a rich, moist, well-drained loam
overlies limestone. The seed is sowed and rolled, but not
cultivated after it comes up. The vigorous plants get the start
of the weeds and kill them out. The roots plow deep, and the
stems soar.</h4>

<h4>When the flowers appear and the tops turn yellow, then comes
the harvest. The stems are cut as low as possible, for the best
fibre is at the base. The September sun dries the stalks that lie
with butts down hill on the grass. In a week they are gathered
into small bundles, tied, shocked, or stacked. </h4>

<h4>In November the stems are spread for two months so that
moisture and frost rot the outer bark and woody center of the
stems from the fibrous layer. This &quot;retting&quot; is
sometimes done in water. </h4>

<h4>When the fibre separates easily, the stalks are set up to
dry. The old-fashioned hand-breaks are used to
&quot;decorticate&quot; the fibre, and clean it of the fragments
of bark and wood left after the breaking is done. The freed fibre
is tied in hanks, and these are baled for market. After being
hackled it goes to the twine factory. Often the hemp-grower
clears $30 to $60 an acre, after cost of growing is deducted. And
the land is left in better condition than before the hemp was
planted. </h4>

<h4>The British navy consumes a quantity of hemp fibre in the
manufacture of the bags in which coal is carried. Sail cloth,
coarse sheetings and canvas, carpet warp and rugs, fish lines and
nets, and all kinds of twines and ropes are made of hemp. Hemp
seed is not ripe when the canes are right for fibre, so special
plots are grown for seed, which is valuable as poultry food. Oil
for paint is extracted from the seed. The plants are best grown
in hills so that they have room to branch and produce the
greatest amount of seed. The seed crop often nets the farmer
almost as much as if he grew hemp fibre.</h4>

<h4>In the Far East the resinous substance in flowers and leaves
of hemp is a commercial product in great demand. In various
forms, to drink, to chew, and to smoke, the intoxicating drug is
universally used. The bhang is the dried leaves and fruits. It
may be mixed with tobacco, for smoking, or with honey and spices,
for a kind of candy, or steeped like tea. Hasheesh is the name it
is known by in Turkey and Syria. Hasheesh cakes, often huge in
size, are sold in the bazaars. The effect of hasheesh is
pleasantly stimulating at first; then follows loss of sensation,
dulling of pain, and sleep with pleasant dreams. The result of
constant use of the drug may be insanity.</h4>

<p><font size="3">The following is excerpted from _A History of
the Hemp Industry in Kentucky_ (Lexington: University of
Kentucky, 1951), pp. 4, 24-30, 132-40, 196. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">SLAVERY IN THE HEMP INDUSTRY</font></p>

<p><font size="3">James F. Hopkins</font></p>

<p><font size="3">... Without hemp, slavery might not have
flourished in Kentucky, since other agricultural products of the
state were not conducive to the extensive use of bondsmen. On the
hemp farm and in the hemp factories the need for laborers was
filled to a large extent by the use of Negro slaves, and it is a
significant fact that the heaviest concentration of slavery was
in the hemp producing area. Perhaps the nearest approach in
Kentucky to the plantation on the southern scale was the large
Bluegrass farm upon which hemp was one of the major crops and
where virtually all manual labor was performed by slaves. On the
other hand, since hemp does not require as much attention as must
be given to cotton, the number of Negroes on a Kentucky farm was
usually far less than the number necessary on a cotton plantation
of comparable size. Consequently, owing to their high birth rate,
the slaves increased faster than they were needed. Sale of
surplus blacks to the lower South brought welcome revenue to
Kentucky and led to the unwelcome charge that peopled in the
state were engaged in the breeding of Negroes for market. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Kentuckians sometimes referred to hemp as a
&quot;nigger crop,&quot; owing to a belief that no one understood
its eccentricities as well or was as expert in handling it as the
Negro. A Lexingtonian stated in 1836 that it was almost
impossible to hire workmen to break a crop of hemp because the
work was &quot;very dirty, and so laborious that scarcely any
white man will work at it,&quot; and he continued by saying that
the task was done entirely by slave labor. Among the slaves, the
men held a monopoly on all the tasks connected with the
production of fiber because, in the words of this observer,
&quot;Negro women cannot labor at hemp at all, and are scarcely
worth anything.&quot; Another commentator a few years later
concluded that &quot;none but our strong able negro men can
handle it to advantage.&quot; To a considerable extent that
belief was based on fact, for the tasks connected with hemp
culture were for the most part laborious and sometimes
unpleasant, and such work was given to the slave or, after the
Civil War, to the Negro tenant or &quot;hired hand.&quot; As long
as hemp was produced in the state, at least certain types of
work, such as breaking the stalks, were largely reserved for the
Negro. After years of repetition of these tasks, he did become
expert at their performance, though the complaint was sometimes
made that he was undependable. Among the slaves most in demand in
Kentucky were those who were able to work in manufacturing
establishments where hemp was turned into bale rope and bagging,
but the agricultural skill which most contributed to the value of
the Negro was the ability to hackle hemp fiber in preparing it
for market.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On many farms, of course, neither slaves nor,
later, freedmen were available or desired, and in such cases the
men of the family performed all tasks for themselves. If a
landowner was not willing to do this work and would not depend on
slaves, he could follow the example of Nathaniel Hart of Woodford
County, who explained his decision as follows: For several years
I turned my attention to the raising slaves were slight from 1830
to 1860. . . . </font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE FACTORIES IN OPERATION</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the 1830's new machinery was introduced in
the manufacturing of bale rope and bagging in Kentucky, though
for years afterward many establishments continued using more
primitive methods, depending on hand labor to do most of the
work. Rope-making, before the industry was mechanized, was
performed in a long, narrow building called a
&quot;ropewalk,&quot; whose dimensions varied from one
establishment to another. A description written in 1873, possibly
referring primarily to the walks found in New England, stated
that they were &quot;twelve or thirteen hundred feet in
length.&quot; John B. McIlvaine's cordage factory in Carlisle,
Kentucky, extended across &quot;the whole square on Water street,
from Main Cross to Second Cross,&quot; and Charles W. Turston's
walk in Louisville was about 26 feet wide and 570 feet long in
1837 and seems to have been extended to 770 feet by 1849.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The method of manufacturing has been described
as follows:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first part of the process of rope making by
hand, is that of spinning the yarns or threads, which is done in
a manner analogous to that of ordinary spinning. The spinner
carries a bundle of dressed hemp round his waist; the two ends of
the bundle being assembled in front. Having drawn out a proper
number of fibers with his hand, he twists them with his fingers,
and fixing this twisted part to the hook of the whirl, which is
driven by a wheel put in motion by an assistant, he walks
backwards down the rope walk, the twisted part always serving to
draw out more fibers from the bundle around his waist. . . . The
spinner takes care that these fibers are equably supplied, and
that they always enter the twisted parts by their ends, and never
by their middle. As soon as he has reached the termination of the
walk, a second spinner takes the yarn off the whirl, and gives it
to another person to put upon a reel, while he himself attaches
his own hemp to the whirl hook, and proceeds down the walk. When
a person at the reel begins to turn, the first spinner, who had
completed his yarn, holds it firmly at the end, and advances
slowly up the walk, while the reel is turning, keeping it equally
tight all the way, till he reaches the reel, where he waits till
the second spinner takes his yarn off the whirl hook, and joins
it to the end of that of the first spinner, in order that it may
follow it on the reel.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The next step in ropemaking was to
&quot;warp&quot; the yarns or to stretch all of them to the same
length and at the same time to put a &quot;slight turn or
twist&quot; in them. If the cordage was intended for marine use,
it was wound from one reel to another, meanwhile passing through
a vessel containing boiling tar. If &quot;white work&quot; was
desired, the tar was omitted. Finally, the last step, called
&quot;laying the cordage,&quot; was carried out: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">For this purpose two or more yarns are attached
at one end to a hook. The hook is then turned the contrary way
from the twist of the individual yarn, and thus forms what is
called a strand. Three strands, sometimes four, besides a central
one, are then stretched at length, and attached at one end to
three contiguous but separate hooks, but at the other end to a
single hook; and the process of combining them together, which is
effected by turning the single hook in a direction contrary to
that of the other three, consists in so regulating the progress
of the twists of the strands round their common axis, that the
three strands receive separately as their opposite ends just as
much twist as is taken out of them by their twisting the contrary
way, in the process of combination.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the first third of the nineteenth
century most of the rope made in Kentucky was spun and twisted by
hand and by the use of horse power at one end of the walk. In
1838 David Myerle, formerly of the firm of tiers and Myerle,
Philadelphia, established upon a new principle a large
steam-driven factory at Louisville. The method of manufacture had
been invented earlier by Robert Graves of Boston, from whom
Myerle had bought the patent right, and it: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">consisted, in part, in winding the threads upon
revolving spools, from which they were conducted through a
cast-iron tube of a diameter suitable for the size of rope
required. In the opinion of officers of the United States navy
and others the cordage made by the Graves machinery was stronger
than that made by the old method.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Myerle's establishment, called the Washington
Steam Patent Cordage Factory,&quot; included several buildings
and was valued by him at $28,650. The ropewalk, housed in a frame
building one story high, was 1,100 feet long and 25 feet wide.
Down the length of the walk ran tracks on which the patented
machinery operated as it spun the yearns and twisted them into
rope. Three tons of cordage per day, or at least 600 tons
annually, could be manufactured by this machinery. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">A factory for making bagging by machinery was
established in Newport in 1832. Prior to that time most of the
bagging had been made upon the old hand looms, but the new
machines turned out a product that was claimed to be superior to
that woven by manual labor. The cloth was strong, compact,
uniform in texture, and consistently weighed twenty-six ounces to
the yard. As first set up, the manufactory could process 450 tons
of hemp annually, and the owners stated their intention shortly
to add other machinery for making Kentucky jeans. The writer who
described this plant said that &quot;no doubt is entertained now
of the practical success of this mode of manufacturing bagging of
hemp, though heretofore it has been considered as a visionary
speculation.&quot; In 1835 this enterprise employed two hundred
workmen and was manufacturing wool and cotton in addition to
hemp. Its total annual output was valued at over a quarter of a
million dollars. At the same time a factory located at Covington
was producing $25,000 worth of finished hempen goods each year.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Andrew Caldwell of Lexington invented, and in
1841 began the operation of, machinery which received raw fiber,
hackled it, spun it into thread, and then wove it into bagging.
He claimed that its output was thirty yards per hour, which was
far more than any other loom of the time could produce. Caldwell
also professed to be able to manufacture bagging for three cents
a yard, or at a saving of five or six cents over the cost of
other methods of manufacturing. Most of the innovations in the
manufacturing of hemp were adopted slowly by those engaged in the
industry, probably because most of the changes did not yield the
results claimed for them. Even in 1860 only a few factories were
run by steam, most of them relied on horse power, and a few were
still operated by hand.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only a comparatively few manufacturers
specialized in either bale rope or bagging, and the majority of
them produced both in their factories. One of the larger
establishments, operated by Gratz and Bruce in Lexington,
included for the manufacture of bagging a &quot;Calender and Hemp
House, capable of storing 60 tons of Hemp;&quot; a hackling house
18 feet wide and 30 feet long; a &quot;Factory&quot; 195 feet
long, 50 feet wide, and two stories high, &quot;calculated for 12
spinners each story;&quot; and, attached to the factory, a
weaving house which contained spindles and looms. For making rope
the company had a brick hemp house 40 feet long, 50 feet wide,
and two stories high, capable of storing 200 tons of hemp, a
brick spinning house 180 feet long and 32 feet wide, and a
ropewalk &quot;extending 100 fathom,&quot; or 600 feet. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Slave labor was used to a large extent in the
manufacture of hemp, the Negroes being owned by the operator of
the business or hired by him for a period of time. In either case
the task work plan was used to promote diligence, and the slave
who applied himself could earn in the 1850's two or three dollars
per week which he was free to spend as he chose. The price paid
for the hire of such laborers varied according to the ability of
the slave. In Louisville in 1834 one Negro, George, was hired for
$30 per year, whereas Henry cost his employer $80 for the same
period of time. Two years later the extremes were George, at $40,
and Sullivan, at $180. &quot;The exceedingly low price of
twenty-five cents per day,&quot; was the figure set in 1836 by
the Nicholasville manufacturer who, wishing to retire from
business, offered to sell his factory and hire out his
&quot;thirty old hands well skilled in the manufacture of
Hemp.&quot; Wishing to protect insofar as possible the valuable
property he was hiring to another man, the owner of a slave
sometimes required a contract which obligated the employer to
treat the laborer well, clothe and feed him, &quot;pay his taxes
&amp; physician Bill Should the Same be necessary, &amp; return
the Boy as usual well clothed at the End of the time&quot; for
which he was hired. Early in the nineteenth century Thomas Bodley
and Company of Lexington wanted to hire ten Negro boys, from 12
to 15 years of age, and five men, from 17 to 25, &quot;the boys
to spin &amp; the men to weave and heckle in a Coarse Linen
Manufactory.&quot; In the same year Tom, a ropemaker by trade,
ran away from his master in Danville, and shortly afterward
Thomas H. Pindell advertised a desire to purchase or hire several
Negro boys, age 14 to 18, to work in a ropewalk. When John W.
Hunt of Lexington decided to retire from the manufacture of
bagging, he advertised an auction sale of 60 men, boys and women.

Commissioner Anslinger:
I assume the press will be after us. The Treasury Department has not 
as yet publicly announced this meeting. The Department will do this 
subsequently. I hope therefore, that none of you will be drawn into 
discussions with reporters until the meeting is concluded. The Treasury 
Department will issue a statement on the meeting.
I want all of you to freely express your opinions on every phase of 
the subject under discussion; and if you differ on any point, we hope you 
will not hesitate to present your side of the picture.
I want to give you a brief review of what took place at Geneva, 
Switzerland, last spring at a meeting of the Sub-Committee on Cannabis, of 
the Advisory Committee on traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs of 
the League of Nations. I think this a fitting way to open the Conference. It 
will illustrate the international significance of the Cannabis problem and 
show the current status of some of the excellent work that is being done 
by other nations on the question.
This work I think was very important, and I want to give you the 
reports of the experts of the various countries which will give you an idea 
as to the points on which the authorities still remain in doubt.

The Secretariat of the League referred to various points submitted 
to the Experts in a questionnaire drawn up for their use in January, l936, 
and used as a basis for the Sub-Committees work. He described the 
research work being undertaken.
The Sub-Committee endeavored to indicate on what phases of the 
Marihuana problem agreement exists, and on what points there is a 
divergence of views which has formed the subject of exchange of 
information between the Experts whether on chemical and agricultural 
questions, or on the medical and pathological questions.
Since the Advisory Committee's last session, Mr. J. V. Collins, 
Government Analyst, Ceylon, on January 12, l938, notified the Committee 
of his acceptance of the Advisory Committee's invitation to act as an 
Expert on Cannabis in place of the late Dr. Symons.
The Committee received important documents from two of its 
Experts, Dr. Bouquet and Dr. de Myttenaere.
Dr. Bouquet has for many years done a vast amount of work on 
Cannabis. He is the Inspector of Pharmacies in Tunis.

Dr. Bouquet submitted reports on the following points:

I	Vegetable products wrongly designated as hemp.
II	Microscopic examination of samples of Cannabis.
III	Physiologically active resin in the staminate Cannabis 
plant.
6

IV	 New variety of Cannabis.
V	Influence of drought on the growth of Cannabis.
VI	Medical uses of Cannabis and drugs with a Cannabis base.
VII	Use of animal charcoal. 
VIII	Dr. James C. Munch's Reaction.
IX	Is light petroleum the only solvent of the active element 
of Cannabis and its preparations? 
X	Addiction by certain solanaceae.

Then the report is supplemented by Dr. Bouquet regarding the following 
points:

I	Are the light petroleum extracts of Cannabis the only 
ones that are physiologically active?
II	Observations on document O.C.1542 (z) (Report on the 
research conducted by the Treasury Department of the United 
States of America, in cooperation with the Department of 
Agriculture, in connection with studies on the chemical 
identification of Cannabis Indica (Cannabis Sativa).
III	Identification test for Cannabis resin, proposed by Dr. de 
Myttenaere.
IV	Method of identifying resin, proposed by Dr. H. J. Wollner.
V	Procedure for experiments.
VI	Observations on the causes of Cannabis addiction in 
North Africa.
Dr. de Myttenaere submitted to the Secretariat a supplement to the 
third note on Indian hemp, and a fourth note on Indian hemp, including a 
study of the published work which has appeared since May, 1937, giving 
observations of Mr. Wollner's experiments in the United States.
Apart from these contributions from Experts of the Sub-Committee 
on Cannabis, the Secretariat received a ÒStudy of the Chemical 
Identification of Marihuana (Cannabis Indica)" by Dr. Rafael Plasencia, 
Government Chemist of Cuba, and a reply concerning the same subject 
from the United Kingdon Representative. It also received information 
regarding experiments on the chemical identification of Cannabis indica 
communicated by the United States Government. This is the report 
covering the investigation conducted by the Treasury Department in 
cooperation with the Department's Agriculture.
The United Kingdom also submitted to the Secretariat a 
communication concerning the question as to whether Cannabis stalks 
used commercially for the production of fibre still contained resin. That 
point was also discussed.
As to the American documents, we usually summarize all work that 
has been done on Cannabis, incorporate it into one document and submit it 
to the League of Nations.
As to Dr. Plasencia's experiment; he has followed up Beam's 
experiments and elaborated a new method which he

8

states is absolutely and specifically suitable for Cannabis and constant 
for all the varieties tested, even Merck's extract of Cannabis indica with 
which Beam's reaction gave no result.
Our Government has submitted observations on this paper.
The United Kingdom Representative also transmitted an opinion by 
the Government Chemist who suggests certain modifications in this 
method. These modifications consist of an attempt to separate the 
substances responsible for the characteristic color in Beam's test on the 
assumption that it is a phenol.
All of these documents are available in the United States Treasury 
Department for anyone who would like to study them.
It would seem that Dr. de Myttenaere and Mr. Wollner have different 
opinions on the point as to whether light petroleum is the best solvent for 
Cannabis. Dr. de Myttenaere considers that so far as is known at present, 
light petroleum is the best solvent for the extraction of the active 
principles of Cannabis, and hence the only one suitable for Beam's test; 
and he has carried out experiments as to whether ethyl acetate should be 
substituted, or is preferable as a solvent for petroleum ether.

9

In the report there is also given the list of vegetable products 
wrongfully designated as hemp,
We have a little trouble with that in this country, as it is frequently 
designated as Cannabis, New Zealand hemp, hemp of the Americas, Bombay 
hemp, African hemp, etc.
It has been found that these were all wrong designators used by 
various persons interested in the problem.
NOTE.--Until very recently. the definition of Cannabis sativa 
(marihuana) was based upon the traditional conception that the active 
principle of the drug, technically known as cannabinol or cannabinone, is 
present only in the female or pistillate plant and present there only in the 
flowering tops. Since the development of more refined chemical tests, it 
has been discovered that the active principle is contained in the leaves of 
the pistillate plant as well as the leaves of the staminate plant. This 
brought about the advisability of makihg the definition all inclusive in 
laws for control of the drug found in the male as well as the female plant. 
It will therefore be necessary to change the definition in the League of 
Nations Treaty of 1925.
Dr. Bouquet, while investigating this question, found that it always 
has been acknowledged that intoxicating resin could be obtained from 
male Cannabis plants but in

10

such small quantities that for practical purposes this source of 
production is not utilized at present. He realized, however, that it might 
become worthwhile for traffickers to turn their attention to it, and 
recommended that the free handling of the vegetative parts of both male 
and female Cannabis plants should be prohibited.
That work was started in America by the laboratory of Parke-Davis 
some years ago.
Then the question of the production of the fibre, the condition of 
development, depending on the meterological factors of the crop area was 
discussed. In this respect differences have been noted between the height 
of the plant, and the length, consistency and toughness of the textile 
fibres.
The growing conditions of the plant also affect the output of its 
resin, which depends directly on the degree of temperature; on the dryness 
of the soil; and probably on the amount of sunshine encountered.
In the annual report for Turkey for 1937, there is brought to the 
attention of the Committee data concerning a variety of Cannabis sativa 
having long stalks. It is grown for industrial purposes in various parts of 
Anatolia; the fibre is used for manufacturing ropes and sacks; and its 
resin content is so slight it could not be used for

11

the extraction of a narcotic drug.
That seems to be the answer to our prayers, if true. As to the 
psychical and psychopathic effects of Cannabis, the literature on this 
phase of the subject tends to confirm the analysis as to the psychic 
effects of hashish made as long ago as 1845 by Dr. Moreau de Tours in his 
book, which incidentally is still the standard work on the subject.
Also, Dr. Brottaux in his book on Hashish published in 1934, which I 
think is considered a veritable "bible" on the subject today, has followed 
up and in the main confirmed Dr. Moreau's analysis.
Then there was discussed the relation between Cannabis and 
insanity. There was reference to the work of Dhunsiboy, the Director of 
one of the Hospitals for Insane in IndiaÑin which he points out that the 
prolonged use of Indian hemp leads to insanity.
The work of Dr. Bouquet was discussed; and also the work of the 
British Indian hemp Commission which carried out an inquiry in 1893 and 
1894 into the relationship of Indian hemp and lunacy.
Colonel Chopra did some work in India which was discussed. He found that 
in India a special form of mental disease classed as toxic insanity had 
direct relation to the excessive use of hemp drugs.

12

All of these experts laid stress on "excessive use."
Then there was a proposal discussed to authorize the sale of ganja 
to the Indian population in Burma.
As you probably know, in India. the Government maintains a 
Monopoly, and various narcotic products are sold across the counter tax-
paid.
The League of Nations wanted to point out to the Committee the 
various points that were raised in connection with the proposal to sell 
hemp.
To meet the allegation concerning the increase in insanity due to the 
use of ganja, a table prepared by the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals 
in Burma has been added showing that as far as the mental hospital at 
Tagadale was concerned, the percentage of mental cases attributable to 
the use of ganja and its derivatives varied during the years between 1928 
and 1937 from 0.87 to 4.35; and that in 1936, out of a total of 296 
admissions there were ten such cases, the corresponding figures for 1937 
being 356 and ten respectively.
The Sub-Committee was urged to examine the still-controversial 
question of the relationship between addiction to hemp drugs and the 
spread of insanity.
The work of Dr. Stringaris on Hashish was discussed. He is an 
authority on insanity due to the use of Hashish

13

in Russia. He maintains that a further increase can be expected in the 
ravages caused by Hashish in Asiatic Russia.
Then the question of the relationship between the abuse of narcotic 
drugs and alcoholism arose. It is still a mixed question, and considerable 
recommendations were furnished.
In Algeria, Dr. Bouquet has noted that Heroin addicts were recruited 
from the Hashish addicts, and Dr. Stringaris in Asiatic Russia has found 
that to be the case there also.
In conclusion the Secretariat pointed out that, as a result of 
concurrent investigations, progress has been made on chemical studies 
and research, while fresh information has been gathered in other spheres; 
at the same time, certain points still require clarification, especially in 
connection with the physiological, psychological, and psychopathic effects 
of Cannabis and with the relationships between Hashish-addiction and 
insanity, and between Cannabis-addiction and crime.
After considering all of the recommendations furnished by the 
League of Nations, the Sub-Committee then made the following report, 
which is very pertinent in the light of the points we want to discuss here.

"In discussion of the matter before it, the Sub-Committee divided 
consideration of the subject as follows:

14

(l)	Commercial uses of Cannabis 
(2)	Medical uses of Cannabis 
(3)	Effects of the abuse of Cannabis 
(4)	Methods of detecting the presence of Cannabis
(5)	Legal definition of the term "Cannabis.Ó

The discussions developed the fact that the Committee still lacks 
complete information concerning the commercial uses of Cannabis. The 
Sub-Committee would welcome further information concerning the 
physiological, psychological and psychopathic effects of abusive use of 
Cannabis and the relation between Cannabis-addiction and crime.
Dr. Bouquet pointed out that percentages of resin content in the 
hemp plant raised in different countries should be ascertained with a view 
to deciding whether it is necessary to prohibit or merely to control the 
cultivation of Cannabis for industrial purposes.
The value of the Beam test for detecting the presence of Cannabis 
appears to have been confirmed by a further series of experiments, the 
results of which are before the Committee, including those attained by the 
employment of several different modifications of that text.
Dr. de Myttenaere said that his experience enabled him to state that 
the Beam alkaline reaction and its modifications indicated the chief 
element in the various

15

components of Cannabis resin which was the cause of Hashish addiction, 
i.e.the alcoholic group.
Dr. Bouquet informed the Sub-Committee that a test based upon new 
principles had recently been devised which will form the subject of a 
thesis to be presented by Messrs. Duquenois and Hassan Negm Mustapha at 
the University of Strasbourg in July, 1938, a brief description of which 
will be circulated to the Opium Advisory Committee.
The question of modifying the incomplete definition of Indian hemp 
in the Geneva Convention of 1925 was discussed, but no definite 
conclusion was arrived at. It appeared upon examination that such 
modification would affect not only Article 1 of the Convention, but also 
Articles 4 and 11 and would necessarily involve complicated adjustments 
in the Convention itself. It was therefore decided to postpone further 
consideration of this matter until the next session of this Sub-Committee 
when it is hoped that more time will be available for the work.
Up to the present time, the work of the Sub-Committee has 
consisted almost entirely of collecting information in regard to the 
various phases of the Cannabis problem, and, until the Sub-Committee has 
before it more data than it has at present, it would scarcely be considered 
advisable to undertake definite recommendations."

16

We would like to take inventory of our research and see what is 
needed.
The Federal Government did not get into this picture until after all 
48 states had adopted legislation controlling Marihuana in greater or less 
degree. The Marihuana Tax Act went into effect a little over a year ago, 
and since that time we have destroyed some 16,000 acres of the plant 
throughout the various States; most of it in the Middle West. About l,000 
violators have been arrested by the Federal Government.
I am not trying to sell this book, but I want to call your attention to 
the work on "Marihuana'a written by Dr. Robert P. Walton, Professor of 
Chemistry, University of Mississippi, with a foreword by Dr. Geller who is 
a distinguished pharmacologist connected with the University of Chicago.
I would like to start with the agricultural phases of this problem, 
which will also include the industrial and economic phases.
I am therefore going to call on Dr. Wright of the University of 
Wisconsin and ask him to discuss some of the questions that seem to be 
troubling us.

STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. WRIGHT
Professor of Agronomy University of Wisconsin

17

DR. WRIGHT: Gentlemen, let me say to you in the first place that 
while I am connected with the University of Wisconsin, so far as the hemp 
work is concerned, the hemp being Marihuana, I am working as an agent and 
in cooperation with the Bureau of Plant Industry here in Washington.
I had better assume that you are about the agricultural side like I am 
about chemistry, that you do not know very much about it. Therefore, 
suppose I sketch briefly the practical every day procedure by which hemp 
is handled in the United States and Canada, not mentioning anything about 
the European situation, and as Dr. Robinson is going to review something 
about the history of hemp, I will leave that out entirely.
In the United States hemp is an annual crop produced from seed 
planted each year, planted in the Spring the same as small grains are 
planted, the same as corn is planted.
It has been grown during recent years almost exclusively in very few 
sections; Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
It is planted en masse thickly as small grain, in other words, it is 
drilled in.
It is planted on very good soil in order to be a profitable production. 
It is a crop limited to good soil

18

for profitable production most every where in the world, and it is seeded 
about a bushel to the acre on soil, prepared as for small grain.
After it is planted, there is nothing left to be done except to wait 
for it to be harvested, and it is harvested in the latter part of August, 
throughout September, and sometimes extending into October depending on 
the section of the United States or Canada.
The seed is usually produced in Kentucky, and in the North American 
Continent, very rarely any other place. In the sections where it is grown 
for fibre or industrial uses, seed is not produced.
The usual, or arbitrary way of determining when to harvest a crop is 
when it is well in blossom, we will say rather late blossom when the 
pollen is being fairly cleared, depending from that time on how 
circumstances work out, but that is when it is begun.
It is generally harvested now by special machinery which has been 
developed during the last few years. It is cut and spread in swaths of even 
length. It is left in the stuble, spread out for retting.
Now, the exact procedure varies in different sections of the country. 
This retting period, that is the period when the so-called fibre portion of 
the stem is released

19

from the woody portion, varies from two weeks to, in certain cases, two 
months.
After it has reached that stage where the fibre can be removed from 
the straw by being dressed, it is gathered and bound in bundles and 
shocked. Then it is put in stacks, usually in hemp mills or processing 
plants.
From these stacks it is sent to the dryer, and dried to what is 
commonly called in the trade bone-dry condition and which would mean 8 
or 9 or 10% moisture.
Then it is crushed by the breaking process, that is the fiber is 
separated by the usual process called scutching, and it is divided into two 
kinds of fibre, one the long stretch, and the other tangled, and then it is 
inserted in bales.
That, I believe, is the agricultural procedure of the handling of the 
hemp.
There is a little variation in Kentucky because of the weather 
conditions. It is not retted immediately, but shocked until later in the 
season when the retting conditioning can be done.
In the northern part of the country, it is spread on the ground and the 
retting is done immediately.
Now, I want to avoid going into the acreage and that phase of the 
work for Dr. Robinson is going to cover that.

20

I would like to inject this thought here for I am sure it will do no 
harm, and that is that hemp has been an American industry ever since 
Colonial times It is not a large industry. It has had its ups and downs, but 
it has been an American industry since Colonial times, and it is one of the 
oldest crops that we have in the United States.
It is used, as you know, from an industrial stand-point for textile 
purposes, and to a minor extent for other purposes and Dr. Robinson will 
develop that.
Now, there might be perhaps some questions right now. One or two 
other items I want to take up before I am through.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Go right ahead.

DR. WRIGHT: You know I might not have another chance to say 
anything

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You will be given a chance. Go right 
ahead, Dr. Wright.

DR. WRIGHT: I was just wanted to throw this into the pot, and that 
is, of course, that we who work with the commercial producers, and the 
industry naturally collectively, and I suppose we are justifiable in that, 
our prejudices are on that side. I do not think we would be human if we 
were not, and I do not claim to be other than human. We have a small 
industry in the United States that

21

has had its ups and downs over a long period of time. We still produce 
commercial hemp and fibre. Those in the industry are naturally concerned. 
They have a stake in that they have what little they have invested in the 
business. 
They are not concerned about this last law because I believe they 
were given a very square deal in the national legislation on the matter. 
What they are concerned about is the public position, that indefinite 
intangible thing, public feeling about growing hemp at all. 
They have already been subjected to some rather embarrassing 
situations. 
Now, just suppose that as a result of the agitation, warranted or 
not, and there are probably two views on that, and I am open to both 
views, the extensive publicity that has been given in the hemp states, 
particularly Wisconsin where there is much agitation, that some kind of a 
legislation will come up to put out or eradicate the production of hemp 
under the Weed Control Department or the Legislature appropriating money 
to do it. 
I will not bother you long on that, but I just want to mention that 
and show what problem we will be called on to face. Those men have 
managed to keep their mouths

22
shut and have expressed no views concerning Marihuana in public, for we 
feel we are not in a position to do so, and we would like to be sure of our 
ground before doing it.
Of course, having worked with eradication procedures and 
eradication programs, unless you would convince us otherwise we would 
oppose the eradication program in Wisconsin as we see it now with the 
immense cost and the things of that sort.
Now comes the other phase of it. We have been trying, in cooperation 
with the Bureau of Plant Industry, and Dr. Robinson and the Division of 
Pharmacy of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Link who is head of the 
Bio-Chemistry Department of the University of Wisconsin to begin a study 
of Cannabis in relation to hemp as a crop. 
Without going into details, I think I have told you my story for the 
present.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We thank you very much, Doctor. Before 
we go on to Dr. Robinson, I think there were various points brought up that 
our conferees would like to discuss.
There is one point about commercial hemp. We did not make a survey 
in your State, but we did make a survey in the State of Minnesota, and 
some of the hemp that was harvested in 1934 is still on the ground.

23

DR. WRIGHT: That is right.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is giving us a great deal of difficulty. 
The farmers up in Minnesota in some of the sections have been subjected 
to various promotion schemes. Due to the existence of stacks of the old 
1934 and 1935 crop of harvested hemp in Southern Minnesota, which is a 
menace to society in that it has been used by traffickers, we have 
arrested a gang who took a truck load of this Marihuana into New York.
I will say that the farmers up there have been cooperating with us 
100%. If they see anybody around that section who looks like a trafficker, 
they bring out their old shot guns, and he is soon disposed of. We have very 
little trouble from the farmers up there.
It is said that every stack contains a plentiful supply for smoking 
purposes.
Allegations have been made that if it was on the ground three years 
there would not be any resin left. Mr. Wollner can tell you how much resin 
some of the experts reported after Marihuana had been lying on the ground 
three years. It seems that the traffickers can find it. Our own chemists 
have found it.
We feel that the farmer is entitled to a reasonable return for these 
old crops. He planted the crop in goodfaith; he has no desire to violate the 
law, and we have

24

been assured that the removal of the harvested crops is very desirable. It 
is a very difficult situation.
Have you any observations to make, or any discussion on the 
question?

DR. ROBINSON: As to thw commercial procedure, tha plant is spread 
out on the land, and left there until the stalks are retted, and some of the 
leaves are gone. It is shocked and taken into the hemp mill. The grower is 
uncertain as to where he stands, and whether the leaves that are 
associated with the straw are in the legal sense Marihuana, referring, of 
course, to that particular clause in the law which refers to dry stalks.
Now this is done as follows: the straw is left on the land in the 
stubble for varying times, as I say, from two weeks or longer during this 
retting process. It is subject to the action of rains and bleaching and 
decomposition with the various effects of bacteria and fungi, but when it 
is taken in, it still retains a trace of the leaves. That is what affects the 
folks up there in Minnesota.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I notice the term "hurds" referred to.

DR. WRIGHT: That is the non-fibrous material crushed and taken away 
from the fibrous. It is the residue. It

25

would be the same as shives in flax.

MR. WOLLNER: I am afraid to say that the experiment with Minnesota 
hemp is rather inconclusive. As I understand it the hemp was bundled 
before it had been permitted to ret for an extended period of time.
It may be we will find that if the hemp is permitted to ret before it 
is stacked, a further decomposition of the drug will ensue. However, we do 
know that the Minnesota hemp of 1934 is active.

DR. WRIGHT: It would be active.

MR. WOLLNER. It is active but whether the activity was retained by 
improper handling of the hemp, I don't know. As I understand it they were 
advised to bunch their hemp before it was retted.

DR. WRIGHT: It was never rotted or retted. The plan of handling in 
Minnesota was unauthorized. In other words, it was contrary to the usual 
procedure. They put the green hemp or the semi-green hemp in a bundle, 
and at a later stage it would be known in the trade as green hemp. That 
was never used for textile purposes. It was not suitable for textile 
purposes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then, Dr. Wright, your opinion is that if 
harvested properly most of the leaves avould remain on the ground and not 
adhere to the stalks?

26

DR. WRIGHT: I will be perfectly frank in telling you that will vary in 
seasonal conditions, and so we are much concerned about that. There are 
leaves left. As to the condition of those leaves, we don't know. They are 
left, and there is no use in denying that. There are considerable left on the 
straw. There are not a great deal, but there are leaves left.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then prompt harvesting would reduce this 
danger we are now confronted with? 

DR. WRIGHT: It would.

DR. MATCHETT: What about the hemp stacked green in Kentucky; 
doesn't that mold more than that left on the ground?

DR. WRIGHT: Hemp is left in the shock in Kentucky. You will correct 
me Dr. Robinson, if I'm wrong, because it has been fifteen years since I 
was down there, but it is my impression that it is shocked. It is first 
spread and allowed to wilt on the ground.

DR. MATCHETT: Then there is no molding?

DR. WRIGHT: If properly handled there will be no molding. 

MR. WOLLNER: From our point of view that would be improper 
handling; there would be no decomposition of the resin.

27

DR. WRIGHT: The general weathering we would get would be during 
the curing stage.

MR. WOLLNER: How long, about, does that take?

DR. WRIGHT: Now, after it is shocked, cured and stacked, later it is 
spread on the land again and retted.

DR. MATCHETT: But, during this period, of course, it would be in 
excellent condition for smoking, - that is, relatively dry in the stack.

DR. WRIGHT: From the time it is cut until it is rotted, whatever 
leaves there are should be suitable for Marihuana.

MR. SMITH: While we have not found in New York State a large 
agricultural growth, we do find that the largest part of our growth, 
instead of being on good soil, is on poor soil.
For the past two years when I have been looking for wild growth, I 
have found it in dumps or soil that has a high content of ashes or cinders, 
and I have found it trying to grow it in my own garden but the growth does 
not begin to compare with that of the cinder growth, and as a matter of 
fact we have found that most recently the wild growth seeks that kind of 
soil.
That does not prove anything, of course, except we have probably 
most of our wild growth coming from ashes

28

and cinders and public dumps. This did strike me very forcibly, and what 
struck me more forcibly was that we had some of the biggest growths in 
Brooklyn where it was almost a clear cinder dump.
Our experience in New York State so far has not produced anyone who 
desired to be licensed as a cultivator.
I think some of that might be offset if the public was assured that 
the cultivator would have to be licensed, after proper investigation, and 
that definite qualifications exist to establish control.

DR. WRIGHT: As to your first statement about hemp growing on 
cinder beds, wild hemp, - it is not a fibrous hemp. As all of you who are 
familMWith the middle west know, you will find blocks that were 
formerly even cinder beds, but fibrous hemp will not grow there.

MR. SMITH: The point I was chiefly interested in was the public 
interest, where it was grown, whether being produced by chance or design.

DR. WRIGHT: We are hopeful we can clarify this situation. Since 
legislation may be introduced to eradicate or to bring pressure upon the 
legitimate producer, I appreciate your suggestion. I think it is a good one.

MR. SMITH: We have also in New York State given some consideration 
to definite measures for removal, but so far we have operated under 
difficulties acting under nuisance laws. Under the Public Health laws in 
New York, we can fix a penalty for maintaining a public nuisance. We have 
in a few instances removed Marihuana from private property where the 
owner wouldn't undertake it himself, and then assessed a lien against the 
property within the Public Health law on the ground that we have removed 
a public nuisance.

DR. WRIGHT: It might be construed to apply to Marihuana under our 
Public Health regulations in Wisconsin. I do not know whether it has been 
discussed or not.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Robinson, we would like to hear from 
you.

STATEMENT OF DR. B. B. ROBINSON
BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

DR. ROBINSON: If fibres produced from plants were ranked in 
accordance with their world production in tonnage, hemp would occupy a 
position of probably third or fourth. It would be surpassed by cotton and 
jute produced in India, and in some years by flax. That gives you some idea 
of where it stands in relative importance.
Dr. Wright mentioned a mattor that many of you are familMWith, the 
fact of the importance that hemp played in our earlier Colonial days 
before the introduction of

30

the cotton gin.
The culture of hemp in the United States, I might ay has decreased 
because of the cheap competitive fibres which are produced by cheap labor 
in foreign countries, and it is because of this cheapness that they are 
substituted for hemp in many cases, and not because of the fact that they 
have characteristics that are better than hemp for cordage or textile 
purposes.
The average world production between the years 1930 and 1954 for 
hemp was about 750,000 tons. And now, during that same period in the 
United States in this small industry we have produced about 500 tons. The 
world production was produced mainly by Russia where I think 56% of the 
fibre is produced, followed by Italy, Yugoslavia, Rumania as other 
producing countries, During the past year or two we imported for domestic 
consumption about 700 to 800 tons a year, so our total consumption, 
including domestically produced fibre, and imported fibre runs about from 
1500 to 2000 tons.
Now, many of you here may wonder why such a small industry as that 
should be favored to continue on, particularly in the light of the 
detrimental character of certain parts of the plant used illegally.
In the first place the United States is dependent


31

upon the foreign production of fibres other than cotton. The United States 
imports annually about 300,000 tons of fibre used for cordage and textile 
purposes. The estimated value last year was about $35,000,000. That does 
not include some importations of India twine.
I do not mean to infer that if hemp were grown in this country, it 
could substitute for all of this 300,000 tons imported, but it is the 
principal fibre which we can get in the United atates, which could be 
substituted in many cases if conditions arose to make it necessary.
The United States, is very thoroughly taken care of at present in 
reference to supplying our own needs on this cordage fibre.
Another argument for the hemp industry is the adaptability of the 
hemp plant to various regions of the country and because of suitability for 
mechanical handling, and these are some of the reasons why the office 
with which I am connected in the Department of Agriculture is interested 
in seeing this small nucleus of hemp industry continued each year until it 
is capable of supporting itself under economic conditions. I am speaking 
more of the industry in Wisconsin rather than the promotional attempts to 
grow hemp in Minnesota which one might speak of an unorthodox 
processing. But this industry we have is capable at the

32

present time of supporting itself if public opinion does not force it to be 
shut doan, or additional restrictions hamper it.
So, this industry could be benefited we naturally think, if this 
Marihuana stigma could be removed. However, the Wisconsin operators are 
not opposed to adjust themselves to the conditions and are very much 
interested in trying to overcome this drug problem.
A couple of years ago when this problem was brought to the front 
more vividly than in the past, the Department of Agriculture was naturally 
interested in it, and the main way we could see to combat it was as to 
how to get around it [sic]. Naturally there might be less restriction on the 
production of hemp in this country if we could prove that in certain 
sections of the country, because of climatic conditions, the drug was not 
active, or if we could possibly get plants of varieties that lack the drug, 
which is probably an Utopian view, or that had it in low concentration.
As a result we cooperated with the Bureau of Narcotics, in setting 
up some experiments. The Bureau of Narcotics has conducted all of the 
chemical work, and Dr. Marchett later on will speak of these tests. I do not 
want to go too much into his field. But, we have attempted under

33

this cooperative work to remove or reduce the resinous substance from 
commercial hemp.
You gentlemen who are chemists and pharmacologists can assist the 
Agricultural program by furnishing the Agriculture Department some 
working tools or some tests by which we can tell the presence or absence 
of this drug, or its activity. It may be said that I am throwing it all on the 
chemists. I am not trying to do that, but we do need something to work 
with.
So far we naturally have resorted to the Beam tests, the 
significance of which we do not know with certainty, but in the work we 
undertook last year, it was the only simple tool which we could work 
with.
Now last summer out at Arlington farm close by, we planted a field 
in which there were 98 small plots of hemp that were set up in 
conformity with the statistical method of analysis of variances by a man 
named Fisher.
We obtained statistically significant differences between the 
varieties using the alkaline but did not obtain it using the acid test. The 
question may arise, then, as to which is the most accurate of the tests in 
measuring the presence or absence of the drug.
In reference to that, the question of the region of the hemp may play 
some importance. The native home of

34

hemp is supposedly in central Asia, Ñand the hemp of Chinese origin which 
has been distributed throughout the world has practically always been 
used for fibre purposes.
The hemp that has come from India has been of the narcotic type and 
has not been cultivated generally for fibre. It has been cultivated for the 
drug. I wish I knew the history of this a little better, but from what I have 
been able to learn from others, hemp does not appear to constitute a 
narcotic problem in China. That is of a fibrous variety, and there is a great 
difference between that hemp and the hemp that came from India. 
With reference to our test at Arlington, the narcotic chemists 
selected samples at three different periods for the acid and alkaline test. 
We got a difference, mathematically significant between those tests. That 
is, the first sampling which I think was in the early part of June, was 
different from the later two samplings in that it was lower in that 
characteristic of activity, the numbers they gave on the Beam test.
Actually, the last test was a little lower than the middle test, but it 
was not significantly lower.
We arranged 8 different fertilizer treatments for the various plots 
and found that the fertilizer used had no effect on the strength or 
incidence either the

35

acid or alkaline test.
Because of the fertilizer result it would appear that soil vs. variations 
that occurred probably did not produce any differences or that the soil does 
not play a part.
With reference to climate, so far we have not made a test for we have 
only had the work at Arlington.  But we plan next summer, if things go well at 
Arlington, to conduct a test in Wisconsin. We have some cooperative agents in 
Mississippi and we thought we could get a test farm there. It has been 
suggested that we try to get one other region, Arizona or New Mexico, or out 
in that section.  So far, we have not made arrangements, but, if we could get 
these various locations in the United States, then we could have a set-up 
whereby we could evolute [sic] climatic conditions in reference to certain 
tests, the Beam test or some other one if you can furnish it. These are the 
results which we have obtained so far in the agricultural program to get away 
from this drug.
There have been several reasons I have not brought out as to why we 
thought we could get somewhere.  We know by handling the plants that some 
of them are very resinous, and some are not.
So, we are receptive to the work you men will do to give us some means 
of testing our plants so as to allow

36

us to produce agriculturally some results which we hope will help the 
industry.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Thank you very muck, Dr. Robinson. You 
recall what I said about the Turkish annual report for the year 1937 in 
which it is said that Cannabis sativa with long stalks is grown for 
industrial purposes in various parts of Anatolia; that the fibre is used for 
the manufacture of ropes and sacks, and its resin content is so slight that 
it could not be used for the extraction of a narcotic drug. It might be 
interesting to get some Turkish seed. 

MR. WOLLNER: We have not had a great deal of success as regards 
those statements. We obtained some seed submitted by Dr. Bouquet and I 
believe Dr. Robinson planted some of them, without any success.

DR. ROBINSON: We planted them under favorable conditions last 
spring. Roughly we may have gotten in the field 200 or 300 plants, and 
after our first Beam test it was estimated we had about 100 left. About 
the first of August, I came back from a trip to the west, and we el-
iminated about two-thirds of the remainder leaving only about 40. I have 
harvested about 20 of these one-half were males, and we sent 10 from 
that collection over to Dr. Matchett to run an alkaline Beam test on. I was

37

able to obtain out of that .about one-third negative and the rest positive.

MR. WOLLNER: Was the amount of resin in these plants comparable to 
that in other plants?

DR. ROBINSON: In harvesting these plants, we merely stripped the 
seed in the field to keep the birds from getting it and I would say that the 
African plant was more resinous than the Manchurian plant. It may be that 
the African plant was later in maturing, but still, by comparison with the 
Manchurian plant, it had more resin. My hand was simply caked with resin 
in stripping the plant for the seed.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: The Indian Government report for 1934 
shows that where they did not have this type of hemp all of the resin was 
imported from Central Asia.
It is stated that the hemp cultivated in Europe does not carry the 
intoxicating properties of Indian hemp. While it is believed that the 
European hemp does not contain as much resin as is to be found in hemp 
usually produced in Asia, the production of the active resin is particularly 
variable, and there are some times great differences in quantity depending 
on the altitude of the place of cultivation.
Are there any questions that you care to ask, Dr.

38

Robinson?

DR. HIBBEN: I would like to ask if you made any experiments 
artificially in the new varieties by radiation?

DR. ROBINSON: We had a program for a number of years on hemp, and 
my predecessor, Mr. Dewey, who unfortunately could not be here this 
morning, reached retirement age three years ago, and our hemp program 
was interrupted.
So far we have not gone into that, but to some extent we have 
considered it. These other methods we have approached seemed to have 
possibilities of results if the tests mean anything.
I think this next spring, we should be able to plant these negative 
seeds we have, and those which have tested negative three different times 
and have been pollinated by plants in three different tests, and we should 
be able to give the chemists something definite to test.

DR. MUNCH: It is my recollection, when Mr. Dewey made a test of the 
original plants growing in Arlington back in 1922, we found different 
physiological portents in the male and the female but, at that time, Mr. 
Dewey had seed he had obtained from various parts of the world, and it is 
my impression that after about three years of cultivation at Arlington, the 
growth characteristics of all of these plants tended to the same type. In 
other

39

words, they all tended to hemp of a certain height, Ñas I say that occurred 
after three years of cultivation.

DR. ROBINSON: I think that more or less that result is obtained. 
Professor Wright who may have had a little closer touch with the problem 
could answer you better. Wouldn't that be your opinion, Professor Wright?

DR. WRIGHT: Yes, under the method used of applying open pollinating, 
that was the tendency as far as our observation went,Ñthat they were 
more or less alike.

DR. ROBINSON: In reference to that, these stalks of hemp we obtained 
last year from these various sources, have all been isolated, so they have 
not been cross pollinated.

DR. MUNCH I do not know where Mr. Young of Florence, South Carolina, 
got his idea for the raising of Cannabis for a medicinal purpose -

DR. ROBINSON: He got it from Mr. Dewey.

DR. MUNCH: There was a material decrease in the material before he 
finally abandoned that project.

DR. ROBINSON: I do not know how he obtained it all, or that he 
obtained it all from Mr. Dewey, but as I recall, he did.

DR. MUNCH: There is one other question, and that is as to the method 
by which the seeds themselves were ob-

40

tained,-is that of any interest to you?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes, Dr. Wright, can you give us something 
on the that?

DR. WRIGHT: Commercial seed used for commercial planting?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes.

DR. WRIGHT: I do not have any notes on that. The seed are grown from 
plants cultivated principally for seed; I mean the ordinary hemp which has 
been planted for seed similar to corn. It is planted in rows, all harvested 
by hand, and put in large shocks like those in Kentucky. It is harvested in 
the latter part of September or the first of October in the section in 
which it is grown. Then the shocks are dumped over on large canvasses, 
smoothed out on the ground, and the stubble removed and beat out with 
sticks in the old fashioned method. This is the only place in the United 
States producing this commercially.

DR. MATCHETT: Isn't most of the seed planted here produced in 
foreign countries?

DR. WRIGHT: I do not get the question.

DR. MATCHETT: Aren't most of the seeds produced in foreign 
countries?

DR. WRIGHT: Most of the seed produced for Commercial purposes 
originated in China, central China or towards

41

the south part of China and was carried here for cultivation.

MR. WOLLNER: I believe what Dr. Matchett means is the commercial 
crop that is grown for instance in Wisconsin, does that originate from 
seed grown in Kentucky, or the Far East?

DR. WRIGHT: All of the hemp planted in the United States for 
commercial purposes comes from Kentucky. That is, all of the legitimate 
hemp comes from seed grown in Kentucky. Does that answer the question? 
DR. MATCHETT: Yes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Matchett, you have been collaborating 
with Dr. Robinson in these experiments at Arlington. Can you tell us what 
results you obtained? Dr. Robinson has told us quite a lot about the 
results, but I think you can probably elaborate upon them.

DR. MATCHETT: First of all I might state we made these tests in the 
manner that was published by us last year, and in the treatment we 
divided the tests into six categories, according to the depth of color that 
we obtained, beginning with zero for negative plants. These plants which, 
gave us only traces of color, which we felt should not be overlooked, but 
which we also felt would not constitute wholly satisfactory 
identification of the

42

plant, were designated number one.

Those plants characterized as 2, gave strong responses, definitely 
positive, and those as 3, 4, and 5 responded with increasing intensity in 
that order.

Briefly we found on variety No. 1, a Rumanian variety 97.5% of the 
plants tested would have been satisfactorily identified by the Beam test. 
That is assuming for the moment the single test would be sufficient, 
which I believe is generally understood not to be so.

Variety No. 2, another Rumanian variety, gave us 100%.

Variety No. 3, the third Rumanian variety, 87% of satisfactory 
response.

Variety No. 5, Manchuria, 22.9% satisfactory response. 

Variety No. 6, Chinese, 13.8% satisfactory. 

Variety No. 9, Italian, 98.1%

There is a very decided difference between the Chinese, and 
Manchurian varieties on the one hand and the Rumanian and Italian 
varieties on the other.

Now there were some very interesting things in reference to the 
differences between the three test periods.

It is true that there was one rather decided change, particularly in 
the second test, but there was not as significant difference between the 
number of negative plants, nor was the difference worked with reference 
to

43

category No. l.

The interesting thing was where we had many in category 2 in the 
first testing, in the next testing a considerable increase appeared in 
category 4, with a corresponding decrease in category 2.

The actual number of negative plants was not significantly 
different. I believe the first test gave us 36, the second test 32, and the 
third test 40.

During the course of our activities we found that molding had no 
apparent effect on one alkaline test response of either negative or 
positive plants. We permitted them to mold in a. very moist place for a 
period of five weeks. There was no change in the Beam test.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I want to ask Dr. Wright a question. In 
harvesting the plant, Doctor, we understand that the farmer usually 
harvests it before the resin reaches its highest stage. Is that true?

DR. WRIGHT: I will say yes, not knowing when the highest stage of 
the resin is reached myself, but from what I could gather from talking to 
Mr. Wollner and Dr. Link and those most familiar with the subject. It is cut 
in the mid-blossom stage, and from what I understand the plants are 
usually expected to have a high content of resin at that time.

44

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our eradication program, 16,000 acres 
have been gone over, and as I understand it we will also have to go over 
that same acreage during the coming year, and probably the third year. Do 
you know how long that seed will remain dormant in the soil? 

DR. WRIGHT: I can only give you some guess on that. It is quite 
variable, and how long the seed will remain in the soil is simply my guess. 
If it is harvested the first year, before pollination occurs I would expect 
that to handle the situation under most circumstances. I am basing that on 
practical observation and experience, but if there is a repetition and the 
plant does become a volunteer plant, if the same process as followed for 
two years we could expect almost complete eradication. 

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What seed could replace the hemp seed as 
bird food? There is a lot of growth throughout the country due to the 
casting about of bird seed. Now, however we require sterilization of hemp 
seed. We have not reached the 100% point in sterilization but the seed 
people tell us they should sell the seed in 5% mixtures; but even 5%, 
mixtures if the seed is not properly sterilized, might produce some wild 
growth. Have you any suggestions on that?

45

DR. WRIGHT: I believe that these gentlemen here from the animal 
biology department might be better able to judge of that than I am.

DR., COUCH: As a matter of fact, I do not know anything on that point, 
and we have not gone into it at all. I am extremely interested however.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think there should be some discussion 
as to the relative activities between the male and the female plants.

DR. BLATT: May I ask a question of Dr. Robinson? As I understand it, 
the average production is about 500 tons a year. Is that 500 tons of fibre?

DR. ROBINSON: Yes. This past summer, we had 1300 acres of hemp 
produced commercially in this country, and it has been running about that 
acreage with the exception that in 1934 and 1935 this acreage appeared in 
Minnesota, and in 1936 and 1937 we had a big acreages in Illinois, but 
those were acreages planted, you might say, for other purposes than the 
ordinary use, for there was an idea of producing fibre as a substitute for a 
wool and various things of that nature. Those industries that attempted to 
do that, for one reason or another, have dropped by the wayside, and 1000 
to 1500 acres is the normal hemp production each year in the United 
States.

46

MR. WOLLNER: Professor Wright, you heard Commissioner Anslinger's 
question for information on the relationship between male and female 
plants. You are undoubtedly aware of most of the discussions in the past 
years on the subject of Marihuana, and that it has centered around the 
female plant. As a matter of fact, I believe the United States 
Pharmacopoeia refers to the flowering type of the female plant, and it is 
stated that Marihuana comes mostly from the female plant. I wonder 
whether historically that might not have arisen from the fact that 
possibly the male plant flowered at an earlier period than the female 
plant in the growth of the plant itself, and at the time of harvesting by 
force of circumstance they were limited to harvesting female tops.

DR. WRIGHT: Not actually knowing it, I could not say, of course, but I 
am sure that is the answer. In the male plant the leaves drop off long 
before, the female plant, and when the traffickers have reached the plant 
the leaves have practically all gone from the male, but the females are 
luxuriant.

MR. LEVINE: Is there any distinction between the fiber of males and 
females?

DR. WRIGHT: You see, in fibre, they are cut at an early stage when the 
female plants are just forming the

47

bud, and the male plants just shedding the pollen.

MR. WOLLNER: Then the male plant would grow as tall as the female 
plant.

DR. WRIGHT: Yes, they do usually reach the same height.
MR. WOLLNER. When produced for fibre, the plant does not reach the 
height we experienced in Arlington.

DR. WRIGHT: It has reached its full height when cut for fibre. You 
planted it in rows, too, which would add to the height.

MR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Professor Wright a question as to 
whether or not there was any quantity of Cannabis raised in this country 
for commercial drug purposes.

DR. WRIGHT: I cannot answer that question.

DR. ROBINSON: Undoubtedly there are others here who could furnish 
that information. I do not know of a single case where any of it has been 
furnished companies for that purpose, but I think there are companies that 
get it for that purpose.

MR. SMITH: There was a concern that grew it in Indianapolis several 
years ago for their own purposes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Most of the pharmaceutical houses before 
enactment of Federal Marihuana Legislation

48

obtained their Cannabis supply from the Middle West. There was relatively 
little importation of Cannabis for medical purposes.

DR. COUCH: In the Food and Drug Administration, we occasionally see 
a questionnaire sent to the importers more or less of the patent medicine 
type, and also some well known pharmaceutical houses where cannabis is 
still found in the formula for certain products. Under the Pure Food and 
Drug Act, we have some requirements on that, and we are informed what 
the source of it is, whether gotten in this country or through importation.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think the stocks of some of the larger 
houses who are still putting this out are sufficient to carry them over for 
a considerable period of time. Some of the firms transferred or sold their 
product to other houses, but I know of a number of occasions where raw 
material was obtained in this country for the local trade.

DR. WRIGHT: I have been informed by Doctors that they did get a 
considerable amount of their prepared processed material from Mexico. I 
was wondering if there was any processing plant in Mexico.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I did not know they imported it for 
medical uses from Mexico.

49

DR. MUNCH: Many of the commercial manufacturers have grown it, but 
because of the extreme variability of the potency of the material they 
were growing themselves, they attempted to import it from Madras or 
Bombay. But the material imported was often weaker than that grown in 
this country. So the next step was to purchase from Mr. Young at 
Charleston, South Carolina, or the general neighborhood of Lexington, 
Kentucky, or Nantou, Illinois. But, those sources folded up within the last 
ten years and there has not been any substantial production of material in 
the United States since then. I tested most of the material grown in this 
country that has been offered.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I suppose that seed came from Kentucky, 
which in turn came from China.

DR. MUNCH: That is true, but I have tested material grown in the 
United States commercially that was more potent in its physiological 
aspects than that imported from India.

MR. FULLER: I think that came about as a result of the interest that 
developed in the production of it during the war, or just before we got into 
the war, because at that time I was in the field myself and grew it com-
mercially for four or five years in Virginia from that same stock of seed 
that Young used in South Carolina, and

50

which was obtained from the Bureau of Plant Industry. I do not know 
whether he got it from Dewey or not.

The plan we adopted was to cull out as much as possible the tall 
plants for purely commercial reasons. We could not get so much material 
from the tall plants. In other words, bushy plants grew up six and seven 
feet high, giving much more drug than those that grew up taller but not so 
bushy, When we considered it the proper time, you would grab hold of it. It 
felt like a sponge. We collected enough material then to produce a drug 
very much more potent than any imported material that came into the 
country.

It was our experience that it really did not make much difference 
where the hemp came from, after it had been grown here and become 
acclimated to our conditions you could select bushy plants from it, and it 
was just as potent. It did not make any difference where it came from. We 
used to cull our plants, particularly the male plants. I used to think it did 
not have much effect, but be that as it may, that was what we did. I do not 
think we could have ever used the male plants anyway for, in stripping, 
the amount of material obtained was so small.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How did you strip the plant?

MR. FULLER: It was a very easy process. It was done by women, and 
they used gloves. In all of the years we

51

were producing that material as far as we knew, there never was a case of 
where anybody used it for illegitimate purposes. In fact at that time, I do 
not think there was any Marihuana used. But, it did not pay us to go on.

I think a great deal of the Cannabis sold in the drug trade came from 
the wild materials that grew in the Middle West and one of the largest 
dealers in drugs handled that crop. I knew him very well, and he told me at 
the time.

DR. BROMBERG: What further preparation was there after stripping 
for medicinal purposes?

MR. FULLER: We just baled it and sold it.

DR. BROMBERG: Any other processing necessary?

MR. FULLER: In the manufacturing of medicinals, it has to be 
extracted usually with alcohol end concentrated down to a solid extract. 
There was no attempt, and I do not think there has been any attempt made, 
to separate for commercial purposes the active principle, for even with 
all of the work done, we do not know what it is.

MR. WOLLNER: Did you find, Mr. Fuller, in your growth of the plant 
commercially, that arid seasons or drier seasons would increase, or 
produce an increased quantity of resin?

52

MR. FULLER: I do not think we noticed any difference. Now, I was in 
that portion of Virginia very near to Washington on the first plateau, six 
or eight miles out, and some of those summers were very dry. We would 
get sometimes six weeks without rain, and it did not seem to affect the 
yield at all. One season, I recall particularly, there was a great deal of 
rain, and the crop was just about the same.

MR. WOLLNER: I would like to offer this thought to the Department of 
Agriculture. The statement is invariably made by people in Europe and the 
Far East and Near East that the amount of resin produced by a plant is in a 
measure proportionate to the rainfall, and the less rainfall the more resin. 
I wonder whether we are actually dealing with the question of the 
variation in the amount of resin produced as against the amount of resin 
exuded. That is to say, isn't it possible as a result of a condition, all that 
happens is the plant structure, so to speak, shrinks to evaporation and 
greater amount of resin appears on the surface, but the absolute quantity 
contained by the flowering tops and the leaves is the same ?

DR. ROBINSON: I think your point is well taken, and it was my 
intention to go into some of those points

53

in those tests throughout the United States. We collected material 
over at Arlington Farm last summer at various stages for the purpose of 
making a microtome test of these little pockets. So far we have not had 
time to do very much on that, and there are gentlemen here who have done 
more. We actually found those pockets present in pants two weeks old and 
on varying specimens which we have in our office. We want back to plants 
that were less [than] three weeks old and we found there hashish material. 
Now in older plants in some of the specimens we have of Indian hemp, it 
seemed to be exuded from the cells all over the surface, and I imagine in 
such plants as that, if it exuded if you touched it, much more would come 
off than if it had not exuded. Is that what you mean, certain climatic 
conditions would cause cells to erupt, and the viscosity of the exudate 
would be such that it would spread.

MR. WOLLNER: I am thinking in terms of opium or the poppy. You can 
get opium from the pod without scarifying, and the thought struck me, in 
the case of Cannabis, since the leaf is always extracted in this country, 
and since in the past the process has been of rubbing it from the outside, 
in the East, they get more resin than we do, due to the fact that more has 
exuded but not
54

more produced.

DR. HIBBEN: There is another factor involved in the question about 
rainfall, and the formation of resin, and that is perhaps the production of 
resin would depend upon the amount of sunshine, and the more rainfall, the 
less sunshine. In tomato plants for example, the Department of 
Agriculture has done a great deal of experimentation as to foliage, and [it] 
has been shown that the quantity of foliage depends greatly upon the 
duration of sunshine the plant has received.

MR. WOLLNER: I had not thought of that. 

DR. HIBBEN: Some plants require a great deal of sunshine. 

DR. WRIGHT: May I ask you this question, - I was interested in the 
fact that you selected the bushy plant believing it more profitable to do 
that. 

MR. FULLER: Yes.

DR. WRIGHT: Did you have any observations at all to indicate they 
were more potent or more satisfactory to the purchaser than the more 
slender plants; have you any reason to believe there is a difference 
between the two?

MR. FULLER: No, I do not think there is any difference, for the green 
leaf from the male plant yields resin, and as far as we could determine, 
the resin was just as

55

potent as the female. You do not get so much per plant. That was 
what we were interested in, but, as far as quality is concerned, I do not 
think there was any difference.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: And now, Gentlemen, if we have no more 
questions on the agricultural phase of the problem we will proceed to a 
little more controversial subject. The pharmacological phase. I would like 
to have Dr. Munch give us a little history of the pharmacology of 
Marihuana.

STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES C. MUNCH
PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOLOGY 
TEMPLE UNIVERSITY

DR. MUNCH: So far as the external effects are concerned of the fluid 
extract of Cannabis, the effects are hyperesthesia, fomication, and cold 
extremities. These cause increase in intensity. It is not local.

So far as the gastro-intestinal tract is concerned, there is no effect upon 
the taste. There is a tendency towards an increase in thirst and appetite, 
and large doses will cause nausea, emesis, vomiting, and the drugs 
produced diarrhea or constipation.
So far as the effect on the brain, I am only going into that to this 
extent, to say that in connection with USPVIII which was thirty years ago 
we were interested

56

in knowing whether the American grown plant could be used as well as 
that which had been imported from India. The study made by the American 
Drug Manufacturers Association and by others at that time led the USP 
official Committee to the stand that either the Indian or the American 
grown material would be comparable for medicinal purposes so long as it 
was tested and found to have a certain physiological effect, and from a 
number of bio-tests that were made in which the material was 
administered to dogs, there were three different effects produced, one 
effect being to cause the dog to sway from side to side, and back and 
forth, and finally not to be able to stand erect at all. It was then that 
satisfactory material was produced which would produce such a response.
When it became necessary to prepare revised standards for world 
use of the Cannabis, we standardized the standards. First, we obtained 
material from various manufacturers in this country representing the 
ordinary strength or potency of the product and then many of these 
manufacturers told me of the material of ten or twenty or thirty years 
before, and they gave me the products or materials which were of the 
same commercial strength as they have always been marketing.

Then through various means, we obtained drugs and

57

standardized those products, that is thirteen different products of this 
series of drugs. Those products were then mixed, and constituted the USP 
fluid extract of Cannabis, which was officially recognized in USP X.

Then as to the method of bio-assay. Contrary to much of the 
published literature we find that dogs vary as greatly in their response as 
do humans. On. some 500 dogs I have used, fully one-half were very 
insensitive, and were discarded immediately. The nervous type or short-
haired dog is usually a satisfactory animal but not necessarily the best.

Going back to the pharmacological action, so far as the causes, and 
effect on circulation, a small dose causes rapid beating of the heart which 
may be followed by less than normal. The blood pressure is usually 
unchanged, or there is a slight fall.

So far as the blood is concerned, there is a definite increase in the 
hypoglycemiacal content. At the same time, there is a definite increase in 
the blood sugar. Enormous doses have produced death by cardiac failure, 
but the doses were 100 to 200 times doses, which produced a tremendous 
physiological effect.

If smoked, there is a tendency to choking or coughing, and all doses 
tend to decrease the respiratory needs.

58

So far as the muscles are concerned, the muscles show a definite 
confusion, and with very large doses there are shown flexor spasms. But 
not with a therapeutic dose.

So far as the pupils of the eyes themselves, there is a very definite 
contraction of the conjunctiva, and usually but not always a dilation of 
the pupil.

So far as the effect on the glands, there is probably a double 
diuretical effect. There is a question, and the production of the diuretic 
effect is unsettled.

It has been reported there is a sexually stimulating effect. Some say 
it does and some say it does not exist.

So far as antidotes are concerned the thought is, if it has been 
swallowed, the administration of an emetic, caffeine or acid drinks in 
general.

So far as the habituation is concerned, it has been claimed and 
denied, and so far as elimination is concerned, I have not been able to 
detect it in the urine. So, I do not believe the active principle is 
eliminated by urine.

In the general pharmacopoeia developed by O'Shaunessy in 1843, 
which reached its peak ten or fifteen years later, it was clinically 
recommended for all sorts of diseases and later found worthless.

There is a definite decrease in the central Indian

59

drug which stimulated further work done by Casparis and others, after 
which it appears to have gone into innocuous desuetude until it began to be 
criminally exploited, which led to the present burst of study.

Pharmacology is right I think, when it is said it does not have the 
same effect, or one effect on the brain, and I may be sticking my head out 
when I make a suggested answer that the cause of the awful intoxication 
is largely due to the difference in the rate of absorption, whether the 
material is smoked or given by solution or in capsules and taken into the 
stomach, or given rectally, and also the susceptibility on the brain, 
because in many instances we have given the same material to humans or 
dogs. Some of the animals it has shown no effect upon, others it has 
shown an enormous effect with the same dose. So far as animals are 
concerned, we have made a comparative study and find that dogs and 
rabbits have proven most suitable for quantitative assays but none can be 
relied on for qualitative accuracy, that is 10 to 12%. That is a complete 
change from what I said in my book,1 but it is possible, by running from 14 
to 20 bio-assay, to obtain results accurate within plus or minus 11 to 
20%. But, it never has been done commercially and can only be done in 
connection with research.

60

Through what channels does the active principle find its way into 
the nerve centers? I should say through the blood.
So far as the effect on the blood pressure, I have attempted to cover 
those reflex changes. It has been stated and denied that there are 
significant lesions in the brain of humans. Dogs I have used for some 
years, in some instances showed certain types of brain changes. Whether 
those are connected with Cannabis, I do not know. I am trying to complete 
that now and perhaps within the next five years I can answer the question.
Regarding the other questions, I would rather refer those to Dr. 
Bromberg.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Before we enter into a general discussion, I 
would like to call on Dr. Loewe of Cornell University to give us a 
statement on the bio-assay method.

STATEMENT OF DR. S. LOEWE
PHARMACOLOGIST 
CORNELL UNIVERSITY MEDICAL COLLEGE

DR. LOEWE: The bio-assay, in my opinion, is the point where the 
pharmacologist has to enter this manifold picture at which we arrive in 
this conference for a very significant reason.

61

The reason is that all the manifold aspects of Marihuana are focused 
around and makes the existence of an active principle in this drug, active 
principles which are chemically not known, and as long as an active 
principle is not chemically known, it can only be determined from its 
action, that is, biologically, which can only be by bio-assay.

Dr. Munch has thoroughly depicted the many aspects of the 
pharmacological action of Marihuana. That is what we can call the 
pharmacological spectrum of this drug, But it must be emphasized, that 
the spectrum of the drug as such and not on one certain active principle 
necessarily, for nobody knows the active principle, and nobody ever knows 
whether there is only one active principle or more than one active 
principle.

It can be assumed from the beginning that there is more than one 
active principle but this must not necessarily concern the Marihuana 
interests, because the problem is narrowed to that active principle among 
possibly many active principles which produces the narcotic or "dope" 
action in humans.

Even with respect to this point, of course, we are not one hundred 
percent sure that this is the action of one principle or more than one.

62

Quantitative bio-assay of the active principle of Marihuana, of 
course, tends or aims to determine that one active principle or a complex 
of active principles, which is interesting from the human point of view, 
the narcotic principle. May I mention right here that as long as we do not 
know how many active principles there are, we have to assume primarily 
that every action is carried by a separate active principle, and with this 
assumption, may I speak for the definite ataxia principle, which is the 
principle which can be bio-assayed in the drug which produces the main 
action stored in the dog. There is another action in the drug, which I may 
call the depressant action, the cataleptic action, and then there is the 
anesthetic principle which can be studied in the rabbit, using the 
depression of the corneal reflex. The depressant action in the mouse, 
manifested by prolonging the hypnotic action, is an action which I have 
observed and used to bio-assay this one active principle.

Now, bio-assay has to start, therefore, with this, which one of these 
actions is preferable for the Marihuana problem for studying the narcotic 
principle, important for humans?

We have much evidence that the ataxia action is fairly well related 
to the narcotic action.

63

In detail, there is not much to say. Walton has elaborated the 
previous effects and experiences of the bio-assay of the drug in a fairly 
good manner. There are details, and certainly it is necessary to bio-assay 
a large number of animals due to the individual natures and non-
susceptibility which complicates the actions, and action can only be 
compared in one and the same animal, and only for comparison in a single 
animal, and the consequence is that a large group of animals has to be 
used.

The mode of administration has been emphasized by Dr. Munch. I 
would prefer and do prefer, for bio-assay, intravenous administration 
because the Marihuana action has a very long period of latency without the 
means of elimination from the system, so that the results seem to be 
fairly well comparable.

Now, I am of the opinion, just like Dr. Munch has emphasized, that 
the bio-assay method of the drug is not definitely eliminated. I have the 
impression that the method will result in fairly good accuracy, but it is an 
accuracy of plus or minus 15 or 20%, and which will suffice, I suppose, for 
the period in which bio-assay is necessary.

It is the unfortunate situation of the pharmacologist that in certain 
periods of development of active princi-

64

ples he is available for the purpose, and in a certain sense he is the man 
charged with the entire problem.  But, his unfortunate situation is that 
just when he has developed this method and applied it, it is always finally 
inherent that he is out of the picture for, as soon as the chemist comes 
into the picture, and the bio-assay is not any more necessary, the 
pharmacologist can be dropped.  If I may mention this at random, all of 
these points of view are true also as to the chemical test.  Before the 
chemist has developed the active principle, the chemical method of 
identification of much or great importance to the country, and they may be 
of much or less importance for identifying the active principles than are 
the bio-assay methods, but only after the discovery of the active principle 
and its chemical properties, the problem of the chemical test, the 
importance of the Beam test can become clear.
I know of another example where a greater activity of a certain drug 
was found, and the drug was not white but yellow, and this, of course, 
introduced many beliefs that yellow colors and opticals would be an easy 
expedient for getting a quantitative activity.  So, there was developed a 
number of tests for this drug, going into this problem, but finally it turned 
out what general color

65

of the narcotic or commodity was and the reason for the high activity of 
the drug.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Well, Doctor, we are going to have the 
chemists confer among themselves, and they will then give us some of 
their views. I think we can reserve the general discussion for the 
afternoon.

We will now hear from Dr. Walter Bromberg, Senior Psychiatrist of 
the Department of Hospitals, City of New York.

STATEMENT OF DR. WALTER BROMBERG
SENIOR PSYCHIATRIST 
DEPARTMENT OF HOSPITALS, CITY OF NEW YORK.

DR. BROMBERG: To start with, my interest in this Marihuana problem 
began in 1933 when I reported at Bellevue Hospital a group of 11 cases of 
mental reactions induced by smoking Marihuana and I reviewed the 
literature and medical knowledge at that time. Also, the experience which 
I obtained was at the Psychiatric Clinic of the Court of General Sessions 
over a period of six years. Persons showing overt mental symptoms were 
brought to the hospital by interested relatives and occasionally on a 
magistrate's order. For that reason, the vast majority of Marihuana 
smokers did not reach the hospital. Cases which came before the Clinic 
had passed through the Court of General Sessions and had been arraigned, 
indicted and

66

convicted of a felony.

There has been considerable literature on the intoxication and 
insanity-producing effect of Cannabis, in papers from Asia, Europe, and 
the United States. To sum up this material concisely, it can be said that 
the several types of syndromes recognized fall into three groups: (a) 
intoxication, (b) toxic psychosis with or without admixture of other types 
of mental reactions (schizophrenia, manic-depressive) and (c) according 
to Eastern European and Asiatic observers, chronic dementia and 
deterioration following prolonged use of the drug. Apparently this latter 
type of deteriorating process has not been observed in American clinics.

Our experience with mental conditions following Marihuana indicate 
to us that there are two categories of mental reaction. The following 
classification is suggested:

Acute intoxication (Marihuana Psychosis) Containing sensory, motor 
and subjective elements, lasting hours to several days, often with anxiety 
or hysterical reactions, and panic states and depressions of transient 
nature.
Toxic Psychoses (a) in which there are many admixtures of disturbed 
sensorlum, delusional and emotional reactions amounting to psychosis, but 
with the common characteristic
67

toxic signs and (b) functional psychoses of a typical variety, initiated by 
Marihuana or colored by Marihuana in their symptomatology, but which 
continue in the form of the underlying psychosis. In these cases Marihuana 
represents an incipient stage in the psychosis, apparently.

There were 14 cases of Acute Intoxication and 17 of Toxic 
psychosis.

The point at which the line is drawn between acute intoxicating due 
to Marihuana and psychosis due to Marihuana depends on the degree and 
severity of the symptoms. Acute intoxications, induced by smoking one to 
four cigarettes, bring about after an interval varying from one-half to five 
hours in the individual one or all of the following symptoms: an increase 
in motor activity, a feeling of excitement, mental confusion, 
disorientation, crowding of perception, elementary visual illusions and 
hallucinations, euphoria and talkativeness. In addition to these symptoms, 
numerous subjective experiences occur, such as increased speed of 
thought processes, a feeling of intellectual brilliance, change in time 
perception, various somatic feelings, dizziness, hunger, a feeling of 
swelling of the head, lightness of the extremities, a sensation of walking 
on air, lengthening of the limbs and sexual illusions. More often sex 
excitement consists

68

in the fact that the possible sexual objects in his environment 
become extraordinarily desirable. There is abundant evidence in our 
clinical and experimental material to show that the stimulus for sexual 
interest and activity derives from the aesthetic enhancement of objects 
in the environment. It is not so much a matter of increased potency on the 
part of the user as increased reaction to sexual fantasies and illusions. 
One of our patients said: "I saw black and white women lying in bed with 
legs separated, as if expecting men . . . some women in the park with 
nothing on, doing nasty dances, moving their hips. I chased after them." 
Others state women appear amazingly beautiful. Another patient said: "In 
the subway I felt very sexy. I wanted to touch every woman that passed."

The speeded-up physical motility has its counterpart in rapid 
speech. There is a feeling on the part of the individual that he is witty, 
even brilliant; his ideas flow quickly and words come readily to the 
tongue. Conclusions and answers seem to come to mind ready-formed and 
surprisingly clear, without the effort of thinking. This feelings of clarity 
is, of course, spurious. Actually the productions of the intoxicant are hard 
to follow, for when he wishes to explain what he has thought there is

69

only confusion. The rapid flow of ideas gives a subjective 
impression of brilliance of thought and observation. The sense of 
increased speed of thinking apparently has an effect on memory - hence 
the confusion that appears on trying to recall what was thought during the 
intoxication.

The smoker finds it pleasant to be with others and to impart his 
experiences to them. This is reflected in the fact that Marihuana is 
ordinarily smoked at parties or in groups. It is felt that this need for a 
social setting is a reaction to an inner anxiety arising from the threat of 
bodily destruction implied in somatic illusions induced by Marihuana In 
the ordinary case of smoking Marihuana, especially with one who is used 
to the drug, this threat becomes converted to euphoria which develops to 
uncontrollable fits of laughter. Nevertheless inquiry shows that almost 
every smoker is aware of definite uneasiness at the outset of the 
intoxication. The description from smokers in Harlem and from 
experimental subjects agrees on this point. In the words of a user of two 
years' standing, initiates "shrink together, feel tight inside and get 
frightened." After they smoke it more than once, the reality of these 
frightening somatic illusions becomes less. In occasional instances, and 
these are the cases

70

which are apt to come to medical attention, the fear of death, of insanity, 
of bodily deformity and of bodily dissolution are startling. These patients 
are tense, nervous, frightened, they may develop a state of panic. Often 
suicide or assaultive acts are the result of these emotional states. The 
anxiety state is so common in patients admitted to the hospital for 
uncomplicated Marihuana psychosis, that it can be considered part of the 
intoxication syndrome.

Notes taken on experimental subjects who were psychologically 
trained illustrate these points:

Subject l. Two cigarettes were smoked within 40 minutes. 
Immediately after the second a feeling of lightness in vertex of head was 
felt. Head was expanding; there was a feeling of mild excitement. Now the 
head felt heavy and there was a definite feeling of lengthening in the legs 
and a tension in the back muscles of the thigh. Head felt alternately light 
and heavy. There was a sensation as though the top of the head were lifted 
with about four inch increase in height, accompanied by optic images of 
skulls and skeletons. Feeling of the arms rising up in the air.
Subject was aware of a feeling of confusion. Suddenly he saw 
images of legs and arms in a dissecting

71

room which were terrifying.
Subject 2. "I felt a little euphoric at first, but with the first draw 
my heart feels faster, my eyes a little heavier. I feel myself perspiring all 
over, and shaking. I can feel a slight dizziness. I feel weak; the dizziness 
has left and I am perspiring (Asked to walk around the room. Refuses to do 
so and becomes negativistic).
On looking back I remembered that I had sexual thoughts during the 
time of the experiment. Time seems to pass in a peculiar way, there being 
a combination of fastness and slowness. I took my first inhalation a few 
minutes after 9 and when I looked at the clock and saw it was 10 after 9. I 
was very much surprised because it seemed like hours. The whole 
experiment seems now as if it lasted much longer than it did. Walking 
home I walked slowly in front of oncoming cars and felt a sense of 
recklessness connected with not being able to walk faster and not caring."

It is remarkable how much anxiety is developed when one looks for 
experimental subjects among laymen. The drug is popularly supposed to 
release aggressive and sexual impulses beyond the point of control; it is 
also regarded as being habit-forming. The legendary history and social 
connotation of hashish smoking may help to de-

72

velop in those who have had no experience with the drug, a series of 
anxieties masking sexual fantasies and aggressive impulses. This has 
come almost to the point of mass hysteria. Some public officials are 
unwilling to allow the use of Marihuana cigarettes for experimentation 
purposes, on the ground that it may be "immoral," tending to foster the 
development of drug addiction among the public. This frequent anxiety 
concerning Cannabis may have as its source the feeling of dissolution and 
other somatic changes induced in smokers which is communicated 
somehow to the non-smoking public.

In clinical material as indicated, Marihuana effects may range from 
mild intoxications to transitory psychoses which require psychiatric aid. 
The effects vary and not all the symptoms occur in every case. Illustrative 
of the Marihuana psychosis with anxiety reactions, and somatic sensory 
distortions:
A 31 year old white man, admitted March 27, 1934, with a history of 
having smoked just one cigarette. On admission the patient was depressed, 
retarded, apprehensive. He admitted smoking Marihuana. Was oriented and 
memory showed no defects. Physical examination was negative. The 
patient states, "My hand began to feel blue all of a sudden. I felt like 
laughing and I felt

73

funny in my head. it was the queerest feeling I ever had. I felt like I was 
kind of fainting away like. I sweat and then IÕd get kind of chilly. I got the 
scare of my life. I thought I was going to die and everything else. I knew 
what was happening all the time. I thought my hands were beginning to get 
blue. My throat began to get kind of dry. It was a little better than getting 
drunk. I did not want to step down from the curbÑit seemed to be so high. I 
was sitting down and was afraid to get up." Patient improved and on the 
second day was less apprehensive, was pleasant and cheerful. He was 
discharged as recovered, after two days.

This case demonstrates visual illusions, which recall the 
megalopsia (perceiving objects larger than they are), and more common 
micropsia, which has been reported experimentally and clinically. It is 
this type of illusion, induced by hashish, that may have been the basis for 
the story of Aladdin who saw the tremendous genie emerge from his lamp 
spout in the Arabian Nights' tale.

A 32 year old Irish-American, admitted September 17, 1937, with a 
history of smoking Marihuana cigarettes two hours prior to admission. He 
felt dizzy, wanted to commit suicide by jumping out of windows, bumping 
head on the wall, floor, etc. On admission was uneasy, ap-

74

prehensive, impulsive. Said, "I feel sick. I'm going through hell. I saw 
trucks coming at me getting larger and I wanted to open the door of the 
cab and jump out." He was discharged as improved in his own custody 
about 12 hours after admission.

A common type of intoxication is indicated in the following case:

A 38 year old Negro, admitted April 13, 1934, with history that he 
had run out of the house poorly clad and that he had smoked "artificial" 
cigarettes. He was confused on admission, was dazed in appearance and 
disoriented. He described a lightness of the head, dizziness and seeing 
star-shaped figures before his eyes after smoking a "doped" cigarette. He 
was apprehensive on examination. On the second or third day after 
admission, apprehension had disappeared and he was discharged as 
recovered, being clear, composed, but unable to account for his earlier 
excitement.

It is not uncommon to find the history of admixture of other drugs or 
alcohol in Cannabis intoxication. Frequently alcohol intensifies the 
Cannabis symptomatology.

A 27 year old man of old American stock, admitted on June 18, 1933, 
at his own request. He had been a chronic alcoholic and displayed definite 
evidences of psycho-

75

pathic makeup; had marked inferiority because of his eyes and body 
structure. On admission he appeared to be apprehensive, a little excited, 
spoke coherently and relevantly. His experiences were rather clearly set 
forth--"I was down on the water-front. A fellow gave me an Egyptian 
cigarette to smoke . . . it was hashish. About an hour afterwards I began to 
see things. I'd see things flying in the air. This made me laugh and I'd laugh 
at things not worth laughing at. Then I began to see green and other colors 
flowing before my eyes. Then things got black. I imagined people were 
following me and I screamed in my hotel and got kicked out. I still see red 
lines in front of my eyes and other different colors all stuck together. 
Then I began to hear bells that would get fainter and fainter and then start 
again. Imagined someone was after me all evening. I thought I heard 
footsteps and saw people ducking in and out of doorways behind. me. At 
the time I said to myself maybe it all affect my eyes. I seen a big splotch 
in front of me Ñ it was scarletÑ very bright, exceptionally bright. It 
contracted, then faded away. I knew all the time it was due to hashish."

The second group comprises cases of toxic psychosis due to or 
initiated by Cannabis. There may be other

76

toxic agents present, as alcohol, other drugs, infective or other 
endogenous elements. Disordered sensorium, excitement and agitation, 
retardation, blocking with emotional rigidity, hallucinations, sensations 
of somatic change, delusional experiences may appear in the toxic 
psychosis. The psychosis lasts from weeks to months. Often the mental 
picture crystallizes out into a schizophrenic or manic depressive 
psychosis after several weeks or months (see paradigm). At the onset .of 
the illness what can be considered characteristic Cannabis symptom-
atology is discernible. As the underlying functional psychosis develops, 
the toxic elements recede.

A boy of 16, admitted February 27, 1934, with statement from the 
family that for two months he had been depressed, apprehensive, worried, 
scratching his hands in a nervous manner, prayed constantly. He 
complained that somebody read his thoughts. On admission was well 
developed and showed no physical signs. Patient was agitated, depressed, 
talked constantly in a bizarre manner about the devil influencing him, etc. 
Said: "I felt lightly when I was walking - as if I weighed only 10 pounds. I 
felt like running my whole body was light. I felt like jumping. As if I was 
walking on air. I felt happy. Then I saw yellow lights all around me. I saw 
blue and green

77

too. The colors were more bright than usual. There are just masses of 
colors - sometimes I see a black cross with everything red behind it. That 
means there is a God. He is helping me. The devil knows the evil thoughts 
in me." This agitated condition improved and patient was discharged about 
3 weeks after admission as a psychosis due to drugs; acute hallucinatory 
episode.

Patient was readmitted August 1st of that year with a picture of a 
depression with schizoid features. On this admission there were no 
evidences whatever of the sensory illusions and somatic feelings that he 
had previously when he smoked Marihuana. He was transferred to the state 
hospital, where he remained four years, being diagnosed as Paranoid 
Schizophrenia with Catatonic Features. There he was restless and 
overactive. He had a marked push of speech, expressed ideas of reference 
and religious delusions and was manneristic. Said: "I figured the devil was 
trying to pull me away from God so I cut a cross on my arm. Physically I 
am the same, but mentally I am another person. ...I feel that people 
influence me by touching me - like injecting dope." Later he was 
manneristic, grimaced, was untidy, repeated practically all questions 
asked, answered briefly and usually vaguely and would say, "I don' know 
exactly," or "I don't

78

know." He remained dull, apathetic, indifferent and mute until the present 
time.

The personality factor is of undoubted importance in this group of 
individuals. After the toxic state passed off in these patients in whom the 
intoxication reaches deeply enough into the personality, a basic psy-chotic 
state developed. At times, the toxic features are in the background, the 
personality reactions being pre-dominant. What the inner relationship is 
between Cannabis and the onset of a functional psychotic state is not 
always clear. From our observation, the inner reaction to somatic 
sensation seems to be vital. Such reactions consisted of panic states 
which disappeared as soon as the stimulus (effects of the drug) faded. It 
is generally known in psychopathology that when the perception of our 
own bodily sensations is disturbed we are liable to be profoundly affected 
psychologically. Disturbances in perception of the body-model 
(Korperschema), which is built up of kinesthetic, tactile, visual and other 
stimuli, and integrated into the core of the personality, elicit some type 
of reaction. Such disturbances act as a blow to the ego, invoking defensive 
reactions of anxiety, apprehension, projection, etc., which approach or are 
schizophrenic in their clinical manifestations. The

79

following case illustrates these points:

A 20 year-old colored man admitted February 22, 1936. He is said by 
his mother to have been "nervous" for some time, said he wanted to die, 
wanted to kill himself. Prior to admission his mother caught him with a 
bottle of lysol. He had been depressed and despondent. He was a boy of 
superior intelligence as measured by the Army Alpha test. On admission he 
stated that he used Marihuana for several months and during this time he 
had heard people talking about him They said' "Oh, what an ugly boy. How 
mean-looking he is." For four months, August to October, 1935, he smoked 
three to four cigarettes a day until he began to feel ill. At first Marihuana 
made him happy. Then he felt that he made a peculiar noise in his throat; 
ate once a day; was unable to sleep; and experienced auditory 
hallucinations. The hallucinations started four months ago and increased 
gradually. He thought his face was changing. He looked thin, mean, and 
ugly; he became self-conscious. He felt that every-one in the neighborhood 
knew it. He stated at times he seemed speeded up, but his mind was keenly 
alert with the development of the ideas of reference, he became self-
reproachful, apprehensive and fearful.

He was then transferred to a state hospital on March

80

13, 1936, where he stated his hallucinations had disappeared and his 
emotional reaction improved. After three months he was discharged to his 
home; within five months he was readmitted to Bellevue Hospital, where 
he had gone in a state of panic, and from where he was re-committed to a 
state hospital. He was tense, uneasy, still retained ideas of reference, 
acted oddly at home apparently in response to his delusions. Diagnosis on 
second admission to State Hospital was Dementia Praecox Paranoid Type, 
which was made about two years after the onset of the original illness.

Some cases showed the manic-depressive reactions, but these were 
in the minority. It is perhaps to be expected that schizophrenic-like 
psychoses are more common because individuals who take to drugs have 
some deep inadequacy to start with. The cyclothymic personality is less 
prone to require the drug.

A man of 28 who was brought to the hospital by his mother on 
February 13, 1938, with the history that he had been smoking reefers for 
some time. A year ago he had an episode, was not hospitalized and 
improved from it. On admission patient was confused, restless, apprehen-
sive. He engaged in violent daydreamings. At times he appeared to be 
reacting to hallucinations. He said he

81

"had a big head." He became talkative, euphoric, elated and overactive 
after a day or so. He said: "The best thing for me to do is. . . you look fine. 
I've got to look like you . I know what it is . . . when a Buick and a Packard 
get together." His speech was distinctly flighty, his behavior panicky; was 
constantly restless. Would cry, sing, talk.

He was transferred to a state hospital on February 24, 1938. There 
his condition persisted and he became somewhat depressed, but showed 
promise of recovery a few months after admission. Diagnosis at State 
Hospital was Manic Depressive Psychosis, Manic Type.

Mixed reactions merge with the toxic psychoses. These reactions 
vary clinically, some occurring in chronic alcoholics, some in 
schizophrenics and some in psychopathic personalities, and in all of them 
Marihuana usage was a factor. It can be clearly seen that aside from the 
direct toxic effect of the drug, the personality of the patient plays a 
tremendous role in psychotic states following Marihuana usage.

A Cuban, age 34, who was admitted on March 6, 1938, to Bellevue 
Hospital. He had been taking Marihuana for one and a half years. He had 
jumped in front of a south-bound subway train without injury. He was very 
depressed, dull, lackadaisical, despondent in attitude.

82

He was definitely under productive but still strongly suicidal. He 
described taking one cigarette every day of Marihuana for a year and a half 
because it took his worries away. For some time he had been conscious 
that people were looking at him He feels that his body is heavy all the 
time. Sometimes he hears deceased persons talking to him. He sees lights 
at times. At times he sees a photograph of a strange person.

His friend corroborated the history, stating that he had been in this 
depressed condition for 3-4 years. He had a work-house sentence for 2-3 
months for Marihuana. He was transferred to a state hospital March 18, 
1938. At that time he was dull, preoccupied, but lost his hallucinatory and 
delusional trends. The State Hospital diagnosed him as Schizophrenia, 
Hebephrenic Type (?) and he was released after two months.

In some cases the drug makes relatively little difference in the 
content of the psychosis. It is for the clinician to determine how much 
Marihuana influences the clinical picture. In South Africa, where dagga 
(equivalent of Marihuana) smoking is very widespread, a diagnosis of 
Marihuana psychosis is made in any "toxic psychosis where there are very 
good grounds for assuming addiction to dagga smoking." It is felt that 
there should

83

be more exact criteria, as we outlined above, for a diagnosis of 
Marihuana psychosis, by which we mean the presence of disordered 
sensorium, characteristic colored visual hallucinations, time changes, 
subjective and somatic feelings. One is apt to over-estimate the place of 
Marihuana in the causation of a psychotic picture.

A white man of 28, admitted January 23, 1938, to Bellevue Hospital 
with a history that he was in a state hospital in Arizona for 3 months 
about two years ago and one in Indiana for 9 months four years ago. "I was 
smoking this Marihuana weed (at time of admission to State Hospital in 
Arizona). I ran around the desert for a time, ran out nights and one day 
knocked on a door and told a woman I was Dillinger. I tried to see how 
much water I could walk in. I was just like hypnotized and walking in my 
sleep. Sometimes I feel like something's controlling me. Sometimes I feel 
just like I'm talking to somebody with my mouth closed. I just ask them a 
question with my brain and they answer. Sometimes it's a man, sometimes 
it's a woman's voice; it just works in my temple. I think it's imagination. 
It's just like a dream. People stare at me. Sometimes I see different 
colors. I had that years ago - just like a light coming towards me; it's not 
a light, it's an arc.

84

His effect was flat and he was dejected and slow-speaking. Showed 
blocking and evasiveness on. sex experiences. Had ideas of reference and 
persecutory ideas.

He was transferred to a state hospital, where he was noted as being 
preoccupied, under productive and somewhat dissociated. He stated that he 
had some sort of seizures that were not really fits, but that when he had 
them if he had a sword he would not mind cutting everybody's head off. He 
also believed if anybody got killed near the place where he worked he 
would be blamed for it. Said that when he looks in bright lights he sees 
visions like all sorts of different colors, blues, whites, and these seem to 
blind him. A diagnosis was made of Dementia Praecox, Paranoid Type, and 
he was still in State Hospital after five months.

In psychopathic personalities, those with deep inferiorities, use of 
drugs is a method of supporting the ego. In these cases Marihuana does not 
always produce the desirable effect. Apparently it is not strong enough to 
affect the problems which have involved deeper layers of the personality. 
Such individuals adopt heroin or morphine very soon after a short 
experience with Marihuana. The experience of drug addicts seen at the 
Court of General Sessions confirms this. Persons addicted to

85

heroin, morphine, cocaine or opium never return to Cannabis. Such 
individuals are admittedly psychopathic in that they need an increment of 
drug to make their lives tolerable, In the next case, the use of Cannabis 
represented the attempt of the patient to overcome his sexual inadequacy. 
In this respect the social psychology of the drug is a factor, since 
Marihuana is popularly supposed to free sexual inhibitions.

A white man, age 23, admitted to Bellevue Hospital on March 31, 
1938, with a history that he felt unworthy and thought he had a venereal 
disease. He held ideas of infidelity against his wife and was assaultive. 
Threw a four month old baby across a room. He turned gas jets on. On 
admission he was rambling, talkative, evasive, depressed, self-absorbed 
and had somatic complaints.

He said: 'I was sentenced to the Workhouse for 4 months for smoking 
Marihuana. I knew then I was not satisfying my wife and I thought it might 
help. A year ago some friends gave me the weed, I smoked several. I felt 
calm and liked to listen to music - very happy - exhilarating feeling - 
that's all."

In the hospital he was talkative, discussed his problem in detail and 
showed some depression, which improved. The infidelity ideas and his 
sexual inadequacies concerned him most. He was transferred to a state 
hospital with a

86

diagnosis of Psychosis with Psychopathic Personality; Cannabis usage a 
factor.

Often Cannabis intoxication represents a stage in the incipiency of a 
psychosis. The patient who is developing a functional psychosis strives in 
the incipient stage to overcome the unconsciously perceived difficulties. 
In this sense Marihuana usage represents a healthy reaction tendency, even 
though the mechanism may be unknown to the patient. The next case 
illustrated this problem. A boy who had made a successful adjustment on a 
moderate level of social attainment began to show schizoid behavior 
shortly after the usage of Marihuana. The process continued to a psychotic 
state. What role did the drug play? Could the psychosis have begun without 
the drug? Was the use of Cannabis the patient's attempt to cure his 
developing psychosis? These are problems needing careful judgment and 
study and wide clinical experience.

A young Negro, 20, admitted October 2, 1936 to Bellevue Hospital 
with a history of having been dull, indifferent for some time. Insisted 
upon keeping the windows closed, would not leave the house, but denied he 
heard voices. Would masturbate openly and made sign with fingers, and 
actions were decidedly peculiar. Mother states she caught him. smoking a 
sweet-smelling

87

cigarette with a white man and soon after got a history from his 
playmates that he had been smoking Marihuana cigarettes for a long time.

Observation in the hospital confirmed his withdrawn, retarded 
attitude. Psychometric gave an IQ. of 75 with rating of Borderline to Dull 
Normal Intelligence. Was pre-occupied on ward; difficult to obtain his 
attention; evasive; offered many excuses for closing window and putting 
out lights. About 10 days after admission he appeared a little more alert 
and cheerful. He was discharged in custody of mother as Incipient 
Schizophrenia (?) or Psychoneurosis, Reactive State, on October 13, 1936.

He was readmitted a year later, October 15, 1937. At that time 
mother gave a statement that for past year, since he left hospital, he had 
been dull, staying in the house in a "deep study." He seems to listen; does 
not say anything'. At one time he beat up an old man in the house who, he 
said, called him names. Prior to admission he had attacked a woman for no 
apparent reason. Sleeps day and night. Often looks as if he is in a dream, 
Changed personality reactions for more than a year. For two weeks 
distinctly worse.

On admission he was sluggish, dull and lethargic, spoke in a quiet, 
low voice, showed empty affect, but was

88

intact in intellectual functions, memory, comprehension, orientation. He 
was transferred to the State Hospital on October 20, 1937, where he was 
evasive and dull. He showed no interest in the surroundings and did not 
mingle with the other patients. He expressed mild ideas of persecution and 
of electricity, was evasive and suspicious. He said some people called him 
bad names across the street. Believes that an attempt was made to harm 
him. "I sometimes have a funny feeling in my legs (electricity)." Their 
diagnostic impression included the possibility of Dementias-Praecox, 
Paranoid Type.

Gradually he acquired an interest and socialized with other patients. 
At all times he was neat and tidy in personal appearance and habits. He 
improved after five months and was ready for parole.

Now, so much for the psychopathic. We now come to the criminology.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I thought we would cover that in another 
subject.

We will now adjourn for lunch and come back at 1:30.

(Thereupon at 12:20 oÕclock p.m., a recess was declared, the 
conference to resume discussions at 1:30 p.m.)

89

AFTERNOON SESSION.

The conference was resumed at 1:30 o'clock p.m., pursuant to the 
taking of a recess at noon.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Gentlemen, the Conference will be in 
order. We may very well start with the general discussion on the 
pharmacological phases of the problem, and you can direct your questions 
to Dr. Munch, Dr. Loewe, or Dr. Bromberg.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, I would like to ask you, in respect to the 
statement made by Dr. Walton that Cannabis has been used as a relief 
during labor in the Far East, are you familiar with that general picture?

DR. MUNCH: Yes. I think that the product that is actually used there is 
not Cannabis itself, but one of these peculiar mixtures of datura and 
opium and hashish and other things.

Some of the reports refer to the women smoking the cigarettes for a 
period in labor, but they are not in agreement with the information I have 
gotten from the Mexicans or out in Nevada, for example, where they have 
tried it and found it of no value.

On the isolated tissues the solutions of the drug have no effect, or 
have a very mild, quieting action.

If I remove the alcohol, they have little effect,

90

which means that the active principle is not sufficiently soluble in water 
to produce an action. So that I do not believe the action is very definitely 
therapeutic. It is more psychological, I believe, than it is physiological.

MR. WOLLNER: Who is Willis? One of them refers to the fact that 
Willis recommends its use in tedious labor where the patient is restless.

DR. MUNCH: Let me look at my copy of this book. 

MR. WOLLNER: It is on page 156.

DR. MUNCH: Did you say "Willis", Mr. Wollner?

MR. WOLLNER: Yes. On page 156, "EFFECTS DURING LABOR". It starts 
out, "Willis recommended".

DR. MUNCH: Willis has written a book on obstetrics and gynecology, 
but I cannot give you the reference to it right now.

MR. WOLLNER: All right.

DR. MUNCH: But he is one of the authors in that field. However, the 
work I was referring to more particularly was done by Watt (?) and 
Breyer-Brandwijh, which [sic] I believe is the co-author of the publication 
on poisonous plants in South Africa.
I have had correspondence with Watt along that line.

91

He refers to it in the last paragraph there after South Africa.

MR. WOLLNER: The reason I ask you that question is because of Dr. 
Bromberg's remarks, which I interpreted as being indicative of the 
production of a hypersensitivity. Am I wrong in that, Dr. Bromberg? 

DR. BROMBERG: A hypersensitivity?

MR. WOLLNER: On the part of an individual who uses Marihuana; that 
is, an increased agility.

DR. BROMBERG: The effects I refer to are on a motor activity. You 
refer to those, I presume? 

MR. WOLLNER: Yes.

DR. BROMBERG: By which we mean the promptness to move either 
aimlessly or purposefully; that is, in acute intoxication the smoker is apt 
to dance around and move or wave his arms, or go through movements that 
are more rapid than he would move ordinarily; move his chair, knock it 
across the room, talk to people, show a general output of activity.

Many of those prisoners whom I have contacted state that they 
rather slow up or would rather be quiet during this period. There are two 
effects, in other words.

The hyperactivity is not universal. The great, ex-

92

treme activity results in assault, throwing people around. This is similar 
to what you see in certain types of alcohol intoxication, so-called 
pathological intoxication, where a few drinks set a man off into a 
rampage, breaking things, throwing things around, and fighting.
I think maybe men come in on that more than women because of the 
basic physiological pattern. They are more active anyhow. This refers to 
women, does it not? 

MR. WOLLNER: Yes, sir.

DR. BROMBERG: Certainly the effects are not uniform and cannot be 
counterbalanced.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, regarding these 31 admissions 
out of 100,000, I think it would be interesting to know just what period 
they cover. Are they of recent origin, or are they scattered pretty well 
throughout the years?
The reason that I bring that up is that the mental hospital at Burma 
showed, with the increased illicit traffic in Marihuana, the total 
admissions of insanity cases rose from .87 to 4.35%. I am wondering 
whether we can expect an increase in such cases, and also whether these 
31 cases are more or less of recent origin.

93

DR. BROMBERG: I can answer that by saying that the admissions 
already in the past four years of this type of Marihuana insanity is almost 
twice that which it was during the first four years of our observation, 
that is, three years of our observation period.
Of course, you can realize that many other cases go to private 
hospitals which pass off without regulatory medical treatment, and there 
are other factors so great that I would not put much reliance on these 
figures. I merely give them to you as true data so far as we have available.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have been getting some reports from 
various sections of the country showing cases of alleged insanity due to 
Marihuana which have been brought to light.
For instance, there were interesting developments in a case in 
Findlay, Ohio, concerning a fifteen-year-old boy who showed signs of 
being insane.
When asked about his condition he made statements that he had been 
smoking cigarettes, and an investigation developed the information that 
there were two defendants, who were brothers, who were in charge of a 
playground, and they had been selling drugs that is, Marihuana cigarettes, 
to boys around there; and we found about sixteen pounds concealed above a 
garage owned by them. These fellows had

94

stopped selling the drug, because they noticed signs of the boys acting 
queer, and they became frightened. They were particularly alarmed 
because of what they thought was an unusual appetite for the drug.
We have a questionnaire whereby we ask Marihuana users involved in 
our cases, all sorts of questions. As a matter of fact, I would like now to 
revise that questionnaire, after what I have heard here.
One-fourth of those users when asked what effect the drug has on 
them, say, "It gives me a good appetite." "The first cigarette makes me 
feel hungry." They become hungry after they smoke, have a heavy and 
exceptionally good appetite. That is their answer without prompting. Yet 
that question does not appear in the questionnaire.
We ask them --- of course, we have to take their word for what they 
say --- whether they notice any permanent physical or mental effects, and 
they make statements which confirm the opinions of Dr. Munch and Dr. 
Bromberg. The answers are:
"I believe it has affected my nerves."
"I can not keep my mind on one thing long enough to think clearly."
"Loss of memory"; "Very bad on nerves"; "Produces twisted thoughts"; 
"Affects my brain"; "Dulls my head."

95

"Causes me to become deaf".
"I think IÔm more intelligent."
"Makes me tired".  "Hard to think"  "Headache and weakness".  
"Seemingly dulls senses"; and so on. 
Then the question is asked:  "What effects do you obtain from 
smoking Marihuana?" I think most of the answers confirm what has been 
said about the distortion of space, time, vision and hearing.
The auditory sensibilities are affected.
We are running into a great deal of cases which have to do with 
illicit traffic among musicians.
The next question is,  "Have you acquired tolerance?" Quite a number 
of the users have developed a craving for Marihuana.  Some of them stop 
after smoking few cigarettes, and there is no sign here that they increase 
the number that they smoke in a day.
Some of them vary between one cigarette and twenty cigarettes a 
day. Others have smoked it once; some have smoked it for ten years.

MR. WOLLNER:  I was wondering whether it would not be better, 
unless there are other specific questions, to postpone this portion of the 
Conference, which relates to bio-assay, which pertains to a chemist, 
because all of those questions are related, and go on with the rest of

96

the program.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: All right, unless there are questions.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, do you wish to say some thing?

DR. LOEWE: Among other things, I have tried Marihuana's action on a 
monkey, and I went to it with great hopes because I thought really that the 
psychic action would come out in this patient.
The observations were that the monkey reacts like the dog, and is 
one more of the few laboratory species which really show the ataxia 
action.
The other observation was that the monkey required higher doses per 
kilogram body weight than the dog, which was somewhat unexpected, and 
that all of the lower doses to which I have climbed up through the ratio of 
higher doses did not show anything which indicated a psychic action.
The monkeys do not show this type of abnormality which occurs in 
Dr. Bromberg's material.
MR. WOLLNER: What is the relation in the dosage per kilogram of 
weight of dog and human being?

DR. LOEWE: The dog dosage per kilogram of weight and the human 
being per kilogram of weight, are fairly

97

close. The higher doses used in humans are capable of showing the 
slightest ataxia symptoms, which would point to the fact that the dosage 
is almost the same.

DR. MATCHETT: This ataxia is never apparent in humans at all?

DR. LOEWE: I have no experience; I never saw it. 

DR. BROMBERG: I never saw it either.

MR. WOLLNER: Have you any observations about ataxia symptoms 
comparable to those in dogs as to humans?

DR. BROMBERG: No; but I have never seen a large enough quantity, 
certainly not the tincture or the fluid extract.

Dr. Munch can perhaps answer that.

DR. MUNCH: I have given doses up to twice that re-cognized, but I have 
not noticed ataxia in students.

DR. LOEWE: There is one factor which, of course, is important, and it 
is a fact which we notice from tobacco smoking, and that is that the 
dosage in the form of the cigarette is probably high enough to produce 
great ataxic symptoms in humans by way of the administration of inhala-
tion.

DR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Dr. Bromberg, clinically, whether 
there is a direct physiological addiction to this; that is, are withdrawal 
symptoms produced or do

98

you think it is purely a psychic addiction?

DR. BROMBERG: My idea of habituation on this matter is different, and 
there happen to be several, and we should have the thing clarified.
Habituation must rest on three cases, two of them being habit 
forming.
The first are the symptoms appearing of withdrawal of the habit 
forming drug.
The second is that the patient develops tolerance. 
The third is that because he needs more drug he gets the pleasure of 
addiction, and all medicine agrees that there must be withdrawal.
A morphine addict becomes intolerant of withdrawal. He has 
abdominal pains and various symptoms. When morphine is given he feels 
better. And that is the basis of a well known treatment.
Secondly, there are the people who take increasing doses to feel 
well. Those two are well acknowledged criteria.
In the New York County jail, the physician in charge thinks he sees 
withdrawal symptoms, but the offenders are not allowed to discuss the 
offense with anyone except counsel. They say they did smoke it, or they 
did not. You do not know whether the symptoms are tied up with the

99

drug.

So, I dare say that there are no clear withdrawal symptoms. The 
thing is not settled. Patients come in after being cut off without the drug.
The third is addiction of pleasure-loving, and in that category comes 
smoking and colorful music and things of that nature. You can say that one 
has to have pleasure after he becomes addicted to luxury, and that can be 
looked upon as a valid psychiatric observation.
So I would stop there and say that we can say that in the absence of 
other evidence, that it is essentially hedonistic addiction.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, you mentioned in your experiment on dogs 
that you had injected some of these extracts, but, nevertheless, in most of 
the experiments that had been previously done, I gather, the drug had been 
taken orally. Of course, we know the stuff is smoked.
Your introduction of injection as a method of administration raises 
the question in my mind as to whether we might, at some future date, 
anticipate the use of that on humans, in this way? Is there any possibility 
of this sort? Similar to that which obtains in heroin, for example?

DR. LOEWE: Only after the isolation in pure form

100

I would say, because, at the present time, by use. of the extracts it 
will not be an element in the whole picture to introduce it by intravenous 
injection. It has to be injected in alcohol solution, and a slight injection 
introduces a bad local infection, pain, and so on.

MR. WOLLNER: Why were you impelled to use it as an injection as a 
method of administration, rather than giving it to your dogs orally, Dr. 
Loewe?

DR. LOEWE: It goes faster. In view of the long period of latency, it is 
much more convenient to use it intravenously injected, because the peak 
of the curve is reached sooner.

MR. WOLLNER: Would you conclude from that that on dogs, for 
example, as a medium for standardization, that they are not as radically 
different when the stuff is in-jected as compared to when it is 
administered orally?

DR. LOEWE: Probably that is true, but only to an inconsiderable 
extent. In a slighter extent the variations have been reported by various 
examinators [sic] after oral administration.

MR. WOLLNER: Will you recommend it as the preferred procedure for 
bio-assay.

DR. LOEWE: I am not sure that I should give the preference to the 
intravenous way. I have to collect more

101

experiences.

DR. MATCHETT: Are the effects otherwise identical? 

DR. LOEWE: Identical.

MR. WOLLNER: The curve is more rapid; I mean you achieve the peak of 
the curve more rapidly. 

DR. LOEWE: Comparatively more rapidly. Beginning after only twenty 
minutes, and reaching the peak after half an hour or an hour.

MR. WOLLNER: Your experiments with mice were continued under the 
same circumstances?

DR. LOEWE: No. As to mice, they were injected orally only.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We can now go on to the sociological 
phases.
In 88 users there were 86 males and only 2 females. I do not know if 
that holds true generally. We might have got off the rails on the selection, 
but that is what those figures show.
There were 47 white, 20 colored, 15 Latin Americans. The age, of 
course, is much younger than among opium users. Most of the users were 
between 17 and 35. The greatest number was between 21 and 25.
I believe that was true of a survey made in New York City of the 
users.

102

MR. SMITH: We had 100 arrests there between January 1st and 
October 1st that ran: 99 Negro, 60 white, and 1 yellow; and the nativity, 
(and this nativity includes New York City and up-state New York:) 5 
Mexican, 1 Chinese, 32 Puerto Rican, 2 Greek:, some from South America, 
Cuba, Panama, and other places with 130 native born.
Then, in addition, I have 12 other cases, which to me were more 
interesting, because those persons who were held for crimes other than 
possession, and they ran such as unlawful entry, 3 for grand larceny, in 
addition to their possession; 1 for grand larceny, who admits he is a user.
Of course, the other possessor cases probably were users, but they 
are charged with possession. One with felonious assault with a pistol and 
possession; One, exposure of person; one felonious assault, both users; and 
another, felonious assault with possession; and one a wayward minor who 
admits, in addition to using Marihuana, that he is using heroin; one with 
assault and robbery, and one who was a policy peddler. They were held on 
other charges, rather than on mere possession charges.

MR. WOLLNER: What is the distribution in sexes, there, Mr. Smith? 

MR. SMITH: I have not the age nor sex distribution on those.

103

In at least four cases up-state we can show a definite connection 
with prostitution. In one we had a good report, not proven, but a good 
report that the Negro who was in possession was also running a school, 
teaching youngsters how to smoke Marihuana. Actually, we are not certain 
about the facts as to that, but that is the report that has been current 
with that individual. 

	COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Do you have anything on occupations 
of the users? 
MR. SMITH: We have four as musicians, two as farmers, and those 
two farmers were actually growing Marihuana on their farms. 
Many of them state "unemployed". But where most of those that 
report unemployed are laborers, they usually are associated with 
prostitution, policy, and some of the allied types of minor grade crimes.
 Prostitution, to me, seemed the most evident connection.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our 88, the occupation runs anywhere 
from bartender to unemployed. There are probably 50 different 
occupations, musicians are second to laborers,-of the 88.

The rest were distributed throughout the various

104

occupations.

MR. SMITH: I can give you a breakdown on that section. I have it here 
in another portion of my data.
There were 5 women arrested as sellers, and 8 women arrested for 
possession, and 147 males arrested for possession, and 7 for selling.

MR. WOLLNER: About 10 per cent. 

MR. SMITH: Yes, sir.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our geographical distribution, we show 
the larger number of these around New York; a few in the New England 
areas; a few in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, several in the Middle 
Atlantic States, about 5 in the South, Kentucky and Tennessee, four; 
Michigan-Ohio, 13, Michigan-Ohio is second to New York.
And then they string out through the rest of the States, with 
California probably third.

MR. SMITH: In States with equal population ratios, as to the 
metropolitan district, as against up-state New York, our arrests for 
Marihuana violations in the State, excluding New York City, are about 10 
per cent; 15 cases, actually, against 160.
They probably will vary, though, as to the development of 
prosecution and apprehension, as in the various up-state cities they are 
just beginning to realize in the

105

last year that Marihuana is a problem, and the figures for 1938 will be 
higher than 1937. I expect 1939 will again be higher in up-state New York, 
so that that ratio of about 10 percent should rise.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Bromberg, you were about to start on 
the sociological phases. Will you give us the benefit of your views on 
that?

DR. BROMBERG: The material that I have collected comes from the 
Court of General Sessions. This is the criminal court of New York City.
Our material is limited to New York County, although it must be 
remembered that the courts clientele comes from many sections of the 
country.
We must also note that there are many racial types in our material. 
This is important, because the British investigators have noted in India 
that Cannabis does not bring out the motor excitement or hysterical 
symptoms among Anglo-Saxon users that occurs among natives. There are 
several other difficulties in selecting reliable material, one being the 
dependence on statements from prisoners without opportunity for 
objective tests or other corroborative checks, as in the case of other 
drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine.
During the routine interviews of some 17,000 offend-

106

ers during six and a half years, we have come across several hundred who 
have had direct experience with Cannabis. Their testimony checks with 
experimental results and clinical experiences in regard to 
symptomatology of intoxication, the absence of true addiction, and the 
negative connection with major crime. Especially is this noteworthy 
among sexual offenders, and in cases of assault or murder.
The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press, that 
crime is caused by Marihuana addiction, demand careful scrutiny.
The cases analyzed in this study cover a period of more than six 
years, from 1932 to 1938. Out of over 16,000 prisoners in this six-year 
period, 200 offenders were convicted of drug charges or found to be users 
of drugs, although convicted of other charges, in the Court of General 
Sessions.
Cases of possession for sale are handled in the Court of General 
Sessions which has jurisdiction over felonies. There is no distinction 
made in the indictment in the Court of General Sessions as to the nature 
of the drug sold.

Of this group of 200 drug offenders, 67 were indicated to be users of 
Marihuana in any degree and for any duration of time whether convicted of 
the crime of selling Marihuana or another crime.

107

The remaining 133 offenders were morphine or heroin users.
It is important to note that the only measure of Marihuana usage is 
the statement of the offender. Since statements of use are conceived by 
them to be prejudicial to their interests in court, we meet evasion and 
denial fairly consistently.
Our most reliable source of information is from those not arrested 
for traffic in drugs and questioned in the routine course of psychiatric 
study.
Now, this leaves out thousands of smokers who were never arrested, 
people who were never arrested, and people that we deal with who were 
arrested for major crimes, including the one of selling drugs. Those people 
were all questioned about Marihuana.
Those who were arrested for selling drugs, specifically Marihuana, 
were questioned as to the use of it. Some of those admitted using it, and 
some did not.
All the criminological material that we have has to be taken with a 
very large dose of salt, and they are either convicted by the time we see 
them, or about to be, and are still frightened, and want to keep their fair 
records clean.
The only useful record which we have in which we can

108

throw out and include material as it sounds reasonable to us, and it is 
checked, so far as the use of the sociological aspects of it, and the effect 
of it, and so forth, so that in the General Sessions of Criminal Court the 
87 cases of Marihuana users consisted of 21 whites (native born and 
European extraction), 23 Negroes, 20 Puerto Ricans (some of whom are 
considered to be racial mixtures), 2 Mexicans, and one Negro and Indian 
mixture.
Of the 67 studied, 46 were convicted of possession and sale of 
drugs, and 21 other charges. Among the 21 cases convicted of crimes other 
than the possession of and sale of drugs, were eight charges of burglary, 
five of grand larceny, three of robbery, two of assault, one each of petit 
larceny, forgery, and first degree murder, and none of sexual offenses. 
Burglary, grand larceny, and robbery, then, account for 16 of the 21 cases. 
There were but two sex cases of any description in the history of the 
Marihuana cases, in both of which sodomy occurred as previous offenses. 
In three cases, the individuals were what might be called constant users 
of Marihuana. One of these had commenced to use the Marihuana three 
years previous to the current conviction; another, with a sixteen year 
record, indicated Marihuana, had been used for fifteen years; the third 
referred to his use of Marihuana as

109

"several yearsÓ duration. None of the offenders reported any lasting 
effects from Marihuana. Interrogations as to the habit-forming nature of 
Marihuana were all answered in the negative by the prisoners.
So that in the General Sessions of Criminal Court the 67 people who 
were offenders were involved in selling Marihuana or gave some history of 
using it. Most of those people had previous charges, not including drugs, as 
to being criminals of other types. The largest proportion were not drug 
users.
The next largest number had no previous connection with the 67. 
Fifty had never been arrested for taking any drugs. This was their first 
contact with the court. These were all special cases in the Special 
Sessions Court, which deals with misdemeanors and other cases.
Here, there were 202 cases. Thirteen were there on the first charge 
of any kind, that being a Marihuana charge. Those things do not mean very 
much to me, as they simply give a certain picture, a picture of people 
being picked up and brought in for using Marihuana, and there is not a very 
heavy weighted criminal record behind them. Drug users are not Marihuana 
users in the main.
In the Court of Special Sessions in the same picture, in the same 
six-year period, of approximately 75,000 in-

110

dictments for all crimes, there were 6,000 convictions for possession and 
use of drugs. Since neither the law, the district attorney, nor the police 
department make any distinction between the several kinds of narcotics, 
their arraignments or indictments, in Special Sessions as well as General 
Sessions, there were no figures from which to estimate the number of 
Marihuana users as distinguished from the number of users of other drugs. 
We therefore adopted a system of sampling the 6,000 cases in order to 
arrive at an approximate estimation of the total number of Marihuana users 
who came into conflict with the law. In this sampling, we examined the 
records of l,500 cases, or 25 per cent of the total of 6,000. Of these, 135 
were Marihuana charges. From this, it was estimated that about 540 cases, 
or 9 per cent of all drug cases coming to Special Sessions over a period of 
six years, were users of Marihuana. 
Analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found that 93 had no 
previous record; 8 had a previous drug charge or charges, only; 5 had 
previous charges, including drugs; and 29 had records not including drug 
charges. Among those with longer records, that is, from four to seven 
previous arrests, none showed progression in crime from drugs to other 
crimes.

111

	In considering all the Marihuana cases in both General Sessions 
and Special Sessions Courts, a total of 202 convictions, it is an impressive 
fact that only 30 offenders had been arrested before for drug charges. This 
does not argue very strongly for Marihuana as a  drug that initiates criminal 
careers. 
Where there is a series of crimes committed by one individual, our 
records show that he passes from other forms of crime to the use of drugs. 
Thus, in only three cases out of our series of 67, in which an arrest 
associated with Marihuana was recorded, did the criminal career start with 
the use of Marihuana, and in 7 cases out of 67 criminal activity started 
with other drugs. Ninety per cent of the group is accounted for by those who 
(1) have no criminal record except as drug users, and (2) have a previous 
record from which they turned to drugs This leaves a small minority of 
offenders whose criminal careers started with drugs and went on to other 
crimes like larceny, assault, and so on. As measured by the succession of 
arrests and convictions in the General Sessions cases (our only method of 
estimation), it can be said that drugs generally do not initiate criminal 
careers. Similarly, in Special Sessions, only 8 had previous charges of 
drugs, and 3.7 per cent has previous charges of drugs and other

112

petty crimes. In the vast majority of cases in this group of 135, then, 
earlier usage did not apparently predispose these offenders to crime, even 
that of drug usage. Whether the first offender Marihuana cases go on to 
major crime can only be ascertained by referring to the findings of the 
General Sessions Courts. The expectancy of major crimes following the use 
of Cannabis, then, is small, according to our experiences
The problem of habituation of Cannabis is one of grave importance 
According to the statements of confirmed heroin or morphine addicts, 
Marihuana is not a habit-forming drug. Naturally, where it is used in 
conjunction with heroin, morphine or cocaine another problem presents 
itself.
Occasionally, an astute drug peddler will adulterate Marihuana 
cigarettes with morphine or heroin in order to retain his clientele. Care 
must be exercised in evaluating the question of Marihuana habituation, so 
that we are not dealing with this type of adulterated Cannabis.

The medical diagnosis of habituation depends on the accepted criteria 
of acquired tolerance and after-effect upon withdrawal of the drug. 
Regarding the subject of tolerance, users of Marihuana examined in the 
clinic universally state that an increase in dosage is not neces-

113

sary to achieve the desired effect as time goes on.
The increase in cigarette consumption, sometimes noted, is simply 
related to how often and how long the smoker wants to experience these 
effects.
As to the question of withdrawal symptoms, cases have never, to the 
knowledge of the writer, been observed systematically in an environment 
where control of the drug can be exercised. Although of secondary value in 
deciding the problem of habituation, it should be noticed that experience 
with experimental subjects indicates that after usage of the drug and its 
cessation no withdrawal symptoms are reported.

It has not been possible to observe satisfactorily Marihuana users 
upon their entrance into custody to establish their behavior after cessation 
of usage. For one thing, the law does not allow questioning of a defendant 
prior to trial regarding his charge. The history of the offense cannot be 
discussed except with counsel, but an offender can be questioned in the 
course of medical treatment. The fact that Marihuana cases do not request 
medical treatment upon their incarceration argues for the absence of 
withdrawal symptoms.
As is well known, morphine, opium, etc., users become violently ill 
upon being taken in custody, away from the

114

source of their drug, and are vociferous in their demands for treatment.
Nevertheless, the wide discrepancies between the reports of other 
jurisdictions and ours in the question of addiction to Cannabis demands a 
serious attempt to establish the facts in the case.
Up to March 26, 1938, Cannabis was classed as a habit-forming drug 
in Section 1751 of the Penal Code, based on Public Health Law, Article 22, 
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. Due to difficulty in this Court in proving it to 
be a habit-forming drug (case of People vs. Williams), the Law Revision 
Commission, appointed by the New York State Legislature, was requested 
to amend the Penal Code to read "narcotic" rather than "habit-forming" 
drug.
From a legal point of view, therefore, the problem of whether it is 
habit-forming or not is not vital in this and many other States, since its 
use as a narcotic by un-authorized persons is an offense.
The writer believes it highly desirable and important that a 
Commission be appointed to examine the matter scientifically as was 
done in the case of narcosan and other reputed drug cures in 1921 at the 
Bellevue Psychopathic Hospital under Commissioner Patterson of the 
Department of Correction.

115

The most that one can say on the basis of ascertainable facts is that 
prolonged Marihuana usage constitutes a "sensual" addiction, in that the 
user wishes to experience again and again the ecstatic sensations and 
feelings which the drug produces. 
Unlike morphine addiction, which is biochemically as well as 
psychologically determined, prolonged Marihuana usage is essentially in the 
services of the hedonistic elements of the personality. 
Those are the main conclusions I have developed from that.
Then we took the cases of the Marihuana users and tried to break 
those down. It indicates that no murderers were found among this group of 
67, not one murder committed in these six or seven years by a Marihuana 
user.
There were no sex cases among these 67. We have, however, seven 
hundred odd sex cases, from first degree rape down to exhibitionism, and in 
the course of the six or seven years not one of them was a Marihuana user, 
according to history or physical examination.
At the time of our examination, two of them had sex cases in their 
history some years before. One was sodomy, and the other some other type 
of offense.
Of all of these people, only three called themselves

116

constant users.  One for three years and twelve months, and the others 
nine months.
There is one other point which I would like to mention and that is 
the case of a man named Joseph Ogden who is reported among others in Mr. 
Merrill's paper as having been an addict.
I saw him and spent some time with him. He was a psychopathic 
individual. I think he had been in the State hospital at Lexington, and had 
had several other arrests. But nothing in his history indicated Marihuana.  
In other words, the newspaper accounts must be discounted. The fact of 
the matter was that he had not even been a drug addict, but was a 
homosexualist. The offender was murdered by him and shoved into a trunk.  
I do not know whether he disarticulated his arms or not, but he sent the 
trunk to the express station, and they saw blood oozing out of it, and 
picked him up.
He told the story rather frankly. It was a horrible crime. I think 
Marihuana was innocent of that. I am sure of that, because I have been able 
to check that very carefully.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER:  We have observed two cases of sex 
crimes where we have been able to prove the connection with Marihuana.

117

A boy named Perez, in Baltimore raped a ten-year-old girl, and of 
course he blamed it on Marihuana.
It so happened that, just a year before that, Perez had been picked up 
by the Baltimore police for the sale of 2,500 grains of Cannabis, and got 
three months in jail. This sex offense happened the following year.
And there is another case down in Corpus Christi that we have been 
able to establish, where an oil worker with a good reputation, obtained and 
smoked a cigarette, after which he raped his young daughter.
Those are two cases that I know of in which we have proof.
In the case of Perez, we do not know what else might have been wrong 
with him, but he was definitely a user and a seller of Marihuana.
I believe that Mr. Smith has had a great deal of experience up through 
New York State.

MR. SMITH: We have had one case in the last two or three months, 
which has been of great interest to the Motor Vehicle Department. A 
youngster in Mount Kisco, close to New York City, was involved in an 
automobile accident in that village by hitting three parked cars during the 
evening. When he was apprehended by the police, he literally tore the 
officer's blouse from his shoulder,

118

and he had great difficulty in subduing him. 
During the evening, they first thought it was alcohol, but later the 
youngster admitted having used a "reefer". From the information we 
obtained from him, we apprehended an individual who was growing it, and I 
think we picked up about six pounds. 
We had another case farther up-state, not as well established, but 
apparently pretty well shown, of the inability of the automobile driver to 
perceive distance and speed. 
So that factor will be of considerable interest to those interested in 
traffic control. 
Because of that recent case in White Plains, we have had some inquiry 
from the State Motor Vehicle Department, and they arc considering, I 
believe, the advisability of revoking the licenses of operators who can be 
shown to be users of Marihuana, in the same fashion that we are now able 
to do after showing evidence of narcotism. 

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that in your State law now?

MR. SMITH: No, sir, it is not in our State law now.
In fact, I do not know if it was decided that we could get away with 
it, but through the Motor Vehicle Department we could, as one of the 
requirements in the matter of

119

ability on the questionnaire in New York up-state you have to state whether 
or not you use narcotic drugs.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Marihuana users, when arrested, want to 
fight.
Their motor impulses seem to be working It takes, sometimes, four or 
five officers to subdue a man, and they sometimes wreck the living 
quarters in doing so.
We do not have anything like that in arresting opium users.
The agents proceed very cautiously when arresting a Marihuana user.

MR. SMITH: It conflicts with alcohol which seem to be the worst cases 
yet, and we have had a few cases who used both. Those are perhaps the few 
that you have run across. Then, of course, we have those who have just been 
on the reefer alone.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER, I have noticed a tendency towards more 
gunplay among Marihuana users than among opium users.

MR. SMITH: Than among opium users?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes. And there has been some gun play.
The first case that we arrested under the Marihuana Act, (I happened 
to have been present in the Denver court

120

when they brought this fellow up before the judge.) had been a user for a 
number of years. He was only 23 years old, but many of his arrests were for 
assault.
I have noticed that many of these violators have a record of assault.
In Wilmington, Delaware, there was the case of John Rhodes, who 
attacked an officer with a knife and was shot and killed resisting arrest.

MR. SMITH: I have four out of twelve in one city where the charges, in 
addition to possession, are assault.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In many cases, particularly around Ohio, 
the officers are called in cases of disturbance and they find a Marihuana 
user with some stuff on him.

DR. MUNCH: A chap I talked to told me that the use of gin came in very 
particularly with the use of a reefer. Is that true with opium? Do Marihuana 
users tend to take gin along with smoking of the reefer?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not know about that. We have not run 
into that.

DR. MUNCH: The point I am asking could be that the alcohol there would 
tend to increase the solubility of any material that has been swallowed, 
and, therefore, they would get greater effect under such conditions than if 
they. had not taken the alcohol.

121

DR. MATCHETT One of the Internal Revenue officials, formerly in 
Texas, has told us that down there persons use alcohol and Marihuana 
together, and where they were very wild it took four or five officers to 
bring a man in. He attributed that to the combined effect rather than the 
effect of either one.

MR. SMITH: Still, there is a good deal of fancy on the part of some 
officers, whose experience with Marihuana is new.
I have had some experience with one or two sheriffs. I know of one 
who recently employed the services of two other sheriffs and four deputy 
sheriffs to secure the arrest of a farmer on a farm where the material was 
growing.
Any youngster, 18 or 19 years old, could have gone there and done it 
alone. This was because of the first experience of those officers with it. I 
think the men were anxious to capitalize on the possible publicity which 
might attend the arrest. So that sometimes you run up against that problem, 
where they report that it is necessary for a number of them to subdue an 
individual. That may be an effort to make it appear a more serious type of 
crime.
So that I think we have to put our tongues in our

122

cheeks as to this, also.

DR. MATCHETT: This story came from Deputy Commissioner Berkshire, 
of the Alcohol Tax Unit.

MR. SMITH: We did have in White Plains this additional situation: The 
fact appeared there that with children of high school age with good 
financial and social background, that two of those individuals, who were in 
difficulties there, stated that the smoking of reefers had become a part of 
the initiation in certain clubs or school fraternities.

That probably is a little bit unusual, as an incident, but that has been 
definitely reported in that vicinity. 

DR. WRIGHT: Where was that?

MR. SMITH: That was in White Plains, New York.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Did you not arrest a youngster sixteen 
years old for selling?

Mr.. SMITH: Yes, sir. There were two youngsters of excellent 
background, and fine social connections. That was probably a larger factor, 
as compared to anything else, I think, and that was that they probably had 
too much financial and social backing. That may be more true in that 
particular county than in other counties in that State.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You mentioned a case of a

123

young man using Marihuana and heroin.

MR. WITH: Yes, sir. That was in New York City. 
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What had he used first, do you know?

MR. SMITH: I do not know. That, I extracted from the Police 
Department records last Tuesday, but I did .not have time to go back and get 
the individual cards, and I doubt very much whether the information which 
appears in the police cards will show that.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have not run into many peddlers of 
heroin who also handle Marihuana, and we have not run into many users of 
Marihuana who are also heroin users. However, as Dr. Bouquet points out, in 
Tunis there is a tendency to switch from Marihuana to heroin.
Have you run into any cases like that, Doctor? 

DR. BROMBERG: I have seen many drug addicts, who have, once or 
twice, they say, tried Marihuana, and have dropped it, because it was not 
strong enough. Most true addicts start with heroin or opium.

MR. SMITH: Do you not think that that might be more the association 
with individuals than the association with the drug?

DR. BROMBERG: Perhaps. And there is one other fact, and that is that 
alcohol and Marihuana have a more potent

124

effect than alcohol alone.
I had a case where a man started smoking Marihuana. The seller 
introduced heroin, he noticed the effect, and he became a user, but, of 
course, that was not through any choice.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: As to this question of using alcohol with 
Marihuana, I recall a case in Indiana where a man was arrested who had an 
infusion of the drug in alcohol. How do they do that? Drink it and smoke a 
cigarette?

DR. BROMBERG: No. I think it is a sociological matter. He uses the gin 
with it, or otherwise, and it depends on the amount of money and the 
locality, and they smoke, and it represents having some fun, the effect 
which they look for.

MR. WOLLNER: I wonder how much can be deduced from the present 
figures in the matter of crime, in view of the fact that these figures 
represent a static picture whereas the entire Marihuana picture, so far as I 
know, is on an up-curve.
Have you noticed any tendencies that are not static over a period of 
years Dr. Bromberg?

DR. BROMBERG: That is a very good question, because the alcohol thing 
depends on the relationship between the two.

125

But I have been in contact with the court for about five years, and the 
number of Marihuana peddlers has not increased, but the number of 
Marihuana users we do not know about.

MR. WOLLNER: In what order, would you say?

DR. BROMBERG: It is impossible to say. These are only approximations, 
I admit. It all depends on the police activities.
They make a drive, and the figures go up. They forget about it, and 
there are no figures.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are there any questions as to this phase of 
the problem?
I must say that we are still sort of groping as to a lot of those 
questions.

DR. MUNCH: May I intrude there, just as a matter of difference in mind, 
as to any sort of figure representing the total number of users of 
Marihuana? I mean, has anybody said anything as to the number of heroine 
users being the same as the opium addicts, or less or more, or as to the 
Marihuana?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is impossible to say. The eradication of 
16,000 acres of Marihuana during the past year means nothing as to 
numbers of users. We are sure it was never meant for the illicit traffic. 
Probably

126

15,000 of the 16,000 acres was wild growth.

DR. BROMBERG: You mean additional acreage than that which had 
humans on it?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have arrested over 1,000. The Bureau of 
Prisons is a little concerned about that, because it is causing a definite 
increase in their jails.
Puerto Rico is starting to send a lot of these sellers and users to jail, 
which they did not do before. There has been a tremendous up-grade in 
apprehensions.
I do not recall just what the arrests have been by states throughout 
the country. These are Federal arrests. State arrests are probably over that 
figure.
I should say that the 16,000 acres represent only a drop in the bucket, 
because I know in one State there are 300,000 acres of the wild growth. We 
have a job here on eradication that is just stupendous.
Fortunately, a lot of this acreage that is discovered we hear about 
through people who do not tell anybody else about it.
The illicit trafficker is looking for growth. I cannot understand why 
the New York trafficker had to go out to Minnesota and strip some of those 
hemp fields.

MR. SMITH: We had two instances where the material was either 
reported to be, or actually was, of western

127

growth, and they were getting a higher price than was paid apparently for 
New York grown. Whether that was bona fide, as to the material from New 
York State, or as to the material from Minnesota, I do not know, or whether 
it was a question of price boosting as to the New York sales prices, we still 
do not know.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think within a couple of blocks from 
where Dr. Munch lives you can walk into as much [as] fifty acres that has 
not been destroyed.

DR. MUNCH: They went over about 300 acres of that this year and ran 
out of C.C.C. men and then stopped.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: That is a tremendous problem with us. We 
have used many of the agencies of the Government, the W.P.A. has helped, 
and other agencies. We have discouraged all of these well-meaning people 
throughout the country who want to use Boy Scouts in the removal of' 
Marihuana.

DR. MUNCH: We have had considerable cooperation through Admiral 
Foote, and the Automobile Vehicle Department of our State.

DR. WRIGHT: May I ask Dr. Bromberg whether or not his contacts with 
these patients show whether or not there is any indication of whether 
these cigarettes used were tobacco which had been adulterated with 
Marihuana?

128

DR. BROMBERG: My source of information is the Police Department, and 
the cigarettes that they have gathered up are filled definitely with 
Marihuana, and no other compound.

MR. SMITH: I would like to ask Dr. Bromberg, or anybody else who has 
had experience as to the likelihood of development of perversion.
Has anybody had any experience on that?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Kolb, have you run into anything on 
that? 

DR. KOLB: No, sir. 

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How many of these users have you in 
Lexington?

DR. KOLB: There are about one hundred patients who have used it 
occasionally, but they are mostly opium and heroin users. 
About twenty-five have used nothing but Marihuana alone. 
But, just as Dr. Bromberg has stated they use it occasionally, just to 
see if it is another drug that they need.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are these Marihuana users, as such, a 
younger group than your opium smokers?

DR. KOLB: Most of the time.

129

For instance, we had a man from Puerto Rico, about fifty years old, 
who had been a judge, and who said it was a political plot that he should 
get four years. I do not know how politics came into it.
He said, "Well, they are trying to get rid of me."
He never had any criminal record. That seemed to be a rather strong 
sentence for users.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have noticed the tendency in Puerto 
Rico, even with heroin users, to give them five years for use only.

DR. KOLB: Yes, they give them a very severe sentence.
The district attorney wrote me and wanted to take it up with judge 
Cooper. I told him that, from the stand-point of rehabilitation, it was a 
rather harmful matter to put a man in prison for four years. He is liable to 
learn a lot of things in prison and then go out and hate society and use them 
against society.
It is my idea that users should get one year, and especially the fellow 
who does not have a criminal record.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not think the courts here are being too 
severe.

DR. KOLB' No, they are not.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: They are giving the seller

130

a great deal more than the user, on the average. 

DR. KOLB: Of course.

MR. WOLLNER: What does your investigation represent as to these 
twenty-five users of Marihuana alone, as compared to those who use other 
drugs other than Marihuana?

DR. KOLB: Of course, we get them after they have stopped using the 
drug, and after they have escaped the acute effects of the drugs, There is 
only one psychiatric case, which we are not quite sure of, that has been due 
to using the Marihuana drug.

MR. WOLLNER: I am going to ask an awfully unfair question.
What percentage of these people would have been in jail if they had 
not smoked Marihuana? 

DR. KOLB: Well, very few of them.

MR. WOLLNER: They would hot have been in jail?

DR. KOLB: That applies to a great many users of drugs.
A great many of them have done other things, particularly thievery, or 
other slippery types of work. 

MR. WOLLNER: Are they slightly impaired?

DR. KOLB: They are slightly impaired, partly due to the psychiatric 
condition, and to the distress of needing the drug.

131

There are very few violent types of crime with the opium addict.
Our experience with the Marihuana addicts is not enough to give an 
answer. I rather think that with the alcoholic-Marihuana user, that he 
would become a type of drug addict that would cause many crimes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER:  There was a case in Canada, Mr. Lancaster, 
there a Marihuana user had withdrawal symptoms similar to those of an 
opium user.

MR. LANCASTER: Yes, sir. That was the boy who was picked up and had 
used Marihuana for a long time. He was out of work, had no continual 
employment.
He tried to smoke Marihuana, rather liked it, and after several months 
of usage, he was jailed, and kept there for about a week.
His case was remanded, and he reported feeling tingling pains and 
needles in the hands and feet, and he was greatly upset and pleaded for a 
narcotic again. He was suffering with an imparity of that order. I do not 
think it was tried to see whether giving him Marihuana should relieve that 
case or not.
The general impression is that there is no great suffering, and if they 
are relieved from it after the first five days, naturally they want it again, 
but they do

132

not break down if they do not get it.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Bromberg, have you come across any occasion of 
drinking Marihuana in the form of tea extract, or something of that sort? 

DR. BROMBERG: No.

MR. SMITH: Is there any evidence of it being used in Canada? On any 
convictions, have you had any evidence of it ?

MR. LANCASTER: Not there, no. No, sir, so far there have been no 
samples submitted to us as yet.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: None that I know of.
But I understand they do mix them, mix it with sweets, in northern 
Africa.

MR. SMITH: There have been one or two reports that they do mix it in 
California.

MR. WOLLNER: For your ears, I can tell you, Mr. Smith, that all of the 
chemists are sitting on the edge of their seats, worrying about that 
happening

MR. SMITH: And there is a question as to the toxic effects which could 
be present.

MR. WOLLNER: And there may not be any way in which we can examine 
it. We are hoping that they do not guess that gasoline will extract it.

DR. MATCHETT: Is it true that that is a common form

133

in the Far East?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: No, not in The Far East, but in the Near 
East. 

DR. MATCHETT: In the Near East, yes.
 
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We seem to have covered the  sociological 
phases, so far as we are able to and I am going to turn the choir over, at 
this point, to Dr. Wollner, who will proceed with the chemical phases. 
This is where most of the spade work has got to be done, anyway.

STATEMENT OF MR.. H. J. WOLLNER, 
CONSULTING CHEMIST, TREASURY DEPARTMENT

MR. WOLLNER: The problem is not yet resolved. We are not yet in a 
position to know exactly what it is we are looking for, and, within four 
walls, I am perfectly frank to admit that al]. the chemists I have met, who 
are interested in this field, are at a complete loss when asked to prophesy 
the character of the narcotic principle, which we are going to eventually 
disclose.
The situation is as bad in the chemical literature as it is in all of the 
other phrases.
I should certainly be within the reasonable bounds of correctness 
when I say that ninety percent of the stuff that has been written on the 
chemical end of Can-

134

nabis is absolutely wrong, and, of the other ten percent, at least two-thirds 
of it is of no consequence.
That ninety per cent has had, however, to be dealt with, and chemists 
all over the world have been interested in Cannabis, and in the past few 
years have spent a goodly portion of their time upsetting a lot of this 
shibboleth and tradition which has been set up, probably a thousand years, 
so as to clear the ground and to be able to proceed in a more orderly 
fashion.

In this work the evidence, by force of circumstance, compels us to 
turn to the pharmacologist for guidance.

As Dr. Loewe ably expressed before, since we have no test in the 
chemical laboratories for indicating the presence or absence of the 
narcotic principle, every bit of the exploratory work of consequence that 
has been engaged upon had to be paralleled with work in the field of bio-
assay.

The chemical problem is so obvious that it does not require much 
delineation.

Chemists, enforcement administrative chemists, are interested in 
two things. First, and immediately, they want to know how to find and 
detect the presence of Cannabis sativa, or any of its products that are 
narcotic in character.

In other words, most enforcement officers will make

135

a seizure in some form, solid or liquid, and the question asked is, "Is this 
Marihuana?" And no satisfactory technique for answering such a question 
obtains today.
That does not say that in most of the cases that come before the 
chemists they are not in a definite position to make a definite statement, 
that before them the substance is definitely Cannabis sativa, but they can 
not do it as definitely as in the case of morphine, opium, and heroin.
The second question they would like answered is,
"What is the narcotic principle, or what are the narcotic principles 
present?"
That question is not one of enforcement so much as of general 
administration.
The Commissioner of Narcotics has the problem of deciding, at times, 
what regulations shall be invoked in respect to an industry or an 
agricultural phase of this problem.
The question arises, how long shall we have to wait before the resin 
is decomposed, during the rotting process, for example, and the only way I 
would know how to answer that question is to know how long that principle 
will exist during that rotting exhibition. Of course, we do not know. We can 
not answer that question.
The question arises, can recommendations be made to


136

exempt the use of certain portions of the plant and certain industrial 
directions, as far as governmental regulation is concerned, be given by 
virtue of the fact that they are harmless. No statement can he made on that 
score.
So, it becomes important, from an administrative point of view, for 
administrative chemists, associated with the carrying out of the Marihuana 
Act, to have a more competent picture of the drug, as competent as obtains 
at the present time in respect to the poppy and its secretion, opium, and its 
products, morphine, heroin, codeine, and so on.
This drug, peculiarly enough, has withstood competent attack for an 
extensive period of time.
Before the laws were passed controlling the opium picture, chemists 
were able to supply a fairly excellent background, against which such 
legislation and regulations might have been and were in fact predicated.
But, in the case of Marihuana, there is no such background. It is just a 
fog; without question the psychiatrists and bioassayists and agricultural 
people know far more about Cannabis than do the chemists.
So far as knowing anything about the plant, today, is concerned, all 
they can tell you is that such and such

137

a product is not a narcotic, such and such a product is non-narcotic, and 
they are trying to shrink the residue further and further, but they have not 
touched it.
Of great assistance in clarifying the issue has been the work 
undertaken by Dr. Blatt, in reviewing the literature.
Dr. Blatt has prepared a paper consisting of a critical review of the 
literature on narcotics, published in the journal of the Washington Academy 
of Sciences on the 15th of November. I have a number of copies of the paper 
here, and also a chart setting forth the general character of the critique, so 
that a person who is a technical man can get a picture of the thing.
I am going to ask that only these people who have a working 
knowledge of chemical symbology receive them, and we will try to get 
enough copies to mail them out to you later.
I am going to ask Dr. Blatt if he will be so kind as to offer a picture of 
his survey as to the chemical constituents of Cannabis Sativa.

STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. BLATT, 
HOWARD UNIVERSITY.

DR. BLATT: That will not take very long, because as Mr. Wollner has 
said, we are only dealing with two-

138

thirds of ten percent of the material. 
Very briefly, the story is, you can take Cannabis and extract it with 
one of several solvents, or combinations of solvents and obtain a 
physiologically active extract. The only successful technique that has been 
applied to that so far has been a distillation process, and through the 
distillation you can get out of it three substances, which I will simply 
name and pass on. 
One of them is a paraffin hydrocarbon known as nonacosane, that is, 
physiologically, inactive. 
If you do a distillation, you get a definite distillate, and all chemists 
who have worked with Cannabis know it as red oil. Unfortunately, it also 
was known as Cannabinol, and that has been the cause of much trouble. 
	This red oil looks a good bit like a lubricating oil of a rather poor 
quality, a semi-solid material at room temperature. 
That material we will simply call narcotic-active by a physiological 
test. The real nasty principle about the situation is that that material 
behaves as if it were a chemical substance, and there have been three 
different formulas proposed for it. 
One of the formulas has Cot so far as two individuals having agreed 
upon it. Then the hitch comes. In about

139

forty years, three English workers succeeded in preparing and isolating one 
pure chemical substance from this red oil.
They called that Cannabinol, and the one individual substance derived 
from it is also called Cannabinol. For thirty years, nobody following them 
was ever able to get this pure Cannabinol.
So, we went ahead and worked with Cannabinol, and assumed that we 
were working with the pure substance
Then, roughly about eight years ago, the pure chemical individual, pure 
Cannabinol, again was secured for the second time, and apparently it can be 
repeated.
Pure Cannabinol is the fourth chemical substance to be gotten out of 
Cannabis, and it is the fourth one to be lacking in narcotic activity. It is 
toxic, however, and it is quite possible that some of the .activity of Canna-
binol, some of this complex activity that has been referred to during the 
morning, is due to pure Cannabinol as a chemical individual.
The chemical structure of pure Cannabinol has been fairly well 
worked out. It is not definitely settled. We do not need to go into that
 There is one more thing that should be pointed out, and that is the 
fact that for thirty years perfectly com-

140

petent chemists have taken this red oil, distilled, and worked with it as if 
a pure chemical. It not only gives analytical values of resin, but they are 
even more complex. You can carry out the chemical reactions with this.
So, let us refer to red oil as the crude Cannabinol; and the chemical 
individual as pure Cannabinol. You can run chemical reactions. You can 
reduce an acetylate and the products you get out are still analyzable for the 
proper derivatives of crude Cannabinol. That is, where everybody has gone 
haywire.
There is one ray of hope, and a pretty definite one, as to the confusion 
of a mixture which was taken to be a definite chemical substance, and that 
is why progress has been so slow, and that is the fact that we have no way 
quantitatively of following the definite reaction of the chemical principle..
The one ray of hope I mention is the fact that you can take red oil, 
crude Cannabinol, remove one-fourth, which is inactive as pure Cannabinol, 
and the residual three-fourths still retains chemical activity. There is 
where the work begins. That is as far as has been gotten chemically.
There is just one more point here. As far as I have been able to find, 
and I received corroboration at noon, there not only is no correlation, or no 
correlation has

141

been made, so far as I can find. out, between the various color reactions for 
Cannabis and the narcotic activity, and I was told at noon that, not only had 
there been none made, but it was because there definitely is none. So we 
can not fail to follow the activity as to this color test.
I may be getting off in deep water, but that is the apparent final 
analysis. There is one more thing, and that will finish it up.
I hope not many people will be misled by the principle that the active 
principle of Cannabis is Cannabinol. You will find it even there. The active 
fraction which you will find, which is more or less of a mixture, is called 
Cannabinol.
You can find a chemical substance which is not active. I think that 
covers it.

MR. WOLLNER: I think that adds oils to the fire. 

DR. MUNCH: Is there an active substance there? 

MR. WOLLNER: I will take your word for it, and Bromberg's on the basis 
of his research in New York
It leads us pretty much to where we started.
I think if all the research work done so far were dumped together by a 
group of chemists, or if they started out today on this investigation, that 
they would be exactly the same as they are now inside of six months;

142

	that is, all of the information which we have, which is very 
little, could be accumulated in six months. 
Recognizing that situation, the Treasury two years ago undertook to 
lay the basis for a competent attack on the problem. 
We did not know what that would consist of, but we knew sound, 
fundamental, reproducible information and data had to be obtained. 
The first thing we did was to contact the Department of Agriculture, 
and with their cooperation, there was planted a plot at Arlington Farms 
over here, last summer, and the summer before, where the plant was 
observed in its various stages of growth, and which furnished us all of the 
criteria the literature offered us in the past. 
As I mentioned earlier, about ninety percent of all of it was thrown 
out. The report of the first year's investigation was published in the journal 
of the American Pharmaceutical Association. I have a number of copies 
here, if there are any technical men who have not soon that report. 
An equivalent report is being prepared at the present time on the 
basis of this summerÕs work.
We have obtained several tons of Marihuana. We have extracted or are 
extracting huge quantities of that mater-

143

ial, in an effort to provide a satisfactory amount on the basis of which a 
broad attack on the problem may be predicated.
Dr. Matchett is in charge of the Treasury's own immediate attack on 
the problem, and I believe he has some information which he can lay before 
you this afternoon. 
Is that correct, Dr. Matchett? 

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN R. MATCHETT, 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT. 

DR. MATCHETT: The problem is clarified a little bit by recognizing 
that there are two distinct phases involved, the first of which must be 
pretty well finished before the second can begin. 
First of all, there is the separation of the active principle from other 
material, and second, the characterization of it. 
Before a competent separation can be undertaken, we must be in 
possession of suitable assay methods. 
We, of course, are interested in those manifestations of Marihuana 
that lead to the effects, which have led in turn, to the passage of the Act
We are not sure, I take it, whether the substance produces ataxia in 
the dog, or sleep in the mouse, or corneal(?) anesthesia in the rabbit is the 
same as the one in which we are interested.

144

Nevertheless, something must be adopted, and by common consent, a 
dog assay, with all its faults, has been the method of choice.
It seems obvious that these various principles, if more than one 
exists, will be each characterized on its own merits.
In considering this phase of it, also, it must not be forgotten that any 
one of the effects may be combinations, and any of the effects that we are 
able to measure may possibly be combined effects, of which the bad effect 
of the drug itself may be only one. 
With that so disposed of, it is possible to recognize that certain 
characteristics of the so-called resin are fairly well defined already, 
although I think we must recognize that the resin itself is variable, and to 
what extent, we are not yet able to say very definitely.
As Dr. Blatt said, there have been certain individuals isolated in pure 
form, of which the most important are Cannabinol and the hydrocarbon 
nonacosame.
There is also present definitely in the resin a substance that responds 
to the alkaline Beam test.
There are still other substances among all those responsible for the 
psychological and physiological activity; of such there may be one or more.

145

And finally, there are those volatile oils, in which there is no 
tremendous interest other than to dispose of them before being able to 
isolate the drug.
Now, little or nothing is known of the nature of the active substance. 
All attacks on the problem have, thus far, broadly speaking, produced 
negative results. The thing, in any event, is not an alkaloid, because we are 
not able to extract it into acid solutions from solvents, nor does it contain 
any nitrogen. It is not an acid, since it does not extract into alkaline 
solution. And it has not been shown to contain any carbonyl groups because 
it does not form any derivatives with the common reagents for such.

There is evidence on the other hand that it forms esters and that it is 
an aromatic substance, the latter from the refractive index of the most 
active fraction. From that it would appear to be a phenolic compound. The 
substance is thermostable under rather rigorous conditions, but it is 
quickly destroyed in the presence of oxygen.
It is also quite likely that it is unsaturated since reduction by 
hydrogen is possible.
But all those, unfortunately, are properties of the active mixtures 
that Dr. Blatt referred to, rather than of any chemical individual. They are 
all of some assis-

146

tance though, in considering methods by which the problem may be 
attacked.
Now, only distillation in a rather high vacuum has been of any 
assistance thus far in fractionating the mixture, known as Cannabis resin. 
The volatile oils are so separated with relative ease. The substance 
responsible for the acid Beam test, whatever it may be, is removed, the 
acid test no longer appearing in the distillate.
The hydrocarbon which does appear in the distillate can be removed by 
crystallization from alcohol or some other solvent, and pure Cannabinol can 
be removed as a crystalline acetate or paranitry benzoate.
As Dr. Blatt pointed out, this point is where the trail ends at present, 
with the exception of a brief note indicating that it is definitely possible 
to find physiological effects in the material remaining after Cannabinol has 
been removed.
It is at that point that we purpose ultimately to actually begin.
The former distillation has been carried out at pressures anywhere 
from atmospheric down to a reported pressure of about five-one 
thousandths of a millimeter.
From the character of the work in which this was reported it would 
appear that the reported pressures must

147

be taken with a grain of salt. No essential difference however has appeared 
in the products of fractionation. The material, as you may be aware, is an 
exceedingly difficult material to work with, a heavy tar-like oil, and it 
does not lend itself readily to distillation by any means.
We have considered that at this point it might be preferable to resort 
to molecular distillation in an effort to obtain a more competent 
separation. If this hope be realized, a number of avenues of attack are 
opened or re-opened. That is, among other things the action of solvents may 
be reinvestigated, and of particular interest will be the action of solvents 
at low temperatures.
Then there are possibilities of preferential adsorption, and also it 
may be possible to prepare crystalline derivatives. They fail to appear from 
treatment of the present mixtures.
Now, the molecular distillation outfit that we have chosen for this 
work is of the static type, rather than the cyclic still with which you are 
probably more familiar, because the higher boiling fractions of this 
material are so viscous that they probably would not cycle with in that 
still without special precautions to maintain a high temperature.

148

The original material has been distilled before passing it into the 
molecular still in a flash apparatus that operates under a good vacuum. This 
is necessary since the crude oil is particularly prone to spit in the 
molecular still and ruin the distillation.
More specifically, the process that we are following is extraction 
from the plant material with cold alcohol, alcohol being chosen as a solvent 
rather than petroleum ether, on account of fire hazard. This process is 
followed by a liquid extraction from the alcohol by pentane, which does 
away with a lot of water soluble material, and tarry material of a 
nondescript character.
We have not yet thoroughly satisfied ourselves that all of the active 
material is extracted by pentane, but we believe we have every reason to 
think it is.
Then the pentane, which incidentally, extracts quite a little alcohol, 
is removed, and the alcohol is also removed.
The material is then passed through the flash process that I referred 
to a moment ago, and the distillate from here is placed in the molecular 
still. That is the point which the investigation has reached at this parti-
cular moment.
Now, it is expected to divide the oil into about ten

149

fractions in the stills, then to remove Cannabinol as the acetate and the 
hydrocarbon by precipitation from a suitable solvent, and then to 
refractions, to the remaining material.
The work from that point, of course, all depend upon the results of the 
fractionations, and can not be very definitely foreseen, other than that 
those processes, to which I referred a moment ago, will be applied.
Now, it would have been possible to have attacked certain phases of 
the problem along a number of other lines, a few of which I will suggest in 
conclusion. The first would be a characterization of those volatile oils, 
which have been referred to, and which would be of interest from a purely 
chemical point of view.
They are separated with relative ease, by steam distillation, for 
example. No one, of course, has been very much interested in them, and that 
line of attack has not been followed.
Again, someone might become interested in the substance which 
responds to the acid Beam test. It can be removed from a solution in 
petroleum either by means of alkali, and presumably would be isolated with 
relatively little difficulty, but experience shows that resins so prepared 
are not physiologically active, hence little in-

150

terest is attached to that substance.
A third possible line of attack would have been in connection with the 
Beam test itself. The development of the color is due to a product resulting 
from oxidation of some substance which is present In the resin. This 
substance is soluble in aqueous alkali, and is precipitated by acid. It can be 
readily extracted from acid solution. It, of course, is not actually the 
substance which responds to the alkaline Beam test, but it would be of 
great interest from the purely scientific point of view.

MR. WOLLNER: I would like to make a couple of announcements.
Those of you who are not particularly interested in the chemical 
attack here may find this part of the program a little arduous, and I want 
you to understand that you are at liberty to leave and interrupt if you want 
to, as I think this part of the program might be a little obtuse at certain 
points.
Dr. Blatt has just indicated that there are some errors in the material 
which he distributed on the critical review.
Do you want to indicate those?

DR. BLATT: There is one error in the literature, for example on page 
469 in the middle of the page are three

151

formulas, just one the paragraph beginning in the middle of those formulas. 
There is a carbon atom, a "C", a single line to an oxygen "0", and that should 
be a double line to make it conform to the other two.
Then, on that flow sheet, on the left-hand half of the page, the second 
of those errors reads "dihydrogenation with sulphur," and that should be 
Òdehydrogenation", and not "dihydrogenation".

MR. WOLLNER: As you gathered, Dr. Matchett's attack there is directed 
at the heart of the problem; that is to say, the isolation and 
characterization of the extreme number of active principles.
I indicated at the beginning that there is another phase of the 
problem, and that was identification. We at this time do not know whether 
the chemical attack is destined to determine the active principle in one 
year or sixty years.
The Treasury has issued a little manual of identification, consisting 
largely of photographs, and it is being distributed. In this country we are 
mostly dealing with the drug in its plant form, and in this manual they are 
showing the separate parts of plants, and so on, and it is helpful in that 
direction.
I am going to ask Mr. Levine to give us a picture

152

of the Beam test.





STATEMENT OF MR. LEVINE,
CHEMIST, BUREAU OF NARCOTICS.

MR. LEVINE: The Beam test seems to be the most widely used chemical 
test for the identification of Marihuana, and was first introduced by Dr. W. 
Beam, of the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratory, of Khartoum.
The alkaline test in 1911 and the acid Beam test in 1915 have come 
to be accepted as specific for Marihuana, although a lot of samples have 
failed to respond.
Workers in Europe and north Africa have used it and tried it on a large 
number of plant materials.
In general it is agreed that no other material responds 
characteristically to the test.
It has been attacked by some chemists, notably Trolle and Rende, who 
said they obtained the Beam test on a mixture of drugs consisting of ginger, 
coriander, licorice, nutmeg, and several other things.
Other workers, notably Fahamy and Keiy in Egypt, and Papavassiliou 
and Liberato, in Greece, applied the test to these materials, both 
individually and in the mixture, and failed to get a positive response to any 
of them.
As I stated before, a large number of authentic samples of Marihuana 
failed to respond to the Beam test, or

153

gave a very slightly dirty purple color, which might be mistaken for just a 
dirty color. So a number of modifications of the Beam test have been 
introduced to try to improve the results obtained in the test.
One of the steps taken to improve the test was the use of adsorbent 
charcoal to remove chlorophyll from the solution of the resin.
This was reported independently by Fahamy and Keiy, Bouquet, and by 
the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory.
One of the tests developed in the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory is 
the ethyl acetate test. Ethyl acetate is used as a solvent, because it is a 
good solvent for the resin, it has a low boiling point, hence is easily 
evaporated and it can be treated with activated charcoal, which removes 
most of the chlorophyll, and other substances, which would interfere with 
color development, but takes out very little of the material responsible for 
the Beam test.
In carrying out the test, a sample of Marihuana is extracted with a 
portion of ethyl acetate. The solvent is treated for a few seconds with 
darco or norite and filtered.
The filtrate is divided between two porcelain dishes and evaporated 
on a steam bath before a fan. To one of

154

the dishes is added several drops of the alkaline Beam reagent, and to the 
other, several drops of the acid Beam reagent.
In a large number of tests, no samples which were negative to this 
modification were found to be positive by the original Beam test, or any of 
a number of other modifications.
It seems, therefore, that this is the most satisfactory modification 
of the Beam test.
Dr. Bouquet, in Tunis, has developed two amyl alcohol tests, one of 
which uses charcoal, and the other does not.
His test consists of grinding a sample of Marihuana with potassium 
Hydroxide, and then adding a portion of alcohol, mixing thoroughly, and 
filtering, whereupon a purple color appears in the filtrate.
Then, to a portion of this filtrate he adds about a ten-fold volume of 
water, and extracts with one cc. of amyl alcohol. The purple color is 
extracted into the amyl alcohol.
In his test involving the use of charcoal, he adds a small amount of 
animal charcoal to the mixture of the alcohol, KOH, and Marihuana, 
presumably to remove chlorophyll, and then lets it stand for two hours 
before filtering.

155

The resultant filtrate is free of chlorophyll, and the tests obtained 
are better.
We have found that his test, involving the use of charcoal, works 
better with activated charcoal, such as norit or Darco than with the animal 
charcoal prescribed.
Also, we find that we get results by filtering immediately after the 
addition of charcoal, instead of letting the mixture stand for two hours. We 
have not found any case of failure to respond upon immediate filtration, 
which would respond after standing.
Another modification which we have developed in our laboratory, and 
which may be considered a modification of the Bouquet test, is probably 
most convenient of the modifications to run, because it involves the least 
manipulation. It consists merely of shaking for a few seconds the sample of 
Marihuana with a two percent alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide. 
Add to this is an amount of activated charcoal equal in weight to the 
Marihuana. The mixture is shaken for a few seconds, and filtered 
immediately. The filtrate is purple and on dilution with water, the purple 
colored substance may be extracted by amyl alcohol.
Other modifications of the technique have been proposed by Dr. 
Myttanaere, Viehoever, Placencias and others.

156

As I said before, a large number of plants fail to respond to any of 
these modifications of the Beam tests. We have followed the appearance of 
the Beam test in plants with regard to age, parts of plant, and variety.
In regard to age, some plants three inches tall have been found to 
respond to the Beam test. Some plants, at all states of growth, up to their 
decadence, respond.
Many male plants, which are all withered, and consist of nothing but a 
skeleton with a few dried flowers sticking to the top still respond to the 
alkaline Beam test.
As far as an individual plant goes, the order of response is best in the 
top, both with the male and female plants, followed by the upper leaves, 
lower leaves, upper twigs, upper stalk, lower twigs, and lower stalk. In 
other words, as you go up towards the top of the plant you get the best 
response.
Where the top responds very strongly, you generally get a weak 
response in the skin of the lower stalk. If the tops respond very weakly, the 
upper leaves will probably be negative, or just give a trace of response. We 
have never been able to get any response at all from the pith or roots of the 
plant.

157

This last summer we tested six varieties of hemp, as Dr. Robinson 
indicated this morning. Three of them were Roumanian varieties; one of 
them was Italian, one, Manchurian; and one of Chinese origin.
Of the three Roumanian varieties, about a percent could be positively 
identified by the alkaline Beam test, as Dr. Natchett pointed out this 
morning.
The other three gave a trace of response to the test.
The Italian variety was very close to this, having about 98 percent 
attainable by the Beam test.
Of the Manchurian and Chinese, only about 20 to 50 percent could be 
positively identified, and of these, practically none of the tests were as 
strong as the tests obtained from the Roumanian and Italian varieties. The 
largest number of the plants were absolutely negative, or showed merely 
faint trances of response, which we would not consider to be suitable for 
identification if the plants were unknown.
We studied the effect of heating the plants towards response to the 
alkaline Beam test. We found that heating parts of the plant at 100 degrees 
with air blowing over them for up to five hours did not have any harmful 
effects on the material response for the alkaline Beam test.
In fact, some of the plants showed better response

158

after heating than before. Although some workers in Europe say in no case 
should the extract be heated. over 50 degrees Centigrade.
However, heating the plant at 150 degrees under the same conditions 
did prove to have a deleterious effect.
Another treatment we tried was permitting the plant to mold. We 
subjected the tops of some of the plants, both negative and positive, to 
molding, in a very moist atmosphere, for a period of about five weeks. After 
this period, the whole plant was covered with slimy mold. Response to the 
alkaline Beam test was as good as it was originally.
Some negative plants which were molded remained negative after the 
molding period.
Oxidization is an essential part of the Beam test. Beam, in his 
original article, pointed out that if the tests be applied in the absence of 
air, a dirty brown color will result instead of the purple color. We have 
taken up some of the resin in alcohol, and added an equal volume of 2 per 
cent alcoholic KOH solution. The resultant solution was colorless, but on 
passing oxygen through it, the characteristic purple color developed.
Shaking the solution with charcoal had the same effect. Presumably 
this is because oxidization is effected

159

by the oxygen adsorbed on the charcoal.
Oxidation must be done in alkaline solution. Charcoal plays a dual role 
in the test. In the case of the ethyl acetate test the effect is merely to 
remove extraneous matter, since no oxidation is effected in this solution.
In certain solvents, such as petroleum ether, the activated charcoal 
will entirely remove from solution the material responsible for the Beam 
test, while animal charcoal does this to a much smaller extent. In fact, 
animal charcoal may be used in petroleum ether, although its effect as a 
cleaning agent is not very large.
The second role of charcoal is that of an oxidizing agent.
The oxygen adsorbed on activated charcoal is effective in producing 
the necessary oxidation of the material responsible for the alkaline Beam 
test. Animal charcoal is effective to a very much smaller extent, and is 
therefore unsatisfactory for use in this process.

MR. WOLLNER: I think we will have a recess now for about five 
minutes before we resume.

(A short recess was taken, after which the proceedings were 
resumed as follows:)

MR. WOLLNER: Now, after that rather exhaustive

160

treatise on the Beam test, I would like to have Mr. Benjamin tell us 
something about this so-called Duquenois test.
The reason time is being given on these tests is this: Every so often a 
new test is obtained, and this is the experience in every phase of chemical 
activity, and until several months or years have been put in on it, everyone 
gets highly enthusiastic about it.
Efforts are made to introduce it as witness material in court, and the 
first thing you know you run into a situation where you are yourself out on 
a peninsula and you can not possibly get back.
We have asked the Treasury Department not to employ any tests 
unless they are absolutely tests on a theory of so-called triangulation, so 
that when our men go to court to testify on a seizure that their evidence is 
sound.

Mr. Benjamin, will you tell us briefly about the Duquenois test and 
what our experience has been with that.

MR. BENJAMIN: I think this was proposed in the early part of 1938. 
Reagent number 1 is an alcoholic solution with vanillin and acetaldehyde.
The second reagent is concentrated hydrochloric acid;

161

The technique consists of extracting hemp with petroleum ether and 
driving off the solvent by heat.
One then takes one cc. of the alcoholic reagent, adds it to the residue, 
and into the solution thus prepared, puts two c.c.Õs of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid.
There is a change in color from green to slate blue to violet blue.
Now, since we have had this, we have tested approximately 165 
substances, including some of the alkaloids, the essential oils, C. D.  
alcohols, everything I could get my hands on that might show up with this 
reagent.
So far, not one sample of hemp has failed to respond to this test. 
When I say "hemp" I am referring to solid extracts, fluid extracts, and ether 
available preparations. They all show positive.
Certain essential oils when treated by the test procedure ran through 
the same changes as the hemp, namely, oil of bay, geranyl acetate, rhodinyl 
acetate, and one or two others.
There was also a compound known as Denol, that gave practically the 
same reaction as hemp. That is used in C. D. alcohols. I do not know exactly 
what it is composed of, but I think a mixture of higher alcohols and ketones.

162

MR. SCHICKTANZ: Yes, higher alcohols.

MR. BENJAMIN: I must emphasize the fact that not one sample of 
Cannabis or fluid extract of Cannabis or solid extract has failed so far.

MR. WOLLNER: Would you recommend the test as an eliminative test 
for hemp; that is to say, hemp would have to give a positive test of the 
Duquenois agent in order to be considered hemp, and then proceed?

 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes.

MR. WOLLNER: To apply another test to see whether it is another 
substance?

MR. BENJAMIN: I think the fact that ia the Duquenois test for Cannabis 
fails to respond, then one should hesitate to call the sample Cannabis.

MR. WOLLNER: That is predicated---

MR. BENJAMIN: (Interposing) On the 165. 

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, you have had some experience with some 
other tests, which we do not think very much of.

DR. MUNCH: That is fine. 

MR. WOLLNER: What is your experience with that test?

DR. MUNCH: I started about three or four years ago with the method 
developed by an official in the British pharmacopoeia for ergot, using 
paradimethyl amino benzal-

163

dehyde.
The results I obtained I then dropped, because I got busy on something 
else, but I have had occasion this last spring to review and finish up that 
work, which was reported at Madison and the American Pharmaceutical 
Association. The manuscript is in the hands of the editor of the American 
Pharmaceutical Association, and ought to be out next month.
In it I tried various modifications and found the 2-1/2 per cent 
solution of paradimethyl amino benzaldehyde in 65 per cent sulphuric acid, 
or in 65 per cent phosphoric acid, which is my principal reagent.
The material to be tested is shaken with 10 parts, or approximately 
10 parts, of low boiling petroleum ether, (below 40 degrees Centigrade) 
which has been redistilled and a half part of MerckÕs activated charcoal or 
norit, or any other U. S. P., activated carbon for five or ten minutes, then 
filtered. The filtrate is evaporated, and the reagent applied to the residue. 
The direct application of the reagent causes charring, or does not cause 
anything, according to how much material has been removed.
But on the addition of a drop of water there is an immediate 
development of a blue color, shifting toward the violet end of the spectrum, 
and disappearing within

164

two seconds or two hours, depending on how much material is present.
Ergot gives a blue color similar to that of Cannabis, but the color 
shift is toward the red. The red is much slower than with that of Cannabis, 
and it persists for several days.
I went to two neighborhood drug stores, and got ten or eleven 
materials out of their prescription department, and sent them through the 
same tests. Many of them gave no color. Others gave colors of some sort.
But, to make a long story short, none of them gave the same type of 
color as the blue shift that I obtained with Cannabis. 
I have tried about 50 samples of Cannabis, so far, and every one of 
those gave the same reaction. 
While my eye is not too good, still there is a symmetric trend 
between the potency on dogs and the degree of color developed here. By 
degree I mean intensity and duration, considering them together. But a 
product stronger on the dog has given me a stronger color. 

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Matchett, what is your experience with that 
Ghamrawy test? 

DR. MATCHETT: We found too many other substances, which we regard 
as giving colors too similar to that

165

given to Cannabis, to have any value in the hands [of] anyone not very 
definitely expert in the use of it. Even in such hands it is our judgment that 
colors given tobacco and certain other substances were still too near the 
color given by Cannabis for use in the case of extracts.
Of course, where we have a plant to look at, we realize a different 
situation exists.

DR. MUNCH: Even with tobacco? 

DR. MATCHETT: Tobacco was very close. 

DR. MUNCH: Is that right? 

DR. MATCHETT: This was not used with charcoal. 

DR. MUNCH: If I do not use charcoal, I get inconclusive results along 
that line. 

DR. MATCHETT: I am coming 'to that. 
It was our experience that the U.S.P. activated charcoal would remove 
either the hemp or tobacco test substance from petroleum ether. The result 
being that the test in hemp was about the same as it was in tobacco. 
I will ask Mr. Benjamin if that is a correct statement.

MR. BENJAMIN: That is correct. 

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Lancaster, have you had any experience with these 
tests in Canada?

MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. [sic] Wollner.

166

Some years ago our interest was aroused as to whether or not 
Canadian Cannabis would be at all active. As some of you know, the plant 
thrives in all climates. We have it in all altitudes. There are no cultivated 
plants. 
But some years ago we wanted to satisfy ourselves about the activity 
of the Canadian produced Cannabis. Some was grown in western Canada for 
windbreak purposes, that is the only economic function it had with us. 
	After applying the alkaline Beam test, as put out from Geneva we 
obtained positive reactions, and the pharmacologists tried it on dogs and 
we found it responded, so we concluded that some of the Canadian Cannabis 
was active.
From the standpoint of the administration of the Narcotic Act, our 
interest is entirely limited to the illicit traffic, and it is confined to the 
reefer or cigarette, where we have the advantage of a physical. diagnosis, 
rather than chemical.
The chemical work on this we intend to follow up as of extreme 
importance, because it is difficult to predict to what extent the extracts 
may come into use.
There is a possibility of developing a non-reactive type of plant, but 
it is not of an immediate concern, although there again conditions of world 
trade and combined

167

complications might become such that Canada might be asked to take up 
that problem again. Who knows?
So we can not afford to lose interest in these chemical phases of the 
testing.

Our experience with the Beam test has been that it is somewhat 
erratic, and does not always give the equivalent results in the hands of 
different operators, for some reason.
Of course, there again, we have run some of our tests on plants where 
we know we have had them in storage for some years.
It is rather puzzling there is no reaction there.

MR. WOLLNER: No reaction? 

MR. LANCASTER: On prolonged storage. 

MR. WOLLNER: Under what conditions was that hemp stored? 

MR. LANCASTER: In a large glass stopped bottle. However, we have to 
check that again, because of the results of this vegetation which remained 
an open field, which is another puzzle.

MR. WOLLNER: That is where we all find ourselves at the moment.
What I would like to hear from the group is something in the way of 
suggestions as to how this problem can be

168

most competently attacked. What is to be done? The problem is not a 
simple one, although there is no indication as to its complexity. I say it is 
not a simple problem, because if material has not been advanced after 
several thousand years of experience there must be some barrier there. 
Is there any technique which should be considered which has not been 
considered?
Dr. Hibben, have you any suggestions along this line?

DR. HIBBEN: That is rather a difficult question. I think we are 
proceeding correctly.
I think the first thing that has to be done is developing an adequate 
method for determining the content of the active principle, and until such a 
method is developed, there is not going to be very much room for 
improvement.

MR. WOLLNER: The only difficulty has been that this problem has been 
very much the problem of peeling an onion--the more you peel, apparently 
the more peels you can take off, until you peel away the onion and then 
there is nothing left.

DR. HIBBEN: That is quite true. But I do not think there has been any 
comprehensive, systematic work done on the problem, by an adequate 
chemical staff, under ade-

169

quate direction.

MR. WOLLNER: The first thing seems to be to find the active principle. 
That is a different proposition.

DR. MUNCH: Has any work been done on the chlorophyl of the leaf?

DR. MATCHETT: All the work we know of is what you have done.

DR. MUNCH: The only thought I have is, if the chlorophyll of Marihuana 
happens to be different from all other chlorophylls in the universe, it can 
be identified microscopically.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Hibben, you have run some microscopic tests on 
Cannabis direct for the chlorophyll. 

DR. HIBBEN: I did not look for chlorophyll. I say that is very desirable, 
but I say they would be very doubtful on the chlorophyll alone.

DR. MATCHETT: Of course, there are some points about that. 

MR. VALAER: The chemistry of opium was very uncertain for a long, 
long time. We had a crude mass to work with, and gradually they pulled out 
one hundred pieces or more. I believe, after all, we have not been interested 
in this more than about two years. I believe the chemical crude resin 
Marihuana will work out in the same way. We have two stills upstairs. We 
have a good many people

170

working on it in extracts and various ways, even now in this brief time.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Couch, do you have anything to offer?

DR. COUCH: I would like to say that this problem is in no more 
desperate condition than a great many other problems in which a solution 
has not been reached. They all present this picture before the real work is 
done in solving it which makes it all seem extremely baffling.
It is very curious that by plugging along and keeping infernally at it, 
that one of these days the problem is solved almost before it is realized, 
and it seems to me that the lines that have been projected here and the 
lines that have been followed are exactly those that should be followed, and 
will, in the course of time, lead to the solution of the problem; I mean the 
information that you desire to have.
There is one thing that occurs to me that has not been mentioned, and 
that is if any work has been done upon the smoke from Marihuana, as the 
smoke is physiologically active.

It may be different from the resin taken by mouth or injected into the 
veins. That is another matter. But it seems to me that there is something 
there that might

171

be developed as a test for identity.

MR. SMITH: I think Dr. Hershfield did something on that chlorophyll 
work which he did two years ago.

DR. COUCH: Of course, along that line is also the possibility of 
reaction from the protein. It simply rests on the possibility and probability 
that that is, of course, the leafy tissue, and the extract probably would not 
serve.
The leafy portion would contain some propein. That with a water 
extract or salt extract of the plant itself, in a very short time would get 
positive results, one away or the other.
The difficulty there is there may be present some protein that is also 
present in another plant. That difficulty arises, but the precipitation 
reactions are amazingly specific and amazingly direct.
When one goes from one animal tissue to another he has to wash his 
hands extremely carefully as he changes over from one to another, so as not 
to spoil the test in the next tissue. There is that sort of delicacy.
I simply offer that as a test. I presume there has already been a lot of 
thought discounted on that subject.

MR. WOLLNER: I do not know of that test. Dr. Loewe? 

DR. LOEWE: If I may bring up the encroachment which

172

is in doubt, it has been known thousands and thousands of years that sex 
cells contain an active principle. However, it has taken up to this century to 
get hold of those active principles, and the reason was not the difficulty 
with respect to chemistry, but the difficulty was that there was no test 
for the active principle only as an active principle, and no chemical tests 
were given.
This is the same situation in Cannabis with one exception, and we 
know the physiological test for the active principle is given. It is much 
more easily accessible. This biological test is much more easily accessible, 
so there is a test, and the thing which has not yet been done, at least not 
yet systematically enough, is to dovetail the identification of the active 
principle by its active nature by a biological test.
I think this specific picture of the dovetail work gives immediately 
the solution, unless somebody is inclined to drop the whole thing.
But I again remember that same situation in the female hormone and 
the male hormone, which involves just this one property to give a beautiful 
color reaction. However, it did not take more than five years after finding 
the right test and using the right test in the right way from the first 
isolation of the principle. I think

173

this is the way prescribed.

MR. WOLLNER: Do you know of any experiments, Dr. Loewe, that have 
been performed on the smoke itself? 

DR. LOEWE: No.

DR. BLATT: I know of where they took the Marihuana smoke and passed 
it through solvents.

DR. LOEWE: Through chloroform? 

DR. BLATT: No, through water. 

DR. LOEWE Water, rather than chloroform?

DR. BLATT: Yes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: There is a great deal of work being done at 
the present time with respect to the use of opium smoke. A paper has just 
been prepared by someone in a laboratory in London, which has just been 
issued. Are you familiar with Dr. Nicholls?

MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. Nicholls was mentioned in connection with 
the research today.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that the same Nicholls who is on the 
Opium Assay Committee?

DR. BLATT: I was going to say very much the same thing as Dr. Loewe 
said; that is, that I can not see any reason for being discouraged as far as 
chemistry is concerned.
Now, you have got a perfectly good point of attack.

174

The amazing thing about this whole problem is that nothing has been 
done with the exception of this one matter in 1932, when it was 
established that crude Cannabinol behaves like a pure substance, and the 
customary high vacuum distillation technique fails to separate it into its 
constituents. 
The work has been apparently dropped from that time on.
The surprising thing is that someone has not jumped into that.

MR. WOLLNER: Of course, there has been no commercial demand in that 
respect, .and that is one of the reasons for that.

DR. BLATT: It is difficult to get hold of the material. 

DR. HIBBEN: If you want to get something on spectroscopic methods, 
when these chemists leave the point where there are spectroscopic 
methods for determination and for determining the structure, they would 
aid greatly in facilitating this problem.

MR. WOLLNER: It would aid greatly.

DR. MATCHETT: We would like to ask Dr. Hlbben if there are not some 
such methods which may be correlated to the bioassay?

175

The essential or volatile oils come out of this material very readily. 
It can be narrowed down to relatively few compounds.
If we knew, separately, the spectra of these various materials, would 
it not help to follow the separations at that stage of operations?

DR. HIBBEN: Yes, I think it would. You can start in by that procedure on 
hormones.

DR. MATCHETT: And I believe also carotenoids. 

DR. HIBBEN: Yes.

DR. MATCHETT: As the fractionation goes further and further, the 
number of bioassays increases almost without limit, and that is one reason 
we were particularly interested in it.
Also, the quantitative phase has to be considered. 

DR. LOEWE: But, as an economic matter, and the rational method is to 
proceed in an economical way, which can be done by carefully choosing 
fractions to test.

DR. MATCHETT: I do not believe we could quarrel about that.

DR. MUNCH: Doctor, there is the other thought, and that is that we have 
not been picking on any of the prisoners lately.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, we are not dealing

176

with the same problem as opium, where we can take the addict to a hospital 
at Lexington and go through all of the experiments.
There is a little danger that this drug might affect a man 
permanently. He might do something which we may be sorry for later.
I think that must be given serious thought.

DR. WRIGHT: Dr. Wollner, I will not be very long now, but I just want 
to clarify a point, and it would seem from reports and other information 
that the tests are rather indicative of hemp rather than of the active prin-
ciple.

I am saying that for this reason: We would like to be in a position to 
approach the development of strains that were free from the active 
principle,
Now, until we have a test it seems to be that we can not do anything.

MR. WOLLNER: Yes, and no.

DR. WRIGHT: I will say it is possible that one of these tests may be 
useful from a breeding standpoint, but it seems to me it is working entirely 
on a guess,
It would seem to me that any approach would be resolving the strains 
in pure breeding alone. In other words, approach the inbreeding situation in 
a hybrid manner;

177

that is the approach we want, but it would seem to me that all we could do 
at this state would be to develop those lines at random.

In other words, set up as many facilities as we could for pure 
breeding lines. Any individual plant that would be tested would be very 
indefinite as to what its progeny would be, and it would seem to me that 
that is more or less a blind approach; shall I say a lick in the dark; and we 
would have to develop as many as we could. We can do that, develop as many 
lines as possible, like in Prussic acid in Sudan grass.
My point is, and I am mentioning it to you chemists, that we can get 
nowhere without a test of consequence. We might be lucky. About ten 
thousand chances to one, we might be lucky until we have a test.

MR. WOLLNER: In the last analysis, you are unquestionably correct 
about that. Really, before significant progress can be made by the 
agricultural people, we will have to provide you with a formula.
Before we adjourn, I would like to invite any of the visiting friends 
present to come upstairs for a few minutes and see our laboratory set-up 
for tackling this job, the molecular stills, and extraction equipment, and I 
am quite sure you will enjoy it.

178

And I want to really express my appreciation and thanks for your kind 
cooperation in helping to clarify these issues.

(Whereupon, at 5:10 o'clock p.m., the Conference was adjourned sine 
die.)
