<h2>Aldous Huxley on Self-Transcedence</h2>

<h4>The Epilog of <br>
<i>The Devils of Loudun</i></h4>

<p> <i>Introduction</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Aldous Huxley writes here about self-transcendence and the
    various methods used in its pursuit. He expresses opinions
    about the use of drugs which might surprise many readers,
    until it is realized that his opinions here were expressed
    before his first experiences with psychedelic drugs: the
    following is the Epilogue to <i>The Devils of Loudun,</i>
    published in 1952. Very soon thereafter, Huxley was to take
    the psychedelic drug mescaline under the guidance of the
    Canadian psychiatrist and researcher Humphrey Osmond. In 1954
    Huxley published <i>The Doors of Perception</i> which
    represented a metamorphosis in his opinion about the use of
    drugs. Such complete reversals of thinking on the basis of
    evidence are, unfortunately, far too rare among professionals
    of any kind, and the comparison of what is written here with <i>The
    Doors of Perception</i> should provide an important lesson to
    the many researchers and politicians who have since denounced
    psychedelic drugs as a &quot;scourge of humanity&quot;: in
    the following piece we hear some of the very same ignorant
    pronouncements about drugs still echoed today by those having
    the least direct knowledge of the potential of psychedelic
    drugs to assist humanity to find a more satisfying and
    ecological mode of existence. <br>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Without an understanding of man's deep-seated
urge to self-transcendence, of his very natural reluctance to
take the hard, ascending way, and his search for some bogus
liberation either below or to one side of his personality, we
cannot hope to make sense of our own particular period of history
or indeed of history in general, of life as it was lived in the
past and as it is lived today. For this reason I propose to
discuss some of the more common Grace- substitutes, into which
and by means of which men and women have tried to escape from the
tormenting consciousness of being merely themselves. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In France there is now one retailer of alcohol to
every hundred inhabitants, more or less. In the United States
there are probably at least a million desperate alcoholics,
besides a much larger number of very heavy drinkers whose disease
has not yet become mortal. Regarding the consumption of
intoxicants in the past we have no precise or statistical
knowledge. In Western Europe, among the Celts and Teutons, and
throughout medieval and early modern times, the individual intake
of alcohol was probably even greater than it is today. On the
many occasions when we drink tea, or coffee, or soda pop, our
ancestors refreshed themselves with wine, beer, mead and, in
later centuries, with gin, brandy and usquebaugh. The regular
drinking of water was a penance imposed on wrongdoers, or
accepted by the religious, along with occasional vegetarianism,
as a very severe mortification. Not to drink an intoxicant was an
eccentricity sufficiently remarkable to call for comment and the
using of a more or less disparaging nickname. Hence such
patronymics as the Italian Bevilacqua, the French Boileau and the
English Drinkwater <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alcohol is but one of the many drugs employed by
human beings as avenues of escape from the insulated self. Of the
natural narcotics, stimulants and hallucinators there is, I
believe, not a single one whose properties have not been known
from time immemorial. Modern research has given us a host of
brand new synthetics; but in regard to the natural poisons it has
merely developed better methods of extracting, concentrating and
recombining those already known. From poppy to curare, from
Andean coca to Indian hemp and Siberian agaric, every plant or
bush or fungus capable, when ingested, of stupefying or exciting
or evoking visions, has long since been discovered and
systematically employed. The fact is strangely significant; for
it seems to prove that, always and everywhere, human beings have
felt the radical inadequacy of their personal existence, the
misery of being their insulated selves and not something else,
something wider, something in Wordsworthian phrase, &quot;far
more deeply interfused.&quot; Exploring the world around him,
primitive man evidently &quot;tried all things and held fast to
that which was good.&quot; For the purpose of self-preservation
the good is every edible fruit and leaf, every wholesome seed,
root and nut. But in another context&#151;the context of
self-dissatisfaction and the urge to self- transcendence&#151;the
good is everything in nature by means of which the quality of
individual consciousness can be changed. Such drug-induced
changes may be manifestly for the worse, may be at the price of
present discomfort and future addiction, degeneration and
premature death. All this is of no moment. What matters is the
awareness, if only for an hour or two, if only for a few minutes,
of being someone or, more often, something other than the
insulated self. &quot;I live, yet not I, but wine or opium or
peyotl or hashish liveth in me.&quot; To go beyond the limits of
the insulated ego is such a liberation that, even when
self-transcendence is through nausea into frenzy, through cramps
into hallucinations and coma, the drug induced experience has
been regarded by primitives and even by the highly civilized as
intrinsically divine. Ecstasy through intoxication is still an
essential part of the religion of many African, South American
and Polynesian peoples. It was once, as the surviving documents
clearly prove, a no less essential part of the religion of the
Celts, the Teutons, the Greeks, the peoples of the Middle East
and the Aryan conquerors of India. It is not merely that
&quot;beer does more than Milton can to justify God's ways to
man.&quot; Beer is the god. Among the Celts, Sabazios was the
divine name given to the felt alienation of being dead drunk on
ale. Further to the south, Dionysos was, among other things, the
supernatural objectification of the psychophysical effects of too
much wine. In Vedic mythology, Indra was the god of that now
unidentifiable drug called soma. Hero, slayer of dragons, he was
the magnified projection upon heaven of the strange and glorious
otherness experienced by the intoxicated. Made one with the drug,
he becomes, as Soma-Indra, the source of immortality, the
mediator between the human and the divine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In modern times beer and the other toxic short cuts
to self-transcendence are no longer officially worshipped as
gods. Theory has undergone a change, but not practice; for in
practice millions upon millions of civilized men and women
continue to pay their devotions, not to the liberating and
transfiguring Spirit, but to alcohol, to hashish, to opium and
its derivatives, to the barbiturates, and the other synthetic
additions to the age-old catalogue of poisons capable of causing
self-transcendence. In every case, of course, what seems a god is
actually a devil, what seems a liberation is in fact an
enslavement. The self-transcendence is invariably downward into
the less than human, the lower than personal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like intoxication, elementary sexuality, indulged
in for its own sake and divorced from love, was once a god,
worshipped not only as the principle of fecundity, but as a
manifestation of the radical Otherness immanent in every human
being. In theory, elementary sexuality has long since ceased to
be a god. But in practice it can still boast of a countless host
of sectaries. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is an elementary sexuality which is innocent,
and there is an elementary sexuality which is morally and
aesthetically squalid. D. H. Lawrence has written very
beautifully of the first; Jean Genet, with horrifying power and
in copious detail, of the second. The sexuality of Eden and the
sexuality of the sewer&#151;both of them have power to carry the
individual beyond the limits of his or her insulated self. But
the second and (one would sadly guess) the commoner variety takes
those who indulge in it to a lower level of subhumanity, evokes
the consciousness, and leaves the memory, of a completer
alienation, than does the first. Hence, for all those who feel
the urge to escape from their imprisoning identity, the perennial
attraction of debauchery and of such strange equivalents of
debauchery as have been described in the course of this
narrative. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In most civilized communities public opinion
condemns debauchery and drug addiction as being ethically wrong.
And to moral disapproval is added fiscal discouragement and legal
repression. Alcohol is heavily taxed, the sale of narcotics is
everywhere prohibited and certain sexual practices are treated as
crimes. But when we pass from drug-taking and elementary
sexuality to the third main avenue of downward
self-transcendence, we find, on the part of moralists and
legislators, a very different and much more indulgent attitude.
This seems all the more surprising since crowd-delirium, as we
may call it, is more immediately dangerous to social order, more
dramatically a menace to that thin crust of decency,
reasonableness and mutual tolerance which constitutes a
civilization, than either drink or debauchery. True, a
generalized and long-continued habit of overindulgence in
sexuality may result, as J. D. Unwin has argued,*( J. D. Unwin, <i>Sex
and Culture</i>, London, 1934), in lowering the energy level of
an entire society, thereby rendering it incapable of reaching or
maintaining a high degree of civilization. Similarly drug
addiction, if sufficiently widespread may lower the military,
economic and political efficiency of the society in which it
prevails. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries raw alcohol
was the secret weapon of the European slave traders; heroin, in
the twentieth, of the Japanese militarists. Dead drunk, the Negro
was an easy prey. As for the Chinese drug addict, he could be
relied upon to make no trouble for his conquerors. But these
cases are exceptional. When left to itself, a society generally
manages to come to terms with its favorite poison. The drug is a
parasite on the body politic, but a parasite which its host (to
speak metaphorically) has strength and sense enough to keep under
control. And the same applies to sexuality. No society which
based its sexual practices upon the theories of the Marquis de
Sade could possibly survive; and in fact no society has ever come
near to doing such a thing. Even the most easygoing of the
Polynesian paradises have their rules and regulations, their
categorical imperatives and commandments. Against excessive
sexuality, as against excessive drug-taking, societies seem to be
able to protect themselves with some degree of success. Their
defense against crowd-delirium and its often disastrous
consequences is, in all too many cases, far less adequate. The
professional moralists who inveigh against drunkenness are
strangely silent about the equally disgusting vice of
herd-intoxication&#151;of downward self-transcendence into
subhumanity by the process of getting together in a mob. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Where two or three are gathered together in
my name, there am I in the midst of them.&quot; In the midst of
two or three hundred, the divine presence becomes more
problematical. And when the numbers run into the thousands, or
tens of thousands, the likelihood of God being there, in the
consciousness of each individual, declines almost to the
vanishing point. For such is the nature of an excited crowd (and
every crowd is automatically self-exciting) that, where two or
three thousand are gathered together, there is an absence not
merely of deity, but even of common humanity. The fact of being
one of a multitude delivers a man from his consciousness of being
an insulated self and carries him down into a less than personal
realm, where there are no responsibilities, no right or wrong, no
need for thought or judgment or discrimination &#151;only a
strong vague sense of togetherness, only a shared excitement, a
collective alienation. And the alienation is at once more
prolonged and less exhausting than that induced by debauchery;
the morning after less depressing than that which follows
self-poisoning by alcohol or morphine. Moreover, the
crowd-delirium can be indulged in, not merely without a bad
conscience, but actually, in many cases, with a positive glow of
conscious virtue. For, so far from condemning the practice of
downward self-transcendence through herd-intoxication, the
leaders of church and state have actively encouraged the practice
whenever it could be used for the furtherance of their own ends.
Individually and in the co-ordinated and purposive groups which
constitute a healthy society, men and women display a certain
capacity for rational thought and free choice in the light of
ethical principles. Herded into mobs, the same men and women
behave as though they possessed neither reason nor free will.
Crowd-intoxication reduces them to a condition of infrapersonal
and antisocial irresponsibility. Drugged by the mysterious poison
which every excited herd secretes, they fall into a state of
heightened suggestibility, resembling that which follows an
injection of sodium amytal or the induction, by whatever means,
of a light hypnotic trance. While in this state they will believe
any nonsense that may be bawled at them, will act upon any
command or exhortation, however senseless, mad or criminal. To
men and women under the influence of herd-poison, &quot;whatever
I say three times is true&quot;&#151;and whatever I say three
hundred times is Revelation, is the directly inspired Word of
God. That is why men in authority&#151;the priests and the rulers
of peoples&#151;have never unequivocally proclaimed the
immorality of this form of downward self-transcendence. True,
crowd-delirium evoked by members of the opposition and in the
name of heretical principles has everywhere been denounced by
those in power. But crowd- delirium aroused by government agents,
crowd-delirium in the name of orthodoxy, is an entirely different
matter. In all cases where it can be made to serve the interests
of the men controlling church and state, downward
self-transcendence by means of herd-intoxication is treated as
something legitimate, and even highly desirable. Pilgrimages and
political rallies, corybantic revivals and patriotic
parades&#151;these things are ethically right so long as they are
<i>our</i> pilgrimages, <i>our</i> rallies, <i>our</i> revivals
and <i>our</i> parades. The fact that most of those who take part
in these affairs are temporarily dehumanized by herd-poison is of
no account in comparison with the fact that their dehumanization
may be used to consolidate the religious and political powers
that be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When crowd-delirium is exploited for the benefit of
governments and orthodox churches, the exploiters are always very
careful not to allow the intoxication to go too far. The ruling
minorities make use of their subjects' craving for downward
self-transcendence in order, first, to amuse and distract them
and, second, to get them into a subpersonal state of heightened
suggestibility. Religious and political ceremonials are welcomed
by the masses as opportunities for getting drunk on herd-poison,
and by their rulers as opportunities for planting suggestions in
minds which have momentarily ceased to be capable of reason or
free will. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The final symptom of herd-intoxication is a
maniacal violence. Instances of crowd- delirium culminating in
gratuitous destructiveness, in ferocious self-mutilation, in
fratricidal savagery without purpose and against the elementary
interests of all concerned, are to be met with on almost every
page of the anthropologists' textbooks and&#151;a little less
frequently, but still with dismal regularity &#151;in the
histories of even the most highly civilized peoples. Except when
they wish to liquidate an unpopular minority the official
representatives of state and church are chary of evoking a frenzy
which they cannot be sure of controlling. No such scruples
restrain the revolutionary leader, who hates the <i>status quo</i>
and has only one wish&#151;to create a chaos on which, when he
comes to power, he may impose a new kind of order. When the
revolutionary exploits men's urge to downward self-transcendence,
he exploits it to the frantic and demoniac limit. To men and
women sick of being their insulated selves and weary of the
responsibilities which go with membership in a purposive human
group, he offers exciting opportunities for &quot;getting away
from it all&quot; in parades and demonstrations and public
meetings. The organs of the body politic are purposive groups. A
crowd is the social equivalent of a cancer. The poison it
secretes depersonalizes its constituent members to the point
where they start to behave with a savage violence, of which, in
their normal state, they would be completely incapable. The
revolutionary encourages his followers to manifest this last and
worst symptom of herd-intoxication and then proceeds to direct
their frenzy against his enemies, the holders of political,
economic and religious power. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of the last forty years the
techniques for exploiting man's urge toward this most dangerous
form of downward self-transcendence have reached a pitch of
perfection unmatched in all of history. To begin with, there are
more people to the square mile than ever before, and the means of
transporting vast herds of them from considerable distances, and
of concentrating them in a single building or arena, are much
more efficient than in the past. Meanwhile, new and previously
undreamed-of devices for exciting mobs have been invented. There
is the radio, which has enormously extended the range of the
demagogue's raucous yelling. There is the loudspeaker, amplifying
and indefinitely reduplicating the heady music of class- hatred
and militant nationalism. There is the camera (of which it was
once naively said that &quot;it cannot lie&quot;) and its
offspring, the movies and television; these three have made the
objectification of tendentious phantasy absurdly easy. And
finally there is that greatest of our social inventions, free,
compulsory education. Everyone now knows how to read and everyone
consequently is at the mercy of the propagandists, governmental
or commercial, who own the pulp factories, the linotype machines
and the rotary presses. Assemble a mob of men and women
previously conditioned by a daily reading of newspapers; treat
them to amplified band music, bright lights, and the oratory of a
demagogue who (as demagogues always are) is simultaneously the
exploiter and the victim of herd-intoxication, and in next to no
time you can reduce them to a state of almost mindless
subhumanity. Never before have so few been in a position to make
fools, maniacs or criminals of so many. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Communist Russia, in Fascist Italy, in Nazi
Germany, the exploiters of humanity's fatal taste for herd-poison
have followed an identical course. When in revolutionary
opposition, they encouraged the mobs under their influence to
become destructively violent. Later, when they had come to power,
it was only in relation to foreigners and selected scapegoats
that they permitted herd-intoxication to run its full course.
Having acquired a vested interest in the <i>status quo</i>, they
now checked the descent into subhumanity at a point well this
side of frenzy. For these neo-conservatives, mass intoxication
was chiefly valuable, henceforward, as a means for heightening
their subjects' suggestibility and so rendering them more docile
to the expressions of authoritarian will. Being in a crowd is the
best known antidote to independent thought. Hence the dictators'
rooted objection to &quot;mere psychology&quot; and a private
life. &quot;Intellectuals of the world, unite! You have nothing
to lose but your brains.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drugs, elementary sexuality and
herd-intoxication&#151;these are the three most popular avenues
of downward self-transcendence. There are many others, not so
well trodden as these great descending highways, but leading no
less surely to the same infra-personal goal. Consider, for
example, the way of rhythmic movement. In primitive religions
prolonged rhythmic movement is very commonly resorted to for the
purpose of inducing a state of infra-personal and subhuman
ecstasy. The same technique for achieving the same end has been
used by many civilized peoples&#151;by the Greeks, for example,
by the Hindus, by many of the orders of Dervishes in the Islamic
world, by such Christian sects as the Shakers and the Holy
Rollers. In all these cases rhythmic movement, long-drawn and
repetitive, is a form of ritual deliberately practiced for the
sake of the downward self-transcendence resulting from it.
History also records many sporadic outbreaks of involuntary and
uncontrollable jigging, swaying and head-wagging. These epidemics
of what in one region is called Tarantism, in another St. Vitus's
dance, have generally occurred in times of trouble following
wars, pestilences and famines, and are most common where malaria
is endemic. The unwitting purpose of the men and women who
succumb to these collective manias is the same as that pursued by
the sectaries who use the dance as a religious rite&#151;namely,
to escape from insulated selfhood into a state in which there are
no responsibilities, no guilt-laden past or haunting future, but
only the present, blissful consciousness of being someone else. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Intimately associated with the ecstasy-producing
rite of rhythmic movement is the ecstasy-producing rite of
rhythmic sound. Music is as vast as human nature and has
something to say to men and women on every level of their being,
from the self-regardingly sentimental to the abstractly
intellectual, from the merely visceral to the spiritual. In one
of its innumerable forms music is a powerful drug, partly
stimulant and partly narcotic, but wholly alterative. No man,
however highly civilized, can listen for very long to African
drumming, or Indian chanting, or Welsh hymn-singing, and retain
intact his critical and self-conscious personality. It would be
interesting to take a group of the most eminent philosophers from
the best universities, shut them up in a hot room with Moroccan
dervishes or Haitian voodooists, and measure, with a stop watch,
the strength of their psychological resistance to the effects of
rhythmic sound. Would the Logical Positivists be able to hold out
longer than the Subjective Idealists; Would the Marxists prove
tougher than the Thomists or the Vedantists? What a fascinating,
what a fruitful field for experiment! Meanwhile, all we can
safely predict is that, if exposed long enough to the tom-toms
and the singing, every one of our philosophers would end by
capering and howling with the savages. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ways of rhythmic movement and of rhythmic sound
are generally superimposed, so to speak, upon the way of
herd-intoxication. But there are also private roads, roads which
can be taken by the solitary traveler who has no taste for
crowds, or no strong faith in the principles, institutions and
persons in whose name crowds are assembled. One of these private
roads is the way of the <i>mantram</i>, the way of what Christ
called &quot;vain repetition.&quot; In public worship &quot;vain
repetition&quot; is almost always associated with rhythmic sound.
Litanies and the like are chanted, or at least intoned. It is as
music that they produce their quasi-hypnotic effects. &quot;Vain
repetition,&quot; when practiced privately, acts upon the mind,
not because of its association with rhythmic sound (for it works
even when the words are merely imagined), but in virtue of a
concentration of attention and memory. The constant reiteration
of the same word or phrase frequently brings on a state of light
or even profound trance. Once induced, this trance can either be
enjoyed for its own sake, as a delicious sense of infra-personal
otherness, or else deliberately used for the purpose of improving
personal conduct by autosuggestion and of preparing the way for
the ultimate achievement of upward self-transcendence. Of the
second possibility more will be said in a later paragraph. Here
our concern is with &quot;vain repetition&quot; as a descending
road into an infra- personal alienation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We must now consider a strictly physiological
method of escape from insulated selfhood. The way of corporal
penance. The destructive violence which is the final symptom of
herd- intoxication is not invariably directed outward. The
history of religion abounds in gruesome tales of gregarious
self-whipping, self-gashing, self-gelding, even self-killing.
These acts are the consequences of crowd-delirium, and are
performed in a state of frenzy. Very different is the corporal
penance undertaken privately and in cold blood. Here the
self-torment is initiated by an act of the personal will; but its
result (in some cases at least) is a temporary transformation of
the insulated personality into something else. In itself, this
something else is the consciousness, so intense as to be
exclusive, of physical pain. The self-tortured person identifies
himself with his pain and, in becoming merely the awareness of
his suffering body, is delivered from that sense of past guilt
and present frustration, that obsessive anxiety about the future,
which constitute so large a part of the neurotic ego. There has
been an escape from selfhood, a downward passage into a state of
pure physiological excruciation. But the self-tormentor need not
necessarily remain in this region of infra-personal
consciousness. Like the man who makes use of &quot;vain
repetition&quot; to go beyond himself, he may be able to use his
temporary alienation from selfhood as the bridge, so to speak,
leading upward into the life of the spirit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This raises a very important and difficult
question. To what extent, and in what circumstances, is it
possible for a man to make use of the descending road as a way to
spiritual self-transcendence; As first sight it would seem
obvious that the way down is not and can never be the way up. But
in the realm of existence matters are not quite so simple as they
are in our beautifully tidy world of words. In actual life a
downward movement may sometimes be made the beginning of an
ascent. When the shell of the ego has been cracked and there
begins to be a consciousness of the subliminal and physiological
othernesses underlying personality, it sometimes happens that we
catch a glimpse, fleeting but apocalyptic, of that other
Otherness, which is the Ground of all being. So long as we are
confined within our insulated selfhood, we remain unaware of the
various not-selves with which we are associated&#151;the organic
not-self, the subconscious not-self, the collective not-self of
the psychic medium in which all our thinking and feeling have
their existence, and the immanent and transcendent not-self of
the Spirit. Any escape, even by a descending road, out of
insulated selfhood makes possible at least a momentary awareness
of the not-self on every level, including the highest. William
James, in his <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, gives
instances of &quot;anaesthetic revelations,&quot; following the
inhalation of laughing gas. Similar theophanies are sometimes
experienced by alcoholics, and there are probably moments in the
course of intoxication by almost any drug, when awareness of a
not-self superior to the disintegrating ego becomes briefly
possible. But these occasional flashes of revelation are bought
at an enormous price. For the drugtaker, the moment of spiritual
awareness (if it comes at all) gives place very soon to subhuman
stupor, frenzy or hallucination, followed by dismal hangovers
and, in the long run, by a permanent and fatal impairment of
bodily health and mental power. Very occasionally a single
&quot;anaesthetic revelation&quot; may act, like any other
theophany, to incite its recipient to an effort of
self-transformation and upward self-transcendence. But the fact
that such a thing sometimes happens can never justify the
employment of chemical methods of self-transcendence. This is a
descending road and most of those who take it will come to a
state of degradation, where periods of subhuman ecstasy alternate
with periods of conscious selfhood so wretched that any escape,
even if it be into the slow suicide of drug addiction, will seem
preferable to being a person. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What is true of drugs is true, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
of elementary sexuality. The road runs downhill; but on the way
there may occasionally be theophanies. The Dark Gods, as Lawrence
called them, may change their sign and become bright. In India
there is a Tantric yoga, based upon an elaborate
psychophysiological technique, whose purpose is to transform the
downward self-transcendence of elementary sexuality into an
upward self-transcendence. In the West the nearest equivalent to
these Tantric practices was the sexual discipline devised by John
Humphrey Noyes and practiced by the members of the Oneida
Community. At Oneida elementary sexuality was not only
successfully civilized; it was made compatible with, and
subordinate to, a form of Protestant Christianity, sincerely
preached and earnestly acted upon. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Herd-intoxication disintegrates the ego more
thoroughly than does elementary sexuality. Its frenzies, its
follies, its heightened suggestibility can be matched only in the
intoxications induced by such drugs as alcohol, hashish and
heroin. But even to the member of an excited mob there may come
(at some relatively early stage of his downward
self-transcendence) a genuine revelation of the Otherness that is
above selfhood. This is one of the reasons why some good may
sometimes come out of even the most corybantic of revival
meetings. Some good as well as very great evil may also result
from the fact that men and women in a crowd tend to become more
than ordinarily suggestible. While in this state they are
subjected to exhortations which have the force, when they come
once again to their senses, of posthypnotic commands. Like the
demagogue, the revivalist and the ritualist disintegrate the ego
of their hearers by herding them together and dosing them with
plenty of vain repetition and rhythmic sound. Then, unlike the
demagogue, they give suggestions some of which may be genuinely
Christian. These, if they &quot;take,&quot; result in a
reintegration of broken-down personalities on a somewhat higher
level. There can also be reintegrations of personality under the
influence of the posthypnotic commands issued by a rabble-rousing
politician. But these commands are all incitements to hatred on
the one hand and to blind obedience and compensatory illusion on
the other. Initiated by a massive dose of herd-poison, confirmed
and directed by the rhetoric of a maniac who is at the same time
a Machiavellian exploiter of other men's weakness, political
&quot;conversion&quot; results in the creation of a new
personality worse than the old and much more dangerous because
wholeheartedly devoted to a party whose first aim is the
liquidation of its opponents. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have distinguished between demagogues and
religionists, on the ground that the latter may sometimes do some
good, whereas the former can scarcely, in the very nature of
things, do anything but harm. But it must not by imagined that
the religious exploiters of herd-intoxication are wholly
guiltless. On the contrary, they have been responsible in the
past for mischiefs almost as enormous as those brought upon their
victims (along with the victims of those victims) by the
revolutionary demagogues of our own time. In the course of the
last six or seven generations, the power of religious
organizations to do evil has, throughout the Western world,
considerably declined. Primarily this is due to the astounding
progress of applied science and the consequent demand by the
masses for compensatory illusions that have an air of being
positivistic rather than metaphysical. The demagogues offer such
pseudo-positivistic illusions and the churches do not. As the
attractiveness of the churches declines, so also does their
influence, so do their wealth, their political power and, along
with these, their capacity for doing evil on a large scale.
Circumstances have now delivered the churchmen from certain of
the temptations, to which, in earlier centuries, their
predecessors almost invariably succumbed. They would be well
advised voluntarily to deliver themselves from such temptations
as still remain. Conspicuous among these is the temptation to
acquire power by pandering to men's insatiable craving for
downward self-transcendence. Deliberately to induce
herd-intoxication&#151;even if it is done in the name of
religion, even if it is all supposedly &quot;for the good&quot;
of the intoxicated&#151;cannot be morally justified. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the subject of horizontal self-transcendence
very little need be said&#151;not because the phenomenon is
unimportant (far from it), but because it is too obvious to
require analysis and of occurrence too frequent to be readily
classifiable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to escape from the horrors of insulated
selfhood most men and women choose, most of the time, to go
neither up nor down, but sideways. They identify themselves with
some cause wider than their own immediate interests, but not
degradingly lower and, if higher, higher only within the range of
current social values. This horizontal, or nearly horizontal,
self- transcendence may be into something as trivial as a hobby,
or as precious as married love. It can be brought about through
self-identification with any human activity, from running a
business to research in nuclear physics, from composing music to
collecting stamps, from campaigning for political office to
educating children or studying the mating habits of birds.
Horizontal self- transcendence is of the utmost importance.
Without it, there would be no art, no science, no law, no
philosophy, indeed no civilization. And there would also be no
war, no <i>odium theologicum</i> or <i>ideologicum</i>, no
systematic intolerance, no persecution. These great goods and
these enormous evils are the fruits of man's capacity for total
and continuous self-identification with an idea, a feeling, a
cause. How can we have the good without the evil, a high
civilization without saturation bombing or the extermination of
religious and political heretics The answer is that we cannot
have it so long as our self-transcendence remains merely
horizontal. When we identify ourselves with an idea or a cause we
are in fact worshipping something homemade, something partial and
parochial, something that, however noble, is yet all too human.
&quot;Patriotism,&quot; as a great patriot concluded on the eve
of her execution by her country's enemies, &quot;is not
enough.&quot; Neither is socialism, nor communism, nor
capitalism; neither is art, nor science, nor public order, nor
any given religion or church. All these are indispensable, but
none of them is enough. Civilization demands from the individual
devoted self-identification with the highest of human causes. But
if this self-identification with what is human is not accompanied
by a conscious and consistent effort to achieve upward
self-transcendence into the universal life of the Spirit, the
goods achieved will always be mingled with counterbalancing
evils. &quot;We make,&quot; wrote Pascal, &quot;an idol of truth
itself; for truth without charity is not God, but His image and
idol, which we must neither love or worship.&quot; And it is not
merely wrong to worship an idol; it is also exceedingly
inexpedient. The worship of truth apart from
charity&#151;self-identification with science unaccompanied by
self-identification with the Ground of all being&#151;results in
the kind of situation which now confronts us. Every idol, however
exalted, turns out, in the long run, to be a Moloch, hungry for
human sacrifice. </p>

Among the Apaches <br>
of the Mescalero Indian Reservation <br>
</b>L. Bryce Boyer, Ruth M. Boyer, <br>
and Harry W. Basehart </font><font size="5">Taken from
_Hallucinogens &amp; Shamanism_ <br>
Edited by Michael J. Harner. 1973, Oxford University Press<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In a volume devoted to the study of shamanism
and hallucinogenic drugs it is important to include data
concerning a group whose experiences with the hallucinogenic
peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii) in shamanistic rituals
resulted in serious conflict and, ultimately, proscription of the
ceremonial use of the drug. 1 Inthis contribution we present
information concerning the Apaches of the Mescalero Indian
Reservation, some of whom used peyote in shamanistic contexts
between about 1870 until some time after 1910. We then examine
some of the reasons why its use was abandoned and why their
accredited shamanistic practices subsequently have excluded the
use of hallucinogens.2 </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Apaches presently living on the reservation
include members of three tribes, in order of descending numbers,
Mescaleros, Chiricahuas, and Lipans (R. M. Boyer, 1962, Appendix
A). The reservation was established in 1873 for the Mescaleros.
The Chiricahuas were taken as prisoners of war in 1886 after the
capitulation of Geronomo and his followers. When they were freed
in 1913, the majority chose to move to the reservation and to
become part of the Mescalero tribe. The Lipans were destroyed as
functioning groups during the latter half of the nineteenth
century, when their few known remaining members joined the
Mescaleros. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nineteenth-century authors stated that the
Mescaleros used peyote in religious rites in 1867 (Methvin,
1899:36-37), the Chiricahuas in 1875 (Tones, 1899:95)1· and the
Lipans in 1885 (Havard, 1885:521; 1886:38). Nevertheless, it is
not generally known that these Apaches ate peyote. They were
excluded from Shonle's (1925) map of the distribution of the use
of peyote in the United States and they were listed as non-users
in a booklet compiled under the aegis of the Bureau of Indian
Affairs (Newberne, 1925.) </font></p>

<p><font size="4">During his field work in the 1930's, Opler
(1936); learned that the Mescaleros had practiced rather
elaborate ceremonies centering on the utilization of peyote for
some forty years and that the Lipans had used it in shamanistic
contexts (Opler, 1938, 1940, 1945)· </font></p>

<p><font size="4">According to the aged informant Antonio Apache,
the Lipans obtained peyote from the Carrizo Indians (Opler,
1938); and the Mescaleros are said to have learned peyote rites
from the Lipans not long before 1870 (LaBarre, 1938) or from the
Tonkawas, Lipans, Yaquis, or other non-Apachean groups of
northern Mexico (Opler, 1936:148). But for some slight degree of
experimentation by today's young people with marijuana and
perhaps LSD, the reservation Apaches are not known to have used
any other hallucinogenic drugs with the exception of alcohol.
Modern informants affirm that peyote has been and may now be used
for social purposes, but that formerly it was ingested only
during Mescalero and Lipan shamanistic ceremonies. We have been
unable to confirm its use during the years 1958-71. No one now
has knowledge of peyote use by the Chiricahuas of the
reservation. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">To understand why the shamanistic use of peyote
was abandoned requires an insight into Apache religious concepts
and a cognizance of personality structure among these people.
Initially we shall summarize the religious tenets. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Aboriginal religio-medical philosophies, the
criteria for according the status of shaman to individuals, and
shamanistic procedures have been similar if not identical among
the three tribes in recorded times (Boyer, 1964)· They conceive
the world to be permeated by supernatural power which has no
intrinsic attribute of good or evil; its virtue resides in its
potency. Power approaches people through the agency of a plant,
animal, or natural phenomenon by means of a dream or other
hallucinatory experience; its acceptance is frequently
accompanied by an ordeal. Ritual instruction may be received
directly from the power or from other shamans. Any person is a
possible power recipient. Thus, Opler (1936:146) described the
Mescaleros as &quot;a tribe of shamans, active or potentially
active.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">An individual might own any number of powers.
If he is thought to use power for purposes which are not oriented
toward the common good, he is accorded the status of witch. Yet
those who are thought to use their powers for the benefit of the
group, the shamans, are implicitly witches since a shaman who
saves a life must then either sacrifice his own or that of a
loved person. Obviously, jealousies, enmities, and suspicion
abound. Each shaman has private instructions concerning the use
of power, and his rites are individually owned. Consistent with
native concepts of leadership and authority (Basehart, 1959,
1960, 1970), there has never been a chief shaman. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Opler's informants stated, and today's Apaches
agree, that ritual peyote use was acquired from personal contact
with power that approached people while it was invested in peyote
flowers or &quot;buttons.&quot; Various Mescalero shamans
acquired peyote power and became leaders of a peyote camp in
which curing and other ceremonies were conducted. During such
rites, various shamans and other participants used and were
affected by peyote, experiencing the usual perceptual and logical
distortions, hallucinations, and physical effects. Whether the
Lipans had a formal peyote camp is not known. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">There is a fundamental incongruity between the
principles involved in ordinary Mescalero shamanistic ceremonies
and the rules that applied to peyote rites. In ordinary
shamanistic practices, a single shaman is tire principal figure
and the experiences of attendants at ceremonies are subordinate.
Religious ecstasy, visions, and communications with supernaturals
are the shaman's prerogatives and validate his power and
efficacy. The use of peyote by other people at ceremonies made
its psychological and physiological effects common, and the
uniqueness of the shaman's experiences disappeared. The peyote
meetings became places in which shamanistic rivalries and
witchcraft flourished. Disruption resulted, rather than
cohesiveness through shared experience. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The peyote ceremonies were not accompanied by
the acceptance of Christian beliefs and practices, and the
Mescaleros never became involved in the Peyote Religion (see
Slotkin, 1956). Instead, the use of peyote was intended to affirm
the vitality of traditional religious practices at a time when
the impact of reservation confinement contributed to an increased
awareness of social and cultural deprivation. Yet antagonisms
became so open and bloody that eventually the peyote gatherings
were abandoned. The hostilities which became overt during the
meetings were ascribed to the peyote. Since its use involved
witchcraft practices, its ingestion was equated with the
potential for witchcraft. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It will be recalled that, in the native
conceptualization, power has no intrinsic attribute of good or
evil, and can be used for moral or immoral purposes at the will
of its human owner. To our knowledge, peyote power is unique
among the Mescaleros in that it is uniformly considered to be
bad. Some Mescaleros believe that one other power, the owl, is
intrinsically evil. Thus, the hoot of an owl is considered to
presage death. However, some Apaches regard the owl as the bearer
of the power of a human witch, others believe ghosts to inhabit
owls, and yet others deem owls to be witches whose actions are
motivated by their own evil will or power. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">During 1959-60 there were thirteen accredited
Mescalero, Chiricahua, and Lipan shamans on the reservation.
Perhaps fifteen Mescaleros, here termed pseudoshamans, claimed to
own supernatural power but were considered generally to be
imposters. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">One of the shamans, Ancient One, was the sole
living person known to have participated in the peyote camp. Of
the shamans, only he and Black Eyes (Boyer, 1961; Klopfer and
Boyer, 1961), both Mescaleros, were at times judged to be
witches. It was said that they and two of the pseudoshamans still
used peyote in the illicit practices of witchcraft and love magic
ceremonies, rites which are potentially dangerous to those who
perform them. The shamans, considered to be legitimate possessors
of peyote power, were not punished by that power for their
actions. However, the peyote had &quot;turned back&quot; on the
pseudoshamans. As a consequence, one of them lost one of his legs
in an accident and the other was castigated indirectly when one
of his close relatives was killed and another lost a limb. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Let us turn now to a brief and partial
recapitulation of facets of current socialization practices. R.
M. Boyer (1962) found that child-rearing techniques tend to be
uniform in emotional content, and usually in actual practice,
provided the mother has been brought up on the reservation.
Further, during the prelatency period of a child's growth,
socialization practices strongly resemble aboriginal tactics.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Typically, there is gross inconsistency in the
maternal care of children. Frequently, the baby of the family is
afforded tender and loving care but periodically the mother will
impulsively abandon the infant to the supervision of others,
sometimes to children of only four or five years of age, for
hours or days while she engages in narcissistic pursuits,
commonly involving drinking. Ordinarily, a husband does not
object to such treatment of small children because his attention
and regard are no more constant. Under such conditions, the
development of a sense of basic trust (Erikson, 1950) is
Stultified; one result is the marked ambivalence and
suspiciousness which form aspects of Apache personality. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">With the birth of a baby, usually when the
previous child is 18 to 24 months old, the older child is
abruptly, and often brutally, displaced. The resultant sibling
rivalry is intense but strongly disapproved. Nevertheless, its
repression is insecure and its effects become blatantly manifest
when teenagers and adults are under the influence of alcohol. We
refer here to only two of the severe psychological traumata
encountered by growing children. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the aboriginal situation, other
socialization practices were reasonably effective in directing
hostilities engendered by such child-rearing practices, for
example, those mentioned above toward outsiders, witches, ghosts
and other culturally defined objects. During the long period when
these Apaches were nomadic hunters, gatherers, and raiders, such
externalization of aggression served to strengthen group
solidarity. With changing life conditions, in the presence of
feeble repression of interfamilial and intragroup resentments,
individuals' hatreds are generally discharged in manners which
result in anomie and various forms of self-destruction (Boyer and
Boyer, 1972)· </font></p>

<p><font size="4">L. B. Boyer's essential research method
consisted of conducting psychoanalytically oriented investigative
interviews (Boyer, 1964a). He had from 1 to 145 interviews each
with 60 different persons of both sexes, ranging in age from 4 to
65 years. He found a personality configuration which was typical
for these Apaches. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">They are impulse-ridden, fear loss of control,
especially of feebly repressed hostile urges, and are suggestible
and phobic. They tend to avoid introspection and seek outer
controls and explanations for their behavior and thoughts. They
are suspicious and dependent and their libidinal attachments are
unstable. The men, who are caught between passive and aggressive
urges, have insecure sexual identities. The typical Apache
personality configuration corresponds with the Western
psychiatric diagnosis of character disorder with hysterical and
impulsive attributes. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">L. B. Boyer was generally considered to be a
shaman and, accordingly, was in an unusually good position to
learn about shamans and their activities. He found them to have
personality configurations that concur with those which are
typical for the Apaches, differing only to the degree to which
they successfully employ imposture and in their having greater
creative potential (Boyer, 1962).3 They are not autocultural
deviants who have resolved serious psychopathological conditions
through assuming shamanistic roles (Ackerknecht, 1943; Devereux,
1956; Silverman, 1967)· The personality structure of the
impostor as delineated by psychoanalysts (Greenacre, 1958) is
clinically similar to that of the usual Apache shaman. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A capacity to regress in the service of the ego
(Kris, 1952) and an ego-controlled availability of primary
process thinking (Freud, 191·5) are related to creativity and
showmanship. These characteristics appear to be necessary for the
successful practice of shamanism and for convincing
impostureship. It is noteworthy that the pseudoshamans who were
interviewed were found clinically to lack creative potentials and
the capacity to use regression in the service of the ego. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Because it was impossible to conduct
psychiatric interviews in depth with all of the shamans and
pseudoshamans, the Rorschach test was employed as a research
adjunct. Protocols were obtained from all Apaches of fifty years
of age and older (referred to here as the old-age group), 12 of
the 13 shamans and 7 pseudoshamans (Boyer, Klopfer, Brawer, and
Kawai, 1964). The protocols of the shamans and pseudoshamans were
compared with those of the old-age group and with each other. As
expected, the protocols of the old-age group showed hysterical
signs. The shamans demonstrated more hysterical signs and,
additionally, a way of handling data with keener awareness of
peculiarities and more selective theoretical interest; they had
creative characteristics and a high degree of reality testing
potential in addition to a capacity to regress in the service of
the ego. Viewed heteroculturally, or within Devereux's framework
of the ideal psychological normal, they more nearly approached
normality than did their culture mates.&quot; The personality of
the pseudoshamans was strikingly different. They were not
hysterical, had variable degrees of reality testing potential,
and impoverished personalities. Klopfer concluded from indirect
data that the shamans were able to use imposture convincingly
whereas pseudoshamans could not.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>COMMENT</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Historical and modern data provide some partial
and tentative answers to the intriguing question of why the
Mescaleros abandoned the use of peyote in shamanistic rituals and
today forbid its use.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Apache child-rearing practices engender much
hostility. Aggression was and is addressed institutionally toward
outsiders, witches, ghosts, and cultural bogies in an attempt to
produce individual repression of hostile impulses originally
directed toward familial and societal members. The effort was
more effective aboriginally but has never been strikingly
successful. In the past, as today, when individuals were under
the influence of hallucinogens, including alcohol, their unstable
repression of hateful impulses toward parent and sibling
surrogates became blatantly overt and threatened tribal unity. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The use of peyote in the camps introduced a
foreign element into Apache shamanistic procedures, the
simultaneous assumption of authority by more than one
practitioner. Each of them vied for supremacy of power and
status. The physiopsychological effects of the hallucinogen
reduced the efficacy of their repression of the hostilities which
had resulted from their socialization experiences. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The drug-induced regression resulted in their
releasing aggression in its earlier, childish form, directly
toward parent and sibling surrogates. Bloodshed and feuds
occurred; the Apache wisely banned the peyote camps. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It would appear that the ascription of the
quality of evil to peyote (power), an act which involved basic
deviation from the conceptualization of power without intrinsic
properties of good or evil, was intended to deny the presence of
intragroup hostility. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The use of peyote was proscribed for shamans;
thenceforth it was employed by possessors of supernatural power
solely in witchcraft rituals, as was owl power, and love magic
practices. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It can be no coincidence that only peyote and
owl power have been considered to be evil in themselves. In each
instance, murderous wishes are projected onto the power in
question. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Mescaleros, Chiricahuas, and Lipans fear
the use of peyote for two stated reasons: (1) it has an evil
power which will drive them to do evil and (2) it causes
hallucinations, that is, reduces their capacity to perceive and
judge external reality accurately. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">There is fear of the visual aberrations and of
the strange qualities of movement encountered. In the first case,
intrapersonal asocial tendencies are projected onto the peyote.
Sexual transgressions arouse little overt anxiety among these
Apaches except when inter-generational incest has occurred, but
they fear their poorly controlled aggressive impulses. The second
case is similar. The Apaches may displace their fear of loss of
control over destructive urges onto fear of loss of control of
perceptual accuracy. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A number of questions remain, of which we shall
deal briefly with three. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">First, why did two shamans continue to use
peyote in illicit practices! Both were considered to be very
powerful and were feared by most Apaches. Black Eyes,
intoxicated, frequently bragged that he was a witch and once
flaunted peyote buttons before the psychoanalytic author. Ancient
One had no need to flaunt his witchcraft potential. He was said
to have killed many individuals, both tribal enemies and Apaches,
sometimes by means which appeared to have required the
intervention of the supernatural. His own children were so awed
by his presumed powers that they even hesitated to whisper their
conviction that he was a witch. Perhaps these two men deemed
themselves to be so strong that they were above social sanctions
and continued to use peyote both to demonstrate their contempt
for their fellow Mescaleros and for material purposes. It is
probable that they could demand greater recompense and command
greater respect from performing rituals which were conceptualized
as illegitimate in Apache practice and belief. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Second, why did two pseudoshamans use peyote in
their rituals? They had impoverished personalities, and were
generally scorned both as shamans and witches and employed solely
by the most suggestible. We postulate that they used peyote in an
attempt to raise their esteem in their eyes and those of others,
hoping that they would truly become powerful if they could
exploit the effects of the hallucinogens. Each of them confided
to L. B. Boyer while intoxicated that they doubted their own
claims of power possession and consciously sought to deceive
others. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Third, the use of alcohol among these Apaches
is commonplace. While it is officially and to some extent
socially disapproved, it is accepted as &quot;one way of
life,&quot; a way accepted even prior to white domination. Under
its influence, hallucinosis is frequent, and exceedingly violent
actions often occur. Further, in the drunken state, perception is
blurred and distorted, paralleling one aspect of the experiences
induced by the ingestion of peyote. Why, then, was the use of
alcohol socially permissible, while peyote was proscribed? A
significant reason would appear to be the incorporation of peyote
into the shamanistic ritual complex from the time of its
introduction to the Apaches; the consumption of alcohol, to our
knowledge, has never been culturally acceptable in ceremonial
contexts. Where the group situation at peyote meetings fostered
conflict centering on the varying powers controlled by and
controlling particular individuals, aggression released during
drinking parties was channeled outside the personally mediated
world of the supernatural. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It will be most interesting to observe future
Apache involvement with hallucinogens, inasmuch as their use has
become commonplace among adolescents and young adults throughout
the United States. Will the ban against the use of peyote extend
to other hallucinatory agents with which Apaches may become
familiar in their increasing intercourse with the world beyond
the reservation? Or, might acquaintance with some hallucinogens
pave the way for the re-definition of peyote, especially in view
of the diminished commitment of the majority of present-day
Apaches to the system of supernatural beliefs associated with
shamanism? </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Research designed to answer these and related
questions should yield significant data for cross-cultural
comparison of processes of sociocultural change.</font></p>

<h4>Foreword</h4>

<h2>THE QUEST FOR INSTANT SATORI</h2>

<h3>S. I. HAYAKAWA</h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p> IN THE COURSE of twenty-two volumes of <i>ETC.,</i> the
present is the fifth special issue. Like our previous special
issues, it is an attempt to examine a topic of current scientific
or theoretical interest from the point of view of general
semantics. </p>

<p> For some time, judging from unsolicited manuscripts coming to
<i>ETC.,</i> it has been clear that there is widespread interest,
both scientific and popular, in drug-induced psychedelic
experiences. <i>ETC.</i> was fortunate in having on its Editorial
Committee Dr. Robert E. Mogar, associate professor of psychology,
San Francisco State College, and director of the Institute for
Psychedelic Research, to serve as editor of this special issue.
He read the manuscripts on hand, invited other contributions, and
arranged the material. Without Dr. Mogar, there would have been
no psychedelic issue, not only because of his skill in selecting
and editing the varied contributions, but more importantly
because his enthusiastic espousal of the project convinced me
that such an issue would be of real service to our readers. </p>

<p> For all my gratitude to Dr. Mogar and the personal regard in
which I hold the contributors to this issue, I am forced by my
own convictions to introduce a discordant note. I am far from
convinced of the therapeutic or &quot;spiritual&quot; value of
the psychedelic experience. Indeed, I cannot get rid of the
feeling that this issue is likely to do the world as much harm as
good. In the present climate of opinion, with hallucinogens like
LSD available on almost every college campus in the U.S., the
glowing accounts of &quot;consciousness-expanding&quot;
experiences resulting from their use under controlled conditions
and responsible supervision are all too likely to be seized upon
as justification for their uncontrolled use without medical or
scientific supervision of any kind. A recent issue of the <i>Gater,</i>
student newspaper at San Francisco State College, carries the
following advertisement (December 3, 1965): </p>

<p> <center>THE PSYCHEDELIC CHAPEL<br>
Presents: &quot;Trip Thru The Astral Plane&quot;<br>
Featuring Recording Artist Ivan Ulz<br>
Service Begins 8:30 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 4, l 10 Page St.<br>
(WHERE The Jet Set MEETS The Sin Crowd)</center> </p>

<p> I shudder as I see in my mind's eye, sitting in the
&quot;chapel,&quot; the Jet Set and the Sin Crowd, &quot;turned
on&quot; and &quot;tripping through the Astral Plane,&quot; with
the music of Recording Artist Ivan Ulz (whatever he sings or
plays) crashing and reverberating through their skulls, each
member with a dog-eared copy of this issue of <i>ETC.</i> in his
pocket. </p>

<p> The most interesting semantic point made by contributors to
this issue is that under the influence of psychedelic drugs, one
is &quot;freed&quot; from the categories and symbolizations
through which our experience is ordinarily presented to us,
bundled, prepackaged, and labeled in terms of the linguistic
conventions (and therefore perceptual habits) of the culture. To
&quot;transcend&quot; these cultural imperatives is asserted to
be an &quot;expanding&quot; of consciousness, so that one sees
afresh&#151;presumably as if one were a little child again. </p>

<p> But is such &quot;transcending&quot; necessarily beneficial?
It is obviously an advantage if you have long been cursed with
inappropriate &quot;maps&quot; of the &quot;territory&quot; of
reality. From seeing afresh, you might start making better maps.
It is an advantage, too, if you have long treated the map as if
it were the territory&#151;that is, if you are so engrossed in
the world of symbolism as to have forgotten what the symbols
stand for. </p>

<p> But what if, like a good poet or scientist, you have long
been accustomed to seeing the world with &quot;consciousness of
abstracting&quot;? What if you have used symbols properly, so
that you have remained constantly aware of the realities behind
the symbols&#151;of the complex, uncategorizable, squirming
&quot;beknottedness of space-time&quot; behind the categories?
The process of abstracting, of creating classifications and
making the symbols that stand for them, are the normal and
necessary survival mechanisms of the human class of life. What is
so wonderful about suspending this great, uniquely human process,
except where the process has gone awry? As Weston La Barre said
in this connection, &quot;It is not immediately evident that an
abnormal toxic functioning of an adaptive organ, the brain, is
necessarily a <i>supernormal</i> functioning&#133;&quot;* </p>

<p> I do not doubt that dangerous substances such as LSD
temporarily shake us up and cause us to &quot;transcend&quot;
habitual ways of experiencing. But transcending of itself is not
enough. What happens afterward? In what ways are perceptions of
the self or the environment altered or restructured for the
better? What conditions produce what changes? The contributors to
this issue, I am sorry to say, touch on these questions but
lightly. </p>

<p> The fact that symbolic processes often go awry is, of course,
well known to general semanticists, who have their own
prescriptions as to what to do about it. These involve, as
Korzybski said, learning to experience at nonverbal levels,
refraining from &quot;bursting into speech,&quot; and maintaining
&quot;silence, within and without.&quot;** These also involve
learning to establish a constant interplay between experiential
and higher levels of abstraction, checking each level against
those below, and all of them against the realities of the world.
Disciplines such as these are not easy to master. They involve
for many of us the upsetting of cherished ideas and the
relinquishing of many long-ingrained automatism of thought and
speech. They also involve <i>time</i>-time to re-experience the
world, time to examine carefully both language and the world it
purportedly describes, in order painfully and painstakingly to
develop a better language. General semantics, like many other
disciplines offering deliverance from the world of illusion and
self- delusion, offers no easy path to enlightenment. </p>

<p> However, we live in an advertising culture. ROLAIDS offers us
instant relief from indigestion. CLAIROL offers instant youth and
beauty. The new MUSTANG makes instant Casanovas out of Casper
Milquetoasts. Is it any wonder that there lurks in many of us a
hope that a product can be found that offers instant relief from
all spiritual ills&#151;instant insight, instant satori? </p>

<p> The full appreciation of art or literature or music requires
years of study, years of experience and exposure to master works.
But under LSD, tremendous &quot;esthetic&quot; and
&quot;creative&quot; experiences are said to be accessible,
instantly and without effort. &quot;You got a television
set?&quot; asked one hipster of another. &quot;No, man,&quot; was
the reply. &quot;I just turn on and watch the wallpaper.&quot;
(If the reader thinks this is a caricature of what is claimed for
the psychedelic experience, let him read on!) Is there any
meaningful sense in which such hallucinatory experiences can be
termed &quot;esthetic&quot; or &quot;creative&quot;? </p>

<p> But perhaps my basic reason for distrusting the dependence on
&quot;mind-expanding&quot; drugs is that most people haven't
learned to use the senses they possess. Speaking only for myself,
I not only <i>hear</i> music; I <i>listen</i> to it when it is
around, so that I find Muzak and other background music, intended
to be heard but not listened to, utterly intolerable. When I am,
in Carl Rogers' terms, open to my experience, I find the colors
of the day, whether gray and foggy and muted or bright and
sunlit, such vivid experiences that I sometimes pound my steering
wheel with excitement. A neon-lit supermarket is often too much
for me&#151;so terribly rich in angles and colors and dizzying
perspectives that I must deliberately narrow my perceptions to
the things on my grocery list lest I take forever to do the
shopping. Paintings and sculptures and ceramics get me so
intensely excited that I often come out of a museum higher than a
kite. In short, I <i>use</i> my senses&#151;at least some of
them, some of the time. And I say, why disorient your beautiful
senses with drugs and poisons before you have half discovered
what they can do for you? </p>

<p> I find myself in sharp disagreement, therefore, with my
friends who have contributed to this issue. They are still my
dear friends despite disagreements. I hope I remain theirs.</p>

<p> AS THE CONTENTS of this issue make clear, the
consciousness-expanding drugs and the states they produce have
direct relevance to a wide range of fields and disciplines as
well as many aspects of modern culture. It is not surprising then
that general semantics&#151;with its broad applicability, its
trans-disciplinary orientation, and its concern with social as
well as scientific issues&#151;provides a useful framework for
comprehending psychedelic phenomena. Similarly, it seems less
than a coincidence that five papers were submitted almost
simultaneously to <i>ETC.,</i> each examining some aspect of this
class of experiences using the principles of general semantics.
The decision to devote an entire issue to the psychedelics was
prompted also by the concerted effort of these writers to
transcend the emotionalism and <i>pro-con</i> zeal characterizing
much of the literature to date. Since most of the papers were
written by students of general semantics rather than primary
investigators of these phenomena, each article has been commented
upon by a recognized authority on some aspect of the
psychedelics. In planning the issue, an attempt was made to
maximize diversity among contributors so as to present a broad
but comprehensive coverage and to include as many viewpoints as
possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h3>Modern Man Plagued by Overabstraction</h3>

<p> SINCE psychedelic substances have been known and ingested
throughout man's history, the increasing interest and fascination
generated recently seem particularly significant. The reasons
behind this widespread attraction (or avoidance) are of course
multiple and complex. Although presently unclear, one general
reason can be identified: Either as a means of investigating
higher thought processes or as a potentially valuable personal
experience, the LSD-induced state is intriguing because it meshes
with the <i>zeitgeist</i> in the social sciences and with major
trends in the larger culture. </p>

<p> There is considerable evidence and commentary from a variety
of quarters which support this contention. As a case in point,
Aldous Huxley's prolific writings give eloquent testimony to a
dominant theme in contemporary thought; namely, the strangely
ambivalent relationship between culture and the individual. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We are at once the beneficiaries of our culture and its
    victims.... Culture and that pre-condition of all culture,
    language, have made possible all the achievements of talent
    and sanctity. They have also given us fanaticism,
    superstition . . . nationalistic idolatry, and mass-murder in
    the name of God.<sup>1</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Huxley showed a life-long preoccupation with the artificial
polarities which have continually plagued Western man. Like
Korzybski, Huxley anticipated by a quarter of a century William
Barrett's pronouncement that the most formidable problem facing
man in the twentieth century is the conciliation of opposites.
Huxley wrestled persistently with the contrived antagonism
erected between the scientific and the poetic, mind and body,
reason and impulse. He was one of the few men of modern times
deeply aware of the essential union and coexistence of opposites.
It is perhaps significant that a man who felt equally at home
with contemporary science and art, mystical states of awareness,
and general semantics should write three books and many articles
devoted to psychedelic phenomena. </p>

<p> The ambivalence of man toward the culture he has inherited
and continually creates, articulated so incisively by Huxley, has
reached new heights in the present era. On the one hand, we have
at our command a technology capable of making the lives of men
healthy, safe, and reasonably secure for the first time in
history. Until recently, the motive power of civilization,
particularly in Western cultures, has necessarily focused on
survival and environmental mastery. In Maslow's terms, the
organismic equilibrium made possible by satiated bodily needs,
physical safety, and some measure of psychological security is
prerequisite to more uniquely human pursuits. This hierarchical
conception of man's strivings depicts him as a self-directed
creature with impulses toward growth and self-enhancement as well
as homeostatic maintenance.<sup>2</sup> To the degree that
Maslow's humanistic image of man engages the modern temper, the
realization of human potentialities should reach unprecedented
heights in the foreseeable future. </p>

<p> On the other hand, many writers, impressed with the
progressive subordination of personal identity to what Erik
Erikson calls the &quot;technological superidentity,&quot; do not
foresee any greater actualizing of man's vast personal resources.
Particular attention has been called to our ultra-rational
commitment to structured, controlled forms of experience; that
is, the restricted range of experience sanctioned by public
consensus. A corollary to this feature of modern culture is our
inordinate investment in language and higher-order abstractions
at the expense of nonverbal experience and nonverbal
communication. In this connection, L. L. Whyte refers to the
&quot;western dissociation,&quot; a division of mind and body
which scientific-industrial society has pushed almost to the
limit of endurance.<sup>3</sup> More recently, Burton and Kantor
have noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As a culture attains higher forms, it desiccates itself by
    abstractions and reduces the immediacy of personal
    experience. The prevalent cry of alienation and &quot;loss of
    meaning&quot; today is just that quality of culture which
    denies the body and ignores the integrative aspects of its
    impulses.<sup>4</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> The paradoxical relationship between language and experience
has been well stated by Robert Cohen: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is most impelling to observe how verbal language, which
    evolved as an instrument to describe, to define, to sing, to
    acquaint man with the thoughts of another, which binds time
    and makes each man heir to the efforts of his brother (and a
    potential slave to the past) can destroy its maker.... This
    possibility arises from a lessened ability to recognize and
    hence respond to important fundamental sense impressions.<sup>5</sup>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h3>LSD and the Corrective Measures of Korzybski</h3>

<p> AS STUDENTS of general semantics are well aware, the problems
alluded to by these representative writers were explicitly
recognized by Korzybski. <i>Science and Sanity</i> depicts in
graphic detail the &quot;unsane&quot; consequences of
&quot;identifying or confusing words with objects and feelings,
or memories and ideas with experiences which belong to the
un-speakable objective level.&quot;<sup>6</sup> It is through
lack of <i>consciousness of abstracting</i> that objectification,
identification, and allness occur&#151;habits of thought which
narrow and restrict human consciousness rather than heighten it.
Korzybski considered consciousness of the abstraction process the
most effective safeguard against these semantic restraints and
the key to further human evolution. Consciousness of abstraction
was defined as &quot;awareness that in our process of abstracting
we have <i>left out</i> characteristics.&quot;<sup>7</sup> Stated
differently, an individual apprehends himself and his world fully
and accurately to the degree that he continually translates
higher-order abstractions back to the naive sensory level,
becoming experientially aware of the discrepancy between
conceptualization and sense impression. </p>

<p> Today there is a growing recognition of the semantic dangers
described by Korzybski and a greater appreciation of the
corrective measures he recommended. For example, in order to
counteract the destructive consequences of
&quot;surplus-repression&quot; (intensional thought?), Herbert
Marcuse suggested the cultivation of &quot;libidinal
rationality&quot; (consciousness of abstraction?)&#151;a process
which would abolish elementalism and reintegrate human
experience.<sup>8</sup> Similarly, the literary critic, Ihab
Hassan, has noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For the neo-Freudians {viz., Norman 0. Brown}, the problem
    is repression, abstraction, and the solution is the
    construction of a Dionysian ego. In their view, language
    ultimately becomes &quot;the natural speech of the
    body,&quot; a phrase adopted from Rilke.<sup>9</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> These semantic problems and prescriptions account in part for
the current interest in the drug-induced psychedelic experience
and its potential value as a therapeutic or educative device. As
the contributors to this volume make clear, the LSD- state
increases one's ability &quot;to recognize and hence respond to
fundamental sense impressions&quot; without semantic barriers.
The freshness of perception and feeling of unity which
characterize the experience suggest that the &quot;is&quot; of
identity is temporarily eliminated. Like the structural
differential method devised by Korzybski, the LSD experience may
be viewed as nonverbal training in nonidentity. At its best the
psychedelic state permits the subject to evaluate with some
detachment (1) the structure of his semantic framework (its
similarity to reality), and (2) his semantic reactions (so that
they take place more on the silent objective level). These two
kinds of learning experience were recommended by Korzybski as the
most effective means of increasing consciousness of abstracting.<sup>10</sup>
</p>

<p> In the present era, the press of cultural demands on the
individual, symbolized by an undue emphasis on language and
conventional modes of perception, are perhaps greater and felt
more keenly than a generation ago. While recognizing that
&quot;it takes a good 'mind' to be 'insane,'<sup>11</sup>
Korzybski noted that &quot;the average person 1933 must be
considered pathological.&quot;<sup>12</sup> From a similar
perspective, Nettler has succinctly stated our current dilemma: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We may have to choose between the &quot;health&quot; of
    the man who behaves badly because he sees accurately, and the
    &quot;health&quot; of the man who behaves nicely because he
    has learned the popular (i.e., socially self-delusional) way
    of seeing falsely.<sup>13</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h3>LSD and the Search for Meaning</h3>

<p> IN THIS CONNECTION, it is important to note that interest in
the psychedelic experience is heavily concentrated among the
upper-middle class, intellectual-professional strata of society;
among healthy, well-adjusted people according to standard
criteria of normality. The type of self-dissatisfaction expressed
by this segment of our population seems consistent with the
cultural climate mentioned earlier. More specifically, the nature
of human discontent in a modern technological (and affluent)
society has been undergoing rapid and profound change. In recent
years, artists and scholars representing every field of endeavor
have flooded the various media of communication with discussions
of the quest for identity and meaning, the decline of traditional
values and religion, modern man's deep sense of alienation, and
the advent of science as a way of life. The current interest in
humanistic psychology, oriental philosophy, existential
psychiatry, self-actualization, <i>and</i> psychedelic drugs
represents reactions to these trends and offers solace to the
&quot;encapsulated man&quot; living in an age of &quot;strident
over-communication&quot; Similarly, the conventional neuroses and
character disorders are in decline, being replaced by what one
writer termed the philosophical neurosis.<sup>14</sup> It may
well be as some critics suggest that orthodox psychotherapy with
its emphasis on early childhood conflicts and social adjustment
is already obsolete. Many individuals who understand all too well
the antecedents of their behavior still feel unfulfilled and find
their lives lacking in significance and purpose. </p>

<p> In the light of what seems to be an incompatibility between
psychotherapy as traditionally conceived, on the one hand, and
the nature of modern discontent, on the other, it is not
surprising that many people who fit this description express an
interest in the psychedelic experience and find their way to LSD.
A case in point is the almost four hundred voluntary subjects who
have undergone a large-dose LSD session at the International
Foundation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park, California.
Approximately one-third of the total sample did not present
complaints of a psychiatric nature and revealed minimal neurotic
symptomology according to both diagnostic evaluation and
psychological test data. Consistent with the independent
assessment, the interest expressed by these subjects in the
psychedelic experience seemed to be &quot;growth-motivated&quot;
rather than &quot;deficiency- motivated.&quot;<sup>15</sup> Some
were dimly aware of potentialities or personal aptitudes which
they hoped to activate and develop more fully. Others expressed a
feeling of emptiness and lack of meaningful purpose while
adequately meeting the exigencies of life. Still others sought a
deeper understanding or more satisfying resolutions to problems
of an existential nature. </p>

<p> Being relatively free of emotional disturbance, these
subjects were more likely to grapple with fundamental problems
during the LSD experience. In addition to examining self-identity
and the relationship between self and non-self, questions of
love, death, creation, and the conciliation of opposites received
frequent attention. Follow-up interviews, clinical ratings, and
subjective reports indicated that these subjects benefited
considerably from the psychedelic experience along the lines of
self-actualization, richer creative experience, and enhancement
of specific abilities and talents. Although extremely tentative
at this point, these preliminary findings are at least suggestive
of the ways in which these powerful agents might be employed to
explore and enhance human consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h3>Research: Current Status and Future Trends</h3>

<p> SINCE more than three hundred studies on the use of LSD-25 as
a therapeutic agent have been reported, only the most salient and
consistent findings will be summarized.<sup>16</sup> Despite
great diversity in the conduct of these studies, impressive
improvement rates have been almost uniformly reported, with both
adults and children, and in group as well as individual
psychotherapy. Used in conjunction with traditional
psychotherapy, or as a primary vehicle for inducing rapid
personality change, LSD has been found to facilitate improvement
in patients representing the complete spectrum of neurotic,
psychosomatic, and character disorders. Particularly noteworthy
are the positive results obtained with cases highly resistant to
conventional forms of therapy. High remission rates among
alcoholics, for example, have frequently been reported following
a single, large-dose LSD session. Based on their findings with
more than one thousand alcoholics, Hoffer and his coworkers
concluded that LSD was twice as effective as any other treatment
program.<sup>17</sup> Other chronic conditions carrying a poor
prognosis which have responded favorably to psychedelic therapy
include sexual deviations, criminal psychopathy, autism in
children, and adolescent behavior disorders. </p>

<p> When employed as an adjunct to psychotherapy, most
investigators have associated the beneficial effects of LSD with
reduced defensiveness, the reliving of early childhood
experiences, increased access to unconscious material, and
greater emotional expression. In contrast, when used as a primary
vehicle for rapid personality change, emphasis is usually placed
on the transcendental quality of the experience, the re-synthesis
of basic values and beliefs, and major changes in the
relationship between self and environment. </p>

<p> Since most reports on the therapeutic effectiveness of LSD
have been based on clinical judgments of questionable
reliability, it is worth noting that comparable results have been
obtained by investigators in many other countries. The likelihood
of a significant positive bias is further lessened by the widely
divergent theoretical persuasions represented in this research.
These include Freudian, Jungian, behavioristic, existentialist,
and a variety of eclectic orientations. It seems safe to conclude
from the breadth and consistency of the clinical evidence that
LSD can produce far-reaching beneficial effects in some people,
under some conditions. However, controlled studies of the process
variables involved have yet to be conducted. Specifically, in
what ways do various kinds of people respond to LSD, both during
the experience and afterward? What are the optimal conditions of
administration for given objectives? How can we account for the
various kinds and extent of change which follow an LSD
experience? In short, despite the mass of accumulated data on the
<i>outcome</i> of psychedelic therapy, relationships among <i>process</i>
variables remain obscure. </p>

<p> Primarily because of the controversy surrounding these
chemical agents (which interestingly is confined to the United
States), controlled research aimed at maximizing safety,
effectiveness, and applicability has barely begun. In addition to
questions concerning the potential uses of LSD as a therapeutic
or educative device, its possible value as a basic research tool
for investigating higher mental processes and their relationship
to behavior has also been minimally explored. Although the
clinical evidence and testimonial reports indicate that LSD
promises to be a valuable tool for both the study and enhancement
of cognitive and perceptual functioning, such claims have been
neither supported nor refuted by means of controlled studies.
Other hypotheses readily testable include the often noted
similarity of the psychedelic experience to certain phases of the
creative process and its possible relationship to other altered
states of consciousness such as hypnosis, transcendental
experiences, identity crises, and dream states. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h3>Psychological Interpretations of the Psychedelic Experience </h3>

<p> AN ALMOST INVARIANT effect of the psychedelics, cutting
across the wide range of individual reactions, is an
extraordinary alteration in perception. This usually takes the
form of intensified sensory acuity in all modalities and a
blurring of self-nonself boundaries. Whether expanded awareness
or increased insight accompany these unhabitual perceptions and
altered frames of reference is not a function of the chemical
agent. In contrast to the earlier search for
&quot;drug-specific&quot; effects of LSD, it is now generally
recognized that the nature, intensity, and content of the
experience are the resultant of complex transactions between the
subject's past history and personality, the set and expectancies
of both subject and administrator, and the physical and
psychological environment in which the experience takes place.
Importantly, most of these determinants can be intentionally
arranged and manipulated so as to foster either a propitious or a
stressful experience. Based on data obtained from a large sample
of cases, Harman noted that when the context of the experience is
optimized, the subject &quot;is able to re- examine his
relationships with others, his attitudes and values, his beliefs
about his own nature and that of the world he lives in&#151;all
with unusual nonattachment and freedom from threat.&quot;<sup>18</sup>
Similarly, in a careful study of 690 administrations of LSD,
Chandler and Hartman concluded that: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . the drug does not appear to produce any serious or
    marked impairment in the major ego functions. The patient
    remains oriented for person, place, and time. He does not
    appear to lose contact with everyday reality . . . he can
    withdraw his awareness from the physical reality of the
    moment and allow his attention to become completely absorbed
    by the phenomena at the deeper psychic levels, but he retains
    the ability to focus his awareness back on to external
    objective reality whenever he chooses...<sup>19</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> The striking similarity between this state and certain phases
of the creative process has been described by Frank Barron<sup>20</sup>
and demonstrated in a study of thirty artists given LSD. In
psychoanalytic terms, the psychedelic experience resembles a
&quot;regression in the service of the ego&quot; or a merging of
impulse and realistic thinking. In the light of the cultural
trends noted earlier, it is noteworthy that this capacity to
blend primary and secondary processes has been recognized
recently as a condition of superior functioning or positive
mental health. Irnportantly, there is some evidence indicating
that individuals tend to display more of this ability following
an LSD session as well as during the psychedelic experience
itself. If conditions are favorable, the experience and its
aftermath have much in common with a self-actualizing &quot;peak
experience.&quot; <sup>21</sup> The process of transformation
operative in such cases seems highly similar to Erik Erikson's
penetrating analysis of the &quot;identity crisis&quot; as a
catalyst for rapid personal growth.<sup>22</sup> </p>

<p> A number of studies have demonstrated that relatively stable
individual characteristics (for example, personality) are as
important as set and setting in determining response to LSD. In a
study of changes in values and beliefs, personality, and
behavioral patterns in major life areas, Mogar and Savage found
that the nature, magnitude, and stability of post-LSD changes
were related to personality variables and modal defense patterns.<sup>23</sup>
As might be expected, subjects with a well-defined but flexible
self-structure responded most favorably to the drug, while those
with either underdeveloped or overly rigid ego defenses responded
least favorably. This differential finding parallels the
distinction often made between the creative process and psychotic
states. An analysis of imaginal responses to the Rorschach led
Holt and Havel to conclude: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We find primary process thinking in conscious subjects
    either out of strength or out of weakness. In the former
    case, it is more likely to appear in a playful or esthetic
    frame of reference, accompanied by pleasant affect. If, on
    the other hand, primary thinking breaks through the usual
    defenses uninvited and unwanted, the subject may feel anxious
    or threatened and is likely to act defensively.<sup>24</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Like the psychedelic experience, both creative and psychotic
states are characterized by greater access to unconscious
material. However, in contrast to the regressive quality of
psychosis, creativity involves a <i>temporary</i> and <i>voluntary</i>
breaking up of perceptual constancies which permits the
individual &quot;to shake free from dead literalism, to recombine
the old familiar elements into new, imaginative, amusing, or
beautiful patterns.&quot;<sup>25</sup> Despite these important
differences, it should be emphasized that altered states of
consciousness, whether willfully induced, stress-induced, or
drug-induced, all favor sensation and image over word-concept.
This type of deviation from conventional perception will be
welcomed and valuable rather than feared and harmful to the
degree that the psychological and social context of the
experience are congenial to the needs of a particular individual.
As it was stressed earlier, systematic research into the
relationship among relevant factors must be conducted before
&quot;optimum&quot; conditions can be reliably specified for
given objectives and subjects.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h3>LSD As Training in Visualization</h3>

<p> IN THE LIGHT of the cardinal features of the psychedelic
experience and its apparent similarity to the creative process,
it is worth noting that each contributor to this issue makes some
reference to the rupture which often exists between experience
and language. As indicated previously, awareness of the causes,
correlates, and consequences of this basic human problem is no
longer a unique concern of general semantics. On the contrary, it
is now widely recognized as a dominant theme in contemporary
thought. As a phenomenon of modern culture, the psychedelic
experience highlights this central problem and suggests one means
of alleviating it. </p>

<p> There is some indication that LSD will prove effective as a
method of nonaristotelian training producing greater semantic
flexibility. As an aid to sane, creative living, Korzybski
emphasized the need to &quot;visualize our theories.&quot; The
soundness of this recommendation has been dramatically confirmed
by Albert Einstein: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The words of the language, as they are written or spoken,
    do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The
    psychical entities in my case are . . . visual and some of
    muscular type. Conventional words and other signs have to be
    sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage.<sup>26</sup>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> It has been suggested that psychedelic drugs facilitate the
conversion of semantic reactions into sensations and images. In
this respect, there is a striking similarity between the LSD
experience and &quot;training in visualization which
automatically abolishes objectification, identification, and
allness.&quot;<sup>27</sup> Korzybski's description of this
visualization process reads like countless reports of psychedelic
experiences. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . the higher abstractions are translated back into new
    lower abstractions, which are closer to life. Such an
    individual &quot;sees,&quot; &quot;visualizes,&quot; has
    &quot;intuitions,&quot; in his symbolic interplays. He then
    has a new structural vision through a new survey of his own
    experiences and all the experiences of others when translated
    in terms of lower centres. He gains a deeper insight, which
    he ultimately makes useful to all of us.<sup>28</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> In commenting on the growing distrust of language as a medium
of expression among contemporary artists, Ihab Hassan sums up the
fascination and promise symbolized (if not actualized) by the
psychedelics: &quot;The story is really a very old one. To hear
again, to see again, to feel again, and perhaps sometimes to love
what is seen or heard or felt....&quot;<sup>29</sup> </p>

<p> IN THE FOLLOWNG pages, each contributor describes some aspect
of the class of experiences associated with the ingestion of a
psychedelic agent. Yet the emphasis is clearly on a broad array
of experiences or states of consciousness which have been induced
by a variety of means, throughout man's history, and in every
culture of the world. If nothing else, the current advent of
perception-altering chemical agents calls attention to our
traditional neglect of novel thoughts and impulses. These papers
also demonstrate an important application of general semantics to
yet another facet of man's behavior and experience.</p>

<h2>MEANING AND THE MIND-DRUGS</h2>

<h3>RICHARD P. MARSH</h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p> MANY READERS of the Sunday supplements are familiar with the
names, if not the operational characteristics, of at least three
of the new &quot;brain-changing&quot; drugs: LSD-25, psilocybin
(popularized as &quot;the magic mushroom&quot;), and mescaline, a
derivative of the now-notorious peyote plant used by members of
the Native American (Indian) Church in their religious
ceremonies. These three drugs have been publicized, often in
lurid prose, by journalists more interested in their news value
than in their chemical properties. </p>

<p> The sensation-seeking reader has been told that a cult of
suburban intellectuals and city-dwelling beatniks has grown up
around these drugs. He knows that the drugs have the power of
producing strange visions, and he suspects them of producing
strange forms of behavior. What he does not suspect is that there
is a serious possibility that the drugs will one day be a boon to
mankind. </p>

<p> Whether they will or not remains to be seen. Meanwhile, among
serious students of the drugs, a war rages over the question
which may prove to be among the most critical in history. </p>

<p> One group claims big things. Thanks to the drugs and their
capacity for expanding human consciousness, they say, psychiatry
is at a turning point, and Utopia itself may be upon us before we
know it. <a name="back1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Another group is darkly dubious. The new drugs will lead us, they
fear, not into Utopia but into psychosis, and in a pinch could be
used by a future dictator as an insidious adjunct to thought
control. <a name="back2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>

<p> This division of opinion, as so often happens, is reflected
in a division of terminology. Early experimenters with the drugs,
hypothesizing that they had the power of inducing in an ingestant
a short-term model psychosis complete with hallucinations and
paranoid delusions of grandeur and persecution, dubbed them
&quot;psychotomimetic.&quot; Experience showed, however, that
some ingestants persistently refused to retreat into psychosis,
even on a short-term basis, but instead blossomed out with a
variety of positively healthy symptoms and began to report
extraordinary spontaneous increases in self-insight. So
eventually the word &quot;psychedelic&quot; was coined<a
name="back3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> as an
alternative to &quot;psychotomimetic.&quot;
&quot;Psychedelic,&quot; by way of its Greek origins, means
simply &quot;mind-manifesting.&quot; It implies that the new
drugs do not so much drive an ingestant into a state of psychosis
as to open out his mind, whatever its characteristics, making it
available for inspection. </p>

<p> Whether the new drugs are psychotomimetic or psychedelic,
then&#151;whether they diminish or enlarge&#151;is the issue. If
they reduce us to the condition of crazy men, they may possess
limited value in carefully controlled psychiatric research, but
they are scarcely promising as a vehicle for mass liberation. If,
however, they endow us with self-knowledge, manifesting to us our
own minds, their promise is great. </p>

<p> Broadly, the commentators on the new drugs have tended to be
either psychotomimeticists or psychedelicists. They have tended
either to view the drugs with suspicion as potentially dangerous
sources of mental disturbance or to view them optimistically as
useful, almost magical means to self-discovery and
self-actualization. In-between positions have been taken, of
course, but perhaps not so frequently as the facts warrant.</p>

<hr>

<p> THERE ARE at least three reasons, all of them semantic, for
the prevalence of this two-valued attitude. First, there is the
fact that the language available for talking about the drug
experience is simply not equal to the task. Dr. Timothy Leary has
written about this elsewhere in this issue of <i>ETC</i>. The
essence of the problem, in the opinion of the present writer, is
that a process cannot be stored in a box. The static,
subject-predicate, thing-and-properties language we have
inherited from our culture does not easily contain the shifting,
dynamic, flowing experience undergone by the drug ingestant. The
experience is nondual and infinitely valued. Language is
dualistic and two-valued. Attempting to express the drug
experience in language is like trying to stuff the cosmos into a
trunk. </p>

<p> Then there is the prevailing Western attitude toward the
body, one of Puritan distrust. We tend to feel that things of the
mind and spirit should be somehow remote and unbodied. To suggest
that the mind is a function of the brain and can therefore be
unlocked by a drug is to suggest the vaguely indecent. What is
good for us should not be come by too easily and should not be
quite pleasant. Furthermore, the spirit should be kept clear of
the body or else ignored altogether. </p>

<p> Finally, we are confronted by a special form of
guilt-by-association. A certain number of &quot;far out,
beat&quot; people have obtained black market supplies of the new
brain-changing drugs and taken them for kicks. Some have then
talked about their experiences in a jazzy, flippant way. As a
result many responsible people have felt both repelled and
threatened, consequently falling into the semantic trap of
imputing to the drugs the characteristics of the consumers and
condemning the drugs themselves as intrinsically bad. </p>

<p> For these three reasons and others, objectivity about the
drugs is difficult. The drugs are extraordinarily difficult to
talk about. This is unfortunate, since the way they are talked
about determines to a large extent the way they operate, whether
they are positively psychedelic or negatively psychotomimetic.</p>

<hr>

<p> MANY responsible investigators emphasize the importance of
&quot;set and setting&quot; in determining the effects of the
drugs.<sup>4</sup> The subject's expectations, his mood at the
time of drug ingestion, and the physical and social environment
apparently determine, to a considerable extent, the nature of the
subjective experience. If the experience is approached in an
attitude of scientific curiosity combined with a sort of
reverence for the possibilities of human inwardness, the results
will be quite different from what they will be if one takes the
drug as though he were going on a binge. Since one's attitudes
are shaped so much by one's language and may even be inseparable
from it, it matters how one chooses to speak about the experience
before, during, and afterward.<sup>5</sup> It matters also
whether one takes the drug with the half-guilty expectation of
going out of his mind or in the serene confidence that he will be
brought to himself. </p>

<p> In short, the drug experience is like any experience: its
meaning lies primarily within the person, not within the drug,
which merely liberates. What it liberates into, insanity or
ecstatic insight, depends on the subject and the circumstances. </p>

<p> Thus the drug experience is a semantic experience. It is the
experience of creating and discovering meanings. There is perhaps
no more fruitful way of looking at it than this: that it sheds a
good deal of light on the communication process and on the
discipline of general semantics. There is an extraordinary number
of ways in which it does this, but, owing to lack of space, only
seven will be discussed. </p>

<p> 1. <i>The release of the symbolizing function.</i> The
incredible human capacity for symbol and image production is
driven home forcibly to many people who consume one of the drugs
or browse in the literature. Huxley, Watts, Leary, Dunlap,
Newland, and others have written vividly and sometimes eloquently
about this. The present author, at the time of his first
LSD-ingestion, was stunned to discover the fantastic fertility of
his own image- and symbol-producing centers under the impact of
the drug. He underwent the experience of birth, felt himself
transformed into mythological persons, floated graciously through
lovely caverns of sparkling ice and splendid gold-encrusted
Gothic cathedrals, and watched in awe as jeweled patterns formed
and reformed in an endless variety of living mandalar shapes,
fourfold marvels of incredible beauty modulating into endless
variations of themselves, dissolving into spinning galaxies of
infinite dimension and significance, or lapsing into marvelously
unique free-forms dancing in total spontaneity through
unpredictable patterns of absolute wonder. </p>

<p> Above all, there was the experience of light. This appeared
in many forms: as a &quot;diamond center&quot; of incredible
luster (and somehow, too, of incredible significance); as
patterned living flame, shaping itself into fourfold
configurations in a sort of visual equivalent to the music coming
from the phonograph; as music itself visible, apprehended
directly by the inner eye in the form of three-dimensional shapes
glowing from within; and as shining fields, banks, walls,
fortresses, trees and rivers of living gems and jewels. </p>

<p> We are here led directly into the problem of intensionality.
Obviously, this internal splendor was not, as Korzybski would
say, extensional. It was not available for public inspection and
verification. No one except the author looked on to confirm the
reality of the spectacle. And yet its reality seemed beyond
dispute; it seemed even to be a reality of a higher order than
the extensional reality of the public world. It seemed, too, to
have a higher meaning&#151;or rather to be meaning itself, to be
not so much a symbolization of another reality as the very act of
symbolization; not precisely to mean something, but actually to
mean meaning as such.</p>

<hr>

<p> KENNETH BOULDING has said that man's capacity to proliferate
internal images is at once his chief glory and his greatest
hazard.<sup>6</sup> It enables him to elaborate those roadmaps
which get him through life meaningfully, but also those deceptive
roadmaps which lose him in the jungle. In other words, it helps
him to extensionalize as well as to intensionalize.
Extensionalization and intensionalization, the public and the
private, play into each other. The raw, given facts of the
universe are chaotic and meaningless until some sort of structure
is imposed on them, and then they take on meaning and order.<sup>7</sup>
Then they serve as a useful roadmap to get us through life in a
sufficiently rewarding way. </p>

<p> The meaning of things, however, lies not in the things nor
entirely in us, but rather in a fluent traffic between inner and
outer&#151;with particular emphasis on the inner. More precisely,
meanings appear to be discovered but in fact are manufactured.
Under LSD, we seem to come up against that part of our inner
world where meanings are made, where the patterning process
operates in its pure form. It is a startling experience. One who
has known it is not likely to forget it, and we may speculate
that, having once seen his own intensionality in an isolated
form, one will thereafter be better equipped to persuade it to
serve him and less likely to be misled by it to create maps for
which there are no territories. </p>

<p> 2. <i>The experience of unity.</i> One of the most startling
features of the drug experience is that, while one remembers the
names of things with perfect clarity, they no longer seem to him
appropriate. This object is called a table and that one is called
a chair, just as before, but there is now seen to be something
richly amusing about the process of labeling them. One's eyes are
opened. The difference between the table and the chair is still
perceived as real enough, but it is also perceived as entirely
arbitrary, a conventional distinction that could well be replaced
by an infinity of other distinctions equally conventional. </p>

<p> The unity of all things becomes suddenly apparent with
blazing simplicity. The opposites rush together like a clap of
thunder. Each separate quality, normally perceptible only by
contrast with its opposite, is still perceptible as a separate
quality, only now the illusoriness of its separateness is
apparent. Big and little, wet and dry, pain and pleasure are no
longer seen as polar pairs but rather as points on a continuum.
So, likewise, are ugliness and beauty, love and hate, femininity
and masculinity, and all the rest. So, most particularly, are
sameness and otherness, the LSD experient discovering to his
amazement and joy that the separateness that divides him from
others is a masquerade for the identity that connects him </p>

<p> This may be interpreted as a mystical doctrine, to be sure
and as such it will be sufficiently annoying or meaningless to
the more rigidly positivistic. But the more flexibly inclined
will recognize the semantic soundness of the perception that the
things and qualities which fill our lives are, to some extent at
least, verbal constructions that are capable of passing away with
the passing away of the names that gave them birth. </p>

<p> 3. <i>Seeing through the game.</i> Of all the benefits of the
drug experience, this is perhaps the greatest and the most
long-lasting. The author, a college professor, remembers during
his third LSD experience staring at the physician who had
administered the drug with the awed and liberating awareness that
the man was no more a doctor than he himself was a professor.
Both the &quot;professor&quot; and the &quot;doctor,&quot;
although duly certificated by the proper authorities, were, it
now appeared, manifestly frauds. What's more, the discovery
proved liberating and refreshing in the extreme. Two
game-players, one hiding behind the doctor role, the other
playing at being a professor, had come out from their costumes,
abandoned the game, and, thanks to LSD, now sat confronting each
other in a condition of headlong and naked reality. The feeling
of lightness and release was incredible.</p>

<hr>

<p> TIMOTHY LEARY is among those who have emphasized the
game-like nature of most human behavior as well as LSD's capacity
for liberating one from the tyranny of games. He has defined a
game as an acquired cultural sequence characterized by roles,
rules, goals, rituals, language, values, and strategies.<a
name="back8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> This is a
very comprehensive definition which covers virtually every form
of human behavior, especially those not shared with other
animals. Leary has been attacked for this by critics who object
that to abandon one's games would be to abandon most meaningful
human activity including, for example, the &quot;game&quot; of
science. </p>

<p> Actually, of course, one does not abandon the
&quot;scientific game&quot; or any other &quot;acquired cultural
sequence&quot; provided it is serviceable. But, if he is wise,
one does attempt to see through the games he plays and
continually to ask the question: Is <i>this</i> game <i>now</i>
the best one to play in order to actualize my human
possibilities? To reject all games, to reject all &quot;roles,
rules, goals, rituals, language, values, and strategies,&quot; is
to reject civilization itself, along with sanity, maturity,
meaning, and all possibility of being human instead of merely
animal. But to take them all seriously is equally destructive or
more so. There are arguments for both conservatism and
liberalism, and one can choose between dying the death of
ossification and dying the death of formlessness. On the whole,
however, the first seems the more terrifying prospect. </p>

<p> In any case, six hours' freedom from the tyranny of the ego,
a holiday enjoyed by many who have consumed LSD, is likely to
predispose one unfavorably against ever again granting it the
absolute sway to which it is accustomed. The ego is the social
game <i>par excellence</i>, absolutely necessary to our survival
and yet tyrannously opposed to our growth and our deepest
satisfaction. Jay Haley has amusingly yet incisively exposed its
infinitely subtle maneuvers in that ongoing game of one-
upmanship called psychoanalysis.<sup>9</sup> The ego, he says, is
the organ of one-upmanship, always striving to get one-up or stay
one-up, and hence always restless and anxious. Following an
anonymous English scholar, Haley suggests that the analysis will
be spontaneously and successfully terminated when the patient
reaches the &quot;point where he doesn't really care whether the
analyst is in control of the relationship or whether he is in
control.&quot;<sup>10</sup> At that point the patient is cured.
He has seen through the game, and though his ego still functions
as the integrative principle which holds his personality
together, it has become transparent and no longer dominates the
self. </p>

<p> Prolonged psychotherapy is no doubt necessary before the ego
will permanently accept its role as servant instead of master of
the self. The LSD experience, however, can give the ingestant a
startling glimpse of what life would be like if the ego could be
persuaded to relax its grip. This might well facilitate the
process of therapy, just as the process of therapy serves to make
the LSD experience richer and deeper. In any case the game-like,
linguistic, and conventional nature of the ego is often lucidly
apparent to the LSD ingestant. </p>

<p> 4. <i>Receptivity</i>. All points in the communication cycle
are important, but perhaps in our anxious age it is the reception
of messages which gives particular trouble. Most of us encode
willingly enough, but we are not, as a rule particularly
interested in decoding. We talk, but we don't listen. We turn on
the radio, then ignore it. We are eager to impress others, but
not to hear them. </p>

<p> Under LSD many people learn, for the first time, what it
means to be absolutely present. Since they have temporarily
renounced their games and seen through their own need to be
one-up, they can afford to be aware of whatever the environment,
external or internal, may happen to present without wishing to
change it. For the moment, at least, they have nothing to lose by
listening. They may even dare listen to themselves, perhaps for
the first time. </p>

<p> Under these conditions, extraordinary things can occur. Other
people may be seen as precious, infinitely complex, and quite
miraculous. The physical environment may become altogether
startling. One may feel that he is looking not at a book, a
table, or a chair, but at The Book, The Table, or The Chair. To
paraphrase Aldous Huxley, the Absolute seems to blaze forth from
all around one.<sup>11</sup> Music becomes incredible: Old
warhorses like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony become fresh and
powerful again. A record of a choir hunched around a microphone
in a remote recording studio quite literally fills the room with
angels. The music becomes textured and alive. It may even become
visible and glow with an inner light. </p>

<p> Paintings move and open up to reveal new dimensions. Colors
become intense and preternaturally vibrant. Objects in nature,
such as mountains and trees, shine with beauty and drip with
significance. One's internal world opens up to one, both the
repressed world of the personal unconscious and the pre-existent,
archetypal realm of the collective unconscious. One looks in upon
what Huxley calls the &quot;antipodes of the mind,&quot; i.e.,
the world of Visionary Experience.<sup>12</sup> The creatures,
the gardens, the pools of light he sees there fill him with awe
and peace.</p>

<hr>

<p> SEMANTICALLY, the condition of being absolutely present to
the outer and the inner reality has at least two advantages.
First, it allows a person to tune in on that feedback, both
external and internal, which enables him to correct his own
errors in encoding. He is able to reduce the noise level in the
various communication systems in which he is involved by
re-encoding his message streams until they convey the meanings
that he intends them to convey. Secondly, it allows a person to
inhabit the world of the actual, the world of fact, instead of
the unreal and empty world of the prefabricated abstraction. It
allows him to experience the world instead of merely thinking
about it and hence, perhaps, to begin to live in it at last. In
Huxley's words: </p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be
    shown for a few timeless hours the outer and the inner world,
    not as they appear to an animal obsessed with words and
    notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and
    unconditionally . . . this is an experience of inestimable
    value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.<sup>13</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p> 5. <i>Awareness of the shadow.</i> This Jungian expression is
used because of its vividness. In Jung's conception, the shadow
is the repressed, dark side of the personality, a countertype of
the collective, adapted side, which is bathed in the
&quot;light&quot; of consciousness, so to speak. It is the source
of much that is awkward and &quot;evil&quot; in human behavior,
although paradoxically its liberation may result in a certain
amount of &quot;good.&quot; This is because the shadow contains
within it not only the destructive and vicious elements of the
personality but also much that only appears wicked and Satanic
but which is, in fact, merely unknown, untried, and unaccepted.
In theological symbolism, God is at a loss without the eager, if
fiery, cooperation of Satan, as <i>Genesis</i>, the <i>Book of
Job</i>, the story of Jesus' temptations, that of the temptation
of Buddha by Mara, and other religious myths and documents
attest. </p>

<p> Under LSD, the shadow may be explosively liberated. Indeed,
this is one of the hazards of the drug, and it is one reason why
its administration should be selective and controlled. The few
recorded instances in which LSD has been harmful, precipitating
severe depression, psychosis, and even suicide, are probably
cases in which either there has been a &quot;shadow
problem,&quot; or something has been amiss with set and setting,
or both. If the shadow is poorly integrated with the ego and the
rest of the personality, its liberation&#151;the upsurge of
repressed materials from the unconscious&#151;may cause a more or
less irreversible panic leading to the disintegration of the
self. On the other hand, if the subject's expectations are
unhealthy or if the environment contains threatening or
forbidding elements, then the release of the shadow even in a
reasonably well integrated person may be more than he can cope
with. </p>

<p> But if all candidates for LSD consumption are carefully
screened, and if the drug is administered under optimum
conditions, there appears to be virtually no danger. In any case,
one who has experienced a conscious uprush of shadow material
will not soon forget it, whether it be mild or fierce. The
author's reliving of the birth experience (an event which, in
Jung's language, may have been an archetypal experience as well
as a shadow experience) is a case in point: It was mild in the
sense of not being unduly alarming, and yet it was quite
unforgettable. Similarly impressed on the author's memory is the
transformation by which a physician monitoring the LSD experiment
became alternately brutal devil and shining saint and, on another
occasion, that by which a handsome middle-aged woman became
alternately a dewy young virgin and a menacing, toothless witch. </p>

<p> The confrontation with the shadow, however, may be fierce
rather than mild. It may produce intense anxiety or even wild
terror.<sup>14</sup> The subject may feel helplessly cut off from
the rest of the world, or he may people it with monsters of his
own creation. Perfectly benign companions who have only the
welfare of the subject in mind may appear to be degenerate
criminals from whom there is no escape. One may feel as though he
is trapped in some diabolical plot engineered by malevolent
Beings in a corrupt back alley of the universe. It is not
surprising that under these circumstances subjects have been
known to attempt violence or flight. </p>

<p> And yet, from the semantic standpoint at least, there is
genuine value in such paranoid experiences, provided they are
successfully lived through. This value lies in the confirmation
they provide for the reality of projection. The dramatic
alteration in appearance undergone by the physician and the woman
previously mentioned was a purely semantic phenomenon. The
changes in no sense occurred within the two people but rather in
him who experienced the change. They were entirely changes in the
<i>meaning</i> of the people as that meaning was created and then
externalized by their observer. Similarly, the more alarming
kinds of experience alluded to, such as the transformation of
friendly helpers into degenerate monsters, are likewise purely
the result of projection, a fact which becomes dazzlingly
apparent after the effects of the drug recede.</p>

<hr>

<p> A CURIOUS PROPERTY of LSD and the other new drugs is that the
perceptual alterations they produce do not ordinarily reach the
level of hallucination. The ingestant typically retains awareness
throughout of the altered nature of his perceptions. Public
reality continues to be his reference point. Thus he is able to
inspect his own projections as they occur. In extreme cases,
however, the ingestant may move in and out of hallucination so
that recognition of his own projections must be deferred. In
either case the ingestant normally completes the experience with
a heightened awareness of his own capacity for creating meanings
that superficially appear to be external to him. </p>

<p> In addition, of course, there are the changes of meaning one
discovers in one's inner world. The retrieval of unconscious
material by psychoanalytical methods may be easily interpreted as
a semantic process, a clarification of inner awareness and
evaluation. For permanence of results, the psychoanalytical
method may be superior to the method of LSD&#151;though this is
far from certain&#151;but the method of LSD is vastly superior in
the respect that the uprush of imagery it provokes is so dramatic
and startling as to be unforgettable. </p>

<p> 6. <i>The discovery of love.</i> People who have taken LSD do
not &quot;know all the answers,&quot; nor have they automatically
solved all their problems by virtue of having consumed the drug.
But they often feel peculiarly at ease in one another's
presence&#151;a phenomenon which, when perceived by others, is
sometimes a source of annoyance because it is liable to be
mistakenly interpreted as a sign of clannishness. The reason for
the easiness frequently felt by LSD-ingesters in one another's
company is simply this: Because they have seen through the game,
briefly at least, and because they sense that they are in the
presence of others who have seen through the game, they feel not
only less impelled to attack but also relatively immune from
attack. They feel relatively free to drop their defenses and the
other claptrap supporting the ego and simply stand freely and
openly in one another's presence. </p>

<p> But there is more than this. Under LSD they have felt
love&#151;perhaps for the first time. The quality of the love
they have felt is unusual. Thanks to their experience with the
shadow and the uprush of forbidden material from that realm, they
have seen the continuity, the essential unity, of love and hate,
and they have (ideally, at least) accepted that unity. In short,
they have accepted their feelings&#151;not the &quot;nice&quot;
ones only, but the awkward, &quot;bad,&quot; embarrassing
feelings as well&#151;and they are comfortable about it. Because
they have allowed themselves to hate, they can now allow
themselves to love. Because they have admitted that they are
afraid, they can now stand quietly secure in each other's
presence. Still more remarkable than this, however, is the fact
that they remember what it is like to feel love without jealousy
or the necessity of possession. Having seen through the game and
having found out that bare-faced liar, the ego, they have, at
least a little, renounced the need to be one-up and junked at
least some of the apparatus by which the ego maintains itself. </p>

<p> The ego dies hard, of course, but he is perversely
intelligent and his aid may be enlisted in the campaign to subdue
himself. People do not consciously wish to suffer, and so the ego
may let go its grip a little when it is convinced that to do so
is in its own best interests. The ego, having seen its own
unreality, begins to relax: How can I feel jealous of you or
rejected by you, how can I wish to possess you, or be possessed
by you, if I <i>am</i> you? If my separateness from you is a name
and my identity with you the reality, what do I fear? </p>

<p> 7. <i>The attainment of the Self.</i> Implicit in the
foregoing is a rudimentary theory of personality. Grossly
oversimplified its main features would be these: Some
LSD-ingestants feel that they have acquired knowledge, through
direct experience, of an aspect of the self other than the one
they are familiar with. It is as though they had discovered a
second self. This second self is perceived as a kind of Unitary
Self, while the familiar, daily self could be called the game-
self. </p>

<p> The Unitary Self quite literally shimmers and dazzles. It
consists of a set of apparently endless dimensions not evident to
ordinary consciousness but sometimes awesomely present to the
consciousness liberated by LSD. Because of its apparent
endlessness, the ingestant may feel that it connects him with all
other people and creatures. Hence the term <i>Unitary</i>. </p>

<p> The game-self, on the other hand, consists of the accumulated
roles, rules, rituals, goals, language systems, values, and
strategies inherited from one's culture Instead of being unitary
in its action, the game-self tends to be separative. It is the
organ of one-upmanship. While the Unitary Self unites the
individual with other individuals, the game-self sets him against
them in a subtle contest for social supremacy. </p>

<p> When the ingestant discovers his game-self he is liable to be
somewhat contemptuous of it. He may feel, under the influence of
the drug, that he wishes to devote his life to the service of the
Unitary Self. Yet, as the effects of the drug ebb away he feels
the game-self slowly reassert itself. The chief effects of the
LSD experience are perhaps due to the interplay of these two
selves. </p>

<p> If, following a drug session, the game-self reasserts itself
totally, then the LSD experience has provided kicks and a rather
haunting memory, but little more. If the game-self does not
reassert itself sufficiently, then the ingestant is lost to
society or he has slipped over into psychosis. If, however, the
game-self and the Unitary Self have to some extent
interpenetrated, so to speak, producing a degree of
transformation in the ingestant's self-concept, then the
ingestant has taken a step toward that condition of
individuality-within-relationship which is the true meaning of
psychological maturity. An ingestant who achieves this feels
himself to be part of society as a whole, even part of the total
cosmos, and yet uniquely himself and valuable in his uniqueness.</p>

<hr>

<p> THE BLISS experienced by some LSD-ingestants results from the
experience of unity with the cosmos. The ingestant feels
essentially one with what he sees as an incredibly glorious
whole. On the other hand, the terror experienced by some
ingestants results from their clinging to the game-self, whose
partly fraudulent nature has been exposed by the action of the
drug and whose continued existence in its present form has been
threatened. </p>

<p> This is a point at which psychosis may seem imminent. Let us,
therefore, ask our central question once again, the answer to
which may be so crucial to the future of the race: Are the new
drugs psychotomimetic or are they psychedelic, psychosis
mimicking or mind-manifesting? Which? </p>

<p> The answer is conditional on circumstances. Whoever has
experienced the expansion of consciousness and the unveiling of
the Unitary Self resulting from one of the drugs can have no
doubts: They are unmistakably psychedelic in their effects. But
whoever has skirted a psychotic episode&#151;with its
accompaniments of paranoid terror, violence, flight, and suicidal
depression&#151;knows that the drugs are quite capable of being
psychotomimetic (and suspects that perhaps they may even be
psychotogenetic or psychosis-producing) in their impact. </p>

<p> But, as usual, a two-valued orientation is inadequate to the
facts. Not &quot;either-or&quot; but &quot;both-and&quot;
expresses the truth of the matter. It is essential to be
multi-valued in approaching the new drugs, which are so profound
and subtle in their operations within the psyche. Not only are
they psychedelic, but also they are psychotomimetic. Even more,
they are psychedelic <i>because</i> they are psychotomimetic, and
psychotomimetic <i>because</i> they are psychedelic. To be shown
the truth about ourselves, to be shown that we are all, to some
extent, frauds and pretenders, strategy-ridden game-players
intent on getting one-up on our fellow game-players, is an
alarming experience. And this is the experience the new drugs may
give us. They psychedelically show us what we are, and we may
psychotomimetically react with terror. In such a case the terror
results from the fact that to cease identifying exclusively with
the game-self and instead to identify a little more with the
Unitary Self is, in a psychological sense, to die to what we have
been in order to be born to what we are capable of becoming. It
is not surprising that some ingestants, in the face of this
threat of imminent death, suddenly panic. </p>

<p> And yet there is value even in panic, psychedelic benefit in
psychotomimetic terror. &quot;Hell,&quot; as Joe K. Adams has
pointed out, &quot;is at least as instructive as heaven.&quot;<sup>15</sup>
One who has been surprised in the act of furtively playing with
his own excrements might as well relax and stop putting on airs
in public. Having been exposed as a confirmed coprophiliac, he
need have no further fear of detection. Similarly, the public
disclosure, as the result of a drug session, that one harbors
within oneself not only a field of shining jewels but also a nest
of scorpions is most liberating. One's defenses drop away. There
is no longer any need to pretend. It becomes easier to admit
publicly that one is aggressive, hostile, fearful, competitive,
slightly paranoid, and utterly addicted to the game of
one-upmanship. And this in turn opens up the possibility that one
may take steps to bring about a change.</p>

<hr>

<p> IT IS a medical truism that sometimes the patient must get
worse in order to get better. Many people in psychotherapy report
increased anxiety as a prelude to decreased anxiety. One reason
for this is that psychotherapy is, in part, a shock treatment for
forcing the patient to see through his own faulty assumptions
about the meaning of his behavior, to drop his defenses. The
treatment hurts, but it is essential to growth. LSD and the other
new drugs may accomplish similar results in a startling way and
with incredible speed. </p>

<p> They may also, of course, fail to do so. They may even,
unless their administration is properly managed, be harmful to
the ingestant. The chief problem appears to be to bring about the
conditions that create trust. If this trust falters, the
ingestant may perceive the temporary loss of the game-self as a
loss of identity and so slip into panic. On the other hand, if
there is no loss of trust he may feel that he has come into his
own true identity at last. </p>

<p> This &quot;true identity,&quot; this Self, is what lies
beyond all names and games. Nameless and unknowable, it is felt
simply as that which knows, a kind of totally uncategorized,
spontaneously integrating principle of creative unity. It is
consciousness itself: the Tao, the Nameless, the Way that cannot
be &quot;wayed,&quot; the Name that cannot be named, the &quot;I
Am&quot; that cannot be conjugated. Whatever it is that moves
spontaneously and freely to give shape and pattern and
meaning&#151;this is what the LSD-ingestant may perceive himself
to be. </p>

<p> Without trust, on the other hand, without confidence in
himself, in his immediate situation, and even in the cosmos as a
whole, he may see himself and others as monstrous and
threatening. His situation then will be, in a heightened form,
that of the ordinary man under ordinary circumstances: He must
achieve faith in the processes of life or perish.</p>

<h2>COMMENTS</h2>

<h3>HUMPHRY OSMOND</h3>

<p> (Commentary on a paper by Richard P. Marsh, &quot;Meaning and
the Mind Drugs.&quot;)</center></p>

<hr>

<p> THIS IS a lively and intelligent paper and I am glad to see
that Dr. Marsh has taken issue boldly and directly with the
matter of psychedelic and psychotomimetic experiences. </p>

<p> I do not think, however, that even he has emphasized
sufficiently how valuable LSD-25 and mescaline, for instance,
have been as psychotomimetics. Our greater understanding of the
experience of schizophrenic patients, derived from studying the
madness-mimicking effect of these substances, has enabled us to
do things which might have been otherwise impossible. Since many
discussions of psychedelics and psychotomimetics deal largely
with their potentials, it may be as well to familiarize ourselves
with some of their actualities. </p>

<p> 1. We have been able to devise much better hospitals for
mentally ill people. Working closely with my friend, Kyo Izumi, a
Canadian architect from Saskatchewan, we developed a new
formulation for mental hospitals in terms of what we have called
socio-architecture. Parts of at least five mental hospitals have
now been built using these ideas. Of the Saskatchewan Hospital,
Yorkton, Saskatchewan, designed by Izumi himself and his
partners, the Joint Information Service of the American
Psychiatric Association wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Kyoshi Izumi, a pioneer in psychiatric architecture,
    designed the physical structure, and designed, or in some
    cases specified, all the furnishings. The result must
    certainly rank among the most attractive and architecturally
    advanced buildings ever constructed for psychiatric services
    .... as for the physical plant, it was a pleasure to view a
    facility that was more than merely new. Creativity and
    imagination were evident in scores of details. We felt the
    wards and day rooms combined efficiency with comfort and
    cheerfulness to a very exceptional degree.<sup>1</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p> TO MY KNOWLEDGE, Mr. Izumi himself took LSD-25 on several
occasions so that he could experience and explore the effect of
perceptual anomalies upon his experience of space, time, color,
and texture. While doing this, he took particular notice of
certain kinds of architectural configurations. These experiences
of his, along with my own&#151;combined with perceptual studies
by our colleagues, Drs. Weckowitz and Sommer, and an extensive
reading of the writings of mentally ill people&#151;formed the
basis of our original formulations and so of his splendid
designs. Psychotomimetic experiences have thus been used for the
benefit of the mentally ill and also of the well people who work
in hospitals. In addition to this, some of the principles which
we have discovered are also being used to develop a better kind
of living accommodation, particularly when large numbers of
people have to live in a communal building. It may be argued that
Kyo Izumi, an unusually gifted person, would have done this just
as well without the use of LSD-25. I do not know how this could
be proved or disproved, but I do know that both he and I believe
that it played a crucial part in deepening our understanding of
the problem and so enlarging the communication between us. The
fruits of this collaboration are there to be judged by any who
care to go and look at them. It is not frivolous to say that
here, indeed, are some of those concrete results of the
psychotomimetic experience which critics have been so keen to
discover. </p>

<p> 2. Because we came to believe that psychotic people were cut
off by their changes in perception, which they could not readily
describe, and did not necessarily understand, we began to pay
close attention to their <i>umwelts</i>, or experiential worlds.
It became evident that due to a professional preoccupation with
the &quot;meaning&quot; of their experiences, the experiences
themselves were often almost completely neglected. Patients who,
for instance, described that the world looked different were
usually supposed to be saying that it was feeling different. In
other words, their perceptual anomalies were ascribed to some
change of mood or affect. For many years little interest had been
paid to the actual experiences of the ill and the social
consequences which might derive from them. To explore these
experiences more thoroughly we developed the HOD (Hoffer-Osmond
Diagnostic Text),<sup>2</sup> which is an exceedingly crude but
unexpectedly effective instrument for exploring the <i>umwelts</i>
of schizophrenic and other patients. This is already showing
considerable usefulness. An ex-schizophrenic patient once
remarked, &quot;I wish you had had this test when I was ill. I
would have known you knew something about my illness.&quot; </p>

<p> The HOD combined with our interest in psychotomimetics has
led to new and very exciting developments in the use of hypnosis
by Fogel and Hoffer<sup>3</sup> (in Canada) and Aaronson<sup>4</sup>
(here in Princeton). Because we ourselves had experienced marked
changes in perception and had listened to our patients reporting
these same happenings, it was easy to suppose that however they
were produced they might have many interesting effects. A great
advantage of hypnosis and post hypnotic suggestion is that it can
be used to study in a very detailed way the effects of clear-cut
and circumscribed perceptual anomalies. Much work of this kind is
now in progress, and while it is time consuming and demanding, it
seems that this will be a very potent tool for exploring the
psyche. Aaronson noted with some surprise that he had been unable
to predict what the psychological effects of a particular set of
perceptual changes would be and suggested that substantial
revisions of our theories of personality may become necessary. In
the course of this work, Hoffer and Fogel have found that in some
subjects the LSD experience can be evoked without LSD
and&#151;even more surprising&#151;that the effects of the drug
can be almost totally repressed, by post hypnotic suggestion. </p>

<p> 4. Mescaline, LSD-25, etc., have great possibilities for
training psychiatrists, psychologists, and others, who are then
less likely to produce standardized answers for their patients'
distresses. Many psychiatrists suppose that because they have
devised or accepted from others an explanation for their
patients' behavior which makes sense to them, they understand
what has been happening to their patients. This, however, is
often not so and the psychiatrist's too ready assumption of
omniscience, although it may be reassuring to him, simply
prevents him from listening to the patient's halting, but often
quite accurate, explanation. Miss Norma McDonald, herself a
sufferer from schizophrenia, wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>One of the most encouraging things which has happened to
    me in recent years was the discovery that I could talk to
    normal people who had had the experience of taking mescaline
    or lysergic acid, and they would accept the things I told
    them about my adventures in mind without asking stupid
    questions or withdrawing into a safe smug world of disbelief.
    Schizophrenia is a lonely illness and friends are of great
    importance. I have needed true friends to help me to believe
    in myself when I doubted my own mind, to encourage me with
    their praise, jolt me out of unrealistic ideas with their
    honesty, and teach me by their example how to work and play.
    The discovery of LSD-25 by those who work in the field of
    psychiatry has widened my circle of friends.<sup>5</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Schizophrenics are lonely because they cannot let their
fellows know what is happening to them and so lose the social
support, help and encouragement which they need so much yet so
rarely evoke. LSD-25, used as a psychotomimetic, allows us to
study these problems of communication from the inside and learn
how to devise better means of helping the sick. This combined
with the HOD and the hypnosis work allow us to reduce the
alienation of these very ill people. We are no longer forced to
suppose that the experience of the schizophrenic person must
always be harmful; indeed, there is growing evidence that the
psychosocial variability which they endure, although dearly
bought by the individual, may be valuable and even necessary to
society, especially in times of change. </p>

<p> 5. Our early work on alcoholism<sup>6</sup> was based on the
idea that it might be helpful to produce a condition resembling
delirium tremens and so allow the patient to &quot;hit
bottom&quot; earlier than he might otherwise do. Later, after we
had become aware of the possibilities of the psychedelic
experience and had exchanged ideas with Dr. A. M. Hubbard of
Vancouver, one of the pioneers of psychedelic therapy on this
continent, we changed directions: Nevertheless, the original
impetus came from our interest in the psychosis-mimicking
experience. </p>

<hr>

<p> THESE FEW illustrations show that these remarkable sub
stances have already impinged on psychiatry in a positive way,
quite apart from their extensive and very interesting use in
psychotherapy. While I would be the last to discourage
investigators from exploring that huge panorama which sweeps from
the creative to the transcendental experiences, I would urge that
we continue to study carefully and intensively some of the rather
mundane matters which I have noted here. While there may be
marked similarities in the ultimate experiences of birth and
death, and while it is valuable to recognize that we have much in
common, the fact is that our day-to-day experience of the world,
our <i>umwelts</i>, can be surprisingly dissimilar. It is often
these dissimilarities, unrecognized and&#151;until we develop
better means of acquainting ourselves with
them&#151;unrecognizable, that lead to the greatest and often
most tragic failures in communication. Life, like art, is, in
William Blake's words, &quot;a matter of minute
particulars.&quot; We must accept, however difficult it may be to
do so, that the &quot;minute particulars&quot; experienced by one
person may be very different from those experienced by other
people, even though they may be very close to him. By patience,
determination, and skill, we can perhaps develop &quot;universal
particulars&quot; in which many more can share and can know that
they are sharing. To do this we must start with very simple
matters and discover the various ways in which each one of us
builds a world comfortable for him, but more or less
incomprehensible and sometimes even grotesquely strange for
others. </p>

<p> The experiences resulting from the use of psychedelic drugs
are often described in religious terms. They are therefore of
interest to those like myself who, in the tradition of William
James, <a href="#footnote1">(1)</a><a name="back1"> are concerned
with the psychology of religion. For more than thirty years I
have been studying the causes, the consequences, and the
conditions of those peculiar states of consciousness in which the
individual discovers himself to be one continuous process with
God, with the Universe, with the Ground of Being, or whatever
name he may use by cultural conditioning or personal preference
for the ultimate and eternal reality. We have no satisfactory and
definitive name for experiences of this kind. The terms
&quot;religious experience,&quot; &quot;mystical
experience,&quot; and &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot; are all
too vague and comprehensive to denote that specific mode of
consciousness which, to those who have known it, is as real and
overwhelming as falling in love. This article describes such
states of consciousness induced by psychedelic drugs, although
they are virtually indistinguishable from genuine mystical
experience. The article then discusses objections to the use of
psychedelic drugs that arise mainly from the opposition between
mystical values and the traditional religious and secular values
of Western society.</a> </p>

<h4>The Psychedelic Experience </h4>

<p> The idea of mystical experiences resulting from drug use is
not readily accepted in Western societies. Western culture has,
historically, a particular fascination with the value and virtue
of man as an individual, self-determining, responsible ego,
controlling himself and his world by the power of conscious
effort and will. Nothing, then, could be more repugnant to this
cultural tradition than the notion of spiritual or psychological
growth through the use of drugs. A &quot;drugged&quot; person is
by definition dimmed in consciousness, fogged in judgment, and
deprived of will. But not all psychotropic
(consciousness-changing) chemicals are narcotic and soporific, as
are alcohol, opiates, and barbiturates. The effects of what are
now called psychedelic (mind-manifesting) chemicals differ from
those of alcohol as laughter differs from rage, or delight from
depression. There is really no analogy between being
&quot;high&quot; on LSD and &quot;drunk&quot; on bourbon. True,
no one in either state should drive a car, but neither should one
drive while reading a book, playing a violin, or making love.
Certain creative activities and states of mind demand a
concentration and devotion that are simply incompatible with
piloting a death-dealing engine along a highway. </p>

<p> I myself have experimented with five of the principal
psychedelics: LSD-25, mescaline, psilocybin, dimethyl-tryptamine
(DMT), and cannabis. I have done so, as William James tried
nitrous oxide, to see if they could help me in identifying what
might be called the &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;active&quot;
ingredients of the mystical experience. For almost all the
classical literature on mysticism is vague, not only in
describing the experience, but also in showing rational
connections between the experience itself and the various
traditional methods recommended to induce it-fasting,
concentration, breathing exercises, prayers, incantations, and
dances. A traditional master of Zen or Yoga, when asked why
such-and-such practices lead or predispose one to the mystical
experience, always responds, &quot;This is the way my teacher
gave it to me. This is the way I found out. If you're seriously
interested, try it for yourself.&quot; This answer hardly
satisfies an impertinent, scientifically minded, and
intellectually curious Westerner. It reminds him of archaic
medical prescriptions compounding five salamanders, powdered
gallows rope, three boiled bats, a scruple of phosphorus, three
pinches of henbane, and a dollop of dragon dung dropped when the
moon was in Pisces. Maybe it worked, but what was the essential
ingredient? </p>

<p> It struck me, therefore, that if any of the psychedelic
chemicals would in fact predispose my consciousness to the
mystical experience, I could use them as instruments for studying
and describing that experience as one uses a microscope for
bacteriology, even though the microscope is an
&quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot; contrivance
which might be said to &quot;distort&quot; the vision of the
naked eye. However, when I was first invited to test the mystical
qualities of LSD-25 by Dr. Keith Ditman of the Neuropsychiatric
Clinic at UCLA Medical School, I was unwilling to believe that
any mere chemical could induce a genuine mystical experience. At
most, it might bring about a state of spiritual insight analogous
to swimming with water wings. Indeed, my first experiment with
LSD-25 was not mystical. It was an intensely interesting
aesthetic and intellectual experience that challenged my powers
of analysis and careful description to the utmost. </p>

<p> Some months later, in 1959, I tried LSD-25 again with Drs.
Sterling Bunnell and Michael Agron, who were then associated with
the Langley-Porter Clinic, in San Francisco. In the course of two
experiments I was amazed and somewhat embarrassed to find myself
going through states of consciousness that corresponded precisely
with every description of major mystical experiences that I had
ever read. <a href="#footnote2">(2)</a><a name="back2">
Furthermore, they exceeded both in depth and in a peculiar
quality of unexpectedness the three &quot;natural and
spontaneous&quot; experiences of this kind that had happened to
me in previous years.</a> </p>

<p> Through subsequent experimentation with LSD-25 and the other
chemicals named above (with the exception of DMT, which I find
amusing but relatively uninteresting), I found I could move with
ease into the state of &quot;cosmic consciousness,&quot; and in
due course became less and less dependent on the chemicals
themselves for &quot;tuning in&quot; to this particular wave
length of experience. Of the five psychedelics tried, I found
that LSD-25 and cannabis suited my purposes best. Of these two,
the latter---cannabis---which I had to use abroad in countries
where it is not outlawed, proved to be the better. It does not
induce bizarre alterations of sensory perception, and medical
studies indicate that it may not, save in great excess, have the
dangerous side effects of LSD. </p>

<p> For the purposes of this study, in describing my experiences
with psychedelic drugs I avoid the occasional and incidental
bizarre alterations of sense perception that psychedelic
chemicals may induce. I am concerned, rather, with the
fundamental alterations of the normal, socially induced
consciousness of one's own existence and relation to the external
world. I am trying to delineate the basic principles of
psychedelic awareness. But I must add that I can speak only for
myself. The quality of these experiences depends considerably
upon one's prior orientation and attitude to life, although the
now voluminous descriptive literature of these experiences
accords quite remarkably with my own. </p>

<p> Almost invariably, my experiments with psychedelics have had
four dominant characteristics. I shall try to explain them -in
the expectation that the reader will say, at least of the second
and third, &quot;Why, that's obvious! No one needs a drug to see
that.&quot; Quite so, but every insight has degrees of intensity.
There can be obvious-1 and obvious-2---and the latter comes on
with shattering clarity, manifesting its implications in every
sphere and dimension of our existence. </p>

<p> The first characteristic is a slowing down of time, a <i>concentration
in the present</i>. One's normally compulsive concern for the
future decreases, and one becomes aware of the enormous
importance and interest of what is happening at the moment. Other
people, going about their business on the streets, seem to be
slightly crazy, failing to realize that the whole point of life
is to be fully aware of it as it happens. One therefore relaxes,
almost luxuriously, into studying the colors in a glass of water,
or in listening to the now highly articulate vibration of every
note played on an oboe or sung by a voice. </p>

<p> From the pragmatic standpoint of our culture, such an
attitude is very bad for business. It might lead to improvidence,
lack of foresight, diminished sales of insurance policies, and
abandoned savings accounts. Yet this is just the corrective that
our culture needs. No one is more fatuously impractical than the
&quot;successful&quot; executive who spends his whole life
absorbed in frantic paper work with the objective of retiring in
comfort at sixty-five, when it will all be too late. Only those
who have cultivated the art of living completely in the present
have any use for making plans for the future, for when the plans
mature they will be able to enjoy the results. &quot;Tomorrow
never comes.&quot; I have never yet heard a preacher urging his
congregation to practice that section of the Sermon on the Mount
which begins, &quot;Be not anxious for the morrow....&quot; The
truth is that people who live for the future are, as we say of
the insane, &quot;not quite all there&quot;--- or here: by
over-eagerness they are perpetually missing the point. Foresight
is bought at the price of anxiety, and when overused it destroys
all its own advantages. </p>

<p> The second characteristic I will call <i>awareness of
polarity</i>. This is the vivid realization that states, things,
and events that we ordinarily call opposite are interdependent,
like back and front, or the poles of a magnet. By polar awareness
one sees that things which are explicitly different are
implicitly one: self and other, subject and object, left and
right, male and female-and then, a little more surprisingly,
solid and space, figure and background, pulse and interval,
saints and sinners, police and criminals, in-groups and
out-groups. Each is definable only in terms of the other, and
they go together transactionally, like buying and selling, for
there is no sale without a purchase, and no purchase without a
sale. As this awareness becomes increasingly intense, you feel
that you yourself are polarized with the external universe in
such a way that you imply each other. Your push is its pull, and
its push is your pull---as when you move the steering wheel of a
car. Are you pushing it or pulling it? </p>

<p> At first, this is a very odd sensation, not unlike hearing
your own voice played back to you on an electronic system
immediately after you have spoken. You become confused, and wait
for <i>it</i> to go on! Similarly, you feel that you are
something being done by the universe, yet that the universe is
equally something being done by you-which is true, at least in
the neurological sense that the peculiar structure of our brains
translates the sun into light, and air vibrations into sound. Our
normal sensation of relationship to the outside world is that
sometimes I push it, and sometimes it pushes me. But if the two
are actually one, where does action begin and responsibility
rest? If the universe is doing me, how can I be sure that, two
seconds hence, I will still remember the English language? If I
am doing it, how can I be sure that, two seconds hence, my brain
will know how to turn the sun into light? From such unfamiliar
sensations as these, the psychedelic experience can generate
confusion, paranoia, and terror-even though the individual is
feeling his relationship to the world exactly as it would be
described by a biologist, ecologist, or physicist, for he is
feeling himself as the unified field of organism and environment.
</p>

<p> The third characteristic, arising from the second, is <i>awareness
of relativity</i>. I see that I am a link in an infinite
hierarchy of processes and beings, ranging from molecules through
bacteria and insects to human beings, and, maybe, to angels and
gods-a hierarchy in which every level is in effect the same
situation. For example, the poor man worries about money while
the rich man worries about his health: the worry is the same, but
the difference is in its substance or dimension. I realize that
fruit flies must think of themselves as people, because, like
ourselves, they find themselves in the middle of their own
world-with immeasurably greater things above and smaller things
below. To us, they all look alike and seem to have no
personality-as do the Chinese when we have not lived among them.
Yet fruit flies must see just as many subtle distinctions among
themselves as we among ourselves. </p>

<p> From this it is but a short step to the realization that all
forms of life and being are simply variations on a single theme:
we are all in fact one being doing the same thing in as many
different ways as possible. As the French proverb goes, <i>plus
ca change, plus c'est la meme chose</i> (the more it varies, the
more it is one). I see, further, that feeling threatened by the
inevitability of death is really the same experience as feeling
alive, and that as all beings are feeling this everywhere, they
are all just as much &quot;I&quot; as myself. Yet the
&quot;I&quot; feeling, to be felt at all, must always be a
sensation relative to the &quot;other&quot;-to something beyond
its control and experience . To be at all, it must begin and end.
But the intellectual jump that mystical and psychedelic
experiences make here is in enabling you to see that all these
myriad I-centers are yourself---not, indeed, your personal and
superficially conscious ego, but what Hindus call the <i>paramatman</i>,
the Self of all selves. <a href="#footnote3">(3)</a> <a
name="back3">As the retina enables us to see countless pulses of
energy as a single light, so the mystical experience shows us
innumerable individuals as a single Self.</a> </p>

<p> The fourth characteristic is <i>awareness of eternal energy</i>,
often in the form of intense white light, which seems to be both
the current in your nerves and that mysterious e which equals
mc2. This may sound like megalomania or delusion of grandeur-but
one sees quite clearly that all existence is a single energy, and
that this energy is one's own being. Of course there is death as
well as life, because energy is a pulsation, and just as waves
must have both crests and troughs, the experience of existing
must go on and off. Basically, therefore, there is simply nothing
to worry about, because you yourself are the eternal energy of
the universe playing hide- and-seek (off-and-on) with itself. At
root, you are the Godhead, for God is all that there is. Quoting
Isaiah just a little out of context: &quot;I am the Lord, and
there is none else. I form the light and create the darkness: I
make peace, and create evil. I, the Lord, do all these
things.&quot; <a href="#footnote4">(4)</a> <a name="back4">This
is the sense of the fundamental tenet of Hinduism, <i>Tat tram
asi</i>---&quot;THAT (i.e., &quot;that subtle Being of which this
whole universe is composed&quot;) art thou.&quot; </a><a
href="#footnote5">(5)</a> <a name="back5">A classical case of
this experience, from the West, is in Tennyson's Memoirs:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A kind of waking trance I have frequently had, quite up
    from boyhood, when I have been all alone. This has generally
    come upon me thro' repeating my own name two or three times
    to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the
    intensity of the consciousness of individuality, the
    individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into
    boundless being, and this not a confused state, but the
    clearest of the clearest, the surest of the surest, the
    weirdest of the weirdest, utterly beyond words, where death
    was an almost laughable impossibility, the loss of
    personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction but the
    only true life. <a href="#footnote6">(6)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <a name="back6">Obviously, these characteristics of the
psychedelic experience, as I have known it, are aspects of a
single state of consciousness--for I have been describing the
same thing from different angles. The descriptions attempt to
convey the reality of the experience, but in doing so they also
suggest some of the inconsistencies between such experience and
the current values of society.</a> </p>

<h4>Opposition to Psychedelic Drugs </h4>

<p> Resistance to allowing use of psychedelic drugs originates in
both religious and secular values. The difficulty in describing
psychedelic experiences in traditional religious terms suggests
one ground of opposition. The Westerner must borrow such words as
<i>samadhi</i> or <i>moksha</i> from the Hindus, or <i>satori</i>
or <i>kensho</i> from the Japanese, to describe the experience of
oneness with the universe. We have no appropriate word because
our own Jewish and Christian theologies will not accept the idea
that man's inmost self can be identical with the Godhead, even
though Christians may insist that this was true in the unique
instance of Jesus Christ. Jews and Christians think of God in
political and monarchical terms, as the supreme governor of the
universe, the ultimate boss. Obviously, it is both socially
unacceptable and logically preposterous for a particular
individual to claim that he, in person, is the omnipotent and
omniscient ruler of the world-to be accorded suitable recognition
and honor. </p>

<p> Such an imperial and kingly concept of the ultimate reality,
however, is neither necessary nor universal. The Hindus and the
Chinese have no difficulty in conceiving of an identity of the
self and the Godhead. For most Asians, other than Muslims, the
Godhead moves and manifests the world in much the same way that a
centipede manipulates a hundred legs-spontaneously, without
deliberation or calculation. In other words, they conceive the
universe by analogy with an organism as distinct from a
mechanism. They do not see it as an artifact or construct under
the conscious direction of some supreme technician, engineer, or
architect. </p>

<p> If, however, in the context of Christian or Jewish tradition,
an individual declares himself to be one with God, he must be
dubbed blasphemous (subversive) or insane. Such a mystical
experience is a clear threat to traditional religious concepts.
The Judaeo-Christian tradition has a monarchical image of God,
and monarchs, who rule by force, fear nothing more than
insubordination. The Church has therefore always been highly
suspicious of mystics, because they seem to be insubordinate and
to claim equality or, worse, identity with God. For this reason,
John Scotus Erigena and Meister Eckhart were condemned as
heretics. This was also why the Quakers faced opposition for
their doctrine of the Inward Light, and for their refusal to
remove hats in church and in court. A few occasional mystics may
be all right so long as they watch their language, like St.
Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross, who maintained, shall
we say, a metaphysical distance of respect between themselves and
their heavenly King. Nothing, however, could be more alarming to
the ecclesiastical hierarchy than a popular outbreak of
mysticism, for this might well amount to setting up a democracy
in the kingdom of heaven-and such alarm would be shared equally
by Catholics, Jews, and fundamentalist Protestants. </p>

<p> The monarchical image of God, with its implicit distaste for
religious insubordination, has a more pervasive impact than many
Christians might admit. The thrones of kings have walls
immediately behind them, and all who present themselves at court
must prostrate themselves or kneel, because this is an awkward
position from which to make a sudden attack. It has perhaps never
occurred to Christians that when they design a church on the
model of a royal court (basilica) and prescribe church ritual,
they are implying that God, like a human monarch, is afraid. This
is also implied by flattery in prayers: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>O Lord our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of
    kings, Lord of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost
    from thy throne behold all the dwellers upon earth: most
    heartily we beseech thee with thy favor to behold....<a
    href="#footnote7">(7)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <a name="back7">The Western man who claims consciousness of
oneness with God or the universe thus clashes with his society's
concept of religion. In most Asian cultures, however, such a man
will be congratulated as having penetrated the true secret of
life. He has arrived, by chance or by some such discipline as
Yoga or Zen meditation, at a state of consciousness in which he
experiences directly and vividly what our own scientists know to
be true in theory. For the ecologist, the biologist, and the
physicist know (but seldom feel) that every organism constitutes
a single field of behavior, or process, with its environment.
There is no way of separating what any given organism is doing
from what its environment is doing, for which reason ecologists
speak not of organisms in environments but of
organism-environments. Thus the words &quot;I&quot; and
&quot;self&quot; should properly mean what the whole universe is
doing at this particular &quot;here-and-now&quot; called John
Doe.</a> </p>

<p> The kingly concept of God makes identity of self and God, or
self and universe, inconceivable in Western religious terms. The
difference between Eastern and Western concepts of man and his
universe, however, extends beyond strictly religious concepts.
The Western scientist may rationally perceive the idea of
organism-environment, but he does not ordinarily feel this to be
true. By cultural and social conditioning, he has been hypnotized
into experiencing himself as an ego- as an isolated center of
consciousness and will inside a bag of skin, confronting an
external and alien world. We say, &quot;I came into this
world.&quot; But we did nothing of the kind. We came out of it in
just the same way that fruit comes out of trees. Our galaxy, our
cosmos, &quot;peoples&quot; in the same way that an apple tree
&quot;apples.&quot; </p>

<p> Such a vision of the universe clashes with the idea of a
monarchical God, with the concept of the separate ego, and even
with the secular, atheist/agnostic mentality, which derives its
common sense from the mythology of nineteenth-century scientist
According to this view, the universe is a mindless mechanism and
man a sort of accidental microorganism infesting a minute
globular rock that revolves about an unimportant star on the
outer fringe of one of the minor galaxies. This
&quot;put-down&quot; theory of man is extremely common among such
quasi scientists as sociologists, psychologists, and
psychiatrists, most of whom are still thinking of the world in
terms of Newtonian mechanics, and have never really caught up
with the ideas of Einstein and Bohr, Oppenheimer and Schrodinger.
Thus to the ordinary institutional-type psychiatrist, any patient
who gives the least hint of mystical or religious experience is
automatically diagnosed as deranged. From the standpoint of the
mechanistic religion, he is a heretic and is given electroshock
therapy as an up-to-date form of thumbscrew and rack. And,
incidentally, it is just this kind of quasi scientist who, as
consultant to government and law-enforcement agencies, dictates
official policies on the use of psychedelic chemicals. </p>

<p> Inability to accept the mystic experience is more than an
intellectual handicap. Lack of awareness of the basic unity of
organism and environment is a serious and dangerous
hallucination. For in a civilization equipped with immense
technological power, the sense of alienation between man and
nature leads to the use of technology in a hostile spirit---to
the &quot;conquest&quot; of nature instead of intelligent
co-operation with nature. The result is that we are eroding and
destroying our environment, spreading Los Angelization instead of
civilization. This is the major threat overhanging Western,
technological culture, and no amount of reasoning or
doom-preaching seems to help. We simply do not respond to the
prophetic and moralizing techniques of conversion upon which Jews
and Christians have always relied. But people have an obscure
sense of what is good for them-call it &quot;unconscious
self-healing,&quot; &quot;survival instinct,&quot; &quot;positive
growth potential,&quot; or what you will. Among the educated
young there is therefore a startling and unprecedented interest
in the transformation of human consciousness. All over the
Western world publishers are selling millions of books dealing
with Yoga, Vedanta, Zen Buddhism, and the chemical mysticism of
psychedelic drugs, and I have come to believe that the whole
&quot;hip&quot; subculture, however misguided in some of its
manifestations, is the earnest and responsible effort of young
people to correct the self-destroying course of industrial
civilization. </p>

<p> The content of the mystical experience is thus inconsistent
with both the religious and secular concepts of traditional
Western thought. Moreover, mystical experiences often result in
attitudes that threaten the authority not only of established
churches, but also of secular society. Unafraid of death and
deficient in worldly ambition, those who have undergone mystical
experiences are impervious to threats and promises. Moreover,
their sense of the relativity of good and evil arouses the
suspicion that they lack both conscience and respect for law. Use
of psychedelics in the United States by a literate bourgeoisie
means that an important segment of the population is indifferent
to society's traditional rewards and sanctions. </p>

<p> In theory, the existence within our secular society of a
group that does not accept conventional values is consistent with
our political vision. But one of the great problems of the United
States, legally and politically, is that we have never quite had
the courage of our convictions. The Republic is founded on the
marvelously sane principle that a human community can exist and
prosper only on a basis of mutual trust. Metaphysically, the
American Revolution was a rejection of the dogma of Original Sin,
which is the notion that because you cannot trust yourself or
other people, there must be some Superior Authority to keep us
all in order. The dogma was rejected because, if it is true that
we cannot trust ourselves and others, it follows that we cannot
trust the Superior Authority which we ourselves conceive and
obey, and that the very idea of our own untrustworthiness is
unreliable! </p>

<p> Citizens of the United States believe, or are supposed to
believe, that a republic is the best form of government. Yet vast
confusion arises from trying to be republican in politics and
monarchist in religion. How can a republic be the best form of
government if the universe, heaven, and hell are a monarchy? <a
href="#footnote8">(8)</a> <a name="back8">Thus, despite the
theory of government by consent, based upon mutual trust, the
peoples of the United States retain, from the authoritarian
backgrounds of their religions or national origins, an utterly
naive faith in law as some sort of supernatural and paternalistic
power. &quot;There ought to be a law against it!&quot; Our
law-enforcement officers are therefore confused, hindered, and
bewildered-not to mention corrupted-by being asked to enforce
sumptuary laws, often of ecclesiastical origin, that vast numbers
of people have no intention of obeying and that, in any case, are
immensely difficult or simply impossible to enforce-for example,
the barring of anything so undetectable as LSD-25 from
international and interstate commerce.</a> </p>

<p> Finally, there are two specific objections to use of
psychedelic drugs. First, use of these drugs may be dangerous.
However, every worth-while exploration is dangerous-climbing
mountains, testing aircraft, rocketing into outer space, skin
diving, or collecting botanical specimens in jungles. But if you
value knowledge and the actual delight of exploration more than
mere duration of uneventful life, you are willing to take the
risks. It is not really healthy for monks to practice fasting,
and it was hardly hygienic for Jesus to get himself crucified,
but these are risks taken in the course of spiritual adventures.
Today the adventurous young are taking risks in exploring the
psyche, testing their mettle at the task just as, in times past,
they have tested it---more violently---in hunting, dueling,
hot-rod racing, and playing football. What they need is not
prohibitions and policemen, but the most intelligent
encouragement and advice that can be found. </p>

<p> Second, drug use may be criticized as an escape from reality.
However, this criticism assumes unjustly that the mystical
experiences themselves are escapist or unreal. LSD, in
particular, is by no means a soft and cushy escape from reality.
It can very easily be an experience in which you have to test
your soul against all the devils in hell. For me, it has been at
times an experience in which I was at once completely lost in the
corridors of the mind and yet relating that very lostness to the
exact order of logic and language, simultaneously very mad and
very sane. But beyond these occasional lost and insane episodes,
there are the experiences of the world as a system of total
harmony and glory, and the discipline of relating these to the
order of logic and language must somehow explain how what William
Blake called that &quot;energy which is eternal delight&quot; can
consist with the misery and suffering of everyday life. <a
href="#footnote9">(9)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="back9">The undoubted mystical and religious intent
of most users of the psychedelics, even if some of these
substances should be proved injurious to physical health,
requires that their free and responsible use be exempt from legal
restraint in any republic that maintains a constitutional
separation of church and state. </a><a href="#footnote10">(10)</a>
<a name="back10">To the extent that mystical experience conforms
with the tradition of genuine religious involvement, and to the
extent that psychedelics induce that experience, users are
entitled to some constitutional protection. Also, to the extent
that research in the psychology of religion can utilize such
drugs, students of the human mind must be free to use them. Under
present laws, I, as an experienced student of the psychology of
religion, can no longer pursue research in the field. This is a
barbarous restriction of spiritual and intellectual freedom,
suggesting that the legal system of the United States is, after
all, in tacit alliance with the monarchical theory of the
universe, and will, therefore, prohibit and persecute religious
ideas and practices based on an organic and unitary vision of the
universe. </a><a href="#footnote11">(11)</a> </p>

Religious Experience</i> (1902). </a><a href="#back1">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="footnote3">(3) Thus Hinduism regards the universe
not as an artifact, but as an immense drama in which the One
Actor (the <i>paramatman</i> or <i>brakman</i>) plays all the
parts, which are his (or &quot;its&quot;) masks or personae. The
sensation of being only this one particular self, John Doe, is
due to the Actor's total absorption in playing this and every
other part. For fuller exposition, see S. Radhakrishnan, <i>The
Hindu View of Life</i> (1927); H. Zimmer, <i>Philosophies of
India</i> (1951), pp. 355-463. A popular version is in A. Watts, <i>The

<p> <a name="footnote8">(8) Thus, until quite recently, belief in
a Supreme Being was a legal test of valid conscientious objection
to military service. The implication was that the individual
objector found himself bound to obey a higher echelon of command
than the President and Congress. The analogy is military and
monarchical, and therefore objectors who, as Buddhists or
naturalists, held an organic theory of the universe often had
difficulty in obtaining recognition. </a><a href="#back8">(back)</a>
</p>

</p>

<p> <a name="footnote10">(10) &quot;Responsible&quot; in the
sense that such substances be taken by or administered to
consenting adults only. The user of cannabis, in particular, is
apt to have peculiar difficulties in establishing his
&quot;undoubted mystical and religious intent&quot; in court.
Having committed so loathsome and serious a felony, his chances
of clemency are better if he assumes a repentant demeanor, which
is quite inconsistent with the sincere belief that his use of
cannabis was religious. On the other hand, if he insists
unrepentantly that he looks upon such use as a religious
sacrament, many judges will declare that they &quot;dislike his
attitude,&quot; finding it truculent and lacking in appreciation
of the gravity of the crime, and the sentence will be that much
harsher. The accused is therefore put in a
&quot;double-bind&quot; situation, in which he is &quot;damned if
he does, and damned if he doesn't.&quot; Furthermore, religious
integrity-as in conscientious objection-is generally tested and
established by membership in some church or religious
organization with a substantial following. But the felonious
status of cannabis is such that grave suspicion would be cast
upon all individuals forming such an organization, and the test
cannot therefore be fulfilled. It is generally forgotten that our
guarantees of religious freedom were designed to protect
precisely those who were not members of established
denominations, but rather such (then) screwball and subversive
individuals as Quakers, Shakers, Levellers, and Anabaptists.
There is little question that those who use cannabis or other
psychedelics with religious intent are now members of a
persecuted religion which appears to the rest of society as a
grave menace to &quot;mental health,&quot; as distinct from the
old-fashioned &quot;immortal soul.&quot; But it's the same old
story. </a><a href="#back10">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="footnote11">(11) Amerindians belonging to the Native
American Church who employ the psychedelic peyote cactus in their
rituals, are firmly opposed to any government control of this
plant, even if they should be guaranteed the right to its use.
They feel that peyote is a natural gift of God to mankind, and
especially to natives of the land where it grows, and that no
government has a right to interfere with its use The same
argument might be made on behalf of cannabis, or the mushroom <i>Psilocybe
mexicana Heim</i>. All these things are natural plants, not
processed or synthesized drugs, and by what authority can
individuals be prevented from eating theme There is no law
against eating or growing the mushroom <i>Amanita pantherina</i>,
even though it is fatally poisonous and only experts can
distinguish it from a common edible mushroom. This case can be
made even from the standpoint of believers in the monarchical
universe of Judaism and Christianity, for it is a basic principle
of both religions, derived from Genesis, that all natural
substances created by God are inherently good, and that evil can
arise only in their misuse. Thus laws against mere possession, or
even cultivation, of these plants are in basic conflict with
biblical principles. Criminal conviction of those who employ
these plants should be based on proven misuse. &quot;And God said
'Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon
the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the
fruit of a tree yielding seed- to you it shall be for meat....
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good.&quot; Genesis 1:29, 31. <br>

<h2>The New Alchemy</h2>

<h5>Alan Watts</h5>

<p> an essay from <i>This is It and Other Essays on Zen and
Spiritual Experience,</i> by Alan Watts, Vintage Books, 1973,
copyright Alan Watts 1958, 1960. This essay was written in 1960. </p>

<hr>

<p> Besides the philosopher's stone that would turn base metal
into gold, one of the great quests of alchemy in both Europe and
Asia was the elixir of immortality. In gullible enthusiasm for
this quest, more than one Chinese emperor died of the fabulous
concoctions of powdered jade, tea, ginseng, and precious metals
prepared by Taoist priests. But just as the work of transforming
lead into gold was in many cases a chemical symbolism for a
spiritual transformation of man himself, so the immortality to be
conferred by the elixir was not always the literally everlasting
life but rather the transportation of consciousness into a state
beyond time. Modern physicists have solved the problem of
changing lead into gold, though the process is somewhat more
expensive than digging gold from the earth. But in the last few
years modem chemists have prepared one or two substances for
which it may be claimed that in some cases they induce states of
mind remarkably similar to cosmic consciousness. </p>

<p> To many people such claims are deeply disturbing. For one
thing, mystical experience seems altogether too easy when it
simply comes out of a bottle, and is thus available to people who
have done nothing to deserve it, who have neither fasted nor
prayed nor practiced yoga. For another, the claim seems to imply
that - spiritual insight is after all only a matter of body
chemistry involving a total reduction of the spiritual to the
material. These are serious considerations, even though one may
be convinced that in the long run the difficulty is found to rest
upon semantic confusion as to the definitions of
&quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;material.&quot; </p>

<p> However, it should be pointed out that there is nothing new
or disreputable in the idea that spiritual insight Is an
undeserved gift of divine grace, often conveyed through such
material or sacramental means as the water of baptism and the
bread and wine of the mass. The priest who by virtue of his
office transforms bread and wine into the body and blood of
Christ, <i>ex opere operato</i>, by the simple repetition of the
formula of the Last Supper, is in a situation not radically
different from that of the scientist who, by repeating the right
formula of an experiment, may effect a transformation in the
brain. The comparative worth of the two operations must be judged
by their effects. There were always those upon whom the
sacraments of baptism and communion did not seem to
&quot;take,&quot; whose lives remained effectively unregenerate.
Likewise, none of these consciousness-changing chemicals are
literally mystical experience in a bottle. Many who receive them
experience only ecstasies without insight, or just an unpleasant
confusion of sensation and imagination. States akin to mystical
experience arise only in certain individuals and then often
depend upon considerable concentration and effort to use the
change of consciousness in certain ways. It is important here,
too, to stress the point that ecstasy is only Incidental to the
authentic mystical experience, the essence of which might best be
described as insight, as the word is now used in psychiatry. </p>

<p> A chemical of this kind might perhaps be said to be an aid to
perception in the same way as the telescope, microscope, or
spectroscope, save in this case that the instrument is not an
external object but an internal state of the nervous system. All
such instruments are relatively useless without proper training
and preparation not only in their handling, but also in the
particular field of investigation, </p>

<p> These considerations alone are already almost enough to show
that the use of such chemicals does not reduce spiritual insight
to a mere matter of body chemistry. But it should be added that
even when we can describe certain events in terms of chemistry
this does not mean that such events are merely chemical. A
chemical description of spiritual experience has somewhat the
same use and the same limits as the chemical description of a
great painting. It is simple enough to make a chemical analysis
of the paint, and for artists and connoisseurs alike there is
some point in doing so. It might also be possible to work out a
chemical description of all the processes that go on in the
artist while he is painting. But it would be incredibly
complicated, and in the meantime the same processes could be
described and communicated far more effectively in some other
language than the chemical. We should probably say that a process
<i>is</i> chemical only when chemical language is the most
effective means of describing it. Analogously, some of the
chemicals known as psychedelics provide opportunities for
mystical insight in much the same way that well-prepared paints
and brushes provide opportunities for fine painting, or a
beautifully constructed piano for great music. They make it
easier, but they do not accomplish the work all by themselves. </p>

<p> The two chemicals which are of most use in creating a change
of consciousness conducive to spiritual experience are mescaline
and lysergic acid diethylamide (known, for short, as LSD). The
former is a synthetic formulation of the active ingredients of
the peyote cactus, and the latter a purely synthetic chemical of
the indole group which produces its effects even in such minute
amounts as twenty-five micrograms. The specific effects of these
chemicals are hard to identify with any clarity, and so far as is
known at present they seem to operate upon the nervous system by
reducing some of the inhibitory mechanisms which ordinarily have
a screening effect upon our consciousness. Certain psychiatrists
who seem overly anxious to hang on to the socially approved
sensation of reality---more or less the world as perceived on a
bleak Monday morning---classify these chemicals as hallucinogens
producing toxic effects of a schizoid or psychotic character. I
am afraid this is psychiatric gobbledygook: a sort of
authoritative rumble of disapproval. Neither substance is an
addictive drug, like heroin or opium, and it has never been
demonstrated that they have harmful effects upon people who were
not otherwise seriously disturbed. It is begging the question to
call the changes of consciousness which they educe
hallucinations, for some of the unusual things felt and seen may
be no more unreal than the unfamiliar forms perceived through a
microscope. We do not know. It is also begging the question to
call their effects toxic, which might mean poisonous, unless this
word can also be used for the effects of vitamins or proteins.
Such language is evaluative, not descriptive in any scientific
sense. </p>

<p> Somewhat more than two years ago (1958) I was asked by a
psychiatric research group to take 100 micrograms of lysergic
acid, to see whether it would reproduce anything resembling a
mystical experience. It did not do so, and so far as I know the
reason was that I had not then learned how to direct my inquiries
when under its influence. It seemed instead that my senses had
been given a kaleidoscopic character (and this is no more than a
metaphor) which made the whole world entrancingly complicated, as
if I were involved in a multidimensional arabesque. Colors became
so vivid that flowers, leaves, and fabrics seemed to be illumined
from inside. The random patterns of blades of grass in a lawn
appeared to be exquisitely organized without, however, any actual
distortion of vision. Black ink or <i>sumi </i>paintings by
Chinese and Japanese artists appeared almost to be three
dimensional photographs, and what are ordinarily dismissed as
irrelevant details of speech, behavior, appearance, and form
seemed in some indefinable way to be highly significant.
Listening to music with closed eyes, I beheld the most
fascinating patterns of dancing jewelry, mosaic, tracery, and
abstract images. At one point everything appeared to be
uproariously funny, especially the gestures and actions of people
going about their everyday business. Ordinary remarks seemed to
reverberate with double and quadruple meanings, and the
role-playing behavior of those around me not only became
unusually evident but also implied concealed attitudes contrary
or complementary to its overt intention. In short, the screening
or selective apparatus of our normal interpretative evaluation of
experience had been partially suspended, with the result that I
was presumably projecting the sensation of meaning or
significance upon just about everything. The whole experience was
vastly entertaining and interesting, but as yet nothing like any
mystical experience that I had had before. </p>

<p> It was not until a year later that I tried LSD again, this
time at the request of another research team. Since then I have
repeated the experiment five times, with dosages varying from 75
to 100 micrograms. My impression has been that such experiments
are profound and rewarding to the extent that I do my utmost to
observe perceptual and evaluative changes and to describe them as
clearly and completely as possible, usually with the help of a
tape recorder. To give a play-by- play description of each
experiment might be clinically interesting, but what I am
concerned with here is a philosophical discussion of some of the
high points and recurrent themes of my experiences. Psychiatrists
have not yet made up their minds as to whether LSD is useful in
therapy, but at present I am strongly inclined to feel that its
major use may turn out to be only secondarily as a therapeutic
and primarily as an instrumental aid to the creative artist,
thinker, or scientist. I should observe, in passing, that the
human and natural environment in which these experiments are
conducted is of great importance, and that its use in hospital
wards with groups of doctors firing off clinical questions at the
subject is most undesirable. The supervising physician should
take a human attitude, and drop all defensive dramatizations of
scientific objectivity and medical authority, conducting the
experiment in surroundings of some natural or artistic beauty. </p>

<p> I have said that my general impression of the first
experiment was that the &quot;mechanism&quot; by which we screen
our sense-data and select only some of them as significant had
been partially suspended. Consequently, I felt that the
particular feeling which we associate with &quot;the
meaningful&quot; was projected indiscriminately upon everything,
and then rationalized in ways that might strike an independent
observer as ridiculous---unless, perhaps, the subject were
unusually clever at rationalizing. However, the philosopher
cannot pass up the point that our selection of some sense-data as
significant and others as insignificant is always with relation
to particular purposes---survival, the quest for certain
pleasures, finding one's way to some destination, or whatever it
may be. But in every experiment with LSD one of the first effects
I have noticed is a profound relaxation combined with an
abandonment of purposes and goals, reminding me of the Taoist
saying that &quot;when purpose has been used to achieve
purposelessness, the thing has been grasped.&quot; I have felt,
in other words, endowed with all the time in the world, free to
look about me as if I were living in eternity without a single
problem to be solved. It is just for this reason that the busy
and purposeful actions of other people seem at this time to be so
comic, for it becomes obvious that by setting themselves goals
which are always in the future, in the &quot;tomorrow which never
comes,&quot; they are missing entirely the point of being alive. </p>

<p> When, therefore, our selection of sense-impressions is not
organized with respect to any particular purpose, all the
surrounding details of the world must appear to be equally
meaningful or equally meaningless. Logically, these are two ways
of saying the same thing, but the overwhelming feeling of my own
LSD experiences is that all aspects of the world become
meaningful rather than meaningless. This is not to say that they
acquire meaning in the sense of signs, by virtue of pointing to
something else, but that all things appear to be their own point.
Their simple existence, or better, their present formation, seems
to be perfect, to be an end or fulfillment without any need for
justification. Flowers do not bloom in order to produce seeds,
nor are seeds germinated in order to bring forth flowers. Each
stage of the process---seed, sprout, bud, flower, and fruit---
may be regarded as the goal. A chicken is one eggs way of
producing others. In our normal experience something of the same
kind takes place in music and the dance, where the point of the
action is each moment of its unfolding and not just the temporal
end of the performance. </p>

<p> Such a translation of everyday experience into something of
the same nature as music has been the beginning and the
prevailing undertone of all my experiments. But LSD does not
simply suspend the selective process by cutting it out. It would
be more exact to say that it shows the relativity of our ordinary
evaluation of sense-data by suggesting others. It permits the
mind to organize its sensory impressions in new patterns. In my
second experiment I noticed, for example, that all repeated
forms---leaves on a stem, books on shelves, mullions in
windows---gave me the sensation of seeing double or even
multiple, as if the second, third, and fourth leaves on the stem
were reflections of the first, seen, as it were, in several
thicknesses of window glass. When I mentioned this, the attending
physician held up his finger to see if it would give me a double
image. For a moment it seemed to do so, but all at once I saw
that the second image had its basis in a wisp of cigar smoke
passing close to his finger and upon which my consciousness had
projected the highlights and outline of a second finger. As I
then concentrated upon this sensation of doubling or repeating
images, it seemed suddenly as if the whole field of sight were a
transparent liquid rippled in concentric circles as in dropping a
stone into a pool. The normal images of things around me were not
distorted by this pattern. They remained just as usual, but my
attention directed itself to highlights, lines, and shadows upon
them that fitted the pattern, letting those that did not fall
into relative insignificance. As soon, however, as I noticed this
projection and became aware of details that did not fit the
pattern, it seemed as if whole handfuls of pebbles had been
thrown into-the optical space, rippling it with concentric
circles that overlapped in all directions, so that every visible
point became an intersection of circles. The optical field
seemed, in fact, to have a structured grain like a photograph
screened for reproduction, save that the organization of the
grains was not rectilinear but circular. In this way every detail
fitted the pattern and the field of vision became <i>pointillist</i>,
like a painting by Seurat. </p>

<p> This sensation raised a number of questions. Was my mind
imperiously projecting its own geometrical designs upon the
world, thus &quot;hallucinating&quot; a structure in things which
is not actually there? Or is what we call the &quot;real&quot;
structure of things simply a learned projection or hallucination
which we hold in common? Or was I somehow becoming aware of the
actual grain of the rods and cones in my retina, for even a
hallucination must have some actual basis in the nervous system?
On another occasion I was looking closely at a handful of sand,
and in becoming aware that I could not get it into clear focus I
became conscious of every detail and articulation of the way in
which my eyes were fuzzing the image---and this was certainly
perception of a grain or distortion in the eyes themselves. </p>

<p> The general impression of these optical sensations is that
the eyes, without losing the normal area of vision, have become
microscopes, and that the texture of the visual field is
infinitely rich and complex. I do not know whether this is actual
awareness of the multiplicity of nerve-endings in the retina, or,
for that matter, in the fingers, for the same grainy feeling
arose in the sense of touch. But the effect of feeling that this
is or may be so is, as it were, to turn the senses back upon
themselves, and so to realize that seeing the external world is
also seeing the eyes. In other words, I became vividly aware of
the fact that what I call shapes, colors, and textures in the
outside world are also states of my nervous system, that is, of
me. In knowing them I also know my self. But the strange part of
this apparent sensation of my own senses was that I did not
appear to be inspecting them from outside or from a distance, as
if they were <i>objects.</i> I can say only that the awareness of
grain or structure in the senses seemed to be awareness of
awareness, of myself from inside myself. Because of this, it
followed that the distance or separation between myself and my
senses, on the one hand, and the external world, on the other,
seemed to disappear I was no longer a detached observer, a little
man inside my own head, <i>having </i>sensations. I was the
sensations, so much so that there was nothing left of me, the
observing ego, except the series of sensations which
happened---not to me, but just happened---moment by moment, one
after another. </p>

<p> To become the sensations, as distinct from having them,
engenders the most astonishing sense of freedom and release. For
it implies that experience is not something in which one is
trapped or by which one is pushed around, or against which one
must fight. The conventional duality of subject and object,
knower and known, feeler and feeling, is changed into a polarity:
the knower and the known become the poles, terms, or phases of a
single event which happens, not to me or <i>from</i> me, but of
itself. The experiencer and the experience become a single,
ever-changing self-forming process, complete and fulfilled at
every moment of its unfolding, and of infinite complexity and
subtlety. It is like, not watching, but being, a coiling
arabesque of smoke patterns in the air, or of ink dropped in
water, or of a dancing snake which seems to move from every part
of its body at once. This may be a &quot;drug-induced
hallucination,&quot; but it corresponds exactly to what Dewey and
Bentley have called the transactional relationship of the
organism to its environment. This is to say that all our actions
and experiences arise mutually from the organism and from the
environment at the same time. The eyes can see light because of
the sun, but the sun is light because of the eyes. Ordinarily,
under the hypnosis of social conditioning, we feel quite distinct
from our physical surroundings, facing them rather than belonging
in them. Yet in this way we ignore and screen out the physical
fact of our total interdependence with the natural world. We are
as embodied in it as our own cells and molecules are embodied in
us. Our neglect and repression of this interrelationship gives
special urgency to all the new sciences of ecology, studying the
interplay of organisms with their environments, and warning us
against ignorant interference with the balances of nature. </p>

<p> The sensation that events are happening of themselves, and
that nothing is <i>making</i> them happen and that they are not
happening <i>to</i> anything, has always been a major feature of
my experiences with LSD. It is possible that the chemical is
simply giving me a vivid realization of my own philosophy, though
there have been times when the experience has suggested
modifications of my previousthinking. <a name="back1"></a><a
href="#footnote1">(1)</a> But just as the sensation of
subject-object polarity is confirmed by the transactional
psychology of Dewey and Bentley, so the sensation of events
happening &quot;of themselves&quot; is just how one would expect
to perceive a world consisting entirely of process. Now the
language of science is increasingly a language of process---a
description of events, relations, operations, and forms rather
than of things and substances. The world so described is a world
of actions rather than agents, verbs rather than nouns, going
against the common-sense idea that an action is the behavior of
some thing, some solid entity of &quot;stuff.&quot; But the
commonsense idea that action is always the function of an agent
is so deeply rooted, so bound up with our sense of order and
security, that seeing the world to be otherwise can be seriously
disturbing. Without agents, actions do not seem to come from
anywhere, to have any dependable origin, and at first sight this
spontaneity can be alarming. In one experiment it seemed that
whenever I tried to put my (metaphorical) foot upon some solid
ground, the ground collapsed into empty space. I could find no
substantial basis from which to act: my will was a whim, and my
past, as a causal conditioning force, had simply vanished. There
was only the present conformation of events, happening. For a
while I felt lost in a void, frightened, baseless, insecure
through and through Yet soon I became accustomed to the feeling,
strange as it was. There was simply a pattern of action, of
process, and this was at one and the same time the universe and
myself with nothing outside it either to trust or mistrust. And
there seemed to be no meaning in the idea of its trusting or
mistrusting itself, just as there is no possibility of a finger's
touching its own tip. </p>

<p> Upon reflection, there seems to be nothing unreasonable in
seeing the world in this way. The agent behind every action is
itself action. If a mat can be called matting, a cat can be
called catting. We do not actually need to ask who or what
&quot;cats,&quot; just as we do not need to ask what is the basic
stuff or substance out of which the world is formed---for there
is no way of describing this substance except in terms of form,
of structure, order, and operation. The world is not <i>formed</i>
as if it were inert clay responding to the touch of a potter's
hand; the world <i>is</i> form, or better, formation, for upon
examination every substance turns out to be closely knit pattern.
The fixed notion that every pattern or form must be made of some
basic material which is in itself formless is based on a
superficial analogy between natural formation and manufacture, as
if the stars and rocks had been made out of something as a
carpenter makes tables out of wood. Thus what we call the agent
behind the action is simply the prior or relatively more constant
state of the same action: when a man runs we have a
&quot;manning-running&quot; over and above a simple
&quot;manning.&quot; Furthermore, it is only a somewhat clumsy
convenience to say that present events are moved or caused by
past events, for we are actually talking about earlier and later
stages of the same event. We can establish regularities of rhythm
and pattern in the course of an event, and so predict its future
configurations, but its past states do not &quot;push&quot; its
present and future states as if they were a row of dominoes stood
on end so that knocking over the first collapses all the others
in series. The fallen dominoes lie where they fall, but past
events vanish into the present, which is just another way of
saying that the world is a self-moving pattern which, when its
successive states are remembered, can be shown to have a certain
order. Its motion, its energy, issues from itself now, not from
the past, which simply falls behind it in memory like the wake
from a ship. </p>

<p> When we ask the &quot;why&quot; of this moving pattern, we
usually try to answer the question in terms of its original, past
impulse or of its future goal. I had realized for a long time
that if there is in any sense a reason for the world's existence
it must be sought in the present, as the reason for the wake must
be sought in the engine of the moving ship. I have already
mentioned that LSD makes me peculiarly aware of the musical or
dance-like character of the world, bringing my attention to rest
upon its present flowing and seeing this as its ultimate point.
Yet I have also been able to see that this point has depths, that
the present wells up from within itself with an energy which is
something much richer than simple exuberance. </p>

<p> One of these experiments was conducted late at night. Some
five or six hours from its start the doctor had to go home, and I
was left alone in the garden. For me, this stage of the
experiment is always the most rewarding in terms of insight,
after some of its more unusual and bizarre sensory effects have
worn off. The garden was a lawn surrounded by shrubs and high
trees---Pine and eucalyptus---and floodlit from the house which
enclosed it on one side. As I stood on the lawn I noticed that
the rough patches where the grass was thin or mottled with weeds
no longer seemed to be blemishes. Scattered at random as they
were, they appeared to constitute an ordered design, giving the
whole area the texture of velvet damask, the rough patches being
the parts where the pile of the velvet is cut. In sheer delight I
began to dance on this enchanted carpet, and through the thin
soles of my moccasins I could feel the ground becoming alive
under my feet, connecting me with the earth and the trees and the
sky in such a way that I seemed to become one body with my whole
surroundings. </p>

<p> Looking up, I saw that the stars were colored with the same
reds, greens, and blues that one sees in iridescent glass, and
passing across them was the single light of a jet plane taking
forever to streak over the sky. At the same time, the trees,
shrubs, and flowers seemed to be living jewelry, inwardly
luminous like intricate structures of jade, alabaster, or coral,
and yet breathing and flowing with the same life that was in me.
Every plant became a kind of musical utterance, a play of
variations on a theme repeated from the main branches, through
the stalks and twigs, to the leaves, the veins in the leaves, and
to the fine capillary network between the veins. Each new
bursting of growth from a center repeated or amplified the basic
design with increasing complexity and delight, finally exulting
in a flower. </p>

<p> From my description it will seem that the garden acquired an
atmosphere that was distinctly exotic, like the gardens of
precious stones in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, or like scenes in a
Persian miniature. This struck me at the time, and I began to
wonder just why it is that the glowingly articulated landscapes
of those miniatures seem exotic, as do also many Chinese and
Japanese paintings. Were the artists recording what they, too,
had seen under the influence of drugs? I knew enough of the lives
and techniques of Far Eastern painters to doubt this. I asked,
too, whether what I was seeing was &quot;drugged.&quot; In other
words, was the effect of the LSD in my nervous system the
addition to my senses of some chemical screen which distorted all
that I saw to preternatural loveliness? Or was its effect rather
to remove certain habitual and normal inhibitions of the mind and
senses, enabling us to see things as they would appear to us if
we were not so chronically repressed? Little is known of the
exact neurological effects of LSD, but what is known suggests the
latter possibility. If this be so, it is possible that the art
forms of other cultures appear exotic---that is, unfamiliarly
enchanting---because we are seeing the world through the eyes of
artists whose repressions are not the same as ours. The blocks in
their view of the world may not coincide with ours, so that in
their representations of life we see areas that we normally
ignore. I am inclined to some such solution because there have
been times when I have seen the world in this magical aspect
without benefit of LSD, and they were times when I was profoundly
relaxed within, my senses unguardedly open to their surroundings.
</p>

<p> Feeling, then, not that I was drugged but that I was in an
unusual degree open to reality, I tried to discern the meaning,
the inner character of the dancing pattern which constituted both
myself and the garden, and the whole dome of the night with its
colored stars. All at once it became obvious that the whole thing
was love-play, where love means everything that the word can
mean, a spectrum ranging from the red of erotic delight, through
the green of human endearment, to the violet of divine charity,
from Freud's libido to Dante's &quot;love that moves the sun and
other stars.&quot; All were so many colors issuing from a single
white light, and, what was more, this single source was not just
love as we ordinarily understand it: it was also intelligence,
not only Eros and Agape but also Logos. I could see that the
intricate organization both of the plants and of my own nervous
system, like symphonies of branching complexity, were not just
manifestations of intelligence---as if things like intelligence
and love were in themselves substances or formless forces. It was
rather that the pattern itself is intelligence and is love, and
this somehow in spite of all its outwardly stupid and cruel
distortions. </p>

<p> There is probably no way of finding objective verification
for insights such as this. The world is love to him who treats it
as such, even when it torments and destroys him, and in states of
consciousness where there is no basic separation between the ego
and the world suffering cannot be felt as malice inflicted upon
oneself by another. By the same logic it might seem that with out
the separation of self and other there can be no love. This might
be true if individuality and universality were formal opposites,
mutually exclusive of one another, if, that is, the
inseparability of self and other meant that all individual
differentiations were simply unreal. But in the unitary, or
nondualistic, view of the world I have been describing this is
not so. Individual differences express the unity, as branches,
leaves, and flowers from the same plant, and the love between the
members is the realization of their basic interdependence. </p>

<p> I have not yet been able to use LSD in circumstances of great
physical or moral pain, and therefore my explorations of the
problem of evil under its influence may appear to be shallow.
Only once in these experiments have I felt acute fear, but I know
of several cases in which LSD has touched off psychic states of
the most alarming and unpleasant kind. More than once I have
invited such states under LSD by looking at images ordinarily
suggestive of &quot;the creeps&quot;---the mandibles of spiders,
and the barbs and spines of dangerous fish and insects. Yet they
evoked only a sense of beauty and exuberance, for our normal
projection of malice into these creatures was entirely withdrawn,
so that their organs of destruction became no more evil than the
teeth of a beautiful woman. On another occasion I looked for a
long time at a colored reproduction of Van Eyck's <i>Last
Judgment</i>, which is surely one of the most horrendous products
of human imagination. The scene of hell is dominated by the
figure of Death, a skeleton beneath whose batlike wings lies a
writhing mass of screaming bodies gnawed by snakes which
penetrate them like maggots in fruit. One of the curious effects
of LSD is to impart an illusion of movement in still images, so
that here the picture came to life and the whole entanglement of
limbs and serpents began to squirm before my eyes. <a
name="back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">(2)</a> </p>

<p> Ordinarily such a sight should have been hideous, but now I
watched it with intense and puzzled interest until the thought
came to me, <i>&quot;Demon est deus inversus</i>---the Devil is
God inverted---so let's turn the picture upside down.&quot; I did
so, and thereupon burst into laughter for it became apparent at
once that the scene was an empty drama, a sort of spiritual
scarecrow, designed to guard some mystery from profanation by the
ignorant. The agonized expressions of the damned seemed quite
evidently &quot;put on,&quot; and as for the death's-head, the
great skull in the center of the painting, it became just what a
skull is---an empty shell---and why the horror when there is
nothing in it? </p>

<p> I was, of course, seeing ecclesiastical hells for what they
are. On the one hand, they are the pretension that social
authority is ultimately inescapable since there are post-mortem
police who will catch every criminal. On the other hand, they are
&quot;no trespassing&quot; signs to discourage the insincere and
the immature from attaining insights which they might abuse. A
baby is put in a play pen to keep it from getting at the matches
or falling downstairs, and though the intention of the pen is to
keep the baby closed in, parents are naturally proud when the
child grows strong enough to climb out. Likewise, a man can
perform actions which are truly moral only when he is no longer
motivated by the fear of hell, that is, when he grows into union
with the Good that is beyond good and evil, which, in other
words, does not act from the love of rewards or the fear of
punishments. This is precisely the nature of the world when it is
considered as self-moving action, giving out a past instead of
being motivated by a past. </p>

<p> Beyond this, the perception of the empty threat of the
death's-head was certainly a recognition of the fact that the
fear of death, as distinct from the fear of dying, is one of the
most baseless mirages that trouble us. Because it is completely
impossible to imagine one's own personal absence, we fill the
void in our minds with images of being buried alive in perpetual
darkness. If death is the simple termination of a stream of
consciousness, it is certainly nothing to fear. At the same time,
I realize that there is some apparent evidence for survival of
death in a few extraordinarily unexplainable mediumistic
communications and remembrances of past lives. These I attribute,
vaguely enough, to subtler networks of communication and
interrelationship in the pattern of life than we ordinarily
perceive. For if forms repeat themselves, if the structure of
branching trees is reverberated in the design of watercourses in
the desert, it would not be so strange if a pattern so intricate
as the human nervous system were to repeat configurations that
arise in consciousness as veritable memories of the most distant
times. My own feeling, and of course it is nothing more than an
opinion, is that we transcend death, not as individual
memory-systems, but only in so far as our true identity is the
total process of the world as distinct from the apparently
separate organism. </p>

<p> As I have said, this sense of being the whole process is
frequently experienced with LSD, and, for me, it has often arisen
out of a strong feeling of the mutuality of opposites. Line and
plane, concept and percept, solid and space, figure and ground,
subject and object appear to be so completely correlative as to
be convertible into each other. At one moment it seems that there
are, for example, no lines in nature: there are only the
boundaries of planes, boundaries which are, after all, the planes
themselves. But at the next moment, looking carefully into the
texture of these planes, one discovers them to be nothing but a
dense network of patterned lines. Looking at the form of a tree
against the sky, I have felt at one moment that its outline
&quot;belongs&quot; to the tree, exploding into space. But the
next moment I feel that the same form is the &quot;inline&quot;
of the sky, of space imploding the tree. Every pull is felt as a
push, and every push as a pull, as in rotating the rim of a wheel
with one's hand. Is one pushing or pulling? </p>

<p> The sense that forms are also properties of the space in
which they expand is not in the least fantastic when one
considers the nature of magnetic fields, or, say, the dynamics of
swirling ink dropped into water. The concepts of verbal thought
are so clumsy that we tend to think only of one aspect of a
relationship at a time. We alternate between seeing a given form
as a property of the figure and as a property of the ground, as
in the Gestalt image of two profiles in black silhouette, about
to kiss. The white space between them appears as a chalice, but
it is intensely difficult to see the kissing faces and the
chalice simultaneously. Yet with LSD one appears to be able to
feel this simultaneity quite vividly, and thus to become aware of
the mutuality of one's own form and action and that of the
surrounding world. The two seem to shape and determine each other
at the same moment, explosion and implosion concurring in perfect
harmony, so giving rise to the feeling that one is actual self is
both. This inner identity is felt with every level of the
environment---the physical world of stars and space, rocks and
plants, the social world of human beings, and the ideational
world of art and literature, music and conversation. All are
grounds or fields operating in the most intimate mutuality with
one's own existence and behavior so that the &quot;origin&quot;
of action lies in both at once, fusing them into a single act. It
is certainly for this reason that LSD taken in common with a
small group can be a profoundly eucharistic experience, drawing
the members together into an extremely warm and intimate bond of
friendship. </p>

<p> All in all, I have felt that my experiments with this
astonishing chemical have been most worth while, creative,
stimulating, and, above all, an intimation that &quot;there is
more in heaven and earth than is dreamed of in your
philosophy.&quot; Only once have I felt terror, the sense of
being close to madness, and even here the insight gained was well
worth the pain. Yet this was enough to convince me that
indiscriminate use of this alchemy might be exceedingly
dangerous, and to make me ask who, in our society, is competent
to control its use. Obviously, this applies even more to such
other powers of science as atomic energy, but once something is
known there is really no way of locking it up. At the present
time, 1960, LSD is in the control of pharmacologists and a few
research groups of psychiatrists, and though there are
unscrupulous and frankly psychotic psychiatrists, this seems to
me a far more reliable form of control than that exercised by the
police and the Bureau of Narcotics---which is not control at all,
but ineffective repression, handing over actual control to the
forces of organized crime. </p>

<p> On the whole, we feel justified in using dangerous powers
when we can establish that there is a relatively low probability
of disaster. Life organized so as to be completely foolproof and
secure is simply not worth living, since it requires the final
abolition of freedom. It is on this perfectly rational principle
of gambling that we justify the use of travel by air and
automobile, electric appliances in the home, and all the other
dangerous instruments of civilization. Thus far, the record of
catastrophes from the use of LSD is extremely low, and there is
no evidence at all that it is either habit-forming or physically
deleterious. It is, of course, possible to become psychically
dependent on stimuli which do not establish any craving that can
be identified in physiological terms. Personally, I am no example
of phenomenal will power, but I find that I have no inclination
to use LSD in the same way as tobacco or wines and liquors. On
the contrary, the experience is always so fruitful that I feel I
must digest it for some months before entering into it again.
Furthermore, I find that I am quite instinctively disinclined to
use it without the same sense of readiness and dedication with
which one approaches a sacrament, and also that the experience is
worth while to the precise degree that I keep my critical and
intellectual faculties alert. </p>

<p> It is generally felt that there is a radical incompatibility
between intuition and intellect, poetry and logic, spirituality
and rationality, To me, the most impressive thing about LSD
experiences is that these formally opposed realms seem instead to
complement and fructify one another, suggesting, therefore, a
mode of life in which man is no longer an embodied paradox of
angel and animal, of reason fighting instinct, but a marvelous
coincidence in whom Eros and Logos are one.</p>

<hr>

<p> <a name="footnote1"></a>(1) I have often made the point, as
in The Way of Zen, that the &quot;real&quot; world is concrete
rather than abstract, and thus that the conceptual patterns of
order, categorization, and logic which the human mind projects
upon nature are in some way less real. But upon several occasions
LSD has suggested a fundamental identity of percept and concept,
concrete and abstract. After all, our brains and the patterns in
them are themselves members of the concrete, physical universe,
and thus our abstractions are as much forms of nature as the
structure of crystals or the organization of ferns. <a
href="#back1">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="footnote2"></a>(2) Later, with the aid of a sea
urchin's shell I was able to find out something of the reasons
for this effect. All the small purple protuberances on the shell
seemed to be wiggling, not only to sight but also to touch
Watching this phenomenon closely, I realized that as my eyes
moved across the shell they seemed to change the intensity of
coloring, amounting to an increase or decrease in the depth of
shadow. This did not happen when the eyes were held still. Now
motion, or apparent motion, of the shadow will often seem to be
motion of the object casting it, in this case the protrusions on
the shell. In the Van Eyck painting there was likewise an
alteration, a lightening or darkening, of actual shadows which
the artist had painted, and thus the same illusion of movement. <a

<h1>The Psychedelics and Religion </h1>

<p> BY WALTER HOUSTON CLARK </p>

<p> <img src="http://cliffcompaq/druglibrary/images/blueline.gif">
</p>

<h4>Introduction </h4>

<p> In 1968 Ralph Metzner wrote of Walter Houston Clark, (in <i>The
Ecstatic Adventure</i>) </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>THERE ARE NOT too many men in their sixties, professional
    academics at that, who have preserved sufficient openness to
    experience and receptivity to new ideas to accept the idea of
    personal experimentation with psychedelic drugs. Old age is
    too often synonymous with rigidity rather than wisdom. Not so
    with Walter Houston Clark, Professor of Psychology of
    Religion at Andover Newton Theological School in Newton,
    Massachusetts, former dean and professor at the Hartford
    School of Religious Education, author of The Oxford Group
    (1951) and The Psychology of Religion (1958), and founder of
    the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> In an article on &quot;Mysticism as a Basic Concept in
Defining the Religious Self,&quot; Professor Clark wrote that </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The [psychedelic] drugs are simply an auxiliary which,
    used carefully within a religious structure, may assist in
    mediating an experience which, aside from the presence of the
    drug, cannot be distinguished psychologically from mysticism.
    Studies have indicated that, when the experience is
    interpreted transcendentally or religiously, chances are
    improved for the rehabilitation of hopeless alcoholics and
    hardened criminals. Even though observations like these mean
    that the psychologist can learn a little more of the
    religious life, in no sense does it ultimately become any
    less of a mystery. Though man may sow and till, winds may
    blow and the rains fall, nevertheless it is still God that
    gives the increase. </p>

<p> Today, amid the confusion of grave problems caused not so
much by decades of &quot;drug abuse&quot; as by decades of
increasingly futile attempts to legislate away the use of
prohibited substances by pious decree, it is all too easily
forgotten that the rediscovery of the psychedelic drugs mid-way
through the present century was as promising a find as mankind
has seen. A significant, if minority group of our best
scientists, doctors, philosophers, writers, artists, and
intellectuals of every description began explorations with the
psychedelics, a search that was really only the continuation of
an age-old quest involving the great majority of peoples and
tribes of the ancient world. Psychedelic drugs have, in fact,
been used as religious and curing aids since the very beginning
of human existence, and only in the 1950's was any significant
&quot;scientific&quot; research begun using them. </p>

<p> This research planted the seeds of a revolution of a kind
that science purportedly thrives upon, but the sprouting of the
seeds was aborted early on by scandal. In the following article
we read about some research that was later to be ignored not so
much because it was scandalous, but because it challenged some of
the underlying paradigms of the entire scientific enterprise.
Some of the findings of psychedelic research seemed to herald a
merging of the &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;religious&quot;
or &quot;mystical&quot; viewpoints, despite very powerful
resistance by both sides to opposing views. The scientific
viewpoint had for a long time generally disdained religion as
primitive superstition, and religious thinkers of every
denomination had tended to view the destructive uses to which
science had been put as evidence of its ultimate inability to
advance the human condition. Yet some scholars such as Professor
Clark saw the rediscovery of psychedelics as the key to the
blossoming of a new view. In the words of Alan Watts, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For a long time we have been accustomed to the
    compartmentalization of religion and science as if they were
    two quite different and basically unrelated ways of seeing
    the world. I do not believe that this state of doublethink
    can last. It must eventually be replaced by a view of the
    world which is neither religious nor scientific but simply
    our view of the world. More exactly, it must become a view of
    the world in which the reports of science and religion are as
    concordant as those of the eyes and the ears. (Preface to <i>The
    Joyous Cosmology,</i> 1962). </p>
</blockquote>

<p> In retrospect, it will be seen by historians of the 21st
century that the scandal of the 1960's was not Dr. Timothy Leary
leading a generation down the road to a drugged oblivion, (for
that generation is today doing quite well!) but rather that such
Puritanical views of mere over-enthusiasm for a new discovery led
a generation of scientists and world leaders to throw away what
in any other epoch would have been a Holy Grail, a discovery of
such fundamental importance that the great discoveries that had
made modern technological civilization possible would seem almost
trivial by comparison. The situation continues today unabated,
despite the continued availability of the wisdom of Professor
Clark and the many other pioneers of psychedelic discovery. </p>

<h3>The Psychedelics and Religion </h3>

<p> WALTER HOUSTON CLARK </p>

<p> from: <i>PSYCHEDELICS, </i>edited by Bernard Aaronson and
Humphrey Osmond, Doubleday &amp; Company, 1970. Copyright 1970
Aaronson &amp; Osmond. </p>

<p> The recent discovery of the religious properties of Lysergic
Acid Diethylamide-25 is not such a wholly new phenomenon as some
people seem to believe. There is some evidence to suggest that
the secret potion that was part of the ordeal of initiation into
the Eleusinian mysteries in ancient Greece contained a
psychedelic drug. The somewhat mysterious drug called soma, used
in India, sometimes for religious purposes, was psychedelic,
while the Mexican mushroom whose active principle is psilocybin
has been used by the Aztecs for centuries in their sacraments.
Their word for it, significantly, meant &quot;God's flesh.&quot; </p>

<p> The peyote button, the top of a certain spineless cactus
plant, has been and is now used by some members of nearly all the
American Indian tribes in cultic ceremonies. The peyote religion
goes back nearly a century in historical records and certainly is
even more ancient. At present it is represented by the Native
American Church, a loose collection of some two hundred thousand
members, according to its claim. Peyote among the Indians has had
a history of controversy not unlike LSD among whites. However,
despite years of repressive laws and legal harassment, there has
been little or no hard evidence of claims made as to its
harmfulness, and some indication that it has done good. More
importantly, laws made to repress its use have been declared
unconstitutional in several states on the ground that they have
violated constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion.(1) </p>

<p> Perhaps the most distinguished and eloquent advocate of the
view that certain chemicals may promote religious states of mind
was William James, who some seventy years ago inhaled the
psychedelic of his day, nitrous oxide. He referred to this
self-experiment, in <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>,
in his chapter on mysticism, where he wrote the often quoted
words: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . our normal waking consciousness, rational
    consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of
    consciousness, whilst all about it parted by the filmiest of
    screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely
    different.... No account of the universe in its totality can
    be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness
    quite disregarded.(2) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> But &quot;religion&quot; is an elusive term, and whether or
not we can regard states associated with the psychedelics as
religious depends on how we define it. Doubtless there are those
who would regard any state initiated by the ingestion of a
chemical as <i>by definition</i> non-religious. For such people,
the reading of this chapter will be an idle exercise. Tillich
defines religion as &quot;ultimate concern,&quot; while both
William James and W. R. Inge speak of the roots of religion as
ultimately mystical. Rudolf Otto, in <i>The Idea of the Holy</i>
(1958), speaks of the non-rational elements of the religious life
in terms of horror, dread, amazement, and fascination as the <i>mysterium
tremendum</i>, &quot;the mystery that makes one tremble.&quot;
Certainly, as I will point out in more detail later, the subject
who has consumed the forbidden fruit of the psychedelics will
often testify that he has been opened to his own &quot;ultimate
concern&quot; in life and may even speak in terms reminiscent of
the medieval mystics. Furthermore, one of the chief objections of
the opponents of the psychedelics is that for many the experience
may be &quot;dread-full,&quot; as cogent an illustration of
Otto's thesis as one could well expect to find. </p>

<p> Long before I took very seriously the claims that eaters of
psychedelic chemicals made as to their religious experiences, I
defined religion as &quot;the inner experience of an individual
when he senses a Beyond, especially as evidenced by the effect of
this experience on his behavior when he actively attempts to
harmonize his behavior with the Beyond.&quot;(3) Consequently, it
would be to this standard that I would refer experiences
triggered by the psychedelic drugs, in order to determine whether
they should be called religious or not. </p>

<p> From the definition, it will be clear that the core of
religious experience is subjective therefore never to be fully
shared with another person. Consequently we are forced to rely to
a large degree on the words of the religious person for any
determination of religion. This necessity disturbs the modern
psychologist whose too-narrow conception of his discipline as a
science bars him from probing the nature of the religious
consciousness despite its cogency as a source of profound
personality change. As he observes the conventional churchgoer
and hears him glibly using such terms as &quot;conviction of sin
&quot;rebirth&quot; &quot;redemption&quot; and
&quot;salvation,&quot; the psychologist may too hastily conclude
that such terms are mere pious language that brings a certain
sentimental comfort to the worshiper but hardly represents any
marked change in his relations with his fellow men. The
psychologist has forgotten, if he ever knew, that such terms are
the echoes of experiences that, perhaps many years ago but also
today, have transformed the lives of prince and beggars enabling
them to unify their lives and attain heights that could have been
possible in no other way. It is this effectiveness, <i>along with</i>
the subjective reports by subjects of encounters filled with
mystery and awe, for which we must be on the lookout as we try to
appraise the religious significance and value of these strange
chemicals. </p>

<p> But before we start our survey I must say something about the
place of the non-rational in the religious life. Notice that I
call it <i>non-rational</i>, not <i>irrational</i>. The religious
life involves at least three basic factors: First is the life of
speculation and thought, the expression of the rational function
of the human mind. The second is the active expression of
religious principles, the concern for others and the observance
of ethics and other social demands that grow out of one's
religious commitment. Religion shares these two functions with
other interests and duties of humankind. But the third function
is unique, and without it no other function or activity can be
called religious in any but a very pale and secondary sense. This
third function is the experience of the sacred, the encounter
with the holy, which not so much logically, but intuitively, or
non-rationally, the subject recognizes as that which links him
with the seers and the saints of today and of yesterday. A
non-drug example will be found in Arthur Koestler's
autobiographical <i>The Invisible Writing</i> (1955), in the
chapter entitled &quot;The Hours by the Window.&quot; It is this
non-rational perception of the holy that so moves the individual
and interpenetrates both his thinking and his activity, infusing
them with tremendous energy and giving to his whole life that
stamp we call religious. We must ask whether in any sense the
psychedelic substances arouse this factor, to determine whether
we can characterize the result as religion. </p>

<p> If we can accept the direction of the argument thus far, that
the essential core of religion may be found in the mystical
consciousness and the direct experience of the holy, I can show
considerable evidence that it is this aspect of the nonrational
consciousness that the psychedelic drugs release. I consider my
first example sufficiently persuasive to make the point. </p>

<p> Dr. Walter N. Pahnke of Spring Grove Hospital, Baltimore, in
a doctorate study at Harvard, used twenty theological students in
a double-blind study of the effects of psilocybin. All twenty
were given similar preparations; half were given the drug and
half placebos; then all attended the same two-and-one-half-hour
Good Friday service. The experimental group reported overwhelming
evidence of mystical experiences, while the control group
reported next to none.(4) The reports included intuitions and
encounters with ultimate reality, the holy, and God; in other
words the &quot;Beyond&quot; of my definition. Furthermore, a
six-month follow-up showed much evidence that the subjects felt
they had experienced an enlivening of their religious lives,
resulting in an increased involvement with the problems of living
and the service of others. </p>

<p> The previous sentence supports that aspect of my definition
that emphasizes the active functions of religion, the effect of
the experience of the Beyond on the individual when he
&quot;actively attempts to harmonize his life with the
Beyond.&quot; Western prejudices in religion favor the pragmatic
test, so claims of encounter with God or ultimate reality are
always more impressive when they can be supported by concrete
evidence of benefit like this. Further cogent evidence is
supplied us in studies of alcoholics treated with LSD by Osmond
and Hoffer in the early 1950S in Saskatchewan. According to Dr.
Hoffer's report, of sixty difficult cases, half were no longer
drinking five years later, while there was a very high
correspondence between success and the report of the subject that
his experience had been transcendental in William James's sense
of the term.(5) </p>

<p> Still more evidence pointing in the same general direction
comes from work done by Dr. Timothy Leary when he was at Harvard.
He received permission from the State Commission of Correction to
give psilocybin to thirty-five inmates at Concord State
Reformatory. Since Dr. Leary had reported that the convicts were
having religious experiences and the work was controversial, I
persuaded him to introduce me to some of them so that I could
investigate at first hand. While unable to follow up all the
subjects, I talked with those who were still in prison---by and
large those who had committed the more serious crimes and so were
serving long terms. I found that it was indeed true that these
men referred to their experiences as religious in varying ways.
One reported a vision in which he had participated with Christ in
His Crucifixion. Shortly after this, he had looked out the
window. &quot;Suddenly all my life came before my eyes,&quot;
said this man, an armed robber of nearly forty who had spent most
of his adult life behind bars, &quot;and I said to myself, What a
wasted Since that time these men have formed, within the walls,
an AA-type organization called the Self-Development Group, to
rehabilitate themselves and others. I could not deny that there
were profound religious forces at work among these men as the
result of the drug treatment (Leary and Clark, 1963). </p>

<p> In their book <i>The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience</i>
Masters and Houston present a wealth of cases illustrating
psychedelic experiences of various kinds. Though nearly all their
206 subjects reported religious imagery of some kind, only a few
demonstrated mystical experience of what the authors consider a
transforming and integrating kind at the deepest level; but they
believe that the drugs do facilitate the latter, making their
belief clear chiefly through a remarkable illustrative case in
their final chapter. The subject, a successful psychologist in
his late thirties, had been irresistibly attracted to what
society regards as &quot;evil&quot; from his earliest youth. He
believed in nothing, was a militant atheist, was sexually
promiscuous, and to his students &quot;preached a gospel of total
debauchery.&quot; The appearance of neurotic symptoms had led him
into a process of self-analysis and therapy, which had been only
partly successful. But only three sessions with LSD led this
person, through an intricate series of shattering symbolic
experiences, to an almost total transformation of self. A year
afterward, this transformation was seen by the subject as an
encounter with God that had been both religious and lasting. This
fact was attested to by those who knew him. </p>

<p> The foregoing is just a sampling of many studies that report
religious elements following the ingestion of psychedelic drugs.
When the environment suggests religion, a higher proportion, up
to 85-90 per cent, of the experiences are perceived as religious
by the subjects. Those who resist the religious interpretation
are much less likely to experience it, but even some of these,
much to their surprise, may &quot;experience God.&quot; </p>

<p> The following case is an illustration: As part of an
experiment at a mental hospital, I had occasion to guide a young
college graduate I will call Duncan Cohen. Brought up as a Jew,
he had become a strong atheist and married outside his faith. The
investigation required a number of sessions, and the study of its
religious aspects was only an incidental aspect of the
experiment. The setting aimed to be supportive, the surroundings
softened with flowers and music, and the subjects were encouraged
to bring with them into their private hospital rooms anything of
significance to them, including their choice of music if desired.
Duncan was given sixteen daily doses of 180 micrograms of LSD. He
was initially irritated by me as a person who taught in a
theological school; and, though he came to trust me more and more
as the sessions continued, he steadfastly resisted any religious
interpretation of the sessions, which, even from the first, he
regarded primarily as experiences of rebirth. The early sessions
involved a climactic series of symbolic encounters with various
members of his family, followed by a dramatic enactment of his
own death, in which he acted both as &quot;corpse&quot; and
&quot;funeral director,&quot; while I was asked to pray as the
&quot;officiating rabbi.&quot; Still the essentially religious
nature of much of these proceedings was either denied or only
dimly sensed. I tried to avoid pressing any religious
interpretation on him, though my interests doubtless acted
suggestively on him. </p>

<p> The climax came after the fifteenth ingestion. About four
hours after taking the drug on that day, he had been sitting on
the lawn outside the hospital watching two grasshoppers
maneuvering in what he interpreted as a kind of cosmic dance.
Suddenly, he felt at one with them and with the cosmos besides. I
was aware of it only after he caught sight of me and came running
over to me in great excitement calling, &quot;Dr. Clark, I have
had a mystical experience; I have met God!&quot; </p>

<p> A nine-month follow-up indicated that Duncan regards the
total experience as a most significant one. He has continued to
grow and mature, as he sees it. There have been some difficult
times. &quot;What I regarded as the end of the experience when I
left the hospital,&quot; he told me, &quot;was simply the
beginning of an experience of maturing which is still
continuing.&quot; He reports more tolerance and open-mindedness,
and he recoils when he thinks of what he now regards as his
former narrow-mindedness. He has reflected with increased insight
on the role of religion in history, history being a favorite
subject. I do not know that he is any more hospitable to
institutionalized religion, though now he is willing to accept a
view of life that for him is more, rather than less, religious
than that of the conventional churchgoer. At any rate,
psychedelic religious cults, like the League for Spiritual
Discovery, have an appeal for him that they did not have before.
Religion in a profound sense, in human nature and in history, has
more meaning to him. </p>

<p> In the middle 1950s Aldous Huxley published his influential <i>The
Doors of Perception</i>, describing an experience with mescaline
and advocating it as a means of vitalizing the religious life,
with particular emphasis on its mystical aspects. R. C. Zaehner,
in his <i>Mysticism: Sacred and Profane</i> (1957), takes issue
with Huxley and points out that while mescaline may be able to
release pantheistic or monistic types of religion, including
those closely associated with psychosis, it cannot be said to
stimulate a theistic religious experience. He does not see its
use justified by Christian doctrine. Zaehner's reasoning is based
partly on a self-experiment with mescaline, and so he cannot be
classified with those many critics of the psychedelics anxious to
make people's flesh creep without having any firsthand knowledge
of what they are talking about. But, commendable though Professor
Zaehner's effort may have been, he falls into a familiar fallacy
common to all users and non-users of the psychedelics, including
Huxley, namely, that of generalizing too widely on the basis of
his own personal experience and point of view. </p>

<p> It is true that the religious experience of many of the drug
users seems to them to fit more readily into pantheistic and
Eastern religious patterns. But the experience itself is
essentially non-rational and indescribable. In order that it may
be described, one is forced to use concepts of one type or
another, none of which seem to do justice to the experience.
Consequently these are of great variety, and while some will
agree with the Zaehner theological typology, others have no more
trouble seeing their experiences as essentially Christian than
did St. Teresa when she described one of her mystical visions as
revealing to her the secrets of the Trinity. I have known those
whose psychedelic experiences have returned them from atheism to
the Christian tradition in which they had been brought up, and I
have also known those who preferred Eastern concepts. </p>

<p> W. T. Stace, in <i>Mysticisrn and Philosophy</i> (1960),
distinguishes between the mystical experience itself, which he
finds to be universal in its characteristics, and the
interpretation of that experience, which differs from faith to
faith and from century to century. Thus the Christian will refer
his experience to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, while the
Buddhist will explain an identical psychological experience in
terms of Nirvana. Stace further aids us in clarifying the nature
of a psychedelic experience in his &quot;principle of causal
indifference.&quot; This states that what makes an experience
mystical is not what touches it off, whether drug or Christian
sacrament, but its experiential characteristics. It may then be
conceptualized in any way deemed suitable by the experiencer. I
may add that, just as a Christian sacrament may or may not
stimulate a mystical experience in any given worshiper, the same
thing may be said of mescaline or LSD. Stace gives us an example
of mystical experience meeting his specifications triggered by
mescaline.(6) </p>

<p> In another part of his book, he discusses the experience of
pantheism, which so often has gotten the mystic into trouble.
Calling the experience &quot;transsubjective,&quot; he points out
its paradoxical character, in which the mystic may feel himself
both merged with the Godhead and infinitely the creature of God
at the same time. Consequently, we can understand how, in some
sense, mysticism can be felt to be compatible with theism by one
mystic and with atheistic Buddhism by another. The same argument
will help to explain the variety of theological and philosophical
concepts used to interpret the psychedelic experience. </p>

<p> There would be no greater mistake than to suppose, since the
psychedelics are frequently accompanied by religious experience,
that God, when He created these chemicals, baptized them and
segregated them for religious purposes. Indeed, had this been His
purpose, it would seem that He has not kept up with His
theological and medical reading, for He might have foreseen the
difficulties He was preparing for their users. As I have already
pointed out, there is no guarantee that a given person will have
what satisfies him as a religious experience. However, certain
conditions will favor this religious result, and I will indicate
briefly a few of the most important. </p>

<p> First of all, there is the subject himself---his nature, and
the desire he may have for the religious experience. A person
already religiously sensitive is more apt to have a religious
experience than one who is not, and one who deliberately prepares
himself is more apt to be rewarded than one who is indifferent or
unaware of the possibility. <i>Vide</i> the case of Duncan Cohen,
who had ingested LSD fourteen times without a religious outcome;
the only experimental subject in the Good Friday experiment who
failed to report a mystical experience was one who did not
believe it possible and deliberately set out to demonstrate this
belief, partly by omitting the religious preparation engaged in
by the other subjects. </p>

<p> The setting is another factor that favors or discourages
religion. If the drug is taken in a church or the subject is
surrounded by religious symbolism, he is more apt to obtain a
religious result. Appropriate readings at strategic points during
the period when the drug is active, say from the Bible or the
Tibetan Book of the Dead, particularly when accompanied by
religious music, are other favoring circumstances. If the guide
is a deeply religious person and anxious to promote a religious
outcome, this will be another plus factor. Subjects have reported
feeling this with respect to Dr. Leary, and doubtless this helps
to explain the high incidence of religious experiences reported
in his experiments. It is obvious that all these factors depend
for their influence on the suggestibility of the subject.
However, it would be a mistake to think that suggestibility will
explain it all, since, once the experience gets started, the
unconscious of the individual subject seems to take over the
direction of matters in large measure. But the initial
suggestibility of the subject and the manner in which it is
exploited, by himself or by others, will enhance the
suggestibility that most investigators feel to be one of the
salient characteristics of the psychedelic state. </p>

<p> Critics, to prove their point that psychedelic experiences
are not truly religious, often cite the fact that beneficial
results do not always last. But in this respect they are no
different from other types of religious experience. Every
evangelist is well acquainted with backsliders. If
personality-changes brought about through psychedelic experience
are to be made permanent, they must be followed up. </p>

<p> The issues that the psychedelics pose seem to most people to
be in the realm of therapy, health, and the law. They may be more
importantly religious. One of the functions of religion---perhaps
its chief function---is that of supplying life with meaning. The
most luminous source of this meaning, through the ages, has been
the religious experience of religiously gifted leaders, the
dreamers of dreams and the seers of visions, prophets, converts,
evangelists, seers, martyrs, and mystics. According to their
enlightenment, these men and women have stood before the Lord,
some in joy, some in vision, some in transport, and some in fear
and trembling. But however rapt, these are the people who have
made their mark on that profoundest function of man's strange
sojourn on this earth. Astonished, amazed, offended, and even
horror-stricken, the present generation of responsible defenders
of the <i>status quo</i> have seen many of those who have
ingested these drugs present pictures of such conditions as
capture the imagination of youth with a cogency that churches
find hard to match. The psychedelic movement is a religious
movement. The narrowly restrictive laws that have been passed
have made it a lawless movement with respect to the use of the
drugs, though generally it is not in other respects. </p>

<p> It has had its parallels in other ages, and it will be
instructive for us to take a brief look at history. The early
Christians were looked on with some alarm by that magnificent
peace-keeping agency, the Roman Empire. Because they refused even
that insignificant homage to the divine Emperor that would have
satisfied the State, these dissenters were persecuted and led to
death in the arena, their persecutors being among the more
conscientious of their rulers. Heretics and Jews during the
Middle Ages were burned at the stake for engaging in secret rites
and the holding of views disapproved by the Church. Among the
former were many mystics who had undergone experiences very
similar to, and probably often identical with, those of many of
the psychedelic hipsters of our times. Sitting in judgment on
these sensitive religious spirits (such as Meister Eckhart) were
not irresponsible sadists but sober clerics whose business it was
to protect other souls from heresy. These judges had no firsthand
knowledge of the mystic's vision. They were rational and
conscientious men charged with the duty of saving their fellows
from the flames of Hell, even as conscientious judges of our time
enforce the modern equivalent of the stake as they sentence to
long prison terms those whose visions and ecstasy they have never
shared. They only know that laws have been broken, and they wish
to protect society. They act according to their lights. </p>

<p> But religious people have never been notable for setting law
above the dictates of their consciences, and it is this stubborn
habit of the human mind that has brought us such protection as
religious conviction has against the state. It will also make
laws against the psychedelic drugs almost unenforceable. Yet it
has been religious conviction hardened into legalism, whether
theological or civil, that has led to intolerable controversy,
self-righteous cruelties, and some of the most savage wars of
history. This shameful record has led to the principle of
religious freedom such as that written into the American
constitution, which, nevertheless, only partially protects
religious minorities from the tyranny of the majority. In general
there is no type of religious experience for which the average
American, high or low, has so little tolerance as that type
fostered by the psychedelic drugs. The reason is that the
mystical side of human nature has been so repressed that it is
little understood. It has been looked on as esoteric and Eastern,
therefore vaguely opposed to the American way of life. Society
must be protected against it, say conservative churchgoers,
Daughters of the American Revolution, respected members of the
academic community, and the American Medical Association. </p>

<p> In order to call attention to a neglected aspect of the
controversy over the psychedelics, I have a little overstated a
case in order to make my point clear. For certainly I recognize
the fact that the drugs have their dangers and need to be
controlled, though I wish that legislators and enforcement
agencies would make greatly needed research much easier. Some of
the world's most experienced and eminent investigators in this
area find the drug denied to them. But it is not surprising that
cults that see in the psychedelics a sacramental substance of
great potency have been growing apace during the past few years,
from the Neo-American Church, whose leaders militantly stand on
their constitutional right to use the substances sacramentally,
to the Church of the Awakening, which is more conservative but
which nevertheless has applied to the FDA for the right to use
peyote as does the Native American Church. This right, like other
religious rights, has been hard won by the Indians through
loyalty of cult members, self-sacrifice, and the willingness of
individuals to go to jail if need be in support of their
convictions. If the Indians can use peyote, it is hard to see why
white churches cannot make good their right to do likewise. In
the meantime, both legal and illegal use of the psychedelics goes
on, sometimes religious and sometimes nonreligious, sometimes
with irresponsible foolhardiness and sometimes with the highest
resolution that such promising tools shall not be lost to
society, at least until their most cunning secrets be wrested
from them through careful research and responsible practice. </p>

<p> But there is no doubt that the drugs and their religious use
constitute a challenge to the established churches. Here is a
means to religious experience that not only makes possible a more
vital religious experience than the churches can ordinarily
demonstrate, but the regeneration of souls and the transformation
of personality are made possible to an extent that seems to be
far more reliable and frequent than what the ordinary churches
can promise. LSD is a tool through which religious experience
may, so to speak, be brought into the laboratory that it may more
practically become a matter for study. It is important that
religious institutions face the issues raised so that any
decisions they may have to make will derive from sound knowledge
rather than prejudice, ignorance, and fear. I do not have the
wisdom nor does anyone yet have the knowledge to say in advance
what the action of the churches will be or ought to be. But I do
say that if such decisions are to be sound, they must be based on
thorough information, freedom from hysteria, and above all,
open-mindedness to what may reliably be learned both of the great
promise and the dangers of these fascinating substances. </p>

<h2>DO DRUGS HAVE RELIGIOUS IMPORT?</h2>

<h4>HUSTON SMITH, Ph.D.</h4>
</center>

<hr>

<p> Until six months ago, if I picked up my phone in the
Cambridge area and dialed KISS- BIG a voice would answer,
&quot;Ifif.&quot; These were coincidences: KISS-BIG simply
happened to be the letter equivalents of an arbitrarily assigned
telephone number, while I.F.I.F. represented the initials of an
organization with the improbable name of the International
Federation for Internal Freedom. But the coincidences were
apposite to the point of being poetic. &quot;Kiss big&quot;
caught the euphoric, manic, life-embracing attitude that
characterized this most publicized of the organizations formed to
explore the newly synthesized consciousness-changing substances,
while the organization itself was surely one of the
&quot;iffy-est&quot; phenomena to appear on our social and
intellectual scene in some time. It produced the first firings in
Harvard's history, an ultimatum to get out of Mexico in five
days, and &quot;the miracle of Marsh Chapel&quot; in which during
a two-and-one-half hour Good Friday service ten theological
students and professors ingested psilocybin and were visited by
what they generally reported to be the deepest religious
experiences of their lives. </p>

<p> Despite the last of these phenomena and its numerous if less
dramatic parallels, students of religion appear by and large to
be dismissing the psychedelic drugs which have sprung to our
attention in the sixties as having little religious relevance.
The position taken in one of the most forward-looking volumes of
theological essays to have appeared in recent years<a
name="back1"></a> <a href="#footnote1">(1) </a>accepts R. C.
Zaehner's <i>Mysticism Sacred and Profane</i> as having
&quot;fully examined and refuted&quot; the religious claims for
mescaline which Aldous Huxley sketched in <i>The Doors of
Perception</i>. This closing of the case strikes me as premature,
for it looks as if the drugs have light to throw on the history
of religion, the phenomenology of religion, the philosophy of
religion, and the practice of the religious life itself. <center></p>

<h4>1. Drugs and Religion Viewed Historically</h4>
</center>

<p> In his trial-and-error life explorations man almost
everywhere has stumbled upon connections between vegetables
(eaten or brewed) and actions (yogic breathing exercises,
whirling dervish dances, flagellations) which altered states of
consciousness. From the psychopharmacological standpoint we now
understand these states to be the products of changes in brain
chemistry. From the sociological perspective we see that they
tended to be connected in some way with religion. If we discount
the wine used in our own communion services, the instances
closest to us in time and space are the peyote of The Native
American (Indian) Church and Mexico's 2,000- year-old
&quot;sacred mushrooms,&quot; the latter rendered in Aztec as
&quot;God's flesh&quot;&#151;striking parallel to &quot;the body
of our Lord&quot; in the Christian Eucharist. Beyond these
neighboring instances lie the <i>soma</i> of the Hindus, the <i>haoma</i>
and hemp, identical with and better known as marijuana, of the
Zoroastrians, the Dionysus of the Greeks who &quot;everywhere . .
. taught men the culture of the vine and the mysteries of his
worship and everywhere [was] accepted as a god,&quot;<a
name="back2"></a> <a href="#footnote2">(2)</a> the<i> benzoin</i>
of Southeast Asia, Zen's tea whose fifth cup purifies and whose
sixth &quot;calls to the realm of the immortals,&quot;<a
name="back3"></a> <a href="#footnote3">(3)</a> the <i>pituri</i>
of the Australian aborigines and probably the mystic <i>kykeon</i>
that was eaten and drunk at the climactic close of the sixth day
of the Eleusinian mysteries.<a name="back4"></a> <a
href="#footnote4">(4)</a> There is no need to extend the list,
especially as Philippie de Felice's comprehensive study of the
subject, <i>Poisons Sacrés, Ivresses Divines (Sacred Poisons,
Divine Raptures),</i> is about to appear in English. </p>

<p> More interesting than the fact that consciousness-changing
devices have been linked with religion is the possibility that
they actually initiated many of the religious perspectives which,
taking root in history, continued after their psychedelic origins
were forgotten. Bergson saw the first movement of Hindus and
Greeks toward &quot;dynamic religion&quot; as associated with the
&quot;divine rapture&quot; found in intoxicating beverages;<a
name="back5"></a> <a href="#footnote5">(5)</a> more recently
Robert Graves, Gordon Wasson and Alan Watts have suggested that
most religions arose from such chemically-induced theophanies.
Mary Barnard is the most explicit proponent of this thesis.
&quot;Which . . . was more likely to happen first,&quot; she asks
in the autumn 1963 journal of Phi Beta Kappa: &quot;the
spontaneously generated idea of an afterlife in which the
disembodied soul, liberated from the restrictions of time and
space, experiences eternal bliss, or the accidental discovery of
hallucinogenic plants that give a sense of euphoria, dislocate
the center of consciousness, and distort time and space, making
them balloon outward in greatly expanded vistas?&quot; Her own
answer is that &quot;the [latter] experience might have had . . .
an almost explosive effect on the largely dormant minds of men,
causing them to think of things they had never thought of before.
This, if you like, is direct revelation.&quot; Her use of the
subjunctive &quot;might&quot; renders this formulation of her
answer equivocal, but she concludes her essay on a note that is
completely unequivocal: &quot;Looking at the matter coldly,
unintoxicated and unentranced, I am willing to prophesy that
fifty theo-botanists working for fifty years would make the
current theories concerning the origins of much mythology and
theology as out-of-date as pre-Copernican astronomy.&quot;<a
name="back6"></a> <a href="#footnote6">(6)</a> </p>

<p> This is an important hypothesis&#151;one which must surely
engage the attention of historians of religion for some time to
come. But as I am concerned here only to spot the points at which
the drugs erupt onto the field of serious religious study, not to
ride the geysers to whatever height, I shall not pursue Miss
Barnard's thesis. Having located what appears to be the crux of
the historical question, namely the extent to which drugs not
merely duplicate or simulate theologically sponsored experiences
but generate or shape theologies themselves, I turn to
phenomenology. <center></p>

<h4>2. Drugs and Religion Viewed Phenomenologically</h4>
</center>

<p> Phenomenology attempts a careful description of human
experience. The question the drugs pose for the phenomenology of
religion, therefore, is whether the experiences they induce
differ from religious experiences reached au nature and if so
how. </p>

<p> Even the Bible notes that chemically induced psychic states
bear <i>some</i> resemblance to religious ones. Peter had to
appeal to a circumstantial criterion&#151;the early hour of the
day&#151;to defend those who were caught up in the Pentecostal
experience against the charge that they were merely drunk:
&quot;These men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only
the third hour of the day&quot; (Acts 2:15); and Paul initiates
the comparison when he admonishes the Ephesians not to &quot;get
drunk with wine . . . but [to] be filled with the spirit&quot;
(Ephesians 5:18). Are such comparisons, paralleled in the
accounts of virtually every religion, superficial? How far can
they be pushed? </p>

<p> Not all the way, students of religion have thus far insisted.
With respect to the new drugs, Professor R. C. Zaehner has drawn
the line emphatically. &quot;The importance of Huxley's <i>Doors
of Perception</i>,&quot; he writes, &quot;is that in it the
author clearly makes the claim that what he experienced under the
influence of mescalin is closely comparable to a genuine mystical
experience. If he is right . . . the conclusions . . . are
alarming.&quot;<a name="back7"></a> <a href="#footnote7">(7)</a>
Zaehner thinks that Huxley is not right, but Zaehner is mistaken.
</p>

<p> There are, of course, innumerable drug experiences which
haven't a religious feature; they can be sensual as readily as
spiritual, trivial as readily as transforming, capricious as
readily as sacramental. If there is one point about which every
student of the drugs agrees, it is that there is no such thing as
the drug experience per se&#151;no experience which the drugs, as
it were, merely secrete. Every experience is a mix of three
ingredients: drug, set (the psychological makeup of the
individual) and setting (the social and physical environment in
which it is taken). But given the right set and setting, the
drugs can induce religious experiences indistinguishable from
ones that occur spontaneously. Nor need set and setting be
exceptional. The way the statistics are currently running, it
looks as if from one-fourth to one-third of the general
population will have religious experiences if they take the drugs
under naturalistic conditions, meaning by this conditions in
which the researcher supports the subject but doesn't try to
influence the direction his experience will take. Among subjects
who have strong religious inclinations to begin with, the
proportion of those having religious experiences jumps to
three-fourths. If they take them in settings which are religious
too, the ratio soars to nine out of ten. </p>

<p> How do we know that the experiences these people have really
are religious? We can begin with the fact that they say they are.
The &quot;one-fourth to one-third of the general populous&quot;
figure is drawn from two sources. Ten months after they had had
their experiences, 24 percent of the 194 subjects in a study by
the California psychiatrist Oscar Janiger characterized them as
having been religious.<a name="back8"></a> <a href="#footnote8">(8)</a>
Thirty-two percent of the 74 subjects in Ditman and Hayman's
study reported that in looking back on their LSD experience it
looked as if it had been &quot;very much&quot; or &quot;quite a
bit&quot; a religious experience; 42 percent checked as true the
statement that they &quot;were left with a greater awareness of
God, or a higher power, or ultimate reality.&quot; <a
name="back9"></a><a href="#footnote9">(9)</a> The statement that
three-fourths of subjects having religious &quot;sets&quot; will
have religious experiences comes from the reports of sixty-nine
religious professionals who took the drugs while the Harvard
project was in progress.<a name="back10"></a> <a
href="#footnote10">(10)</a> </p>

<p> In the absence of (a) a single definition of a religious
experience acceptable to psychologists of religion generally, and
(b) foolproof ways of ascertaining whether actual experiences
exemplify any definition, I am not sure there is a better way of
telling whether the experiences of the 333 men and women involved
in the above studies were religious than by noting whether they
seemed so to them. But if more rigorous methods are preferred,
they exist; they have been utilized and confirm the conviction of
the man in the street that drug experiences can indeed be
religious. In his doctoral study at Harvard University, Dr.
Walter Pahnke worked out a typology of religious experience (in
this instance of the mystical variety) based on the classic cases
of mystical experiences as summarized in Walter Stace's <i>Mysticism
and Philosophy</i>. He then administered psilocybin to ten
theology students and professors in the setting of a Good Friday
service. The drug was given &quot;double-blind,&quot; meaning
that neither Dr. Pahnke nor his subjects would know which ten
were getting psilocybin and which ten placebos to constitute a
control group. Subsequently the reports the subjects wrote of
their experiences were laid successively before three
college-graduate housewives who, without being informed about the
nature of the study, were asked to rate each statement as to the
degree (strong, moderate, slight, or none) to which it
exemplified each of the nine traits of mystical experience as
enumerated in the typology of mysticism worked out in advance.
When the test of significance was applied to their statistics, it
showed that &quot;those subjects who received psilocybin
experienced phenomena which were indistinguishable from, if not
identical with . . . the categories defined by our typology of
mysticism.&quot;<a name="back11"></a> <a href="#footnote11">(11)</a>
</p>

<p> With the thought that the reader might like to test his own
powers of discernment on the question being considered, I insert
here a simple test I gave to a group of Princeton students
following a recent discussion sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson
Society. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Below are accounts of two religious experiences. One
    occurred under the influence of drugs, one without their
    influence. Check the one you think was drug-induced. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <center><p>I</center> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Suddenly I burst into a vast, new, indescribably wonderful
    universe. Although I am writing this over a year later, the
    thrill of the surprise and amazement, the awesomeness of the
    revelation, the engulfment in an overwhelming feeling-wave of
    gratitude and blessed wonderment, are as fresh, and the
    memory of the experience is as vivid, as if it had happened
    five minutes ago. And yet to concoct anything by way of
    description that would even hint at the magnitude, the sense
    of ultimate reality . . . this seems such an impossible task.
    The knowledge which has infused and affected every aspect of
    my life came instantaneously and with such complete force of
    certainty that it was impossible, then or since, to doubt its
    validity. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <center><p>II </center> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>All at once, without warning of any kind, I found myself
    wrapped in a flame-colored cloud. For an instant I thought of
    fire . . . the next, I knew that the fire was within myself.
    Directly afterward there came upon me a sense of exultation,
    of immense joyousness accompanied or immediately followed by
    an intellectual illumination impossible to describe. Among
    other things, I did not merely come to believe, but I saw
    that the universe is not composed of dead matter, but is, on
    the contrary, a living Presence; I became conscious in myself
    of eternal life.... I saw that all men are immortal: that the
    cosmic order is such that without any peradventure all things
    work together for the good of each and all; that the
    foundation principle of the world . . . is what we call love,
    and that the happiness of each and all is in the long run
    absolutely certain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> On the occasion referred to, twice the number of students
(46) answered incorrectly as answered correctly (23). I bury the
correct answer in a footnote to preserve the reader's opportunity
to test himself.<a name="back12"></a> <a href="#footnote12">(l2)</a>
</p>

<p> Why, in the face of this considerable evidence, does Zaehner
hold that drug experiences cannot be authentically religious?
There appear to be three reasons: </p>

<p> 1. His own experience was &quot;utterly trivial.&quot; This
of course proves that not all drug experiences are religious; it
does not prove that no drug experiences are religious. </p>

<p> 2. He thinks that the experiences of others which appear to
be religious to them are not truly so. Zaehner distinguishes
three kinds of mysticism: nature mysticism in which the soul is
united with the natural world; monistic mysticism in which the
soul merges with an impersonal absolute; and theism in which the
soul confronts the living, personal God. He concedes that drugs
can induce the first two species of mysticism, but not its
supreme instance, the theistic. As proof, he analyzes Huxley's
experience as recounted in <i>The Doors of Perception</i> to show
that it produced at best a blend of nature and monistic
mysticism. Even if we were to accept Zaehner's evaluation of the
three forms of mysticism, Huxley's case, and indeed Zaehner's
entire book, would prove only that not every mystical experience
induced by the drugs is theistic. Insofar as Zaehner goes beyond
this to imply that drugs do not and cannot induce theistic
mysticism, he not only goes beyond the evidence but proceeds in
the face of it. Professor Slotkin reports that the peyote Indians
&quot;see visions, which may be of Christ Himself. Sometimes they
hear the voice of the Great Spirit. Sometimes they become aware
of the presence of God and of those personal shortcomings which
must be corrected if they are to do His will.&quot;<a
name="back13"></a> <a href="#footnote13">(l3)</a> And G. M.
Carstairs, reporting on the use of psychedelic bhang (marijuana)
in India, quotes a Brahmin as saying, &quot;It gives good
bhakti.... You get a very good bhakti with bhang,&quot; bhakti
being precisely Hinduism's theistic variant.<a name="back14"></a>
<a href="#footnote14">(l4)</a> </p>

<p> 3. There is a third reason why Professor Zaehner might doubt
that drugs can induce experiences that are genuinely mystical.
Professor Zaehner is a Roman Catholic, and Roman Catholic
doctrine teaches that mystical rapture is a gift of grace and as
such can never be reduced to man's control. This may be true;
certainly the empirical evidence cited does not preclude the
possibility of a genuine ontological or theological difference
between natural and drug-induced religious experiences. At this
point, however, we are considering phenomenology rather than
ontology, description rather than interpretation, and on this
level there is no difference. Descriptively, drug experiences
cannot be distinguished from their natural religious counterpart.
When the current philosophical authority on mysticism, Dr. W. T.
Stace, Professor Emeritus at Princeton University, was asked
whether the drug experience is similar to the mystical
experience, he answered, &quot;It's not a matter of its being <i>similar</i>
to mystical experience; it <i>is </i>mystical experience.&quot; </p>

<p> What we seem to be witnessing in Zaehner's <i>Mysticism
Sacred and Profane</i> is a reenactment of the age-old pattern in
the conflict between science and religion. Whenever a new
controversy arises, religion's first impulse is to deny the
disturbing evidence science has produced. Seen in perspective,
Zaehner's refusal to admit that drugs can induce experiences
descriptively indistinguishable from those which are
spontaneously religious is the current counterpart of the
seventeenth century theologians' refusal to look through
Galileo's telescope or, when they did, their persistence in
dismissing what they saw as machinations of the devil. When the
fact that drugs can trigger religious experiences becomes
incontrovertible, discussion will move to the more difficult
question of how this new fact is to be interpreted. The latter
question leads beyond phenomenology into philosophy. <center></p>

<h4>3. Drugs and Religion Viewed Philosophically </h4>
</center>

<p> Why do people reject evidence? Because they find it
threatening, we may suppose. Theologians are not the only
professionals to utilize this mode of defense. In his <i>Personal
Knowledge</i>, Michael Polanyi recounts the way the medical
profession ignored such palpable facts as the painless amputation
of human limbs, performed before their own eyes in hundreds of
successive cases, concluding that the subjects were impostors who
were either deluding their physician or colluding with him. One
physician, Esdaile, carried out about 300 major operations
painlessly under mesmeric trance in India, but neither in India
nor in Great Britain could he get medical journals to print
accounts of his work. Polanyi attributes this closed-mindedness
to &quot;lack of a conceptual framework in which their
discoveries could be separated from specious and untenable
admixtures.&quot; </p>

<p> The &quot;untenable admixture&quot; in the fact that
psychotomimetic drugs can induce religious experience is their
apparent implicate: that religious disclosures are no more
veridical than psychotic ones. For religious skeptics, this
conclusion is obviously not untenable at all; it fits in
beautifully with their thesis that <i>all</i> religion is at
heart an escape from reality. Psychotics avoid reality by
retiring into dream worlds of make-believe; what better evidence
that religious visionaries do the same than the fact that
identical changes in brain chemistry produces both states of
mind? Had not Marx already warned us that religion is the
&quot;opiate&quot; of the people? Apparently he was more
literally accurate than he supposed. Freud was likewise too mild.
He &quot;never doubted that religious phenomena are to be
understood only on the model of the neurotic symptoms of the
individual.&quot;<a name="back15"></a> <a href="#footnote15">(15)</a>
He should have said &quot;psychotic symptoms.&quot; </p>

<p> So the religious skeptic is likely to reason. What about the
religious believer? Convinced that religious experiences are not
fundamentally delusory, can he admit that psychotomimetic drugs
can occasion them? To do so he needs (to return to Polanyi's
words) &quot;a conceptual framework in which [the discoveries
can] be separated from specious and untenable admixtures,&quot;
the latter being in this case the conclusion that religious
experiences are in general delusory. </p>

<p> One way to effect the separation would be to argue that
despite phenomenological similarities between natural and
drug-induced religious experiences, they are separated by a
crucial <i>ontological</i> difference. Such an argument would
follow the pattern of theologians who argue for the &quot;real
presence&quot; of Christ's body and blood in the bread and wine
of the Eucharist despite their admission that chemical analysis,
confined as it is to the level of &quot;accidents&quot; rather
than &quot;essences,&quot; would not disclose this presence. But
this distinction will not appeal to many today, for it turns on
an essence-accident metaphysics which is not widely accepted.
Instead of fighting a rear-guard action by insisting that if drug
and non-drug religious experiences can't be distinguished
empirically there must be some trans-empirical factor which
distinguishes them and renders the drug experience profane, I
wish to explore the possibility of accepting drug-induced
experiences as religious in every sense of the word without
relinquishing confidence in the truth claims of religious
experience generally. </p>

<p> To begin with the weakest of all arguments, the argument from
authority: William James didn't discount <i>his </i>insights
which occurred while his brain chemistry was altered. The
paragraph in which he retrospectively evaluates his nitrous oxide
experiences has become classic, but it is so pertinent to the
present discussion that it merits quoting again. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time, and
    my impression of its truth has ever since remained unshaken.
    It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational
    consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of
    consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the
    filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of
    consciousness entirely different. We may go through life
    without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite
    stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their
    completeness, definite types of mentality which probably
    somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No
    account of the universe in its totality can be final which
    leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.
    How to regard them is the question&#151;for they are so
    discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may
    determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and
    open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate,
    they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality.
    Looking back on my own experiences, they all converge toward
    a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some
    metaphysical significance.<a name="back16"></a> <a
    href="#footnote16">(16)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> To this argument from authority, I add two that try to
provide something by way of reasons. Drug experiences that assume
a religious cast tend to have fearful and/or beatific features,
and each of my hypotheses relates to one of these aspects of the
experience. </p>

<p> Beginning with the ominous, &quot;fear of the Lord,&quot;
awe-ful features, Gordon Wasson, the New York
banker-turned-mycologist, describes these as he encountered them
in his psilocybin experience as follows: &quot;Ecstasy! In common
parlance . . . ecstasy is fun.... But ecstasy is not fun. Your
very soul is seized and shaken until it tingles. After all, who
will choose to feel undiluted awe . . . ? The unknowing vulgar
abuse the word; we must recapture its full and terrifying
sense.&quot; Emotionally the drug experience can be like having
forty-foot waves crash over you for several hours while you cling
desperately to a life raft which may be swept from under you at
any minute. It seems quite possible that such an ordeal, like any
experience of a close call, could awaken rather fundamental
sentiments respecting life and death and destiny and trigger the
&quot;no atheists in foxholes&quot; effect. Similarly, as the
subject emerges from the trauma and realizes that he is not going
to be insane as he had feared, there may come over him an
intensified appreciation like that frequently reported by
patients recovering from critical illness. &quot;It happened on
the day when my bed was pushed out of doors to the open gallery
of the hospital,&quot; reads one such report. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I cannot now recall whether the revelation came suddenly
    or gradually; I only remember finding myself in the very
    midst of those wonderful moments, beholding life for the
    first time in all its young intoxication of loveliness, in
    its unspeakable joy, beauty, and importance. I cannot say
    exactly what the mysterious change was. I saw no new thing,
    but I saw all the usual things in a miraculous new
    light&#151;in what I believe is their true light. I saw for
    the first time how wildly beautiful and joyous, beyond any
    words of mine to describe, is the whole of life. Every human
    being moving across that porch, every sparrow that flew,
    every branch tossing in the wind, was caught in and was a
    part of the whole mad ecstasy of loveliness, of joy, of
    importance, of intoxication of life.<a name="back17"></a> <a
    href="#footnote17">(17)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> If we do not discount religious intuitions because they are
prompted by battlefields and <i>physical </i>crises; if we regard
the latter as &quot;calling us to our senses&quot; more often
than they seduce us into delusions, need comparable intuitions be
discounted simply because the crises that trigger them are of an
inner, <i>psychic</i> variety? </p>

<p> Turning from the hellish to the heavenly aspects of the drug
experience, <i>some</i> of the latter may be explainable by the
hypothesis just stated; that is, they may be occasioned by the
relief that attends the sense of escape from high danger. But
this hypothesis cannot possibly account for <i>all</i> the
beatific episodes for the simple reason that the positive
episodes often come first, or to persons who experience no
negative episodes whatever. Dr. Sanford Unger of the National
Institute of Mental Health reports that among his subjects
&quot;50 to 60 percent will not manifest any real disturbance
worthy of discussion,&quot; yet &quot;around 75&quot; will have
at least one episode in which exaltation, rapture, and joy are
the key descriptions. <a name="back18"></a><a href="#footnote18">(18)</a>
How are we to account for the drug's capacity to induce peak
experiences, such as the following, which are <i>not </i>preceded
by fear? </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A feeling of great peace and contentment seemed to flow
    through my entire body. All sound ceased and I seemed to be
    floating in a great, very very still void or hemisphere. It
    is impossible to describe the overpowering feeling of peace,
    contentment, and being a part of goodness itself that I felt.
    I could feel my body dissolving and actually becoming a part
    of the goodness and peace that was all around me. Words can't
    describe this. I feel an awe and wonder that such a feeling
    could have occurred to me.<a name="back19"></a> <a
    href="#footnote19">(19)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Consider the following line of argument. Like every other
form of life, man's nature has become distinctive through
specialization. Man has specialized in developing a cerebral
cortex. The analytic powers of this instrument are a standing
wonder, but it seems less able to provide man with the sense that
he is meaningfully related to his environment, to life, the world
and history in their wholeness. As Albert Camus describes the
situation, &quot;If I were . . . a cat among animals, this life
would have a meaning, or rather this problem would not arise, for
I should belong to this world. I would be this world to which I
am now opposed by my whole consciousness.&quot;<a name="back20"></a>
<a href="#footnote20">(20)</a> Note that it is Camus'
consciousness that opposes him to his world. The drugs do not
knock this consciousness out, but while they leave it operative
they also activate areas of the brain that normally lie below its
threshold of awareness. One of the clearest objective signs that
the drugs are taking effect is the dilation they produce in the
pupils of the eyes, while one of the most predictable subjective
signs is the intensification of visual perception. Both of these
responses are controlled by portions of the brain that lie deep,
further to the rear than the mechanisms that govern
consciousness. Meanwhile we know that the human organism is
interlaced with its world in innumerable ways it normally cannot
sense&#151;through gravitational fields, body respiration, and
the like; the list could be multiplied until man's skin began to
seem more like a thoroughfare than a boundary. Perhaps the deeper
regions of the brain which evolved earlier and are more like
those of the lower animals&#151; &quot;If I were . . . a cat . .
. I should belong to this world&quot;&#151;can sense this
relatedness better than can the cerebral cortex which now
dominates our awareness. If so, when the drugs rearrange the
neurohumors that chemically transmit impulses across synapses
between neurons, man's consciousness and his submerged,
intuitive, ecological awareness might for a spell become
interlaced. This is, of course, no more than a hypothesis, but
how else are we to account for the extraordinary incidence under
the drugs of that kind of insight the keynote of which James
described as </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of
    the world, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our
    difficulties and troubles, were melted into one and the same
    genus, but one of the species, the nobler and better one, is
    itself the genus, and so soaks up and absorbs its opposites
    into itself.<a name="back21"></a> <a href="#footnote21">(21)</a>
    </p>

<h4>4. The Drugs and Religion Viewed &quot;Religiously&quot; </h4>
</center>

<p> Suppose that drugs can induce experiences that are
indistinguishable from religious ones, and that we can respect
their reports. Do they shed any light, not (we now ask) on life,
but on the nature of the religious life? </p>

<p> One thing they may do is throw religious experience itself
into perspective by clarifying its relation to the religious life
as a whole. Drugs appear able to induce religious experiences; it
is less evident that they can produce religious lives. It follows
that religion is more than religious experiences. This is hardly
news, but it may be a useful reminder, especially to those who
incline toward &quot;the religion of religious experience,&quot;
which is to say toward lives bent on the acquisition of desired
states of experience irrespective of their relation to life's
other demands and components. </p>

<p> Despite the dangers of faculty psychology, it remains useful
to regard man as having a mind, a will, and feelings. One of the
lessons of religious history is that to be adequate a faith must
rouse and involve all three components of man's nature. Religions
of reason grow arid; religions of duty, leaden. Religions of
experience have their comparable pitfalls, as evidenced by
Taoism's struggle (not always successful) to keep from
degenerating into quietism, and the vehemence with which Zen
Buddhism has insisted that once students have attained <i>satori,</i>
they must be driven out of it, back into the world. The case of
Zen is especially pertinent here, for it pivots on an
enlightenment experience&#151;<i>satori</i> or <i>kensho</i>&#151;which
some (but not all) Zennists says resembles LSD. Alike or
different, the point is that Zen recognizes that unless the
experience is joined to discipline, it will come to naught. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Even the Buddha ... had to sit.... Without <i>joriki</i>,
    the particular power developed through <i>zazen</i> [seated
    meditation], the vision of oneness attained in enlightenment
    . . . in time becomes clouded and eventually fades into a
    pleasant memory instead of remaining an omnipresent reality
    shaping our daily life.... To be able to live in accordance
    with what the Mind's eye has revealed through satori
    requires, like the purification of character and the
    development of personality, a ripening period of zazen.<a
    name="back22"></a> <a href="#footnote22">(22)</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> If the religion of religious experience is a snare and a
delusion, it follows that no religion that fixes its faith
primarily in substances that induce religious experiences can be
expected to come to a good end. What promised to be a shortcut
will prove to be a short circuit; what began as a religion will
end as a religion surrogate. Whether chemical substances can be
helpful <i>adjuncts </i>to faith is another question. The
peyote-using Native American Church seems to indicate that they
can be; anthropologists give this church a good report, noting
among other things that members resist alcohol and alcoholism
better than do non-members.<a name="back23"></a> <a
href="#footnote23">(23)</a> The conclusion to which evidence
currently points would seem to be that chemicals can aid the
religious life, but only where set within a context of faith
(meaning by this the conviction that what they disclose is true)
and discipline (meaning diligent exercise of the will in the
attempt to work out the implications of the disclosures for the
living of life in the every day, common sense world). </p>

<p> Nowhere today in Western civilization are these two
conditions jointly fulfilled. Churches lack faith in the sense
just mentioned, hipsters lack discipline. This might lead us to
forget about the drugs, were it not for one fact: the distinctive
religious emotion and the one drugs unquestionably can
occasion&#151;Otto's <i>mysterium tremendum, majestas, mysterium
fascinans</i>; in a phrase, the phenomenon of religious
awe&#151;seems to be declining sharply. As Paul Tillich said in
an address to the Hillel Society at Harvard several years ago: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The question our century puts before us [is]: Is it
    possible to regain the lost dimension, the encounter with the
    Holy, the dimension which cuts through the world of
    subjectivity and objectivity and goes down to that which is
    not world but is the mystery of the Ground of Being? </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Tillich may be right; this may be the religious question of
our century. For if (as we have insisted) religion cannot be
equated with religious experience, neither can it long survive
its absence. </p>

<h1>DRUGS AND MYSTICISM</h1>

<h3>WALTER N. PAHNKE</h3>

<p> from: <i>The International Journal of Parapsychology</i>,
Vol. VIII, No. 2, Spring 1966, pp. 295-313. copyright 1966.</p>

<hr>

<p> The claim has been made that the experience facilitated by
psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, can be
similar or identical to the experience described by the mystics
of all ages, cultures, and religions. This paper will attempt to
examine and explain this possibility. </p>

<p> There is a long and continuing history of the religious use
of plants that contain psychedelic substances. Scholars such as
Osmond (1957b), Schultes (1963), and Wasson (1961) have made
valuable contributions to this intriguing field. In some
instances, such natural products were ingested by a priest,
shaman, or witch doctor to induce a trance for revelatory
purposes; sometimes they were taken by groups of people who
participated in sacred ceremonies. For example, the dried heads
of the peyote cactus, whose chief active ingredient is mescaline,
were used by the Aztecs at least as early as 300 B.C. and are
currently being employed by over fifty thousand Indians of the
Native American Church as a vital part of their religious
ceremonies. Both <i>ololiuqui</i>, a variety of morning-glory
seed, and certain kinds of Mexican mushrooms (called <i>teonanacatl</i>,
&quot;flesh of the gods&quot;) were also used for divinatory and
religious purposes by the Aztecs. These practices have continued
to the present among remote Indian tribes in the mountains of the
state of Oaxaca, in Mexico. Modern psychopharmacological research
has shown the active chemicals to be psilocybin in the case of
the mushrooms, and several compounds closely related to LSD in
the case of ololiuqui. <i>Amanita muscaria</i>, the mushroom that
has been used for unknown centuries by Siberian shamans to induce
religious trances, does not contain psilocybin. The most
important psychologically active compound from this mushroom has
not yet been isolated, but promising work is in progress. Other
naturally occurring plants, which are used by various South
American Indian tribes in a religious manner for prophecy,
divination, clairvoyance, tribal initiation of male adolescents,
or sacred feasts are: cohoba snuff, made from the pulverized
seeds of <i>Piptadenia</i>; the drink <i>vinho de Jurumens</i>,
made from the seeds of <i>Mimosa hostilis</i>; and the drink <i>caapi</i>,
made from <i>Banisteriopsis</i>. These last three products
contain various indolic compounds that are all closely related to
psilocybin, both structurally and in their psychic effects
(bufotenine, dimethyl-tryptamine, and harmine, respectively).
Both LSD and psilocybin contain the indolic ring, and mescaline
may be metabolized to an indole in the body. </p>

<h5>An Experimental Examination of the Claim that Psychedelic
Drug Experience May Resemble Mystical Experience </h5>

<p> Some of the researchers who have experimented with
synthesized mescaline, LSD, or psilocybin have remarked upon the
similarity between drug-induced and spontaneous mystical
experiences because of the frequency with which some of their
subjects have used mystical and religious language to describe
their experiences. These data interested the author in a careful
examination and evaluation of such claims. An empirical study,
designed to investigate in a systematic and scientific way the
similarities and differences between experiences described by
mystics and those facilitated by psychedelic drugs, was
undertaken (Pahnke, 1966, 1967). First, a phenomenological
typology of the mystical state of consciousness was carefully
defined, after a study of the writings of the mystics themselves
and of scholars who have tried to characterize mystical
experience. [For example, William James (1935) was an invaluable
pioneer in this area.] Then, some drug experiences were
empirically studied, not by collecting such experiences wherever
an interesting or striking one might have been found and analyzed
after the fact, but by conducting a double-blind, controlled
experiment with subjects whose religious background and
experience, as well as personality, had been measured <i>before</i>
their drug experiences. The preparation of the subjects, the
setting under which the drug was administered, and the collection
of data about the experience were made as uniform as possible.
The experimenter himself devised the experiment, collected the
data, and evaluated the results without ever having had a
personal experience with any of these drugs. </p>

<p> A nine-category typology of the mystical state of
consciousness was defined as a basis for measurement of the
phenomena of the psychedelic drug experiences. Among the numerous
studies of mysticism, the work of W. T. Stace (1960) was found to
be the most helpful guide for the construction of this typology.
His conclusion---that in the mystical experience there are
certain fundamental characteristics that are universal and not
restricted to any particular religion or culture (although
particular cultural, historical, or religious conditions may
influence both the interpretation and description of these basic
phenomena)---was taken as a presupposition. Whether or not the
mystical experience is &quot;religious&quot; depends upon one's
definition of religion and was not the problem investigated. Our
typology defined the universal phenomena of the mystical
experience, whether considered &quot;religious&quot; or not. </p>

<p> The nine categories of our phenomenological typology may be
summarized as follows: </p>

<h5>Category I: Unity </h5>

<p> Unity, the most important characteristic of the mystical
experience, is divided into internal and external types, which
are different ways of experiencing an undifferentiated unity. The
major difference is that the internal type finds unity through an
&quot;inner world&quot; <i>within</i> the experiencer while the
external type finds unity through the external world outside the
experiencer. </p>

<p> The essential elements of <i>internal unity</i> are loss of
usual sense impressions and loss of self without becoming
unconscious. The multiplicity of usual external and internal
sense impressions ( including time and space ), and the empirical
ego or usual sense of individuality, fade or melt away while
consciousness remains. In the most complete experience, this
consciousness is a pure awareness beyond empirical content, with
no external or internal distinctions. In spite of the loss of
sense impressions and dissolution of the usual personal identity
or self, the awareness of oneness or unity is still experienced
and remembered. One is not unconscious but is rather very much
aware of an undifferentiated unity. </p>

<p> <i>External unity</i> is perceived outwardly with the
physical senses through the external world. A sense of underlying
oneness is felt behind the empirical multiplicity. The subject or
observer feels that the usual separation between himself and an
external object (inanimate or animate) is no longer present in a
basic sense; yet the subject still knows that on another level,
at the same time, he and the objects are separate. Another way of
expressing this same phenomenon is that the essences of objects
are experienced intuitively and felt to be the same at the
deepest level. The subject feels a sense of oneness with these
objects because he &quot;sees&quot; that at the most basic level
all are a part of the same undifferentiated unity. The capsule
statement &quot;. . . all is One&quot; is a good summary of
external unity. In the most complete experience, a cosmic
dimension is felt, so that the experiences feels in a deep sense
that he is a part of everything that is. </p>

<h5>Category II: Transcendence of Time and Space </h5>

<p> This category refers to loss of the usual sense of time and
space. This means clock time but may also be one's personal sense
of his past, present, and future. Transcendence of space means
that a person loses his usual orientation as to where he is
during the experience in terms of the usual three-dimensional
perception of his environment. Experiences of timelessness and
spacelessness may also be described as experiences of
&quot;eternity&quot; or &quot;infinity.&quot; </p>

<h5>Category III: Deeply Felt Positive Mood </h5>

<p> The most universal elements (and, therefore, the ones that
are most essential to the definition of this category) are joy,
blessedness, and peace. The unique character of these feelings in
relation to the mystical experience is the intensity that
elevates them to the highest levels of human experience, and they
are highly valued by the experiencers. Tears may be associated
with any of these elements because of the overpowering nature of
the experience. Such feelings may occur either at the peak of the
experience or during the &quot;ecstatic afterglow,&quot; when the
peak has passed but while its effects and memory are still quite
vivid and intense. Love may also be an element of deeply felt
positive mood, but it does not have the same universality as joy,
blessedness, and peace. </p>

<h5>Category IV: Sense of Sacredness </h5>

<p> This category refers to the sense of sacredness that is
evoked by the mystical experience. The sacred is here broadly
defined as that which a person feels to be of special value and
capable of being profaned. The basic characteristic of sacredness
is a non-rational, intuitive, hushed, palpitant response of awe
and wonder in the presence of inspiring realities. No religious
&quot;beliefs&quot; or traditional theological terminology need
necessarily be involved, even though there may be a sense of
reverence or a feeling that what is experienced is holy or
divine. </p>

<h5>Category V: Objectivity and Reality </h5>

<p> This category has two interrelated elements: ( 1 ) insightful
knowledge or illumination felt at an intuitive, non-rational
level and gained by direct experience; and (2) the authoritative
nature of the experience, or the certainty that such knowledge is
truly real, in contrast to the feeling that the experience is a
subjective delusion. These two elements are connected, because
the knowledge through experience of ultimate reality (in the
sense of being able to &quot;know&quot; and &quot;see&quot; what
is really <i>real</i>) carries its own sense of certainty. The
experience of &quot;ultimate&quot; reality is an awareness of
another dimension unlike the &quot;ordinary&quot; reality (the
reality of usual, everyday consciousness); yet the knowledge of
&quot;ultimate&quot; reality is quite real to the experiencer.
Such insightful knowledge does not necessarily mean an increase
in facts, but rather in intuitive illumination. What becomes
&quot;known&quot; (rather than merely intellectually assented to)
is intuitively felt to be authoritative, requires no proof at a
rational level, and produces an inward feeling of objective
truth. The content of this knowledge may be divided into two main
types: (a) insights into being and existence in general, and (b)
insights into one's personal, finite self. </p>

<h5>Category VI: Paradoxicality </h5>

<p> Accurate descriptions and even rational interpretations of
the mystical experience tend to be logically contradictory when
strictly analyzed. For example, in the experience of internal
unity there is a loss of all empirical content in an <i>empty</i>
unity which is at the same time <i>full</i> and complete. This
loss includes the loss of the sense of self and the dissolution
of individuality; yet something of the individual entity remains
to experience the unity. The &quot;I&quot; both exists and does
not exist. Another example is the separateness from, and at the
same time unity with, objects in the experience of external unity
(essentially a paradoxical transcendence of space). </p>

<h5>Category VII: Alleged Ineffability </h5>

<p> In spite of attempts to relate or write about the mystical
experience, mystics insist either that words fail to describe it
adequately or that the experience is beyond words. Perhaps the
reason is an embarrassment with language because of the
paradoxical nature of the essential phenomena. </p>

<h5>Category VIII: Transiency </h5>

<p> Transiency refers to duration, and means the temporary nature
of the mystical experience in contrast to the relative permanence
of the level of usual experience. There is a transient appearance
of the special and unusual levels or dimensions of consciousness
as defined by our typology, their eventual disappearance, and a
return to the more usual. The characteristic of transiency
indicates that the mystical state of consciousness is not
sustained indefinitely. </p>

<h5>Category IX: Persisting Positive Changes in Attitude and
Behavior </h5>

<p> Because our typology is of a healthful, life-enhancing
mysticism, this category describes the positive, lasting effects
of the experience and the resulting changes in attitude. These
changes are divided into four groups: (1) toward self, (2) toward
others, (3) toward life, and (4) toward the mystical experience
itself. </p>

<p> (1) Increased integration of personality is the basic inward
change in the personal self. Undesirable traits may be faced in
such a way that they may be dealt with and finally reduced or
eliminated. As a result of personal integration, one's sense of
inner authority may be strengthened, and the vigor and dynamic
quality of a person's life may be increased. Creativity and
greater efficiency of achievement may be released. An inner
optimistic tone may result, with a consequent increase in
feelings of happiness, joy, and peace. (2) Changes in attitude
and behavior toward others include more sensitivity, more
tolerance, more real love, and more authenticity as a person by
virtue of being more open and more one's true self with others.
(3) Changes toward life in a positive direction include
philosophy of life, sense of values, sense of meaning and
purpose, vocational commitment, need for service to others, and
new appreciation of life and the whole of creation. Life may seem
richer. The sense of reverence may be increased, and more time
may be spent in devotional life and meditation. (4) Positive
change in attitude toward the mystical experience itself means
that it is regarded as valuable and that what has been learned is
thought to be useful. The experience is remembered as a high
point, and an attempt is made to recapture it or, if possible, to
gain new experiences as a source of growth and strength. The
mystical experiences of others are more readily appreciated and
understood. </p>

<p> The purpose of the experiment in which psilocybin was
administered in a religious context was to gather empirical data
about the state of consciousness experienced. In a private chapel
on Good Friday, twenty Christian theological students, ten of
whom had been given psilocybin one and one half hours earlier,
listened over loudspeakers to a two-and-onehalf-hour religious
service which was in actual progress in another part of the
building and which consisted of organ music, four solos,
readings, prayers, and personal meditation. The assumption was
made that the condition most conducive to a mystical experience
should be an atmosphere broadly comparable to that achieved by
tribes who actually use natural psychedelic substances in
religious ceremonies. The particular content and procedure of the
ceremony had to be applicable (i.e., familiar and meaningful) to
the participants. Attitude toward the experience, both before and
during, was taken into serious consideration in the experimental
design. Preparation was meant to maximize positive expectation,
trust, confidence, and reduction of fear. The setting was planned
to utilize this preparation through group support and rapport;
through friendship and an open, trusting atmosphere; and through
prior knowledge of the procedure of the experiment in order to
eliminate, if possible, feelings of manipulation that might
arise. </p>

<p> In the weeks before the experiment, each subject participated
in five hours of various preparation and screening procedures,
which included psychological tests, medical history, physical
examination, questionnaire evaluation of previous religious
experience, intensive interview, and group interaction. The
twenty subjects were graduate-student volunteers, all of whom
were from middle-class Protestant backgrounds and from one
denominational seminary in the free-church tradition. None of the
subjects had taken psilocybin or related substances before this
experiment. The volunteers were divided into five groups of four
students each on the basis of compatibility and friendship. Two
leaders, who knew from past experience the positive and negative
possibilities of the psilocybin reaction, met with their groups
to encourage trust, confidence, group support, and fear
reduction. The method of reaction to the experience was
emphasized (i.e., to relax and co-operate with, rather than to
fight against, the effects of the drug). Throughout the
preparation, an effort was made to avoid suggesting the
characteristics of the typology of mysticism. The leaders were
not familiar with the typology that had been devised. </p>

<p> Double-blind technique was employed in the experiment, so
that neither the experimenter nor any of the participants
(leaders or subjects) knew the specific contents of the capsules,
which were identical in appearance. Half of the subjects and one
of the leaders in each group received psilocybin (thirty
milligrams for each of the ten experimental subjects and fifteen
milligrams each for five of the leaders). Without prior knowledge
of the drug used, or of its effects, the remaining ten subjects
and the other five leaders each received two hundred milligrams
of nicotinic acid, a vitamin that causes transient feelings of
warmth and tingling of the skin, in order to maximize suggestion
for the control group. </p>

<p> Data were collected during the experiment and at various
times up to six months afterward. On the experimental day, tape
recordings were made both of individual reactions immediately
after the religious service and of the group discussions that
followed. Each subject wrote an account of his experience as soon
after the experiment as was convenient. Within a week all
subjects had completed a 147-item questionnaire which had been
designed to measure the various phenomena of the typology of
mysticism on a qualitative, numerical scale. The results of this
questionnaire were used as a basis for a one-and-one-half-hour,
tape-recorded interview which immediately followed. Six months
later each subject was interviewed again after completion of a
follow-up questionnaire in three parts, with a similar scale.
Part I was open ended; the participant was asked to list any
changes that he felt were a result of his Good Friday experience
and to rate the degree of benefit or harm of each change. Part II
(fifty-two items) was a condensed and somewhat more explicit
repetition of items from the post-drug questionnaire. Part III
(ninety-three items) was designed to measure both positive and
negative attitudinal and behavioral changes that had lasted for
six months and were due to the experience. The individual
descriptive accounts and Part I of the follow-up questionnaire
were content-analyzed with a qualitative, numerical scale by
judges who were independent of the experiment and who knew only
that they were to analyze twenty accounts written by persons who
had attended a religious service. </p>

<p> Prior to the experiment, the twenty subjects had been matched
in ten pairs on the basis of data from the pre-drug
questionnaires, interviews, and psychological tests. Past
religious experience, religious background, and general
psychological make-up were used for the pairings, in that order
of importance. The experiment was designed so that by random
distribution one subject from each pair received psilocybin and
one received the control substance, nicotinic acid. This division
into an experimental and a control group was for the purpose of
statistical evaluation of the scores from each of the three
methods of measurement that used a numerical scale: the post-drug
questionnaire, the follow-up questionnaire, and the content
analysis of the written accounts. </p>

<p> A summary of percentage scores and significance levels
reached by the ten experimentals and ten controls, for each
category or subcategory of the typology of mysticism, is
presented in Table I. The score from each of the three methods of
measurement was calculated as the percentage of the maximum
possible score if the top of the rating scale for each item had
been scored. The percentages from each method of measurement were
then averaged together. A comparison of the scores of the
experimental and control subject in each pair was used to
calculate the significance level of the differences observed by
means of the non-parametric Sign Test. As can be seen from Table
I, for the combined scores from the three methods of measurement,
p was less than .020 in all categories except deeply felt
positive mood (love) and persisting positive changes in attitude
and behavior toward the experience, where p was still less than
.055.<a name="back1"></a> </p>

<p> <a href="#table1">(TABLE I)</a> </p>

<p> Although this evidence indicates that the experimentals as a
group achieved to a statistically significant degree a higher
score in each of the nine categories than did the controls, the
degree of completeness or intensity must be examined. </p>

<p> In terms of our typology of mysticism, ideally the most
&quot;complete&quot; mystical experience should have demonstrated
the phenomena of all the categories in a maximal way. The
evidence (particularly from the content analysis and also
supported by impressions from the interviews) showed that such
perfect completeness in all categories was not experienced by all
the subjects in the experimental group. In the data, the various
categories and subcategories can be divided into three groups in
regard to the degree of intensity or completeness, as shown in
Table II. Criteria were the percentage levels and the consistency
among different methods of measurement. The closest approximation
to a complete and intense degree of experience was found for the
categories of internal unity, transcendence of time and space,
transiency, paradoxicality, and persisting positive changes in
attitude and behavior toward self and life. The evidence
indicated that the second group had almost, but not quite, the
same degree of completeness or intensity as the first group. The
second group consisted of external unity, objectivity and
reality, joy, and alleged ineffability. There was a relatively
greater lack of completeness for sense of sacredness, love, and
persisting positive changes in attitude and behavior toward
others and toward the experience. Each of these last eight
categories and sub-categories was termed incomplete to a greater
or lesser degree for the experimentals, but was definitely
present to some extent when compared with the controls. When
analyzed most rigorously and measured against all possible
categories of the typology of mysticism, the experience of the
experimental subjects was considered incomplete in this strictest
sense. Usually such incompleteness was demonstrated by results of
the content analyses.<a name="back2"></a> </p>

<p> <a href="#table2">(TABLE II)</a> </p>

<p> The control subjects did not experience many phenomena of the
mystical typology, and even then only to a low degree of
completeness. The phenomena for which the scores of the controls
were closest to (although still always less than) the
experimentals were: blessedness and peace, sense of sacredness,
love, and persisting positive changes in attitude and behavior
toward others and toward the experience. </p>

<p> The design of the experiment suggested an explanation for the
fact that the control subjects should have experienced any
phenomena at all. The meaningful religious setting of the
experiment would have been expected to encourage a response of
blessedness, peace, and sacredness. In the case of love and
persisting changes toward others and toward the experience,
observation by the controls of the profound experience of the
experimentals and interaction between the two groups on an
interpersonal level appeared, from both post-experimental
interviews, to have been the main basis for the controls'
experience of these phenomena. </p>

<p> The experience of the experimental subjects was certainly
more like mystical experience than that of the controls, who had
the same expectation and suggestion from the preparation and
setting. The most striking difference between the experimentals
and the controls was the ingestion of thirty milligrams of
psilocybin, which it was concluded was the facilitating agent
responsible for the difference in phenomena experienced. </p>

<p> After an admittedly short follow-up period of only six
months, life-enhancing and enriching effects similar to some of
those claimed by mystics were shown by the higher scores of the
experimental subjects when compared to the controls. In addition,
after four hours of follow-up interviews with each subject, the
experimenter was left with the impression that the experience had
made a profound impact (especially in terms of religious feeling
and thinking) on the lives of eight out of ten of the subjects
who had been given psilocybin. Although the psilocybin experience
was unique and different from the &quot;ordinary&quot; reality of
their everyday lives, these subjects felt that this experience
had motivated them to appreciate more deeply the meaning of their
lives, to gain more depth and authenticity in ordinary living,
and to rethink their philosophies of life and values. The data
did not suggest that any &quot;ultimate&quot; reality encountered
had made &quot;ordinary&quot; reality no longer important or
meaningful. The fact that the experience took place in the
context of a religious service, with the use of symbols that were
familiar and meaningful to the participants, appeared to provide
a useful framework within which to derive meaning and integration
from the experience, both at the time and later. </p>

<p> The relationship and relative importance of psychological
preparation, setting, and drug were important questions raised by
our results. A meaningful religious preparation, expectation, and
environment appeared to be conducive to positive drug
experiences, although the precise qualitative and quantitative
role of each factor was not determined. For example, everything
possible was done to maximize suggestion, but suggestion alone
cannot account for the results, because of the different
experience of the control group. The hypothesis that
suggestibility was heightened by psilocybin could not be ruled
out on the basis of our experiment. An effort was made to avoid
suggesting the phenomena of the typology of mysticism, and the
service itself made no such direct suggestion. </p>

<h5>Implications for the Psychology of Religion </h5>

<p> The results of our experiment would indicate that psilocybin
(and LSD and mescaline, by analogy) are important tools for the
study of the mystical state of consciousness. Experiences
previously possible for only a small minority of people, and
difficult to study because of their unpredictability and rarity,
are now reproducible under suitable conditions. The mystical
experience has been called by many names suggestive of areas that
are paranormal and not usually considered easily available for
investigation (e.g., an experience of transcendence, ecstasy,
conversion, or cosmic consciousness); but this is a realm of
human experience that should not be rejected as outside the realm
of serious scientific study, especially if it can be shown that a
practical benefit can result. Our data would suggest that such an
overwhelming experience, in which a person existentially
encounters basic values such as the meaning of his life (past,
present, and future), deep and meaningful interpersonal
relationships, and insight into the possibility of personal
behavior change, can possibly be therapeutic if approached and
worked with in a sensitive and adequate way. </p>

<p> Possibilities for further research with these drugs in the
psychology of religion can be divided into two different kinds in
relation to the aim: (1) theoretical understanding of the
phenomena and psychology of mysticism, and (2) experimental
investigation of possible social application in a religious
context. </p>

<p> The first, or theoretical, kind of research would be to
approach the mystical state of consciousness as closely as
possible under controlled experimental conditions and to measure
the effect of variables such as the dose of the drug, the
preparation and personality of the subject, the setting of the
experiment, and the expectation of the experimenter. The work
described above was a first step in the measurement of these
variables, but more research is needed. The results should be
proved to be reproducible by the same and by different
experimenters under similar conditions. Such work could lead to a
better understanding of mysticism from physiological,
biochemical, psychological, and therapeutic perspectives. </p>

<p> Several experimental approaches can be envisioned for the
second kind of research---to determine the best method for useful
application in a religious context. One suggestion would be the
establishment of a research center where carefully controlled
drug experiments could be done by a trained research staff which
would consist of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and
professional religious personnel. Subjects, ideally, would spend
at least a week at the center to facilitate thorough screening,
preparation, and observation of their reactions, both during and
after drug experiments. Another suggestion would be the study of
the effect of mystical experience on small natural groups of from
four to six people who would meet periodically, both prior to and
after a drug experience, for serious personal and religious
discussion, study, and worship. The reactions of a varied range
of subjects with different interests could be studied, but
perhaps a good place to start would be with persons
professionally interested in religion, such as ministers,
priests, rabbis, theologians, and psychologists of religion. </p>

<p> Such research may have important implications for religion.
The universal and basic human experience that we have called
mystical is recorded from all cultures and ages of human history,
but mysticism has never been adequately studied and understood
from physiological, biochemical, sociological, psychological, and
theological perspectives. </p>

<p> Perhaps there is more of a biochemical basis to such
&quot;natural&quot; experiences than has been previously
supposed. Certainly many ascetics who have had mystical
experiences have engaged in such practices as breathing and
postural exercises, sleep deprivation, fasting, flagellation with
subsequent infection, sustained meditation, and sensory
deprivation in caves or monastic cells. All these techniques have
an effect on body chemistry. There is a definite interplay
between physiological and psychological processes in the human
being. Some of the indolic substances in the body do not differ
greatly from the psychedelic drugs. </p>

<p> Many persons concerned with religion are disturbed by
drug-facilitated mystical experiences because of their apparent
ease of production, with the implication that they are
&quot;unearned&quot; and therefore &quot;undeserved.&quot;
Perhaps the Puritan and Calvinistic element of our Western
culture---especially in the United States, where most of the
controversy about psychedelic drugs has centered---may be a
factor in this uneasiness. Although a drug experience might seem
unearned when compared with the rigorous discipline that many
mystics describe as necessary, our evidence has suggested that
careful preparation and expectation play an important part, not
only in the type of experience attained but in later fruits for
life. Positive mystical experience with psychedelic drugs is by
no means automatic. It would seem that the &quot;drug
effect&quot; is a delicate combination of psychological set and
setting in which the drug itself is the trigger or facilitating
agent---i.e., in which the drug is a <i>necessary</i> but not <i>sufficient</i>
condition. Perhaps the hardest &quot;work&quot; comes after the
experience, which in itself may only provide the motivation for
future efforts to integrate and appreciate what has been learned.
Unless such an experience is integrated into the ongoing life of
the individual, only a memory remains rather than the growth of
an unfolding renewal process which may be awakened by the
mystical experience. If the person has a religious framework and
discipline within which to work, the integrative process is
encouraged and stimulated. Many persons may not need the
drug-facilitated mystical experience, but there are others who
would never be aware of the undeveloped potentials within
themselves, or be inspired to work in this direction, without
such an experience. &quot;Gratuitous grace&quot; is an
appropriate theological term, because the psychedelic mystical
experience can lead to a profound sense of inspiration,
reverential awe, and humility, perhaps partially as a result of
the realization that the experience is a gift and not
particularly earned or deserved. </p>

<p> Mysticism and inner experience have been stressed much more
by Eastern religions than by Western. Perhaps Western culture is
as far off balance in the opposite direction---with its
manipulation of the external world, as exemplified by the
emphasis on material wealth, control of nature, and admiration of
science. Mysticism has been accused of fostering escapism from
the problems of society, indifference to social conditions, and
disinterest in social change. While the possibility of such
excesses must always be remembered, our study has suggested the
beneficial potential of mystical experience in stimulating the
ability to feel and experience deeply and genuinely with the full
harmony of both emotion and intellect. Such wholeness may have
been neglected in modern Western society. </p>

<p> The participants in our experiment who were given psilocybin
found the religious service more meaningful, both at the time and
later, than did the control subjects. This finding raises the
possibility that psychedelic drug experiences in a religious
setting may be able to illuminate the dynamics and significance
of worship. Increased understanding of the psychological
mechanism involved might lead to more-meaningful worship
experiences for those who have not had the drug experience. The
analogy with the efficacy of the sacraments is one example of
what would have to be considered for a better psychological
understanding of what goes on during worship. Such considerations
raise the question of the place of the emotional factor, compared
to the cognitive, in religious worship. An even more basic
question is the validity of religious experience of the mystical
type in terms of religious truth. Reactions to such religious
implications will vary with theological position and
presuppositions, but one value of our study can be to stimulate
thoughtful examination of the problems. </p>

<p> Although our experimental results indicated predominantly
positive and beneficial subjective effects, possible dangers must
not be underestimated and should be thoroughly evaluated by
specific research designed to discover the causes and methods of
prevention of physical or psychological harm, both short-term and
long-term. While physiological addiction has not been reported
with psychedelic substances, psychological dependence might be
expected if the experience were continually repeated. The intense
subjective pleasure and enjoyment of the experience for its own
sake could lead to escapism and withdrawal from the world. An
experience which is capable of changing motivation and values
might cut the nerve of achievement. Widespread apathy toward
productive work and accomplishment could cripple a society.
Another possible danger might be suicide or prolonged psychosis
in very unstable or depressed individuals who are not ready for
the intense emotional discharge. If it can be determined that any
of these forms of harm occur in certain types of individuals,
research could be directed toward the development of pretest
methods to screen out such persons. Our evidence would suggest
that research on conditions and methods of administration of the
drugs might minimize the chance of harmful reactions. Spectacular
immediate advance must be sacrificed for ultimate progress by
careful, yet daring and imaginative, research under adequate
medical supervision. </p>

<p> The ethical implications also cannot be ignored. Any research
that uses human volunteers must examine its motives and methods
to make certain that human beings are not being manipulated like
objects for purposes they do not understand or share. But in
research with powerful mental chemicals that may influence the
most cherished human functions and values, the ethical problem is
even more acute. The mystical experience, historically, has
filled man with wondrous awe and has been able to change his
style of life and values; but it must not be assumed that greater
control of such powerful phenomena will automatically result in
wise and constructive use. Potential abuse is just as likely.
Those who undertake such research carry a heavy responsibility. </p>

<p> This is not to say that research should be stopped because of
the fear of these various risks in an extremely complex and
challenging area that has great promise for the psychology of
religion. But while research is progressing on the theoretical or
primary level and before projects for testing useful social
applications in a religious context become widespread, serious
and thoughtful examination of the sociological, ethical, and
theological implications is needed without delay. </p>

<p> Not the least of these implications is the fear that research
that probes the psyche of man and involves his spiritual values
may be a sacrilegious transgression by science. If the
exploration of certain phenomena should be prohibited, should the
mystical experiences made possible by psychedelic drugs be one of
the taboo areas? Such restrictions raise several relevant
questions: Who is wise enough to decide in advance that such
research will cause more harm than good? If such restrictions are
applied, where will they end, and will they not impede knowledge
of unforeseen possibilities? This attitude on the part of
religion is not new. Galileo and Servetus encountered it hundreds
of years ago. The issue should not be whether or not to undertake
such research, but rather how to do so in a way that sensitively
takes into consideration the contribution, significance, and
values of religion. A better scientific understanding of the
mechanisms and application of mysticism has the potential for a
greater appreciation and respect for heretofore rarely explored
areas of human consciousness. If these areas have relevance for
man's spiritual life, this should be a cause for rejoicing, not
alarm. If the values nurtured by religion are fundamental for an
understanding of the nature of man, then careful and sensitive
scientific research into the experiential side of man's existence
has the potential for illumination of these values. The
importance of such research should be emphasized, especially
because of its possible significance for religion and theology. </p>

<p> At present we are a long way from legitimate social use of
such drugs in our society. We do not yet have nearly enough
adequate knowledge of the long- term physiological or
psychological effects. It is true that thus far no organ or
tissue damage has been reported in the usual dosage range, and
physiological addiction has not occurred. But as in the case of
any new drug, deleterious side effects sometimes do not become
apparent until years after a drug has been introduced. The social
suffering caused by the misuse of alcohol is a major public
health problem throughout the Western world. We certainly need to
hesitate before introducing a new agent, much more powerful than
alcohol and perhaps with a potential for the development of
subtle psychological dependence. And yet, paradoxically, these
very drugs may hold a promise for the treatment of chronic
alcoholism by way of the psychedelic mystical experience
(Kurland, Unger, and Shaffer, 1957; Unger et. al., 1966; Unger,
1965). Such questions can be satisfactorily answered only by
thorough scientific research of the possibilities and by sober
evaluation of the results. </p>

<p> Many unknown conscious and unconscious factors operate in the
mystical experience. Much investigation is needed in this area,
and drugs like psilocybin can be a powerful tool. Experimental
facilitation of mystical experiences under controlled conditions
can be an important method of approach to a better understanding
of mysticism. Better understanding can lead to appreciation of
the role and place of such experiences in the history and
practice of religion. </p>

<p> If parapsychology is concerned in an interdisciplinary way
with the question of the potentials of human experience, then the
controlled exploration of experimental mysticism, facilitated by
psychedelic drugs, is an important parapsychological research
area, where psychopharmacology, psychiatry, psychology, and
theology can meet to mutual advantage. </p>

<H2>LSD and Religious Experience</H2>
<H4>BY WALTER N. PAHNKE</H4>
A paper presented to a public symposium<BR>at Wesleyan University, March 1967.<BR>
From <I>LSD, Man &amp; Society</I><BR>Richard C. DeBold and Russell C. Leaf, editors<BR>
&copy;Wesleyan University Press, Middletown, Connecticut, 1967<P>

</CENTER><HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THE relationship between LSD and religious experience is an issue
that is quite complex and needs careful analysis to avoid a loose
and uncritical association. It would be misleading to assume that
the experiences are automatically identical.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
LSD-type drugs have been called by many names. In the early 1950's
the term <I>psychotomimetic</I>, <I>i.e.</I>, psychosis-mimicking,
was generally used; but this rather negatively loaded term was
seen by some as being too narrow and limiting to accommodate the
wide range of experiences being reported and observed. In 1957
Dr. Humphry Osmond (Osmond, 1957) proposed the term <I>psychedelic,
i.e.,</I> mind-opening or mind-manifesting, to encompass the full
range of positive and negative experiences that he had seen in
his work with such drugs. Psychedelic will be the term used in
this paper to refer to the unique class of LSD-type drugs.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In this discussion a survey will first be made of the various
kinds of psychedelic experiences with an especial examination
of the mystical type, and possible reasons for this variety will
be mentioned. Then we shall look at some of the evidence that
psychedelic mystical experiences occur at all and discuss whether
or not they can be considered &quot;religious.&quot; The LSD churches
that have grown out of the evangelistic enthusiasm associated
with LSD will also be examined along with their possible impact
on individuals and society. Finally, the future prospects for
the investigation and use of psychedelic drugs will be discussed.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Psychedelic experiences can be divided into five types: psychotic,
psychodynamic, cognitive, aesthetic and psychedelic peak or mystical.
These have been described elsewhere (Pahnke and Richards, 1966),
and a brief description of each will suffice.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The <I>psychotic</I> experience is described as very intense,
negative, dysphoric and hellish by those who have been through
it. Characteristic elements include fear to the point of panic,
paranoid distrust, delusions of suspicion or grandeur, toxic confusion,
impairment of abstract reasoning, remorse, depression, isolation
and/ or somatic discomfort, all of which can be of monumental
proportions. These words can perhaps be better illuminated by
the following description written by a well-prepared subject who
took LSD under medical supervision:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Time itself seemed to have frozen. I was sick way down inside.
I had lost trust in the doctor and the judgment of part of my
own mind. The terrible thing was that I was going insane and the
normal part of my mind knew this was taking place. I was two people
in the same body. The one with the insane mind was pulling the
one with the sane mind over on his side. I think I was 95% insane.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then things became even more confused and frightening. It seemed
as if I had three minds, two that were insane and one perfectly
normal. In other words, I was having the experience of having
a front row seat watching myself who was insane.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Faces now looked distorted, eyes were of a cruel expression, and
they seemed to have the power of looking through me and my very
thoughts. The least amount of noise sounded one hundred times
louder. Everything I heard was driving me into a living hell.
The doctor looked like the devil to me. He had tricked me.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I didn't think either of us was sane now. As a matter of fact,
I thought everyone was inhuman, and I would go through life in
this situation and this would go on forever. There never even
existed something as wonderful as death that could get me&#151;body
and mind&#151;out of this horrible, unnatural life (Unger, 1964).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This account illustrates especially well the feeling of many people
at some time during an LSD session that something has gone wrong
and that they never will be the same again. Such feelings only
increase the panic and hopelessness. Adequate preparation and
skilled handling, however, do make a crucial difference in the
outcome of most cases. In this particular instance, the patient
was guided through an extremely frightening and unpleasant part
of his experience to a very positive and helpful climax. Unfortunately,
such a happy ending is quite uncertain in uncontrolled settings.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The second type of experience is the <I>psychodynamic</I>, in
which material that had previously been unconscious or preconscious
becomes vividly conscious. We see abreaction and catharsis in
the reliving of traumatic incidents from the past or in the experiencing
of symbolic material. The use of LSD in Europe employs what has
been termed the psycholytic method, which emphasizes the uncovering
of psychodynamic material. Suggestion certainly plays a role,
because the patients of Freudian therapists produce incidents
from the stages of psychosexual development, whereas archetypal
symbols are often encountered by patients of Jungian therapists.
Essential to this method, however, is the support and guidance
of a skilled therapist, both while the patient is having the experience
and while he is between drug sessions. A detailed description
of the psycholytic method has now been published in the papers
presented at an international LSD conference in 1965 (Abramson,
1967). 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The third type of experience, the <I>cognitive</I>, is characterized
by astonishingly lucid thought. The mind seems subjectively to
be able to view things from a new perspective and to see the interrelationships
of many levels or dimensions all at once. Such experiences usually
occur when the drug effects are waning. The very existence of
such states of mind led people to speculate that creativity research
might be aided with psychedelic drugs. Harman and his co-workers
(Harman, McKim, Mogar, Fadiman and Stolaroff, 1966) have already
published a pilot study in which twenty-seven professionally employed
males underwent a single moderate-dose psychedelic session in
a small group setting. Each subject had a particular problem on
which he could not obtain closure and hoped to gain some new perspective
through the psychedelic experience. The setting was structured
so that expectation was maximized, and the sessions were run with
a minimum of interruption. The results in terms of problems actually
solved were promising (9 out of 44 attempted problems yielded
practical solutions), but not conclusive because of the lack of
a control group. Certainly this is an area that merits further
investigation.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fourth type of experience is the <I>aesthetic</I>. Perhaps
the reported increase in all sensory modalities is what attracts
some people to take LSD for &quot;kicks.&quot; These reports do
not exaggerate. Fascinating changes in sensation and perception
do occur: synaesthesia in which sounds can be &quot;seen;&quot;
objects such as flowers or stones that appear to pulsate and become
&quot;alive;&quot; ordinary things that seem imbued with great
beauty; music that takes on an incredible emotional power; and
visions of beautiful colors, intricate geometrical patterns, architectural
forms, landscapes or almost anything imaginable.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fifth type of experience is the focus of interest in this
presentation and has been called by various names: <I>psychedelic
peak, transcendental or mystical</I>. For the sake of this discussion
we shall refer to it as the psychedelic mystical or experimental
mystical experience. Its psychological characteristics have been
described elsewhere (Pahnke, in unpublished thesis) and will be
only briefly summarized here.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
These characteristics, nine in number, were derived from a study
of the literature of spontaneous mystical experiences reported
throughout world history from almost all cultures and religions.
In studying accounts of these strange, unusual experiences, an
attempt was made to extract the universal psychological characteristics
as free from interpretation as possible. Scientific evidence indicates
that these universal characteristics derived from spontaneous
mystical experiences also precisely describe experimental psychedelic
ones. The nine characteristics can be listed as follows:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
1. <I>Unity</I> is a sense of cosmic oneness achieved through
positive ego-transcendence. Although the usual sense of identity
or ego fades away, consciousness and memory are not lost; instead,
the person becomes very much aware of being part of a dimension
much vaster and greater than himself. In addition to the route
of the &quot;inner world&quot; where all external sense impressions
are left behind, unity can also be experienced through the external
world, so that a person reports that he feels a part of everything
that is (e.g., objects, other people, nature or the universe),
or, more simply, that &quot;all is one.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
2. <I>Transcendence</I> <I>of time and space</I> means that the
subject feels beyond past, present and future and beyond ordinary
three-dimensional space in a realm of eternity or infinity.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
3. <I>Deeply felt positive mood</I> contains the elements of joy,
blessedness, peace and love to an overwhelming degree of intensity,
often accompanied by tears.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
4. <I>Sense of sacredness</I> is a non-rational, intuitive, hushed,
palpitant response of awe and wonder in the presence of inspiring
realities. The main elements are awe, humility and reverence,
but the terms of traditional theology or religion need not necessarily
be used in the description.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
5. <I>The noetic quality</I>, as named by William James, is a
feeling of insight or illumination that is felt on an intuitive,
non-rational level and has a tremendous force of certainty and
reality. This knowledge is not an increase in facts, but is a
gain of insight about such things as philosophy of life or sense
of values.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
6. <I>Paradoxicality</I> refers to the logical contradictions
that become apparent if descriptions are strictly analyzed. A
person may realize that he is experiencing, for example, an &quot;identity
of opposites,&quot; yet it seems to make sense at the time, and
even afterwards.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
7. <I>Alleged ineffability</I> means that the experience is felt
to be beyond words, non-verbal, impossible to describe, yet most
persons who insist on the ineffability do in fact make elaborate
attempts to communicate the experience.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
8. <I>Transiency</I> means that the psychedelic peak does not
last in its full intensity, but instead passes into an afterglow
and remains as a memory.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
9. <I>Persisting</I> positive changes in attitudes and behavior
are toward self, others, life and the experience itself.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The reasons for the great variety of psychedelic experiences (characterized
here under five headings) have provided a fascinating research
problem and are now generally recognized to be caused by dosage
and the extra-drug variables of set and setting. Of course, most
sessions do not contain just one kind of experience. In fact it
is not uncommon for all five types to be present in a single psychedelic
experience, though in varying proportions.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Dosage appears to be a crucial variable. Each individual has his
own range of tolerance and response to any drug, and no absolute
figures can be quoted. In the low dose range, for most people,
below 200 mcg of LSD, the probability is great for the emergence
of aesthetic, cognitive and psychodynamic experience. At somewhere
between 200 mcg and 400 mcg of LSD, there appears to be a critical
level beyond which psychedelic mystical experience becomes possible,
which can be compared to the minimal amount of thrust needed for
a rocket to launch itself into orbit. Psychotic experiences are
possible at any dosage level, but are much more probable at the
higher doses.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The presence of the drug at a certain dosage is a necessary but
not sufficient condition, because the extra-drug variables of
set and setting play a crucial role in determining the kind of
drug response. Psychological set is here defined as factors within
the subject, such as personality, life history, expectation, preparation,
mood prior to the session and, perhaps most important of all,
the ability to trust, to let go, to be open to whatever comes.
The setting is here defined as factors outside the individual,
such as the physical environment in which the drug is taken, the
psychological and emotional atmosphere to which the subject is
exposed, how he is treated by those around him and what the experimenter
expects the drug reaction to be. A person who has taken a psychedelic
drug seems to be much more sensitive to non-verbal cues, perhaps
because of an increase in suggestibility, but the exact role of
suggestibility is a problem that needs to be further investigated.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It seems clear that the drug is only a trigger, a catalyst or
facilitating agent. The kind of psychedelic reaction is largely
dependent upon extra-drug variables. Also, at the present state
of knowledge, the exact content is impossible to predict with
certainty. Psychotic reactions are the easiest to produce; mystical
experiences are the hardest, certainly not automatic, even under
optimal conditions. Much more needs to be learned.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
We turn now to an examination of the evidence that psychedelic
mystical experiences actually occur. Most researchers who have
worked with LSD in either a therapeutic or a supportive setting
have reported the occurrence of mystical experiences in varying
degrees of frequency. Some workers, especially most of the European
psycholytic therapists, have not been very much interested in
such experiences and, in fact, have tried to discourage their
occurrence as an unwanted distraction. The frequency with that
kind of set and setting is much less, but, even so, these experiences
are still reported. As time has gone on, some of the European
psychiatrists who have heard about the work done in Canada and
the United States have become more interested (Arendsen-Hein,
1967; Johnsen, 1967).
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Dr. Arnold Ludwig, of the Mendota State Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin,
has purposely programmed his LSD sessions to focus on psychodynamic
issues and has definitely not encouraged mystical experiences,
as he has informed me personally. Interestingly enough, this kind
of experience has occurred anyway in some patients, who then often
sought out the hospital chaplain for discussions of religious
issues.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Houston and Masters (Masters and Houston, 1966) report a series
of 206 subjects with whom they have worked, but of whom little
more than 3% were considered to have had true mystical experiences.
Such figures need to be interpreted cautiously unless a careful
definition with some kind of method for quantifying the experience
is established.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A questionnaire has been developed that is based on the nine characteristics
of spontaneous mystical experiences outlined above (Pahnke, in
unpublished thesis). For any subject the percentage of the maximum
possible score for each category can be determined. Varying degrees
of completeness are possible, but to be counted as a mystical
experience it was decided that both the total score and the score
in each separate category must be at least 60% to 70%. This questionnaire
has been used in two studies that I have conducted.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The first was carried out on Good Friday in 1962 to test the hypothesis
that persons who were given psilocybin would have experiences
similar to those reported by spontaneous mystics. Twenty theological
students from relatively similar religious and socio-economic
backgrounds, after medical and psychiatric screening, were carefully
prepared in groups of four with two leaders for each group. All
thirty participants listened over loud-speakers to a meditative
Good Friday service in a private basement chapel while the actual
service was in progress in the church above. The experiment was
so designed that half of the subjects received 30 mg of psilocybin
and the rest, who became the control group, got as an active placebo
200 mg of nicotinic acid, which causes no psychic effects, only
warmth and tingling of the skin. From our preparation all the
subjects knew that psilocybin caused autonomic changes. Those
who got nicotinic acid thought that they had received psilocybin,
and suggestion was thus maximized for the control group. The drugs
were administered double-blind, so that neither the experimenter
nor the participants knew the specific contents of any capsule.
Data were collected by tape recording, written account, the mystical-experience
questionnaire and personal interview. When all the data were analyzed,
the scores of psilocybin subjects were higher to a statistically
significant degree in all categories than those of the control
subjects. In regard to degree of completeness, only three or four
of the ten psilocybin subjects reached the 60% to 70% level of
completeness, whereas none of the control subjects did.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The second series of experiments was performed at the Massachusetts
Mental Health Center during 1965 and 1966, an account of which
is now being prepared. Forty carefully screened normal volunteers
were selected. Most of the subjects were over thirty and held
responsible positions in the community as professional people.
The sensational publicity about LSD in the popular press added
difficulties to our recruitment. We rejected more than 50% of
our volunteers on the basis of medical and psychiatric history,
physical examination, psychological testing and psychiatric interview.
After three hours of preparation, psilocybin was administered
to four subjects at a time in a carefully prepared room with cut
flowers, pictures of nature scenes, candlelight and a place for
each subject to recline and relax. Silence was maintained during
a six-hour program of classical music. The setting was supportive,
and there were no interruptions for testing during the session.
We encouraged the subjects to relax and to let the music carry
them. At the present time, the data are not completely analyzed,
and all that can be reported are some preliminary impressions.
First, the procedure seemed safe for carefully screened normals.
No one suffered physical or psychological harm even after a one
year follow-up. Second, 20% to 40% of the subjects had a mystical
experience, depending on the level of completeness desired. Third,
95% of the subjects said that they would be willing to take the
drug again, perhaps sometime in the future, but not too many were
eager to do so right away. Having had such powerful experiences,
they expressed a desire for time to integrate what had been learned.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In comparison to the 3% of mystical experiences reported by Houston
and Masters, and the 20% to 40% in our two studies, some 75% of
over 100 patients from the alcoholism project at the Spring Grove
State Hospital in Baltimore have had intense mystical experiences
during their first session with LSD. It should be remembered that
of these patients each had between twelve and twenty hours of
individual therapy before his session, which was run individually.
In our sessions we had only three hours of preparations, and the
sessions were run in groups of four. Individual monitoring seems
to help guide someone toward a positive experience. At Spring
Grove everything is done to ensure optimal conditions (Kurland,
Unger, Shaffer and Savage, 1967). An important consideration is
whether or not such mystical experiences are religious. A simple
identification of religious experience with mystical experience
fails to take into account the many definitions of religion. Religions
vary in their emphasis upon mysticism, although there is a tendency
to make the mystical element the most important characteristic
of religion, especially among psychologists of religion who have
been interested in the dramatic phenomena of the mystical experience.
William James reflected this attitude by his preference for religion
that is an &quot;acute fever&quot; rather than a &quot;dull habit.&quot;
Not all religious experience is necessarily mystical in the sense
of our definition of mystical experience given below. Pratt, for
example, divides religion into four kinds or aspects, of which
the mystical is only one, the other three being the traditional,
the rational and the practical or moral (Pratt, 1921). Even when
quite emotionally meaningful, participation in a particular religion
by observing religious laws, through intellectual belief in a
certain creed or theology or in institutional membership and attendance
at rites and rituals may not result in or be the product of mystical
experience.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
On the other hand, all mystical experience is not necessarily
religious. Again much depends upon how one chooses to define religion.
If one makes the concept of a &quot;personal God&quot; central
to the definition of religion, many forms of mystical experience
could not be considered religious. The phenomena of mystical experience
may occur outside the framework of any formal religion with no
reference to an articulated theology.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The problem is by-passed or merely indicated, rather than solved,
by broadening the definition of religion to include any experience
that would qualify as mystical by our criteria. Tillich, for example,
considers an experience religious when it gives ultimate meaning,
structure and direction to human experience, or when one is concerned
&quot;ultimately&quot; (Tillich, 1951). Better, perhaps, is Huston
Smith's definition in an unpublished address. He has defined as
a religious experience one that elicits from the experiencer a
centered response from the core of his being. Since his being
includes feelings, thoughts and will, a religious experience triggers
in the experiencer a triple movement&#151;a movement of the emotions
in awe, of the mind in belief and of the will in obedience. Here
we return to the important ninth characteristic of mystical experience.
What changes are there in the person's life? What does he do about
it in terms of some religious discipline? If we accept Smith's
definition of religious experience and compare it with the nine
characteristics, we can perhaps say that such a psychological
definition of mystical experience has at least something religious
about it. Whether or not mystical experience is religious depends
upon one's definition of religion.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Rather than labor the point, the following examples of actual
experimental mystical experiences may help the reader to decide
whether such experiences would fit his personal definition of
religion. The first is the experience of a Christian ministerial
student who took a compound from the psilocybin series in a carefully
controlled experiment that was conducted in a German research
institute under the supervision of an experimenter who was not
particularly interested in mystical experiences.
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
I hesitate to attempt a summary of my drug experience as I am
acutely aware of the inability of linguistic symbols to contain,
or even accurately reflect, the dynamics of 'mystic' consciousness.
In the words of the Russian poet Tyutchev, I feel as though 'A
thought that's spoken is a lie'. To seek to condense any of my
experiences into words is to distort them, rendering them finite
and impure. In so acknowledging the profound ineffability of my
experience, I am not trying to write poetry&#151; although in the
final analysis this may well be the only possible means of verbal
expression&#151;but intend only to convey the feelings of frustration
and futility with which I begin this report.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;Now, four days after the experience itself, I continue to feel
a deep sense of awe and reverence, being simultaneously intoxicated
with an ecstatic joy. This euphoric feeling . . . includes elements
of profound peace and steadfastness, surging like a spring from
a depth of my being which has rarely, if ever, been tapped prior
to the drug experience. The spasmodic nature of my prayer life
has ceased, and I have yielded to a need to spend time each day
in meditation which, though essentially open and wordless, is
impregnated by feelings of thanksgiving and trust. This increased
need to be alone is balanced by what I believe to be a greater
sensitivity to the authentic problems of others and a corresponding
willingness to enter freely into genuine friendships. I possess
a renewed and increased sense of personal integration and am more
content simply to 'be myself' than previously.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
. . . Relatively soon after receiving the drug, I transcended
my usual level of consciousness and became aware of fantastic
dimensions of being, all of which possessed a profound sense of
reality.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
. . . It would seem more accurate to say that I existed 'in' these
dimensions of being as I had not only transcended my ego, but
also the dichotomy between subject and object.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is meaningful to say that I ceased to exist, becoming immersed
in the ground of Being, in Brahman, in God, in 'Nothingness,'
in Ultimate Reality or in some similar religious symbol for Oneness....
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The feelings I experienced could best be described as cosmic tenderness,
infinite love, penetrating peace, eternal blessing and unconditional
acceptance on one hand, and on the other, as unspeakable awe,
overflowing joy, primeval humility, inexpressible gratitude and
boundless devotion. Yet all of these words are hopelessly inadequate
and can do little more than meekly point towards the genuine,
inexpressible feelings actually experienced.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is misleading even to use the words 'I experienced,' since
during the peak of the experience (which must have lasted at least
an hour) there was no duality between myself and what I experienced.
Rather, I was these feelings, or ceased to be in them and felt
no loss at the cessation. This was especially evident when, after
having reached the mystic peak, a recording of Bach's 'Fantasia
and Fugue in G Minor' was played. At this time it seemed as though
I was not M. R. listening to a recording, but paradoxically was
the music itself. Especially at one climax in the Fantasia, the
'love' I was experiencing became so overwhelming as to become
unbearable or even painful. The tears I shed at this moment were
in no sense those of fear, but ones of uncontainable joy.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
. . . During the height of the experience, I had no consciousness
of time or space in the ordinary sense. I felt as though I was
beyond seconds, minutes, hours, and also beyond past, present,
and future. In religious language, I was in 'eternity
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
. . . Let me affirm that even with my acquaintance with mystic
literature of both east and west, coupled with the profound appreciation
of natural and artistic beauty I have always enjoyed, I know I
could never have understood this experience, had I not lived it
myself. The dimensions of being I entered surpassed the wildest
fantasies of my imagination and, as I have said, leave me with
a profound sense of awe.... In no sense have I an urge to formulate
philosophical or theological dogmas about my experience. Only
my silence can retain its purity and genuineness.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It may be objected that a divinity student would obviously have
such an experience because of his familiarity with mysticism and
religious language. In the Good Friday experiment, however, the
control subjects with the same amount of suggestion did not have
mystical experiences. Also the next several examples were written
by chronic, hospitalized alcoholics who had received LSD treatment
and who did not have the same interest in religion and mysticism.
The accounts are perhaps even more vivid in their simple straightforwardness.
Following are excerpts of accounts from four different patients
(Unger, 1965).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I found myself drifting into another world and saw that I was
at the bottom of a set of stairs. At the very top of these stairs
was a gleaming light like a star or jewel of exceptional brilliance.
I ascended these stairs and upon reaching the top, I saw a gleaming,
blinding light with a brilliance no man has ever known. It had
no shape nor form, but I knew that I was looking at God himself.
The magnificence, splendor, and grandeur of this experience cannot
be put into words. Neither can my innermost feelings, but it shall
remain in my heart, soul, and mind forever. I never felt so clean
inside in all my life. All the trash and garbage seemed to be
washed out of my mind. In my heart, my mind, my soul, and my body,
it seemed as if I were born all over again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A feeling of great peace and contentment seemed to flow through
my entire body. All sounds ceased and I seemed to be floating
in a great, very very still void or hemisphere. It is impossible
to describe the overpowering feeling of peace, contentment, and
being a part of goodness itself that I felt. I could feel my body
dissolving and actually becoming a part of the goodness and peace
that was all around me. Words can't describe this. I feel an awe
and wonder that such a feeling could have occurred to me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the peak or climax of my experience, I realized a great scene
was about to unfold within myself. I actually shook and shuddered
at what I felt. A tremendous earthquake feeling was building up
in me. There was a tremendous force, and I came and saw a glorious
beauty of space unfold before me, of light, color, and of song
and music, and not only of one thing good and beautiful, but of
a oneness in fellowship, a wanting to belong to this greatness
of beauty and goodness that unfolded before my eyes, and that
I felt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Suddenly, I could see my family handing me great love. It seemed
to be pouring out of their hearts. I cried, not bitter tears,
but tears of beauty and joy. A beautiful organ was playing in
the background, and it seemed as if angels were singing. All of
a sudden I was back in eternity. There was music and beauty. Peace
and happiness, tranquillity&#151;could not possibly describe my feelings.
My heart was filled with joy that was overwhelming. Just a beauty
and peace that I have never known. At this point, I felt that
time was thousands of years ago, thousands of years from now,
and now.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The profound emotional impact that these experiences have on people
can be sensed. The promising possibility that such positive experiences
may have therapeutic value is one implication. Another is the
usefulness of such a tool for investigating profound mystical
experiences that heretofore have been hard to study scientifically
because of their rarity.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The basic psychological experience goes beyond any particular
framework, but does lend itself to many possible interpretations
afterwards, since the rational mind inevitably goes to work and
tries to understand. For example, the mystical experience of union
or fusion with its concomitant characteristics has been interpreted
in many ways: fading or melting into the universal pool, boundless
being, the void, <I>satori</I>, <I>nirvana</I>, <I>samadhi</I>,
the <I>atman-Brahman</I> identity; the awareness of a &quot;Beyond,&quot;
&quot;More&quot; or pure &quot;Self;&quot; or union with God.
Yet in spite of the particular interpretation, the psychological
experience itself is the basis.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This experience of encounter with what is felt to be a divine
dimension deep within a person is not new. It has been reported
throughout the centuries in the history of man's spiritual quest.
It should be remembered that there are psychotic states of mind
in which people also speak in religious metaphors, such as, of
meeting God or of being God. The similarities and differences
between psychosis and mysticism form an interesting area that
needs much more serious study and analysis, for the answers are
by no means worked out as yet.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
One objection sometimes raised against calling these drug-facilitated
experiences mystical or religious is that the accomplishment of
something usually considered so rare and unattainable except by
extraordinary effort or great merit now seems too easy. What seems
like a short-cut causes a feeling of uneasiness. Perhaps the Puritan
ethic, so pervasive in our culture, is the psychological explanation.
Pleasure is supposed to be earned through hard work and painful
struggle.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Indications are, however, that what one <I>does</I> with a psychedelic
experience may be more important than merely <I>having</I> it.
Without integration into the on-going life of the individual,
the experience may be only an irrelevant memory, no matter how
beautiful. Much work is needed to integrate the insights from
LSD when used as a part of psychotherapy. The analogy might be
drawn of a trip to a new country. If the traveler knew nothing
about the history and culture of this country, he might have an
interesting trip, but only a fast-fading memory would remain.
If, on the other hand, before he departed, he learned as much
as possible about the country, its language and customs, talked
with people who had been there before him and prepared himself
fully, he would probably not only enjoy the experience more, but
could utilize it to enrich his life afterwards by thinking, reading
and talking about it with others who had made such an experience
an integral part of their lives.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At the present time there is a growing ferment of excitement and
alarm caused by the religious movement that has been inspired
by psychedelic drugs. Already there are four major psychedelic
churches, which have been founded by persons who are convinced
that their psychedelic experiences have religious implications.
These four churches are The League for Spiritual Discovery, The
Neo-American Church, The Native American Church and The Church
of the Awakening.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The League for Spiritual Discovery, or L.S.D., is the most recent,
having been founded by Timothy Leary in September of 1966, and
it already claims from three hundred to five hundred members.
The psychedelic celebrations that have been performed in some
major cities throughout the country have received considerable
publicity. These &quot;light shows&quot; have attempted to portray
some psychedelic phenomena, but people who have actually had an
LSD experience seem to agree that only a crude facsimile is produced.
Leary has used these occasions to give psychedelic sermons about
his church. The central message has been summarized as &quot;Turn
on, tune in and drop out.&quot; In essence, the message is of
withdrawal, but not from everything, not from all social life,
with nothing in its place. The withdrawal is from the meaningless
games in which we are involved, to allow full-time commitment
to spiritual exploration, which Leary feels is the most important
reason for living. An attempt is made to criticize modern American
culture.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Neo-American Church was founded in 1964 by a psychologist,
Arthur Kleps, who calls himself Chief Boo-Hoo, the Patriarch of
the East. Kleps states that the purpose of this title is to remind
him not to take himself too seriously. Membership now allegedly
numbers over six hundred. LSD is their sacrament, and one of their
main beliefs is that alteration of consciousness with LSD is a
religious right of any citizen.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Neo-American Church should not be confused with the Native
American Church, which has deep historical roots going back to
the religious practices of the Aztecs in Mexico before the time
of Christ. When the Spaniards came, they tried to stamp out the
use of peyote, but the custom persisted underground. Sometime
between 1700 and 1880, the religious use of peyote spread across
the Rio Grande River into the southwestern United States and from
there to the Plains and then all the way into Canada and as far
east as Wisconsin and Michigan. The church has been legally incorporated
in Oklahoma since 1918. At present membership has been estimated
at anywhere from 50,000 to 250,000 Indians, with only a few white
members. Peyote is used in a religious ceremony as their sacrament,
which they feel is essential to their church.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Some important features of the ceremony are constant among different
groups. The rite is an all-night affair extending from about 8:00
p.m. on Saturday until about 8:00 a.m. on Sunday. It usually takes
place around a central fire in a teepee and is led by four or
five Indian officials. The ritual begins with prayer, followed
by the singing of songs by each participant in turn accompanied
by the water drum, ingestion of the sacramental peyote and contemplation.
Although the contents of the individual prayers and songs are
spontaneous, the ritual as a whole follows a definite pattern.
At midnight there is a water-drinking ceremony, and at dawn parched
corn in sweetened water, fruit and dried sweetened meat are eaten.
[For a detailed description of the ritual with diagrams of the
arrangement of participants, see Omar C. Stewart's <I>Washo-Northern
Paiute Peyotism</I>, Volume XL, Number 3 of the Publications in
American Archaeology &amp; Ethnology of the University of California
(1944); and compare to Weston La Barre's <I>The Peyote Cult</I>,
Number 19 of Yale University Publications in Anthropology, an
enlarged edition of which was published in 1964 by The Shoe String
Press of Hamden, Connecticut.].
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Because the ceremony is regarded as very sacred by the Indians,
preparation for the rite is taken seriously. Proper preparation
includes being physically clean, spiritually pure, psychologically
humble and in a mood for concentrated meditation (Slotkin, 1956).
The participants feel that peyote aids contemplation by increasing
their powers of introspection, sensitizing their consciences and
producing visions of great meaning. Throughout the ceremony the
participants conduct themselves with due solemnity. White men
who have attended these worship services as observers or as participants
have taken peyote with the Indians in a receptive manner and have
been impressed by the serious and sacred nature of the ceremony
(Osmond, 1961; Schultes, 1963; Slotkin, 1961).
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Church of the Awakening was founded in 1958 by two married
physicians, John and Louisa Aiken from New Mexico. The church
has grown slowly but steadily and has at present about 350 members.
Only people who have demonstrated a serious interest in spiritual
awakening have been encouraged to join. The members claim that
their spiritual lives have been deepened because of participation
in psychedelic ceremonies using their sacrament peyote. The use
of the sacrament is restricted to once every three months, if
even that often. The major emphasis seems to be on integration
of spiritual insights into the on-going life of the individual
member.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There are certain legal problems posed by the existence of psychedelic
churches. Both natural products, like peyote, cactus buttons,
mushrooms or morning glory seeds, and synthetic chemicals, like
LSD, psilocybin or mescaline, are considered drugs by the law
when taken into the human body and thus requiring medical supervision.
Because this is the way our society has defined things, there
is really no legal mechanism or social sanction for a church to
use these substances for spiritual exploration. Unwillingness
to accommodate to this fact has caused legal difficulties for
Timothy Leary, Arthur Kleps and some of their followers. But the
issue becomes clouded because the religious use of peyote in the
Native American Church has been permitted by the Food and Drug
Administration and by the Supreme Court of California. The matter
becomes even more complex when Dr. John Aiken, a licensed physician,
seeks to administer peyote for what he considers <I>bona fide</I>
religious purposes. If he is not allowed to do so, and the Indians
are, does this constitute discrimination against white people?
Undoubtedly, religious freedom and related issues will receive
much publicity in the years ahead as test cases reach the courts.
If the matter is decided by outlawing all religious use of psychedelic
substances, even by the Native American Church, it may turn into
another sorry example of the white man's disregarding the sensitivities
and cultural heritage of the American Indian.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the meantime there is an increasing need for organized religion
to consider the impact of the psychedelic religious movement.
If instead of the collapse of a fad, as some predict, there is
continued interest, growth and enthusiasm, what might be the effect
on religion in America? Persons having had powerful psychedelic
mystical experiences may well feel that organized religion, in
contrast, is moribund and irrelevant to their needs. Such a trend
could be perceived as a threat, and the churches might feel a
need to encourage suppression of psychedelic drugs. On the other
hand, it can be speculated that with an imaginative and creative
approach to an increasing amount of mystical experience, revitalization
of religious life in the churches could occur. The churches could
help people to integrate such profound experiences with the aid
of meaningful and appropriate religious symbols. Such people do
tend to talk about their drug experiences in religious terms.
In our experimental work with divinity students and ministers,
those who had a meaningful religious framework were much helped
in using positive psychedelic experiences to understand their
faith more existentially.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Some definite dangers, however, are posed by the growing use,
religious and otherwise, of psychedelic drugs. The possible dangers
to the individual have been fully discussed at this conference.
It should be emphasized that unsupervised and unskilled use will
inevitably lead to psychiatric casualties in a certain, as yet
unknown, percentage of cases. The most obvious reasons are lack
of screening, inadequate preparation, unskilled handling during
the drug reaction, and little or no help with useful integration
after the experience. The dangers to society have also been mentioned.
If more and more people drop out and withdraw, can society continue
to function?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
If psychedelic drugs really can change people's goals, values,
motivations and needs for achievement, the impact could be considerable
on our society, in which there is so much stress on money, power
and status. Less emphasis on these traditional goals, coupled
with the availability of more leisure time, could alter our style
of life. Some argue that such changes in moderation might be healthy,
yet it is possible that widespread adoption of a radical change
in outlook might be disastrous to a society that wants mainly
to multiply its Gross National Product and to compete successfully.
Such issues need realistic and sensitive consideration.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There has been too much heat and perhaps not enough light propagated
by the psychedelic drugs. Because of mass-media coverage, certainly
everyone today has heard of LSD. Interestingly enough, almost
everyone has a definite opinion, no matter how little or how much
he knows about the field. These opinions, pro or con, usually
have a deep emotional basis. Certainly the reason is more than
just an abhorrence of drug taking, because other drugs such as
tranquilizers, sleeping pills and alcohol are taken freely with
no such emotional reaction. The dangers of negative consequences
such as psychological breakdown appear to be a logical reason,
but since most drug experiences are positive, there must be an
additional explanation. A deeper reason may lie in the nature
of the profound emotional experiences, often considered religious,
which seem to have the power to change a person's values and to
generate enthusiasm and inspiration in a direction perhaps not
shared by society in general. Such consequences may be seen as
a threat when considered logically, but felt even more powerfully
to be so at a subliminal or non-rational level.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Our society is faced with the fact that the use of psychedelic
drugs is spreading rapidly. Do we have the capacity and wisdom
to deal constructively with this problem, or will we seek a solution
by restrictive legislation and police force? In this instance,
suppression has much less a chance of succeeding than in the illegal
use of narcotics, which has not been stopped. Throughout history
when enough people have really wanted something, no restrictive
measures have worked. Laws did not stop the introduction of coffee
into Europe, nor the consumption of alcohol in the United States
during Prohibition.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What will undoubtedly result, however, from a rigid suppression
of psychedelic drugs is a severe inhibition of research in this
area. The more laws that are passed, the more the public identifies
the drugs with something negative. People in power, in both the
public and academic realms, are influenced by public reaction
and the mass media, and when research is proposed, there is hesitation
and lack of support. The decline of research with psychedelic
drugs has already occurred. Dr. Harold Abramson, one of the early
pioneers in LSD research, has commented that an interested layman
can use LSD more easily in our society today than can a doctor
who wants to do legitimate research. The joint committee now set
up by the N.I.M.H. and the F.D.A. to screen proposals will possibly
enable more research to begin in the near future.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Research is especially important in regard to the individual and
the societal problems caused by the growing use of psychedelic
drugs. Education rather than suppression would seem a more effective
solution, and more research is needed to learn the unknown facts
about many aspects of these drugs. We need more knowledge about
their biological and psychological mechanisms of action, their
therapeutic possibilities, dangers and long-term effects. Valid
statistics about chance of harm would be useful in calculating
a realistic pleasure-to-risk ratio.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
An important area for more research is the effect of psychedelic
drugs on relatively stable, well-adjusted persons. Many of the
people who have taken LSD and upon whom some of the conclusions
about its dangers are based were already drop-outs before encountering
the drug. For purposes of education and guidance it is important
that we base our facts on drug effects in normals rather than
on retrospective analysis of drop-outs. No one knows how many
successful people who did <I>not</I> drop out or withdraw from
their place in society have found that psychedelic experience
can be an enriching part of their total lives, without eclipsing
other interests and responsibilities.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There are many questions that can only be answered by careful
and well controlled research. For example, what are the exact
conditions responsible for the production of aesthetic, cognitive
or mystical experiences? All the extra-drug variables of set and
setting need to be studied intensively. An interesting project
would be to follow a group of persons who would have LSD sessions
at regular intervals for three to five years, or to do a longitudinal
study on a group of persons who had only a few sessions and then
were followed over a period of time. In a small group who might
take LSD together, other phenomena such as the effect on group
discussion, group interaction and group cohesion could be measured.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The sociology of religion has an extraordinary opportunity for
research in the psychedelic religious movement. Here is a chance
to study the formation and growth of what may become an important
form of religion in the United States. The small cult-like groups,
the evangelistic ferment, the utopian ideals, the struggle for
survival&#151;all these elements can be studied for better under
standing of what has gone on when other religious movements emerged
in the past. Dr. R. Blum (Blum <I>et al.,</I> 1964) has made a
start in this area, but other points of view would also be helpful.
Participant-observers, who would be more in rapport with those
in the movement, might add valuable additional data to the field.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
With regard to the future, psychedelic drugs seem to be here to
stay as a fact of our present existence. The experiences are much
too powerful and have too many implications to be dismissed as
a passing fad. Indications are that the use will increase rather
than decrease and may have more influence on American life than
we now imagine. Certainly researchers with LSD even ten years
ago would not have predicted what has happened. More surprises
may be in store for us. Work needs to be done with these drugs
without delay in a disciplined scientific way rather than permitting
a black-market underground to undertake experiments by default.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
If these drugs are ever going to be used legitimately, training
centers will have to be established, because specialized training
under supervision is needed to insure maximal safety. The work
thus far at the Spring Grove State Hospital has indicated that
even very unstable people can be treated with LSD in relative
safety if specific procedures are employed. These centers can
be used for the training not only of psychiatrists, but also of
psychologists, social workers, ministers or any one else who might
have a role in treatment with these drugs. Some day it may even
be possible to establish places where interested, serious people
could go to take LSD in maximal safety under the supervision of
trained personnel. Such a suggestion is utopian at present and
may take a long time in being developed, but it is possible in
the future.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Some people, however, and especially students, are not content
to wait and are asking themselves the existential question &quot;Should
I take LSD now, on my own?&quot; It is obvious that anyone who
really wants to obtain the drug and take it can do so. No amount
of admonition to the contrary from college administrators can
really stop anyone. It remains a personal decision, but anyone
contemplating such a course of action would be wise to consider
some basic facts.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
First, there is a definite risk, which is certainly greater in
uncontrolled than in controlled conditions. The work at Spring
Grove and elsewhere has demonstrated that with skilled handling
the risk is minimal. Psychedelic drugs are like other powerful
tools in that the risk is greatly dependent upon the way they
are used. For example, for eye surgery a skilled surgeon is needed,
not a watchmaker, no matter how skilled he might be in the use
of fine instruments. The use of psychedelic drugs also requires
specialized training for maximal safety. At the Spring Grove Hospital,
three to six months, or longer, are needed to train a therapist.
The fact that safe procedures have been worked out, however, is
not much help at present to someone who would like to take a psychedelicdrug under supervision, because at present no authorized research
in the United States is being done with normal persons.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Another thing to consider is the time of life. Many persons in
college are going through an identity crisis and are trying to
decide where they are really going with their lives. Because a
psychedelic drug experience may affect judgment, it is probably
not a good idea to make a major life decision within three months
after a drug session. People undergoing intensive psychotherapy
or psychoanalysis are given the same advice. Decisions made at
such a time may turn out to be regretted later, especially when
no guidance is available during and after the drug session. People
who have a psychedelic experience when they are older and have
successfully settled some of the crucial issues of their lives
probably have a better chance for an enriching experience. It
would seem that the more life experience a person has had, the
better, just as the program fed to a computer is the basis upon
which the results are produced.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It is a misconception to imagine that LSD is the magic answer
to anything. Hard work is needed to utilize the experience, and
follow-up therapy with the therapist who guided the drug session
can be very helpful. Persons who take a psychedelic drug to &quot;work
out their own problems&quot; not only may be disappointed but
also may unearth additional conflicts. More than a few people
have been unpleasantly surprised by what emerged with great force
from the unconscious.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In spite of the very real dangers in self-experimentation, anyone
with a serious and scientific interest in this fascinating area
of research would not be discouraged about the prospects of legitimate
research. There is much work to be done, and people of the highest
caliber will be needed in the near future if we are to gain new
knowledge about these drugs and their possible applications. Ideally,
an interdisciplinary approach should be used involving the joint
efforts of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, clergymen,
theologians and philosophers.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Anyone interested in this field should get the best possible training
in the discipline of his choice. It has been said: &quot;Turn
on, tune in and drop out.&quot; This can be paraphrased a bit
as follows: Turn on your motivation in the most concentrated way
possible; tune in to everything that's relevant to equip yourself
in the way of training for the work you want to do in the field;
and then, instead of dropping out, you will be ready to drop into
a worthwhile and interesting career, one that may be full of great
satisfactions and a sense of accomplishment, because this is an
exciting area.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A striking example of a future psychedelic research possibility
is the work with terminal-cancer patients. This area is relevant
to a discussion of religion and LSD, because the experience of
death has a crucial place in almost all religions. In spite of
much talk and concern, and perhaps guilt about the way terminal
patients are treated, not much has really changed in this anxiety-ridden
situation in our culture. Many times there is a growing isolation
from meaningful interpersonal involvement, as all efforts are
bent toward making the patient &quot;comfortable.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Psychedelic therapy may have a role to play to make life more
livable for terminal patients. LSD was first tried for its analgesic
effect, which was found to be considerable (Blum <I>et al.,</I>
1964; Kast, 1963; Kast, 1964a; Kast, 1964b). More important, perhaps,
was the finding that fear, anxiety and apprehension were lessened
in some cases (Kast, 1966). By working with patients and their
families, the opportunity for an increase in interpersonal closeness
was afforded, especially in the wake of a powerful psychedelic
experience (Cohen, 1965). Current research to explore these initial
leads is only in the pilot stage, but it appears to be a promising
approach to help ease the agony and isolation of death, both for
those who will be left behind and for the one who must face the
end of his life.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In conclusion, let us ponder the wide influence that the accidental
discovery of LSD in a Swiss pharmaceutical laboratory has exercised
throughout the world. There have been far-reaching effects in
all kinds of research, especially in biochemistry, pharmacology,
psychiatry, psychology, sociology, philosophy and religion. The
interdisciplinary implications seem broad indeed. In spite of
the dangers that are certainly potential in the use of this powerful
tool, it has always been man's destiny to push ahead in order
to increase his knowledge. This area is no exception, but those
who undertake such research bear a heavy responsibility.<P><HR WIDTH=50%>

Public Symposium on Psychedelic Drugs, Wesleyan University, March

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The following discussion between the participants and audience
attending the Wesleyan University symposium is illustrative of
the mood of the times: On the one side we see authoritarians
agitating for maximal control of the psychedelic drugs with criminal
penalties for those who would contravene the regulations; on the
other the more rational voices which, as so often happens, are
little heard and less considered in times when a rush to judgment,
inspired by panic, rules the day. Of particular note are the figures showing
the radically diminishing funding and licensing provided by the government:
If rational decisions and legislation were to be effected, one would think that
greatly expanded research would have been in the general interest. A List of participants follows
the discussion. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  pw</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: The psychedelic drugs have often been referred
to as an instrument for conversion, with use centered on the college
campuses. Many articles about LSD seem to stress the college campuses.
Of course, Greenwich Village is essentially in the watershed of
New York University and other universities there, and the Berkeley
scene is close to the Berkeley campus. On the other hand, it has
been suggested that the spread of LSD is an autonomous phenomenon,
not related to the college community. I would like to ask the
members of the panel to speak to this. Is the LSD phenomenon in
our culture today a college-bound phenomenon or is it, in fact,
independent and autonomous?
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: I would say that Dr. Louria's figures from
this afternoon would dispute that, because he showed that it was
used by people with all kinds of occupations, not only by students.
I think that 15% were students. I'm not sure that use was ever
confined to colleges.
<P>
<I>Dr. Louria:</I> The Blum studies show us the same thing exactly,
but far more precisely than the few data from our hospital.
<P>
<I>A member of the audience</I>: I have a suggestion to make,
and I'd like to ask both Mr. Joffe and Dr. Pahnke whether it's
feasible. Everybody is agreed that more research is needed. The
problem seems to be that today and tomorrow and the next few weeks
a lot of kids and others are going to be turning on, and a small,
yet unknown proportion of these are going to be harmed. I would
like to suggest that perhaps the people from Spring Grove could
get together with the people from the government to the extent
that they have techniques worked out, to the extent that any bit
of information that could be provided to the community at large
to help people use whatever research there has been and to prevent
people from harming themselves. I think that this might be useful.
So that the proportion, whether it is one in a thousand or one
in ten thousand, goes down. And that something be done relatively
soon to try to alleviate the problem as it exists.
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: Dr. Louria has already given you the answer
this afternoon. He said don't use it; it's a dangerous drug.
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience</I>: But people are not listening,
though it is a dangerous drug, because of the kinds of evidence
referred to today. People think that they can use it, taking the
proper precautions themselves; and these people are trying to
decide for themselves whether they can handle it.
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: Do you suggest that each individual who would
like to try the drug furnish a complete medical history, including
electroencephalograms and psychiatric interview, which is the
only way I know of to be reasonably sure that the individual will
not have a bad reaction?
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience:</I> I think that there appears
a general principle for dealing with the LSD experience that seems
to be implied in what Dr. Pahnke said, and I am asking whether
such things couldn't be made available to the public, because
some segment of the public is going to experiment regardless of
what anyone says.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: I'm not clear on just what you're proposing.
It sounds to me as though you're proposing something that we thought
we were getting at when we set up this symposium, that is, providing
definitive information on which people can base their decisions.
This is one thing, but I think that there is inherent in what
you are saying a second suggestion, which is that there be set
up essentially some instrument for providing a mechanism of screening.
I don't know what that would be.
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience</I>: I am talking about procedures
for guiding people on trips. To the extent that such procedures
and Dr. Pahnke stressed the importance of thisseem to be the
prime determinant as to whether a person has or has not a favorable
experience.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Let me comment. Such procedures have been worked
out at Spring Grove and are continuing to be. They will be published
in the scientific literature, but that will take time, at least
a couple of years. If what you want actually happened, if you
did have the information now, and it was disseminated, I don't
think it would help too much because other researchers couldn't,
perhaps, get the permission to use the drug anyway. You want it
for the lay people. In a handbook?
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience</I>: For the people whom Dr. Louria
is worried about.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: But you see, they wouldn't be using it under
medical guidance, which is the essential point.
<P>
<I>Dr. Louria</I>: I think we're in a real dilemma. You see, the
whole thing is that there are several levels involved. On the
one hand, there's the research problem, and during the evening
I was just figuring out from the Congressional hearings what the
research situation is. And here is what it is, if my figures are
at all accurate. In 1964 there were about seventy licensed investigators;
in 1965, thirty-nine; in 1966, thirty-one; and currently, only
sixteen. As to N.I.M.H. funds, there was available in 1964 1.5
million dollars; in 1965, 1.49 million dollars; in 1966, 927,000
dollars, a decrease of over one-third in one year; and currently
there is still less available. It is abundantly clear that research
has been markedly reduced; and you can prove this fact with the
government's own figures. Now, that's one level, research that
we desperately want to increase. And I don't think that there
is any excuse for the N.I.M.H. not to increase it.
<P>
Then, there's the second level, which is the kind of research
that you are doing, Dr. Kurland, absolutely well controlled and
under medical aegis. We all want that increased. That has to be
increased. That's very important research. And there's the third
level, research in a broader context, in a community that may
be in your semi-utopian future under some control. And there's
the fourth level, the level that you're talking about, namely,
having people take the drug, young people, unprepared, on their
own. That level is the one that bothers me. I am not bothered
by the other three levels. There is no way of disseminating information
now to that fourth group and to prevent their having adverse reactions.
That group, young, unprepared, under uncontrolled conditions,
that group is the one that we are desperately trying to educate
not to take the drug in any circumstances, because it is not one
in a thousand or one in ten thousand. At the very minimum it is
several per cent. Now, the derivative problem is that of that
several per cent who do get into trouble, certain ones are going
to do very dramatic things. They are going to jump out windows
or walk in front of cars, enough to get front-page headlines.
In New York City 1 % of heroin addicts die every year of an overdose.
<P>
This fact almost never gets headlines, because it isn't very dramatic.
They shoot the stuff into their veins, and they drop dead. They
are taken to the coroner's office. We whisk them off to the grave,
and nobody cares. But let somebody jump out a window under LSD,
the way the newspapers are now, and that's front-page across the
country.
<P>
In doing that, what you do is to arouse not the people who are
interested in LSD, a very small segment of the population, but
what Leary has called the middle-class, middle-aged monolith that
runs our country. I'm not derogating that, for I'm rather for
their running the country. This relatively stable group then transmits
its fears and angers and anxieties to legislatures, which are
dependent on this middle-aged monolith for their maintenance in
office, and you know what happens. So the only way by which you
can avoid more restrictive laws, which make the whole situation
worse, is by getting the fourth group off its LSD kick. I think
that we have to have some laws, both federal and state, to help
us in that endeavor; because if you don't, then you will destroy
the other three levels from animal research to human research
to community research, all of which could be of enormous value
to all of us in the future.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: Are there any questions from the floor?
<P>
<I>A member of the audience</I>: It seems to me that a lot of
people have forgotten the fact that the reason people are dropping
out is because their society wants them to drop out. Dr. Pahnke,
what do you think that the possibilities are that at some time
in the future, people won't drop out, but will work to change
the aspects of society that tend to drive them out?
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: I think that would be fine. I am a little concerned
as to what happens to these people who do drop out. Who is really
helping them? I know what happens to some of the people who drop
out, because we get them as patients in our out-patient clinic.
These are people who before they took LSD had, perhaps, some problems
and were told that they needed psychotherapy, but they would have
none of it. They felt that they were quite healthy and that their
advisers were just talking through their hats. They took LSD,
got very shaken up and perhaps dropped out of school. But then
they come to the clinic seeking therapy, and, paradoxically enough,
these people are then quite eager to work in therapy. This is
a danger that has a paradoxical, perhaps good, effect, but I certainly
would not recommend it as a way of getting into therapy.
<P>
<I>A member of the audience</I>: There was an earlier question
concerning black-market impurities and the dangers of them. Would
Mr. Joffe discuss this?
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: I'm afraid I can't tell you what the impurities
might be. There is some black-market material that is of exceedingly
good quality. I don't mean to say that everything that is not
legitimate is of poor quality. We do know, however, that a simple
analysis of a cube will show perhaps 30% of LSD; it will also
show on an ultraviolet spectrum many peaks that you know are not
LSD and do not occur in the pure product. Therefore they are impurities
of one sort or another. It has not seemed too important to our
activities to find out what is wrong with this product or that
product, because they are all illegal. I don't see what good it
will do us to run the analyses of the home-made products so that
someone will know that there is bad in his product.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Unless he were getting heroin or something
else. That should be publicized, I think. It might deter some
people from taking it. I've heard of that happening. Amphetamines,
barbiturates and heroin do get mixed in with LSD. I think this
could have very bad effects in terms of persons' becoming addicted.
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: These are recognizable peaks on an ultraviolet
absorption spectrum.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Yes, but if you're not making an analysis,
how would you know that?
<P><I>Mr. Joffe</I>: You run the curve, and you see that here is
the peak that we know is LSD. . .
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Yes, that's fine, if you're doing them, but
you said that you're not doing them.
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: No, I said we're not running the peak down to
find out what the impurity is.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Well, say the impurity was heroin? Somebody
had added . . .
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: Heroin has a recognizable peak.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: One that is easily recognized?
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: Yes.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Do you find that?
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: I don't know. I have not myself heard of it.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: I'm afraid that some of you couldn't hear
the discussion that went on at the table. Let me try to paraphrase
it quickly for you. Dr. Pahnke asked the question if it wasn't
a social responsibility of the F.D.A. to check out the actual
nature of impurities to forestall possibly the use of drugs such
as heroin as additives to sugar cubes and therefore make this
public knowledge in order to warn people who might use them.
<P>
<I>A member of the audience</I>: I am not satisfied with a previous
answer. LSD appeals to young people, and what's to prevent their
using it? You agree that something should be done to stop free
usage by young people. You refuse to recognize any valid reason
for using LSD regardless of whether the user be a young student
or a middle-aged person. I think there is a responsibility among
all groups, doctors, psychiatrists and legal people, to recognize
that there is going to be a lot of illegal LSD usage. In light
of the circumstances, what can be done to keep the number of bad
trips down? This is a problem. The refusal to offer any kind of
guidance to users is bad.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: As I understand the question, it says, as
a banner did over the Sather Gate at the University of California
recently, &quot;Never trust anybody over thirty.&quot; We are
being accused, I guess, of evading the issue that has been brought
before us, which is that there is a large population of people
who fall into category four, as defined earlier by Dr. Louria,
those who use LSD on their own in situations in which there is
no guidance. The panel is asked to comment on possible ways of
minimizing bad trips, psychotic episodes and hospital admissions
for this category.
<P>
<I>Mr. Chayet</I>: I think that this is one of the basic defenses
for the existing laws. As I understand these gentlemen who are
certainly the professionals in dealing with LSD, there is no way
to give out information on a mass scale to tell you how to take
LSD on your own. Even Mr. Leary has suggested that there be licensing
of individuals. He wants, of course, to reduce the criteria for
getting a license to work with LSD; and he certainly doesn't believe
in the medical profession's having exclusive control. But even
Mr. Leary says that there should be some control and some guidance;
and as I understand it, there is just no way of preparing a brochure
so that you can do it yourself and be successful at it, though
I would be interested to hear if this is a possibility.
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: I think that the question ultimately boils down
to the fact that the gentleman says that there will be the use
of this drug whether we authorize it or not. There will also be
bank robberies, murders and other crimes whether we have laws
or not. What you are asking us to do is to show you the best way
to evade the law. You want the government to furnish the safecracker
with tools to make his job easier. We can't do this. It is not
a province of a regulatory agency to show people how to evade
the law. Aside from the fact that there is no cookbook sort of
thing for this.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Well, actually, there are some manuals. 
<P><I>Mr. Joffe:</I> But not for the ordinary individual. 
<P><I>Dr. Pahnke: </I>Well, yes. 
<P><I>Mr. Joffe:</I> One off the street?
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: Yes. Actually, this is what Leary proposed
when he founded IF-IF. He was going to write a number of manuals.
He wrote two, and The Psychedelic Experience has nearly a chapter
describing how to run a session. The trouble is that you cannot
learn this from a book. What you need is specialized training,
in which you work under someone or watch someone run sessions,
as it is possible at Spring Grove, where there is a closed-circuit
television system. But this is not yet set up to train a lot of
people, though it might be possible sometime in the future. This
is what I suggested, having training centers, but we're a long
way from that. So for the present time I can't offer you any advice.
These manuals may be somewhat helpful, but I certainly don't think
that that's the way to learn how to use LSD.
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience</I>: My question asked for the
recognition that there is going to be a lot of usage by the layman.
Instead of saying merely that this is something to be outlawed,
leaving it at that and limiting research to laboratory settings,
you are asked to shift from your concern with developing a definite
set of rules and direct your attention toward existing problems.
Perhaps there's something that should be outlawed. But users of
LSD have a right to be considered themselves.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: I will say that I believe many people in
our culture, in our nation and in the western nations whom I know
and have talked to are very concerned about this. As I understand
the question, we are being asked to increase at least the amount
of attention that we are paying to that group, group four, people
who are taking LSD on their own, and to share our attention with
them, the same attention that animal research receives. I think
that's what you are asking us to do.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: I would just like to say in addition that it
takes three to six months to train adequately an LSD therapist,
to have him learn how to deal with all possible contingencies,
so that he can really guide people with safety. It's no thing
that you can learn easily just from a few rules. Some people have
gone ahead on their own and had experiences, and there have been
a lot of bad experiences. These people of the lay public have
learned by experience, and some have had some very bad trips.
But I don't think that's the ideal way to do it. And you're right,
it is a problem. Some people feel that we just suppress the problem
by passing a law against it and assuming that this law will take
care of it. I don't feel that it will, and I think that it will
take time to work this out. If LSD does continue to spread, and
more and more people do continue to take it, there will eventually
be pressure to change the laws or to make some provision for this,
but that also will take time. I know that this solution probably
won't satisfy you. You want something right now. The reality is
that it probably is not practical.
<P>
<I>A member of the audience</I>: Well, I see some sense of understanding
among certain members of the panel who have spoken today, and
I wonder whether the more legalistically oriented members of the
panel are sitting with points of view that might be expressed
by the statement &quot;Well, we'll let the sympathetic people
speak, but we've got the say, because we make the laws, we enforce
them, we regulate them.&quot; Or whether, in fact, there is a
sense of cooperation and understanding among the people who are
gathered here to speak to us on the issue?
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: But that precisely is the reason why we're
doing it.
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience</I>: Yes, I know. I understand.
My question, though, is whether in the process there are formulations
going on?
<P>
<I>Mr. Joffe</I>: I am working for the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control,
which you may call legalistically oriented, if you wish, but I
am not a lawyer. I am not an enforcement agent. I am a pharmacologist.
The reason that I am working for this agency is because it offers
me a chance to get some scientific work done, and I am interested
in the scientific aspects of this problem. But that the support
happens to be in a bureau that has as well the responsibility
for enforcement does not deter me. I am not going to try to change
the rules of enforcement. This is something else. But I have joined
them, because they give me an opportunity to do the scientific
work that I want to see done. This is my personal approach to
it. I can't speak for anyone else. We have the authority not only
to do in-house research but also to have contract research done.
When I say support for research, I don't mean that someone has
to build me a ten-million-dollar laboratory. I have the authority
to solicit or to receive unsolicited proposals from those individuals
who would like to do work on drug abuse of a scientific nature
that I am capable of supporting.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: I think that we have slipped away from the
question, and rather than see this thread followed, I'd like the
question to get the attention that I think it really deserves.
I wasn't kidding when I said that one of the shocking signs of
my life was the sign over the Sather Gate, which appeared in all
the papers, saying &quot;Never trust anybody over thirty.&quot;
You know, that really gets at me. I don't know why. I need a lot
of love, I guess, and I want people who are under thirty to believe
somehow that even if I am not a part of their culture and don't
understand them, I do want to understand them, and I think that
this feeling is shared by many people who are my age and older.
We are trying very hard to understand, and in addition to trying
to understand we are trying to act in good faith. Now, in your
question, as you phrased it, there was an implication that I hear
very frequently&quot;Yes, you pay lip service to understanding,
but actually you want to pass regulations and hold us down. You're
afraid of us. We are coming up. We're new and we're different,
and we threaten you.&quot; In a sense, that's true. It is the
business of the young to displace the old. That's the story of
life, but I would defend the people here today, all of us, the
people who have been most militant in their expressions and those
who seem most permissive, from the charge of insincerity. I don't
think that these people are, and I certainly know that I am not,
insincere.
<P>
<I>Mr. Chayet</I>: I would like to comment. I am under thirty,
so I don't know where that really puts me. I'm also probably not
a very good representative of the law-enforcement profession,
because I don't like these laws. I think, however, that they are
an absolute necessity. For example, the law regarding marijuana.
I have grave doubt that anybody who is carrying around marijuana seed ought
to get thirty years in prison. That bothers me very much, because
it doesn't seem to me that the danger is there. I've heard from
so many that alcohol is much more dangerous than marijuana, but
this may be subject to rebuttal by those who know more about marijuana.
It seems to me that when you talk about psilocybin and LSD, the
danger is very great, and therefore we do need laws to protect
people from themselves. I think that if the danger weren't there,
that the laws would be bad and unnecessary. It's the danger that
really necessitates the legislation. As soon as we have some control
and some training centers, or anything else, I would be the first
to want to see the laws go.
<P>
<I>Dr. Louria</I>: Well, I think that you really said what I was
going to say, Mr. Chayet. I'm not sympathetic with the questioner's
point of view. I think that we have shown you beyond peradventure
that this drug, taken under those conditions that you want to
take it under, is a dangerous drug. There's no question about
that. You can't show me evidence that taken under your circumstances
this gives you anything other than a kick. You can't show me that
it gives you any lasting benefit, though it may. But that will
come from the kind of research that Dr. Kurland is doing and Dr.
Pahnke is doing and others will do if we can get more research
on a broader level. Not from your going out with a do-it-yourself
kit and taking LSD. Our medical view is simple. If you take it
under those circumstances, you can't show anybody that it does
you any good; and a certain percentage of you are going to end
up in hospitals with acute or chronic psychoses; and some of you,
infrequently, but some of you, are going to end up dead. We know
that now. So what we're telling you is very simple. We do not
under any conditions condone the concept or understand the concept
or agree with any part of the concept that you ought to be able
to take drugs like LSDnot marijuanaunder these conditions
and have us give to you a pamphlet that tells you how to do it
better. As far as I'm concerned, if you're going to do it, knowing
what the dangers are, you damn well take the risk; and if you
get into trouble, what we will do in the medical profession is
to publicize the adverse effects that you have in the hope that
other people won't get into that trouble until the time when we
do have the knowledge that it can be given to people, such as
you, on an outpatient basis, relatively safely.
<P>
<I>Mr. Barron</I>: Well, I don't think that Dr. Louria's response
answers the question, the intent of the question, as it was put.
Also, I wish that Dr. Louria would speak for himself and not say
&quot;we.&quot; It seems you said, &quot;We have shown you beyond
a peradventure of a doubt.&quot; There has been a lack of imaginative
or constructive attempts to find other means, other solutions,
new institutions to meet what has been an expressed need on the
part of a lot of people. I don't think that what one should do
is to give advice on how to break the law. I think it's just what
has to be built up as a body of opinion, reflecting pressure to
create forms that will meet new social needs. It is not a matter
just of restrictive laws.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: At the end, Dr. Louria, you said if there was
enough evidence accumulated showing that it was safe to give LSD
on an out-patient basis, you would be for it. Now, what would
that evidence consist of for you? How much evidence would you
need? I think that there is some evidence already, but how much
more do you need?
<P>
<I>Dr. Louria</I>: Under whose aegis?
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: I think that what they are doing at Spring
Grove has shown that very sick patients can be given LSD without
serious consequences, so far anyway, with almost two hundred patients.
<P>
<I>Dr. Kurland</I>: I think that the safety question is in everybody's
mind, and the safety record established in research at Spring
Grove didn't happen by chance. There were years of pilot work
done by experts, by professionals in these drug studies; and before
we initiated these control studies, there were pilot studies that
went on a year or longer. The thing that I oppose is to let unsophisticated
people, who don't have the longitudinal experience, who don't
have all the things that one needs from the standpoint of physiological
and behavioral background, to plunge into these areas and carry
on research. The point is that without the necessary tools you
can't even document what you are doing. You can't put this down
in some kind of systematic way so that it can be replicated. The
way that our studies started, the history of prior research in
our area had to be studied in order to work out a plan. We didn't
just plunge into this. We gathered the reports that came from
the different investigators, and we formulated the usefulness
of treatment of alcoholics. These were very full reports. We started
out by attempting to replicate these things, and this is our point
for beginning to learn. For people who say that they can get something
accomplished in uncontrolled studies, who think that they are
going to get a lot of new information and insight, I would just
bring back to your attention the fact that we first had to learn
something about what goes on in group psychotherapy, where there
aren't many complicating conditions. So, with all due respect
to the younger people, it is very, very important to learn the
rules before you get involved; certainly they would refuse to
allow anybody to get into the field of radioactivity without having
a license indicating technical competency.
<P>
<I>Mr. Barron</I>: Let me make it quite clear that I am not, by
any means, advocating usage of any of these substances that are
illegal. What I was saying is that I think that the intent or
motive of the question was misinterpreted and that what is essentially
threatening is some kind of feeling that the present laws and
present social institutions are not adequate to a deeply felt
need on the part of some people. It's this, I think, that should
be taken seriously, as a feeling, and that if we use all of it,
we will work as best we can and create whatever kinds of institutions
are necessary, if indeed it's true that this is no passing fad
and represents something that is important to the general movement
of mind over the past fifty years.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: Let me say that it was my feeling that in
your paper, Mr. Barron, you tried to provide an historical analysis
for this anomie toward which the question was directed. I felt
that that was a matter of record today, and I was including you
among those of us who feel sincerely concerned about these problems.
<P>
<I>A member of the audience</I>: Well, I hope that the idea that
you don't trust anybody under thirty doesn't emerge.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: Let me just make that comment over the speaker,
for the people in the back, an important point, sometimes overlooked
in this controversy. One of the audience expressed the hope that
as the reaction to &quot;You can't trust anyone over thirty,&quot;
there wouldn't develop a backlash movement that would be expressed
&quot;You can't trust anybody under thirty.&quot;
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience</I>: I was prompted to say that
when you said that you can't prove to us that you're not taking
it just for kicks. This discussion is supposed to be about LSD
in society, and the legal justification for regulating the drugs
seems to be based on a pleasure-to-risk ratio, which was unfortunately
demonstrated today, what you call a high risk. But nobody has
talked about the other thing that you should substitute for pleasurealthough
pleasure may be applicable in a majority of the casesthe utility-to-risk
ratio. Nobody has investigated the fantastic possibilities that
LSD brings out, so that the utility could be very, very high,
which would balance off, to some extent, the risks. And there's
one other orientation in this symposium that bothers me, which
I think bothered the writer of the recent letter in our college
paper, which is the very scientific cast of the symposium speakers.
And I would be the last one to go against science, because it's
proved to be very, very successful; but it is strange that there
are no artists involved in this, no philosophers, no theologians.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: Dr. Pahnke does have a degree in religion,
I am informed.
<P>
<I>Same member of the audience</I>: All right, but at least, say,
somebody artistic, who would use this in support of his art. This
hasn't really been brought out. Mr. Barron said that the response
to this explosion of knowledge and ideas prompts the response
and McLuhan might be relevant hereto try other types of
integrating knowledge and intellect in these things. I think LSD
might be useful in exploring these areas. This has not been brought
out, though it goes right to the thing of the tremendous utility
of LSD. So I was wondering if the government and Dr. Louria had
considered the possible utility that might balance off some of
the risk? Maybe this isn't a very practical question either, as
we know that there are a lot of artists who are racked by opium
and other drugs who do produce very profound and good poetry.
You know, it's hard to tell whether it is worth it or not. But
there are laws restricting the use of LSD, and we could be losing
a lot. I don't think that this problem has been addressed.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: The member of the audience has asked if
we have paid enough attention to the possibility that LSD has
a high utility, which, if legislated against, would be lost to
the culture.
<P>
<I>Mr. Chayet</I>: On the question of utility and risk, I think
that this is a very realistic suggestion, and I would like to
say that the law of the country is based very much on utility
and risk. What the Supreme Court of the United States says in
its earth-shaking decisions, which are often five to fourfive
jurists thinking one way and four equally learned jurists thinking
the other wayis based on a careful balancing of what they think
is useful and what they think is the social necessity. The example
was brought up today of the automobilethere's a terrific amount
of carnage, but we allow it; we don't outlaw it, because of its
utility. Now everybody who drives an automobile gets somewhere,
and if you could show me that everybody who takes LSD gets somewhere
that is useful in a constructive sense, then I would say let's
get rid of the laws. Let's allow it. But if you have one person
who takes it and really gets somewhere and many hundreds who get
nowhere and who go out windows, then I say there's a real question.
While I think that your suggestion is a good one, I just don't
think that we have reached the point where there is the utility-to-risk
ratio that would allow change in legislation.
<P>
<I>Member of the audience</I>: You were all here when Dr. Kurland
read his case studies, and you also heard Dr. Pahnke's case studies.
It seems to me that one thing that all these people had in commonand
they admitted itwas that they were all dead before they took
the drug, dead in some sense. These drugs were given to somebodythat
twenty-three-year-old girl with the illegitimate child, the Negro
who was a drinkerand gave them something very real. And this,
this introducing of pleasure, just because they and you are supposed
to wait for the other what I really want to say is that it
would be a tragedy to wait until seventy years of age, wait fifty
years, until science comes up with some kind of result, then take
the drugs and find out, by God, I've been missing it all along.
<P>
<I>The moderator:</I> As I understand the member of the audience,
he has suggested that the protocols presented from the patients
indicated a gain in personal phenomenological experience, and
the member of the audience felt that if one waited until he was
a seventy-year-old person without having had those experiences,
it would be a great loss. I shall ask Dr. Kurland to speak to
this, if he will.
<P>
<I>Dr. Kurland</I>: The issue here is one ofone of the issues,
anyway, is, in plain English, impatience. Nobody will realize
the impatience and frustrations of the researchers who are actively
involved in something like this, who see all the possibilities,
yet are aware that society demands that they be responsible to
the public trust. Many times we have the very, very frustrating
business of going into our proposals and looking for advance research,
and then having our peers turn the proposals down, because they
say that there is something missing in the specifications, that
is, the plans are not well done. So we go back to the drawing
board again and again. We don't get everything we ask for. One
of the things that we have learned is that our peers sitting in
the committees that make judgments have not been wrong most of
the time. Most of the time we've been wrong if they haven't approved
of something. We have gone back and redesigned our plans so that
they can meet the objections, and we have been able to go ahead.
For example, when you are dealing with human life and have the
responsibility of working in an unknown area, you have to take
every precaution to make sure that you are doing everything to
make things work out properly. We feel that it is the most important
rule in these areas to document what we are doing, so that the
way will be clear for the next men to follow through. If our research
can't be replicated in Russia or in Australia or in South America,
it means that we have not done the job right. We see things in
our work that we would like to measure. What we realize is that
it may take six months or a year to set up a program so it can
be done with safety and consideration for all the elements involved.
You can't rush good research. Good research takes a long time,
and that is why there are few places that we are able to get the
kind of balance needed. For example, with alcoholics, we started
in 1960, really 1958, and began following these people. So, we
had opportunities of comparing and maintaining balance. But in
a behavioral science, when one works with men, when one deals
with such complex issues, when one is taking psychotherapy and
adding research to itand you heard how complex this job isto
try to accomplish something, it is frustrating that some feel
that they can rush in and get the answers. Maybe we'll have perfected
techniques in ten, twenty, thirty years from now. We have computers
today, which we didn't have several years ago, and some of our
present experiments are not even possible without computers.
<P>
<I>Dr. Pahnke</I>: I detect in both the last two questions a feeling
that the panel here has not really taken seriously the possibilities
of the drugs, positive possibilities for enriching lives. Such
was not the intent of my remarks. I take these possibilities very
seriously. I think that there is promise in the experiments, but
I do not think that we know enough yet to make statements. We
need more research in these very areas, research to determine
the utility, but such research and planning for it will take time.
<P>
<I>Member of the audience</I>: Generally, I think, everyone here
would really have to agree with Dr. Louria's position that scientists
are trying to help in understanding these problems as well as
in control and prevention of abuse. But let me suggest two other
complications; and maybe Dr. Louria or someone on the panel will
comment on these. One is that people are obviously continuing
to use LSD, the so-called lay people, some of whom do know how
to use this drug and have knowledge of therapy. It seems to be
a fact. Why do people do this as often as they do? I think that
there must be some utility here, and it just can't be dismissed
out of hand if enough people are taking it. Too, I think that
Dr. Louria's position on the measures that need to be taken to
control this drug in the colleges could produce a number of problems
that might, in themselves, prove worse than the problem of cure.
Fortunately, there are times when the government gets itself into
a position of not being able to take a really utilitarian stand
and say that the law should stop this problem. We all know that
this law will create an environment in which these other probabilities
exist. And so we should not permit this law to stand, in order
to avoid creating this evil environment. The evidence of heroin
abuse suggests that there was a bad environment, which might serve
as an example, a situation where there is a black market, and
people in the underworld make a fortune on it by smuggling heroin
and starting people off on a terrible habit. So that has to be
considered. I mean, if you look at this and you look at the answers
that a lot of people are giving to these questions, you realize
that youth is a bit distrustful. I don't think that there is a
really considered opinion that exists in, let's say, the visional
people nowadays, which allows the use of LSD some respectability,
or in their criticism of existing statutes about the use of LSD.
<P>
<I>The moderator</I>: I think that your comments could be summed
up as a plea for more open-mindedness in enacting legislation
and in implementing programs. I'm not a member of the medical
profession, but I think I can say a word or two that will perhaps
help you in understanding the feeling of the medical profession
about things like this.
<P>
There was once a motion picture in which a man fought against
a dictator in one of the Latin American countries. He fought,
and he fought, and he did everything that he could to reject the
concept of help from the establishment, so to speak. Then, accidentally,
he became the dictator himself and immediately found himself in
political trouble. In what was probably the best punch-line in
the movie, he turns to the cabinet of men whom he has been rejecting
and says &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot;
<P>
I think that that is the feeling that the medical profession has,
for in its clinical work they regularly see people who are appealing
to them, and they constantly have a feeling of helplessness in
the face of certain of these problems. Therefore, their focus
tends toward avoidance of these terribly painful situations in
which they have to deal somehow with situations that they don't
understand, nor know what to do about. And I think that you see
strength of expression and a focusing on the negative side.
<P>
<I>Dr. Kurland</I>: Actually, there are several issues involved
here. One is that it isn't too difficult to do research in this
area if you submit a protocol. It's first a question of submitting
an experimental design that will be accepted; and the other issue
is that of financing. Many studies are accepted, but there just
aren't funds available to carry them out. For example, we had
the experience of this dying-patient study, which had earlier
been submitted on two occasions, and it had been rejected on two
occasions. If you have studies that you want to pursue, I'm pretty
sure that if they meet the judgment of your scientific peers,
they will be approved. Whether it will be funded is another matter,
because there are priorities in these matters. One must be aware
that there are only certain amounts of money available to go into
programs. We have heard that the funds for LSD research have been
decreasing for various reasons, which may not be relevant to the
research program itself, but to other factors that have no relationship
to these programs. If you're really interested in something and
go to the extent of submitting it to a scientific body for approval,
and if they reject it, there are most probably deficiencies in
that design that should be corrected. This has been our experience.
Not everything that we submit is approved. Some are rejected,
and we go back to try to work them out. And things that are called
to our attention are rejected. Sometimes we realize that we were
biased in a certain way and that this was a good decision. In
the LSD area, despite all the restrictions, you still can do research
if you are willing to undertake the effort to have your plan approved.
As you heard, the members of the panel are attempting now to work
this thing out. There's a very complex administrative procedure
because of the unique situation with this compound. When several
agencies are involved, it becomes a very complicated manoeuver.
Most of the time the rejected designs were rejected because there
was a lack of some kind in them. <P><HR WIDTH=50%>

<h2>The Psychedelic Mystical Experience<br>
in the Human Encounter With Death</h2>

<h4>WALTER N. PAHNKE</h4>
</center>

<hr>

<p> <center></p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
</center>

<p> THIS Spring I received a long distance telephone call from
Dean Samuel Miller, who invited me to give this year's Ingersoll
Lecture on human immortality. Three days later, Dean Miller was
dead. When I heard the sad news, I, as many of you no doubt,
began to think about the way he had influenced me, especially
during my theological training here at Harvard Divinity School.
One of my most vivid memories was a point which he emphasized in
his class on Religion and Literature. Sam Miller felt strongly
that in our modern 20th century two of the most profound and
important experiences of human life are becoming more and more
insulated from everyday existence. These two experiences, birth
and death, have the potential for affecting the character and
quality of the rest of life. But in each instance, they are
falling victim to modern technological efficiency and adding to
the process of dehumanization rather than counteracting it. </p>

<p> How many mothers these days are awake and actively
participating when giving birth to their babies? And much more
rare, how many fathers even are given the opportunity to be
present with their wives at the moment of birth? Certainly there
are times when medical emergencies make the presence of the
father an encumbrance and anesthesia to the point of
unconsciousness a necessity for the mother. But from my own
experience delivering babies as a general practitioner in a
wilderness community in Alaska, most of the time an alert,
participating mother and father make human birth much more than
just another medical procedure to be mechanically processed. I
have also been in the role of the father at the birth of my own
three children. Although I am a physician, it was nevertheless
difficult to find a hospital which would allow me to be present
in the delivery room. But I am tremendously glad that I was.
Delivering someone else's baby cannot compare to witnessing the
birth of your own. This event made a profound impact on me in
regard to reverence for life. </p>

<p> If we turn now to the other end of human life, my experience
has taught me that a creative emotional impact is possible in the
events surrounding death in spite of the tragedy and sadness.
Unfortunately, we have become so &quot;civilized&quot; that
death, too, can be robbed of its function in revitalizing and
energizing the rest of life for those still alive. </p>

<p> What usually happens in our culture when someone is
terminally ill? First of all, the fact of death, although
uppermost in everyone's mind, is usually avoided. Talk in general
is diversionary, for example, about getting well or about
superficial news in an attempt to prevent any serious discussion
of more profound issues. As the dying patient's condition
worsens, he may be subjected to a barrage of heroic treatment
measures which many times can prolong physical life, but also
make meaningful interpersonal contact difficult or impossible.
The patient is rarely given a chance to express his feelings
about how or where he would like to die, e.g., at home or in the
hospital. How could he, when the whole issue of death is somehow
avoided? Then, as the moment of death approaches and the patient
is put on the danger list, family members can stay with him
outside of usual visiting hours, but many times this is subtly
discouraged because it can interfere with hospital routine.
Sometimes frantic last minute efforts to &quot;revive&quot; the
patient are carried out behind drawn white curtains with the
family excluded. When death finally and inevitably comes, whether
at home or in the hospital, the body is quickly removed by the
undertaker, who then proceeds to make the corpse look &quot;as
lifelike&quot; as possible. Our costly and elaborate funeral
procedures seem intent on disguising the fact of death and
somehow insulating the survivors from its impact. </p>

<p> In contrast, consider what happened in other days before our
society became so removed from these primary experiences of birth
and death. Most babies were born and most people died in their
own homes. In the case of death, this meant the preparation of
the body for burial&#151;the tasks of bathing, dressing, and
grooming&#151;was done by members of the family. This
psychological experience was inescapable and profound. Although I
believe that a return to more participation in the process of
birth is important and can be done in the desirable safety of a
hospital setting, I am not suggesting that the elimination of
morticians is either desirable or necessary. But perhaps more
attention to the events preceding and surrounding the moment of
death would add dignity and meaning to this potentially powerful
experience. <center></p>

<h4>The Situation of the Terminal Cancer Patient</h4>
</center>

<p> I do not know how many of you here today have had a primary
exposure to someone whom you knew well and intimately who was
dying of cancer, but at best this is a grim situation. What do we
usually find happening? In my work with such patients I have
become keenly aware of the fear, depression, anxiety, loneliness,
and suffering which are usually present. </p>

<p> There is a certain degree of underlying fear on the part of
everyone involved&#151;not only the patient himself, but also his
family and friends, the nurses, and even the doctors. This fear
manifests itself in many ways, both consciously and
unconsciously, and is basically a fear of the unknown. No matter
how much we have been told about death, its implications for
life, or what might follow afterwards, down deep we all know that
some day each one of us must face this experience as an
individual at the end of his own life. This is a very personal
thing, and one that can stir deep emotions in any person who is
involved even as an observer. Thus, it is not surprising that
frequently in this situation the fear is expressed by an
avoidance of the issue in many ways, some subtle and some not so
subtle. There is hesitation to tell the dying person the gravity
of the condition, especially if his diagnosis is cancer. Doctors
many times advise the distraught family not to tell. The
implication is that the patient psychologically could not take
such ominous news and would disintegrate under the stress. A
common rationalization is that hope would be taken away and the
patient plunged into a deep depression. The assumption is made
for the patient that if he knew the truth, a bad situation would
automatically be made worse. By this line of reasoning, any show
of powerful emotions, even though genuine, is to be avoided at
all costs because the patient cannot take it. But what the family
really means is that they themselves are afraid to face the fact
of death. Undoubtedly, such a course of action, though admittedly
dishonest, seems justified by the situation &quot;for the
patient's own good&quot; and is many times the easiest thing to
do at first. The patient's direct questions, if any, are parried
with cheerful reassurance or adroitly avoided by changing the
subject or avowing ignorance. Nurses can do the same or, if
cornered, can refer the patient to his doctor, who can fill the
time spent with the patient during medical rounds with questions
about details of bowel function, appetite, and pain control. </p>

<p> But what does the patient think and feel about these
happenings? At first he may believe everything he is told,
especially because it is what he would like to think, but as his
condition worsens into a progressively downhill course, he may
realize more and more that something more serious is occurring.
In spite of the natural defense of denial, which can sustain some
patients for a while, he will begin to wonder if he is being told
the truth. If the pretense is continued, and sometimes at this
point it is even intensified, the patient will be getting a
powerful nonverbal message to avoid the issue. The fears of the
family will also be communicated and will reinforce the patient's
own private anxiety. Picking up the emotional turmoil of the
family in spite of attempts to hide it, the patient wonders what
they really know, but out of concern for them chooses not to
bring up issues which they are obviously avoiding. Each side then
attempts the heroic posture of protecting the other from what is
imagined to be too difficult to bear. </p>

<p> The more this dishonesty is perpetuated, the more difficult
it is to face the issues, and the more desperate the situation
becomes. Family members wonder what the patient will think of
them if he finally finds out that such vital information has been
withheld. It is almost as if the participants really believed
that not talking about something unpleasant would make it
magically disappear. </p>

<p> Perhaps the most devastating effect of such deception, even
when done with the honest intention of trying to make the
patient's burden lighter, is to increase the patient's
psychological isolation. At the very time when the welfare and
support of those closest to him could help him the most he feels
cut off at a basic level because his trust is undermined. He
cannot even talk about the things which concern him deeply. In
actuality the emotional pressure is increased for both patient
and family at this deadly game of pretense is played out. </p>

<p> It is no wonder that under such circumstances most patients
become depressed. With cancer patients the usual downhill course
also involves an increase in pain and suffering. When this is
treated with increasing doses of narcotic pain-killing drugs,
there is increased clouding of consciousness. Aldous Huxley in
his last novel, <i>Island</i>, describes the all too common
situation for the dying cancer patient as increasing pain,
increasing anxiety, increasing morphine, increasing addiction,
increasing demandingness, with the ultimate disintegration of
personality and loss of the opportunity to die with dignity. <a
name="back1"></a><a href="#footnote1">(1)</a> To this list I
would add psychological isolation, withdrawal, and depression. </p>

<p> The LSD research in which I have engaged for the last few
years has been an attempt to alter this dehumanization in the
course of events prior to death. How, you may ask, can the use of
LSD, a powerful and sometimes dangerous psychoactive drug, be of
any value to a person who may soon be dead? Don't these poor
patients have enough drugs already&#151;anti-cancer medicines,
pain-killing narcotics, tranquilizers, and anti-depressants, to
mention only a few? <center></p>

<h4>Review of Some Basic Facts About<br>
LSD and Psychedelic Experiences</h4>
</center>

<p> In order to discuss these questions in perspective, the
psychological phenomena which can occur when LSD is administered
to human beings needs to be kept in mind. Five kinds of potential
psychedelic experiences have been described in detail with
examples elsewhere. <a name="back2"></a><a href="#footnote2">(2,3)</a>
Let me briefly review these. </p>

<p> First is the <i>psychotic psychedelic experience</i>
characterized by the intense negative experience of fear to the
point of panic, paranoid delusions of suspicion or grandeur,
total confusion, impairment of abstract reasoning, remorse,
depression, isolation, and/or somatic discomfort; all of these
can be of very powerful magnitude. </p>

<p> Second is the <i>pschodynamic psychedelic experience</i>
characterized by a dramatic emergence into consciousness of
material that has previously been unconscious or preconscious.
Abreaction and catharsis are elements of what subjectively is
experienced as an actual reliving of incidents from the past or a
symbolic portrayal of important conflicts. </p>

<p> Third is the <i>cognitive psychedelic experience</i>,
characterized by astonishing lucid thought. Problems can be seen
from a novel perspective, and the inner relationships of many
levels or dimensions can be seen all at once. The creative
experience may have something in common with this kind of
psychedelic experience, but such a possibility must await the
results of future investigation. </p>

<p> Fourth is the <i>aesthetic psychedelic experience</i>,
characterized by a change and intensification of all sensory
modalities. Fascinating changes in sensations and perception can
occur: synesthesia in which sounds can be &quot;seen,&quot;
objects such as flowers or stones that appear to pulsate and
become &quot;alive,&quot; ordinary things that seem imbued with
great beauty, music that takes on an incredible emotional power,
and visions of beautiful colors, intricate geometric patterns,
architectural forms, landscapes, and almost anything imaginable. </p>

<p> The fifth and last type of psychedelic experience may
ultimately prove to be the most valuable and is the focus in
regard to treatment of the dying patient. This experience has
been called by various names: <i>psychedelic-peak; cosmic,
transcendental</i>, or <i>mystical</i>. Nine universal
psychological characteristics were derived from a study of the
literature of spontaneous mystical experience reported throughout
world history from almost all cultures and religions. When
subjected to a scientific experiment, these characteristics
proved to be identical for spontaneous and psychedelic mystical
experiences. <a name="back4"></a><a href="#footnote4">(4,5)</a> </p>

<p> 1. <i>Unity</i> is a sense of cosmic oneness achieved through
positive ego transcendence. Although the usual sense of identity,
or ego, fades away, consciousness and memory are not lost;
instead, the person becomes very much aware of being part of a
dimension much vaster and greater than himself. In addition to
the route of the &quot;inner world&quot; where external sense
impressions are left behind, unity can also be experienced
through the external world, so that a person reports that he
feels a part of everything that is (for example, objects, other
people, or the universe), or more simply, that &quot;all is
One.&quot; </p>

<p> 2. <i>Transcendence of Time and Space</i> means that the
subject feels beyond past, present, and future, and beyond
ordinary three-dimension space in a realm of eternity or
infinity. </p>

<p> 3. <i>Deeply Felt Positive Mood</i> contains the elements of
joy, blessedness, peace and love to an overwhelming degree of
intensity, often accompanied by tears. </p>

<p> 4. <i>Sense of Sacredness</i> is a nonrational, intuitive,
hushed, palpitant response of awe and wonder in the presence of
inspiring Reality. The main elements are awe, humility, and
reverence, but the terms of traditional theology or religion need
not necessarily be used in the description. </p>

<p> 5. <i>The Noetic Quality</i>, as named by William James, <a
name="back6"></a><a href="#footnote6">(6)</a> is a feeling of
insight or illumination that, on an intuitive, nonrational level
and with a tremendous force of certainty, subjectively has the
status of Ultimate Reality. This knowledge is not an increase of
facts but is a gain in psychological, philosophical, or
theological insight. </p>

<p> 6. <i>Paradoxicality</i> refers to the logical contradictions
that become apparent if descriptions are strictly analyzed. A
person may realize that he is experiencing, for example, an
&quot;identity of opposites,&quot; yet it seems to make sense at
the time, and also afterwards. </p>

<p> 7. <i>Alleged ineffability</i> means that the experience is
felt to be beyond words, non-verbal, and impossible to describe;
yet most persons who insist on the ineffability do in fact make
elaborate attempts to communicate the experience. </p>

<p> 8. <i>Transiency</i> means that the psychedelic peak does not
last in its full intensity, but instead passes into an afterglow
and remains only as a memory. </p>

<p> 9. <i>Persisting Positive Changes in Attitudes and Behavior</i>
are toward self, others, life, and the experience itself. </p>

<p> All the research I have done with psychedelic drugs for the
past six years supports the hypothesis that the kind of
experience is strongly dependent upon the necessary drug dosage,
but only as a trigger or facilitating agent, and upon the crucial
extra-drug variables of set and setting. Psychological set refers
to factors within the subject, such as personality, life history,
expectation, preparation, mood prior to the session, and, perhaps
most important of all the ability to trust, to let go, and to be
open to whatever comes. The setting refers to factors outside the
individual, such as the physical environment in which the drug is
taken, the psychological and emotional atmosphere to which the
subject is exposed, how he is treated by those around him, and
what the experimenter expects the drug reaction will be. </p>

<p> Elements of all these kinds of psychedelic experiences may
appear in any one psychedelic session, but the psychedelic
mystical experience is the most rare, being achieved by only 25
to 50 per cent of subjects, even under the most optimal
conditions of set and setting. The more control that is gained
over these variables, the more predictable is the chance of
obtaining the psychedelic mystical experience, but it is by no
means automatic. Yet when such an event is experienced and then
adequately integrated, it can provide the fulcrum for
transformations of attitude and behavior. <center></p>

<h4>The Procedure of Psychedelic Psychotherapy<br>
in our Current Research with the Dying Patient</h4>
</center>

<p> At the Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. we have been
assessing the impact of psychedelic psychotherapy utilizing LSD,
in the management of terminal cancer patients. <a name="back7"></a><a
href="#footnote7">(7)</a> An LSD session is imbedded within the
matrix of brief intensive psychotherapy. Every effort is made to
maximize the possibility for the psychedelic mystical experience
to occur. </p>

<p> After a patient is referred for the special treatment, he is
screened both by psychiatric interviews and by psychological
tests. Then an informed consent is obtained in writing from both
the patient and his closest relative. By informed consent, I mean
that the nature and aim of the research are explained, including
the possible risks and benefits. Because of the sensationalism in
the mass media about the dangers of LSD, most patients do not
suffer from lack of information about risks. In fact, their
exaggerated ideas make a positive preparation more difficult, and
some patients who might benefit greatly refuse to participate in
the research because of fear. Most patients are surprised to
learn that the safety record of LSD when given by trained
personnel under medically controlled conditions is comparable to
that of other commonly used psychiatric procedures. <a
name="back8"></a><a href="#footnote8">(8)</a> </p>

<p> Patients are told that LSD will not cure their physical
illness, hut may give them more emotional strength to cope with
what lies ahead. Usually control of pain is one of the presenting
problems. Although most of our patients have some degree of
physical pain, we try to emphasize that the analgesic effect of
LSD cannot he guaranteed and is not the main reason for the
treatment. </p>

<p> After consent is obtained, preparation for the LSD session
begins in the form of intensive individual psychotherapy for 8 to
10 hours. The aim is to get to know the person in as much depth
as possible by reviewing his life story and his important past
and current interpersonal relationships. Into this discussion
inevitably come his philosophy of life, religious experiences,
and hopes for the future. No attempt is made to force a
discussion of diagnosis or prognosis: but any indication of a
desire to explore these areas is sensitively dealt with in a way
appropriate to each individual. Above all the development of deep
rapport and trust is essential before LSD can he safely given. </p>

<p> Family members, too, are drawn into the therapy both
individually and in groups, with and without the patient. Some of
the issues discussed are positive and negative feelings, the
quality of interpersonal relationships, communication with the
patient, fear of death, and concern about the future. Their
questions and fears about LSD also must be aired. </p>

<p> Finally, after days of preparations when the patient is
deemed ready, LSD is administered in a private hospital room,
decorated with flowers and objects which have meaning for the
patient. The therapist who has worked with the patient and a
trained psychiatric nurse are in constant attendance throughout
the 10 - to 12-hour session. For most of the day, the patient
listens to classical music through stereophonic high fidelity
earphones. The purpose of the music is to help him let go of his
usual ego controls and experience the unusual emotional awareness
which is possible under these conditions of altered brain
physiology. </p>

<p> In the evening, when the LSD effects have waned, the closest
family members visit the patient. These times can be an
opportunity for a gratifying emotional interchange. In the days
after the session, the patient is helped to integrate new
experiences, feelings, and insights. <center></p>

<h4>Results of our Research</h4>

<p> With this procedure thus far, we have treated only 17
patients in a pilot study with no control group. <a name="back9"></a><a
href="#footnote9">(9)</a> While not much weight can be given to
our tentative findings in any scientific sense some results can
be mentioned to stimulate our thinking in regard to our subject
here today&#151;man's approach to death and what may lie beyond. </p>

<p> Bearing in mind the inconclusiveness of our impressions, what
have we seen following the combined procedure of LSD plus
associated psychotherapy when measured against the situation
encountered at the beginning of treatment? First, no patients
seemed to have been harmed, even those who were physically quite
ill. In general, about one-third of the patients were not
particularly helped, one-third w ere helped somewhat, and
one-third were helped dramatically. </p>

<p> Let us look at the direction of the change, especially in
those patients who were helped the most. The LSD session seemed
to provide the focus around which a new situation could evolve in
the milieu provided by the psychotherapy. The most dramatic
effects came in the wake of psychedelic mystical experience.
There was a decrease in fear, anxiety, worry, and depression.
Sometimes the need for pain medications was lessened, but mainly
because the patient was able to tolerate what pain he had more
easily. There was an increase in serenity, peace, and calmness.
Most striking was a decrease in the fear of death. It seem as if
the mystical experience, by opening the patient to usually
untapped ranges of human consciousness, can provide a sense of
security that transcends even death. Once the patient is able to
release all the psychic energy which he has tied to the fear of
death and worry about the future, he seems able to live more
meaningfully in the present. He can turn his attention to the
things which have the most significance in the here and now. This
change of attitude has an effect on all the people around him.
The depth and intensity of interpersonal closeness can be
increased so that honesty and courage emerge in a joint
confrontation and acceptance of the total situation. </p>

<p> Let me illustrate some of the things I have seen by
describing an actual case. A 49-year- old woman with inoperable
cancer of the pancreas was brought to the hospital by her husband
and daughter when they could no longer tolerate her increasing
agony because of the intractable pain that was not satisfactorily
controlled by narcotic drugs. At this point, she was more like a
whimpering animal than a human being. In my work with the family
it soon became apparent that they were not only at the end of
their rope in regard to physical management of the patient but
were becoming increasingly concerned lest the patient discover
the true nature of her &quot;tumor&quot; and become even more
depressed than she already was. After I had gained his
confidence, the husband one day asked me directly if I did not
think that &quot;mercy killing&quot; was the most humane solution
in such cases. </p>

<p> After the usual period of screening and preparation, the
patient was given an LSD session that was filled with religious
symbolism and during which the patient reviewed many events of
her life. During part of the day the patient strongly felt the
presence of God and, through this experience, a sense of release
from guilt feelings about certain of her past actions. Although
the patient did not have a complete psychedelic mystical
experience, she carried a definite degree of psychedelic
afterglow into the evening fleeting with her family. Her mood was
brighter, and they noticed increased relaxation and peace of
mind. Her pain although still present, was controlled with
narcotic drugs and did not have the same disabling quality as
before admission to the hospital. </p>

<p> A few days after her LSD session, as I was sitting by her
bedside, the patient asked me directly, &quot;Doctor, I have been
wondering what really is the matter with me. Do I have
cancer?&quot; In this particular case the patient's personal
physician had advised me that neither he nor the family had felt
it wise to discuss the diagnosis. I asked the patient if she had
discussed the matter with her doctor. &quot;I have tried
to,&quot; she said, &quot;but everyone avoids my questions. I
think I do have cancer, because if I didn't they would say so
directly.&quot; I then proceeded to explore with the patient the
meaning of such a diagnosis for her if it were, indeed true.
Discussing the question posed in this half-hypothetical manner,
the patient indicated that if she did have cancer, she would have
to learn to live with it and accept it as a fact of her life. At
that very moment we heard the voice of the patient's physician in
the hallway. The patient asked me to get him. After I had advised
him of the nature of the preceding discussion, we entered the
room together. Without too much hesitation, the patient posed for
him the same question she had asked me, &quot;Is this tumor that
I have a cancer?&quot; He answered, &quot;Well, it's
cancerous.&quot; &quot;But is it a cancer?&quot; she insistently
asked. When he indicated that it was, she gave a sigh and said:
&quot;Well, it's a relief to know what I really have, even though
it isn't good news.&quot; Then she asked with some concern:
&quot;Do my family know and have they known all along?&quot; He
nodded, and she sank back on the bed half in amusement and half
in disgust, saying, &quot;And they wouldn't even tell me.&quot; </p>

<p> In talking with the husband and daughter that afternoon, I
informed them what had happened. The news upset them even when
they learned that the patient had taken it calmly. They felt
unmasked and wondered how they could face the patient. They could
not quite believe that she could have accepted it so well and
felt that there would be an emotional &quot;scene.&quot; After
discussing their feeling about the issue, I suggested that we go
and see the patient together. As we neared the room, the daughter
became visibly upset and at the doorway refused to go in. After
more discussion she reluctantly agreed, and we entered the room
together. </p>

<p> As soon as the patient saw her husband, she smiled and said:
&quot;Well, I guess you know now that I'm going to die.&quot;
With this the husband broke down and began to sob uncontrollably.
The patient stretched out her arms inviting him to come to her
bedside. <i>She</i> took him in her arms and consoled <i>him</i>,
explaining that we all have to die sometime, that she was
grateful for what life had given her, and that she was sure they
would all get through this together. A sense of relief and
intense interpersonal closeness pervaded the room. </p>

<p> Before the patient left the hospital she had a second LSD
session. This time one of the major concerns that she explored
was the way she would explain to her young grandchildren what was
happening to her and what the ultimate outcome would be. This was
an issue which the daughter had also discussed with me. She
wondered whether she should even let the children see their
grandmother, who was becoming progressively emaciated. During the
LSD session the patient had a vision of all her grandchildren
standing by her beside. She had a very intense experience of
positive emotional feelings of love which she had for these
children and yet was able to come to a resolution of what she
could share with them in the days ahead. </p>

<p> After discharge from the hospital, the patient's husband and
daughter were able to care for her satisfactorily at home during
the month before she died. Her pain was now adequately controlled
with the aid of narcotics, but the daughter remarked on how much
better her mother seemed to be able to bear the pain than
previously. The patient was able to see her grandchildren for
some time each day, and they understood what was happening as she
got progressively weaker. They took this opportunity to discuss
with her some of their own questions about death, and
particularly her own death. <center></p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
</center>

<p> At this point let us turn our attention to the question of
why the psychedelic mystical experience seems to help these
patients. I suggest that this experience has the potential for
opening up the channels of positive feeling which may have been
previously closed or clogged. Our experiments have indicated that
deep within every human being there are vast usually untapped
resources of love, joy, and peace. One aspect of the psychedelic
mystical experience is a release of these positive feelings with
subsequent decrease in negative feelings of depression, despair,
and anxiety. But this shift in mood is not enough to account for
our most dramatic finding&#151;loss of the fear of death. In
fact, the experience of deeply felt positive mood may be more the
result than the cause of this change in attitude toward death.
Our data show that these feelings are released most fully when
there is complete surrender to the ego-loss experience of
positive ego transcendence, which is often experienced as a
moment of death and rebirth. At this point, unless the patient
previously had experienced mystical consciousness spontaneously,
he becomes intensely aware of completely new dimensions of
experience which he might never before have imagined possible.
From his own personal experience, he now knows that there is more
to the potential range of human consciousness than we ordinarily
realize. This profound and awe-inspiring insight sometimes is
experienced as if a veil had been lifted and can transform
attitude and behavior. Once a person has had this vision, life
and death can be looked at from a new perspective. Patients seem
able to meet the unknown with a new sense of self-confidence and
security. Logical arguments that human experience must be limited
to the narrow range of ordinary human consciousness never can
have the same force again. One patient, after his LSD experience,
wondered how he could have been so worried about death, which now
seemed to be just another step in the life process. Others
frankly and calmly stated that they would be &quot;ready to
go&quot; when the time to die came. This degree of acceptance and
willingness to face the unknown ahead was in strong contrast to
the atmosphere of fear among the family and patient before
psychedelic psychotherapy was started. </p>

<p> Before discussing the relevance of the psychedelic mystical
experience to immortality it would be well to review what William
James said in his Ingersoll Lecture 70 years ago. <a
name="back10"></a><a href="#footnote10">(10)</a> In his view the
brain is a filter of consciousness which transmits part of the
Vaster Consciousness of Reality, like a partially opaque glass
allowing through a few rays of a super solar blaze. The
&quot;degree of opacity&quot; or threshold of brain activity can
vary so that under certain conditions &quot;more light&quot; or
an awareness of a wider and more intense range of consciousness
is possible. According to this hypothesis, the physical brain is
necessary only as a means to transmit a part of this Larger
Consciousness into the dimension of ordinary reality perceived by
individual normal waking consciousness. If an individual brain is
damaged, disintegrates, or dies, this Larger Consciousness does
not cease. </p>

<p> The interesting thing is that our LSD patients who have had
the psychedelic mystical experience and who previously knew
nothing of this transmission theory are supplying data which
precisely fit this hypothesis. Their threshold seems to be
lowered so that they directly experience this Vaster
Consciousness in an Eternal Now, beyond time and space. Again and
again we are told that this experience subjectively occurs
&quot;out of the body.&quot; </p>

<p> But what is the relationship of individual self-consciousness
of the abiding presence of this Vaster Consciousness? William
James did not settle this question nor can I, but again the
psychedelic mystical experience may provide some clues. During
the mystical experience when the experiencer has lost
individuality and become a part of a Reality Greater-than-self,
paradoxically, something of the self remains to record the
experience in memory. One of the greatest fears about human death
is that personal individual existence and memory will be gone
forever. Yet having passed through psychological ego death in the
mystical experience, a person still preserves enough
self-consciousness so that at least part of individual memory is
not lost. In comparison, the loss of other attributes of
individuality such as bodily sensations and personal ego
accomplishments do not appear too important. It is at least
suggestive that persons experiencing mystical consciousness do
not feel that they have &quot;lost&quot; anything crucial&#151;in
fact, a common report is that they have &quot;come home&quot; and
regained proper perspective. </p>

<p> By now I hope it is clear that LSD used in conjunction with
psychedelic psychotherapy is not another chemo-therapeutic method
to achieve a euphoric death, such as increasing doses of
painkillers which have a dulling effect on consciousness. With
such narcotics an escape is provided from harsh and painful
reality, but such cherished human experiences as love and
interpersonal closeness are not particularly enhanced. If the
fear surrounding death is dealt with at all, it is by sedating
the patient so much that he may be unaware of what is really
happening. </p>

<p> In contrast, when LSD is judiciously used, the mind becomes
more active and alert. Problems concerning death can be dealt
with rather than escaped from. Positive emotions can be released
in the service of deepened interpersonal relationships. An
important distinction is that LSD is not used on a continuing
basis. The purpose is not to keep the patient continuously under
the effect of LSD. One treatment is sometimes enough to make a
lasting difference. Even repeated treatments are spaced to allow
time for meaningful integration of the experience. Our data thus
far have indicated that the earlier LSD is given in the course of
the disease, the better chance there is for the patient to
utilize any insights gained. Although the treatment may prepare a
patient for death, the quality of living in the days before death
can be also affected. </p>

<p> Let me illustrate: one of our patients with metastatic breast
cancer had a son in his early twenties. His first bitter reaction
when the possibility of LSD treatment was mentioned was,
&quot;What do you want to do, make my mother die with a smile on
her face?&quot; Much to his surprise, the most important effect
of the treatment was to establish their somewhat ruptured
relationship on a new creative level. Now, five months after her
only treatment, this patient is still working on the implications
of this positive change in her family situation . </p>

<p> Does this treatment threaten to manipulate the human mind in
an unethical and dehumanizing manner? If by manipulation we mean
that human begins are used for purposes to which they neither
consent nor understand, the answer is no. Just the opposite is
true. The goal is to help the patient become more fully human and
able to use the last days of his life in a meaningful way&#151;in
fact, a way which highlights the very things most basic and
important: human love, sharing, closeness, and thoughtful
reflection about the meaning and events of human life. As one of
our patients put it: &quot;You get a clear picture of what is
important and what isn't. All the rushing around and the worry
about keeping my house neat was so unimportant compared to the
expression of feelings toward my family. I now fully realize that
the core of life is love.&quot; </p>

<p> In an ethical consideration of any new experimental
procedure, the proportionate degree of risk compared to the
potential benefit must be considered. From what we have seen in
our research so far, the benefits in human terms have been
impressive, the risks minimal. The danger of LSD depends on how
it is used. As Dr. Albert Kurland, who is responsible for all the
LSD projects at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, has
indicated, the role of LSD in therapy is like that of a scalpel
in surgical intervention: the scalpel is helpful, but without the
skilled surgeon it is merely a dangerous instrument. <a
name="back11"></a><a href="#footnote11">(11)</a> </p>

<p> One consequence of the mystical experience is the inevitable
attempt to make intellectual sense of it. The primary
psychological experience must be interpreted. While some persons
use such symbols as a More, a Beyond, or the Ground of Being,
other speak of the presence of God as the most adequate
reflection of what was encountered. The fact that this experience
was triggered or facilitated with a drug may cause some to feel
uneasy. The troublesome implication seems to be that God can thus
be controlled, limited, or manipulated. Yet the psychedelic
mystical experience is by no means automatic, and there are many
unexplained factors. All chemical substances, including LSD, are
part of God's creation. Man, of course, has the freedom to misuse
or abuse them, but the use of LSD to give comfort to the dying
patient hardly seems an abuse. For man to decide that God cannot
work through any part of his creation would be to limit the
freedom and omnipotence of God. <a name="back12"></a><a
href="#footnote12">(12)</a> </p>

<p> That such profound experiences are possible with the aid of a
drug may seem on first impression to be an easy and somewhat
sacrilegious means of &quot;instant salvation.&quot; On the
contrary, much intensive preparation is needed for the
psychedelic mystical experience to occur at all. Then, perhaps
even more importantly, the work of follow-up integration is
necessary for the experience to be therapeutically useful rather
than only a pleasant memory. Yet, subjectively, there is also a
profound feeling of gratitude because such an experience seems
undeserved. The concept of gratuitous grace as another example of
God's freedom is appropriate here. </p>

<p> The mystical experience itself by emphasizing an immediate
perception of the Divine dimension has historically met
opposition from the church. Mysticism has also always been
accused of pantheism. Yet the indwelling of the Spirit is as
deeply rooted in Christian tradition as the absolute
transcendence of God. <center></p>

<h4>Implications</h4>
</center>

<p> What implications would there be if further research
substantiates the promise that psychedelic psychotherapy has
shown in the treatment of the dying patient? In my own work I
have welcomed the collaboration of religious professionals, part
of whose job is ministering to the dying. In our modern age this
task has become increasingly difficult because of the growing
dissatisfaction with traditional formulations and beliefs. The
psychedelic mystical experience has the potential for opening up
new ways of thinking and feeling. Patients are eager to discuss
the meaning of these new insights, many of which are imbedded in
religious symbolism. Ministers, priests, and rabbis, if they have
some understanding of the use of psychedelic drugs, can be of
tremendous help in integrating these experiences. </p>

<p> In the future it might be possible to establish centers where
dying patients could be sent to have a psychedelic experience in
the most optimal setting. The staff of such a place would include
psychiatrists, psychologists, and religious professionals. This
suggestion is not as utopian as it might sound. Dr. Cecily
Saunders in England has already pioneered a successful center
where medical treatment is given to keep dying patients as
comfortable as possible in their last days. <a name="back13"></a><a
href="#footnote13">(13)</a> LSD has not been tried there, but
adequate doses of alcohol and heroin are used to combat
depression and pain. Our preliminary results suggest that
psychedelic drugs might accomplish much more. Certainly this
hypothesis can be tested experimentally . </p>

<p> If the use of psychedelic psychotherapy for the dying patient
ever should become widespread in our society, there would
probably be a change in our whole approach toward death. There
might be less fear and more acceptance of this part of the life
process. Certainly more honesty and less pretense would be a
healthy change for our culture. <center></p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
</center>

<p> Although the question of human immortality may always remain
a tantalizing enigma. the psychedelic mystical experience at
least teaches that there is more to the range of human
consciousness than we might ordinarily assume. Because the answer
cannot be definitely proved either way, there is certainly no
cause for pessimistic despair. Perhaps it is not so unfortunate
that each person must ultimately find out for himself. The
psychedelic mystical experience can prepare one to face that
moment with a sense of open adventure.</p>

<p> <a name="footnote8"></a>8 In the several large-scale research
projects which have been approved by the U.S. Government in the
last few years, permanent adverse effects have been quite rare.
At the Spring Grove State Hospital, for example, over 300
patients have been treated with LSD without a single case of
long-term psychological or physical harm directly attributable to
the treatment, although there have been two transient post-LSD
disturbances which have subsequently responded well to
conventional treatment. <a href="#back8">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="footnote9"></a>9 The fact that there was no control
group against which to measure these results immediately raises
the possibility that our findings were due to powerful suggestion
implemented by the intensive psychotherapy rather than anything
to do with the administration of LSD. It might be argued that a
placebo control group would attain the same results, but other
experimental evidence concerning the occurrence of psychedelic
mystical experience tends to cast some doubt on this argument. In
two previous series of psychedelic drug experiments that I have
helped to plan and supervise, double blind control groups <i>were</i>
utilized. In each instance the psychedelic mystical experience
occurred to a statistically significant degree in those persons
who received a high dose of psilocybin when compared to control
groups which had exactly the same preparation, expectation, and
suggestion, but received only a placebo or control substance with
active physiological effects. (W. N. PAHNKE, thesis, <i>op. cit</i>.;
and W. N. PAHNKE, LSD and Religious Experience, <i>op. cit</i>.) </p>

<p> Consideration of the powerful placebo effect is certainly
important. Recent research has demonstrated that giving LSD
mainly as a chemotherapy without adequate preparation and
suggestion does not provide any advantage over psychotherapy
alone in the treatment of alcoholism. (A LUDWIG, J. LEVINE, and
L. STARK, A Clinical Evaluation of LSD Treatment in Alcoholism,
Paper presented to the American Psychiatric Association meeting
in Boston, Massachusetts, May 15, 1968.) </p>

<p> This finding underlines the importance of utilizing
suggestion to the maximum in combination with LSD as has been our
practice. For example, at the Spring Grove State Hospital in
Baltimore, the double blind control study of psychedelic peak
therapy utilizing LSD has demonstrated that one out of four
alcoholics who received 450 micrograms of LSD had a profound
mystical experience compared to one out of ten who received only
50 micrograms (total N = 122). Both groups received exactly the
same amount of pre-LSD psychotherapy and identical preparation
for the LSD session. In this particular study the results in
terms of clinical outcome are not yet completely evaluated, but
early trends in the data show that those patients who had a
profound psychedelic peak experience achieved greater clinical
improvement. (A. KURLAND, S. UNGER, C. SAVAGE, J. OLSSON, W.
PAHNKE, Psychedelic Therapy Utilizing LSD in the Treatment of the
Alcoholic Patient: A Progress Report paper presented to the
American Psychiatric Association meeting in Boston,
Massachusetts, May 15, 1968.) </p>

<p> Thus, in the research with cancer patients there is reason to
suppose that the beneficial results observed are not due to
either the psycho-pharmacological effects of LSD or the placebo
effect (suggestion and preparation) <i>alone,</i> but rather a
combination of set, setting, and drug. For the best results it
seems essential that the placebo effect be utilized to the utmost
in conjunction with the psychedelic drug which is then seen to be
a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. <a href="#back9">(back)</a>

<p> <a name="footnote12"></a>12 Those who have lived fully and
deeply know that suffering can have a redemptive value in terms
of personal growth and understanding. Yet in my medical
experience the slow and tortuous devastation to the human spirit
caused by the usual course of terminal cancer is mostly on the
negative side. Reflecting my bias as a physician dedicated to the
alleviation of suffering, I do not feel that this kind of
emotional and physical torment serves much useful purpose. For
this reason, I feel that the addition of psychedelic drugs to the
medical armamentarium against human suffering cannot be objected
to on the grounds that man has no right to interfere with an
element of human life which may serve a useful purpose in God's
plan for man's development. Such an argument is too similar to
the theological objections raised against the introduction of
smallpox vaccination or the invention of rapid transportation. <a

<h2 align="center">PERCEPTION AND KNOWLEDGE</h2>

<h4 align="center">Reflections on Psychological and Spiritual
Learning<br>
in the Psychedelic Experience</h4>

<h4 align="center">Frances E. Vaughan</h4>

<hr>

<p>Little controlled research has been done with psychedelics.
But my own experience, coupled with my observation of hundreds of
clients, students, and acquaintances who have used LSD in both
controlled and uncontrolled settings, has convinced me that we
have much to learn from appropriate investigation of this
powerful mind-altering chemical. The dearth of research has not
lessened the impact of psychedelic experiences on people's lives
and on the culture at large. Psychology in general has failed to
keep pace with personal explorations in altered states of
consciousness, many of them induced by LSD or similar psychedelic
substances. </p>

<p>In the past decade, transpersonal psychology has emerged as
that branch of psychology specifically concerned with the study
of human consciousness. It attempts to expand the field of
psychological inquiry to include such human experiences as those
induced by psychedelics, as well as similar states attained
through the practice of meditation or other disciplines. As a
transpersonal psychologist, I have been particularly interested
in the study of consciousness as it pertains to psychological
health and wellbeing. My clinical practice is devoted to
facilitating human growth and development, often on the border
between psychological and spiritual domains . </p>

<p>My personal introduction to LSD occurred under optimum
conditions. In his book, <i>LSD Psychotherapy</i>,(1) Dr.
Stanislav Grof observes that normal people benefit most when
participating in a supervised psychedelic program, and that the
experience can move them in the direction of selfactualization.
My own experience supports this view. As a subject in early LSD
research, I was thoroughly screened and well prepared. I had also
had an opportunity to talk with other subjects who felt they had
benefited. My first session was a profound and overwhelming
mystical experience. Subsequent sessions seemed less important,
but served as reminders of insights gained in the initial one. </p>

<p>A most striking feature of my psychedelic experience was the
noetic quality of consciousness as it expanded from its usual
perceptual range to a vast contextual awareness that recognized
the relativity of all perception in space/time. I find the term <i>re-cognize</i>
particularly appropriate, since the knowledge that was suddenly
revealed to me under LSD seemed to be remembered rather than
learned. I was awed by the vast range of consciousness, yet felt
that I was simply uncovering what I had always known, i.e. the
truth which had previously been hidden behind a veil of relative
unconsciousness. As the illusory, changeable nature of ordinary
reality became increasingly clear, I also realized how a normally
constricted perceptual framework permits one to see only a
fraction of reality, inevitably distorted to suit personal
projections and presuppositions. </p>

<p>During the experience, I felt I understood what mystics
throughout the ages have claimed to be the universal truth of
existence. I had an academic background in philosophy and
comparative religion, but I realized that mystical teachings had
now taken on an added dimension. My perception seemed to have
shifted from a flat, two-dimensional intellectual understanding
of the literature, to a three-dimensional sense of immersion in
the mystical reality. </p>

<p>The perennial philosophy and the esoteric teachings of all
time suddenly made sense. I understood why spiritual seekers were
instructed to look within, and the unconscious was revealed to be
not just a useful concept, but an infinite reservoir of creative
potential. I felt I had been afforded a glimpse into the nature
of reality and the human potential within that reality, together
with a direct experience of being myself, free of illusory
identifications and constrictions of consciousness. My
understanding of mystical teachings, both Eastern and Western,
Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Sufi alike, took a quantum leap.
I became aware of the transcendental unity at the core of all the
great religions, and understood for the first time the meaning of
ecstatic states. </p>

<p>I now felt I had had some direct experience of the ineffable
realms of union with God, and I discovered that my
dissatisfaction with conventional religion was not due to the
death of God, as some theologians proclaimed, but rather to the
impoverished concepts of God currently in vogue. Whether one
spoke of God, the Void, or the Self, Being, Bliss, or
Consciousness, did not matter, for the words were so far removed
from the experience that they were only fingers pointing to the
moon; they bore little resemblance to the depth of realization
that became available when I let go of my preconceptions about
the nature of the universe. As far as I knew, such insights into
the nature of consciousness had only been attained by rare
individuals, many of them advanced practitioners of spiritual
disciplines . </p>

<p>The world view that made most sense of this experience was
clearly a mystical one. Neither the subjective nor the objective
pole of experience could encompass the totality. The possibility
of transcending boundaries between self and other, the illusory
nature of ego, the interdependence of opposites, the relative
nature of dualism and the resolution of paradox in transcendence
became clear. All mental content was simply the play or the dance
of life, and what could be known about consciousness became the
focus of my attention. Psychodynamic material that came into
awareness seemed irrelevant. My own personal drama was no more
significant than light playing on a movie screen. Even feelings
of joy, ecstasy, and liberation in letting go of attachments were
less important than the insight and sense of knowing, or
remembering, inexpressible truth. &quot;Know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free&quot; were the words that seemed best
to capture the nature of my experience. I felt free to be exactly
who I was, free of fear and social constraints, and filled with
love and compassion for all beings. </p>

<p>Although many of the insights that flooded my awareness were
forgotten, many remained to influence my life. I felt I could see
how much human suffering is self-imposed, how our beliefs shape
our reality, and what it means to awaken to the realization that
life is a dream of our own making. The dreamlike quality of
existence, the unreality of past memories and future fantasies,
and the acceptance of the interrelatedness of all things were
insights subsequently confirmed as I learned more of the
perennial teachings of both Eastern and Western contemplative
traditions. </p>

<p>I also gained a new appreciation for the Christian teaching of
forgiveness. I saw how our own condemnation injures us, and how
our difficulty in forgiving ourselves for imagined imperfections
contributes to neurotic guilt and anxiety. Not only did I feel
forgiven for being just as I was, I saw that in reality there was
nothing to forgive. This seemed to remove the obstacles to the
experience of love and I felt an extension of love and
forgiveness to all beings everywhere. </p>

<p>The subjective nature of time also became starkly apparent. My
Newtonian world view was sufficiently shaken to make it
relatively easy for me to accept some of the more apparently
nonsensical propositions of the new subatomic physics, when they
later came to my attention. Likewise, parapsychological phenomena
no longer seemed incomprehensible. The fact that we could not
explain part of our human experience in the existing paradigm
seemed to indicate that the paradigm needed re-examination rather
than to justify dismissal of the evidence. </p>

<p>For the first time, I understood the meaning of
&quot;ineffable.&quot; There seemed to be no possibility of
conveying in words the subjective truth of my experience. A veil
had been lifted from my inner vision, and I felt able to see, not
just images or forms, but the nature of truth itself. The doors
of perception were so cleansed, they seemed to vanish altogether,
and there was only infinite being. Krishnamurti's
characterization of truth as a pathless land seemed an
appropriate description of this domain. </p>

<p>I felt that I had now experienced the grace of God. Truly I
had been given a gift of infinite worth. I could understand why
human beings throughout history have relentlessly pursued truth
and sought enlightenment. I knew now why some felt impelled to
sit in caves for years trying to become enlightened, why some
were willing to die for ideals, and why suffering was endured. If
asceticism was perceived as a means of attaining this state of
oneness, I could understand why a person might choose it. I
understood that the essence of my being was identical with the
timeless essence of every living thing, that formlessness was the
essence of form, that the whole universe was reflected in every
psyche, and that my separateness was only an illusion, a dream
from which I had, in this moment, fully awakened. </p>

<p>As I faced old fears and watched the tricks of my mind, I
became increasingly aware of my ability to choose my subjective
state. Consciousness seemed infinitely plastic. I could choose to
focus the lens of attention on anything. Barriers and resistances
had dissolved, and fears had disappeared along with them. In that
moment I knew that I had nothing to fear. Only the creations of
my own mind and my own thoughtforms could threaten me, and I
could see them as if in a lucid dream, parading through the field
of awareness. I was free to either attend to them or let them
pass, choosing instead to experience more fully the bliss of pure
being, just being present to my experience of the moment, with no
added fantasy or distraction. </p>

<p>The affective tone of my experience was pure love. After the
barriers dissolved, I could feel the depth of my love for life
itself, and for my husband and children. They seemed perfect just
as they were, yet I did not need them and therefore felt no fear
or possessiveness. Life itself was enough. I too, was complete
and acceptable just as I was. Old feelings of inadequacy and
uncertainty had vanished. </p>

<p>My aesthetic sensibilities were profoundly enhanced, not only
during the few hours of the session, but afterwards as well. This
effect has lasted over a period of 15 years. My appreciation of
music, art, nature, and human beings has continued to grow since
that time. I remember being particularly struck by the joy of
hearing music as I never had heard it before. I could laugh at my
old self-image, which included &quot;not being musical. &quot; I
was deeply moved by each piece of music that was played. As I
listened without distraction, each one evoked a different aspect
of my psyche, and at the center of each was the perfect still
point of pure being where one could experience union with God. </p>

<p>I gained a new appreciation of my own capacity for choice and
the role of consciousness in creating experience. For the first
time I saw the possibility of taking responsibility for my own
experience. I also felt I was truly participating fully in the
universal human condition. All of my experience, including the
experience of separateness and aloneness, was something I had in
common with all human beings. Although my personal history and
the events of my life were unique, the underlying unity of life
became starkly evident. The forms of expression and experience
were diverse, but the underlying qualities of being were
universal. </p>

<p>I also felt a reduction in nonspecific anxiety, and a greatly
diminished fear of death. As the illusory nature of many of my
worries and fears became apparent, I became more trusting and
accepting of myself, and more willing to enter into unfamiliar
situations and take risks in exploring new creative endeavors. As
I was released from feelings of neurotic guilt and inadequacy, my
increased ability to relax also contributed to enhanced sexual
enjoyment. My appreciation of life itself and of the simple tasks
of everyday living was also profoundly enhanced. I found myself
more open in my intimate relationships, and better able to give
and receive love without fear. </p>

<p>I also became aware of a desire to be of service in the world,
to make some contribution to humanity through my work. At the
same time I felt more able to tolerate paradox and ambiguity. The
recognition of the interdependence of opposites has since become
a useful therapeutic tool in my practice; I often think of
psychological growth as a balance and synthesis of opposites. In
working with others to heal internal splits and conflicts,
enabling them to take increasing responsibility for their own
lives and wellbeing, I have had many opportunities to appreciate
the importance of this capacity. </p>

<p>The effects of this experience seemed to me equivalent to what
I might have expected from several years of insight therapy. I
had been able to see through and let go of many constricting
patterns of thought and behavior that previously seemed automatic
and beyond conscious control. Some of the far-reaching effects
appeared immediately in my personal life. For several months
after this experience I remained in a semi-euphoric state in
which I experienced being in love all the time. Everything in my
life seemed to be exactly as it was supposed to be. Everything
was all right. None of the small things I used to get upset about
seemed to matter any more. I was experiencing a state of inner
peace and serenity that allowed me to cope more effectively with
everything I needed to do, while I felt in touch with a sense of
divinity within. </p>

<p>This period of my life coincided with what seemed to be a time
of new hope for humankind. The flower children in San Francisco
were happily rebelling against the old order, and a better future
seemed within reach. A sense of euphoria was in the air; the more
sordid side of psychedelia became apparent only as time went by.
My interest in understanding the experience led me to graduate
school to study psychology, but I soon found that Western
psychological models could not accommodate it. Yet I knew I was
not unique. Many other people were reporting similar experiences.
Eastern consciousness disciplines seemed to offer the best maps
of this inner world, and they also offered instruction for
attaining such states without the use of chemicals. Now I could
hear, as if for the first time, the depth of the wisdom in their
teachings and in the mystical doctrines of all ages and all
cultures. As I sought for words to express my own ineffable
experience I gained a new appreciation for those individuals who
had attempted to communicate their own insights in writing or
art. I also became interested in understanding intuitive ways of
knowing; many years later I wrote a book about the development of
intuition, entitled <i>Awakening Intuition</i>.(2) </p>

<p>My intellect was eager to incorporate what I had learned into
working psychological models. I saw a need to formulate new
psychological theories that could encompass such experiences.
Among Western psychologists, only Carl Jung had addressed
transpersonal experiences. He wrote, &quot; . . . The fact is
that the approach to the numinous is the real therapy and
inasmuch as you attain to the numinous experience you are
released from the curse of pathology.&quot;(3) That was
apparently true of my experience, but it later became clear that
a psychedelic experience in and of itself was not necessarily
therapeutic. The popularity of psychedelics increased greatly,
but few of their users achieved the therapeutic benefits I had
experienced. </p>

<p>In his extensive research on LSD psychotherapy, Stanislav Grof
noted that transpersonal experiences occur only rarely in early
sessions of psychedelic therapy, but are quite common in advanced
sessions. (1,4) Grof has provided a detailed map of the
death/rebirth experience which he found to be therapeutic for
many of his subjects. The experience of ego-death may be
liberating and ecstatic, as it was for me, but it may also be
terrifying to a person who is unprepared. However, under
appropriate, carefully controlled conditions, a subject may be
enabled to surmount the difficulties encountered in letting go of
limiting self-identifications. </p>

<p>Phenomenologically, personal accounts of drug-induced mystical
experiences may be indistinguishable from spontaneously occurring
mystical experiences. In either case, the effects may or may not
last. The glimpse of a larger reality that such experience
affords may change a person's life if he or she chooses to
integrate it. If, however, the experience is repressed, denied,
or invalidated, it may only contribute to exacerbating
existential guilt and anxiety. When a person is not able to
stabilize such glimpses into transcendent reality and incorporate
them into existing belief systems, they can certainly disrupt the
ordinary adjustment of everyday life. </p>

<p>Transpersonal psychology (5,6,7) has attempted to formulate a
conceptual framework for such experiences, since they obviously
are not going to go away. Although psychedelics have been
restricted, the public continues to experiment, and research
continues to lag far behind. Moreover, the striking parallels
between such experiences and those described by mystics raise
many questions for mental health professionals. In the
transpersonal domain, where psychological and spiritual growth
are one, psychedelics appear to be powerful tools for the
investigation of consciousness; they could enable us to expand
our understanding of the human mind and the nature of creative
consciousness. A willingness to question our assumptions and to
keep an open mind with respect to potential benefits and
potential hazards is essential. </p>

<p>For the past 10 years I have been practicing transpersonal
psychotherapy and training therapists to work in this area. The
lack of serious study in the field of psychedelic drugs has
unfortunately restricted their use to uncontrolled personal
experimentation. The dearth of research is clearly a drawback
when therapists are so often called upon to handle situations
where clients have been involved in uncontrolled experimentation.
Although many people in our culture have taken psychedelics, few
therapists are capable of assessing, evaluating, and integrating
psychedelic experiences in a useful way. Psychedelics, like any
powerful tool, may be used skillfully for the benefit of
humanity, or unskillfully to the detriment of those whose
ignorance leads to abuse. </p>

<p>As we search for ways of understanding the possibly infinite
resources of human consciousness, I suggest that the potential of
psychedelics as tools for learning should not be ignored. Today,
when the survival of our planet is at stake, there is an urgent
need to work responsibly in every facet of human endeavor. By
refusing to tread where fools rushed in, we may be turning away
from significant learning about human experience and how the mind
works. People of differing views and persuasions must join
together in exploration of the universals of psychological health
and wellbeing and work to find ways of facilitating experiences
that foster growth toward wholeness for everyone. </p>

<h2 align="center">PSYCHEDELICS AND SELF-ACTUALIZATION</h2>

<h4 align="center">Roger Walsh, M.D.</h4>

<p align="center">From <i>Psychedelic Reflections</i>, Lester
Grinspoon and James B. Bakalar, editors<br>
copyright Human Sciences Press, 1983 </p>

<hr>

<p>In their letter soliciting contributions to this book, the
editors wrote, &quot;we came to the conclusion that psychedelic
drugs have influenced both the lives of individual users and
society in general more than is usually
acknowledged&#151;sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically.
&quot; I was delighted to receive their invitation, since these
words almost exactly expressed my own conclusions after 8 years
of psychiatric clinical and research work. For 5 of those 8 years
I have worked in areas such as the nature of psychological
well-being, non-Western psychologies and religions,
consciousness, and the effects of meditation. I have also
undertaken a personal study of meditative and non- Western
traditions, and I thus have had the opportunity of meeting,
interviewing, and studying with a wide range of people in these
related disciplines. </p>

<p>Whenever I came to know these people closely, the same story
would emerge: that although they rarely acknowledged it in
public, the psychedelics had played an important role in
introducing them to and facilitating their passage through these
disciplines. It occurred to me that this might well be a case of
what social scientists call &quot;plurality ignorance:&quot; a
situation in which each individual thinks he or she is the only
one doing something, although in fact the practice is widespread.
In this case, what seemed to be widely unrecognized was that
large numbers of people appear to have derived, at least from
their own point of view, significant benefits from psychedelics,
despite popular media accounts of their devastating dangers . </p>

<p>This suspicion was deepened by an encounter with the editor of
a prominent psychological journal. In an extensive review of
various Western and non-Western psychologies, I discussed the
data on psychedelics and concluded that there was evidence
suggesting that in some cases people might find them beneficial.
The journal editor was willing to accept the paper provided I
removed any reference to positive effects of psychedelics; he
thought that the journal could not afford to be associated with
such statements. I am familiar with this particular editor's work
and know that he is exceptionally open-minded. It appears that we
have in our culture, even in the scientific and professional
literature, a bias towards reporting only the negative effects of
psychedelics. </p>

<p>How, then, can we get a picture of the effects of psychedelics
when they are used for personal exploration and psychological
growth? One approach suggested by Abraham Maslow, but as yet
apparently untried in the area of psychedelics, is to ask people
who are exceptionally healthy and use them as bioassayers.
Maslow's technique was to identify those individuals who seemed
to be most fully actualizing their potential; he called them
self-actualizers. (1) He listed 13 characteristics, such as a
deep involvement in work, peak experiences, and a good sense of
humor, which identify individuals who have attained exceptional
psychological well-being. While this approach has many
advantages, it is not without its drawbacks and limitations. The
concept and criteria of self-actualization are by no means clear,
and they are largely lacking in research data and support;
individuals are chosen subjectively, with all the possible biases
which that entails. (2) However, in the absence of good empirical
tests of high level well-being, we are left for the present with
subjective judgments. </p>

<p>My research has given me the extraordinary gift of meeting
some very remarkable people: mental health professionals,
advanced meditators, teachers, gurus, holy people of both East
and West who have devoted a large part of their lives to mental
training and psychological growth. I have spent considerable time
with some of them, interviewing and being interviewed, receiving
instruction on various meditative practices, listening to their
talks, and socializing. As might be expected, there is a wide
range of personalities and psychological maturity. I was able to
interview in depth five of the very healthiest Westerners who fit
Maslow's criteria and are also successful and eminent in their
disciplines. </p>

<p>These four men and one woman range in age from their
mid-thirties to their forties. All have university degrees; three
are psychologists, and the other two are highly sophisticated
psychologically. Four are teachers, either of psychology or of
one of the consciousness disciplines such as meditation or
Buddhism. All have strong national reputations, and most have
international reputations; all have published at least one book.
I included the criterion of professional eminence in order to
insure that the people were competent and would not be dismissed
as irresponsible or as dropouts of any sort. </p>

<h4>Personal Experience</h4>

<p>Each of these five people has had multiple psychedelic
experiences. For three of them the psychedelic experience was
crucial in arousing their interest in the consciousness
disciplines and directing their professional careers. A fourth
received LSD for the first time as part of a legitimate research
experiment during the sixties, had a deep religious experience
which affirmed and deepened previously dormant interests and
values, and subsequently returned to school to pursue those
interests further. All five report that the psychedelics have
been important in their own growth and that they continue to find
them useful in the context of their own discipline. On the
average, they continue to use them two to three times per year,
but all have gone for extended periods without use. </p>

<h4>General Principles</h4>

<p>On the basis of their own personal experiences and what they
had learned from working with many people involved in various
psychological and consciousness disciplines, they suggested the
following general principles, advantages, and disadvantages of
psychedelics. </p>

<p>All agreed that they are very powerful tools and that the
effects depend very much on the person who uses them and the
skill with which they are used. They took it as self-evident that
there are many people who should not take psychedelics,
especially anyone with significant psychological disturbances.
However, they agreed that used skillfully by a mature person,
they could indeed be helpful. This meant an appropriate setting,
at least at the start, preferably under the guidance of someone
who is psychologically mature and psychedelically experienced; an
appropriate mental set and expectations, including a preceding
period of quiet and/or meditation; and most important,
involvement in a psychological or consciousness discipline aimed
at deep mental training. </p>

<h4>Possible Benefits</h4>

<p>The first benefit was the simple recognition that there are
realms of experience, modes of self, and states of consciousness
far beyond the ken of our day-to-day experience or our
traditional cultural and psychological models. These experiences
were often said to produce expanded belief systems, making people
less dogmatic and more open to as yet unexperienced or undreamt
realms of being. One common report was that each experience
tended to elicit a deeper realm and a more expanded sense of
consciousness and self, so that the previously expanded belief
system continued opening and widening. </p>

<p>For all five of the subjects mentioned here, and many of their
students, psychedelic experience produced a new interest in depth
psychology, religion, spirituality, and consciousness, as well as
related disciplines and practices such as meditation. All the
subjects believed that their psychedelic experiences had enhanced
their ability to understand these consciousness disciplines. In
particular, the esoteric core of the great religious and
spiritual traditions could be seen as roadmaps to higher states
of consciousness, and some of the most profound material in these
traditions became especially clear and meaningful during
psychedelic sessions. Several of the subjects reported that they
often put time aside during psychedelic sessions to listen to
tapes or readings from these traditions; they found these
experiences particularly important. This is compatible with the
Eastern claim that &quot;Religion is a learning in which a basic
requirement is 'First change your consciousness'.&quot; (3) </p>

<p>Most of the subjects felt that the psychedelic experience
could sometimes supply a guiding vision which provided direction
and meaning for one's life thereafter. They mentioned intense
emotions such as love, compassion, or empathy, and the
recognition that the mind can be and should be highly trained.
Three subjects mentioned another residual benefit. Someone who
has had a deep positive insight may be able to recall that
insight subsequently and use it to guide himself or herself
through a situation where it lends an additional useful
perspective, even though it is no longer directly available. </p>

<p>There was unanimous agreement that under appropriate
conditions the psychedelics could considerably speed and
facilitate the process of working through psychological blocks.
In some cases this involved material which was already being
worked on in an ordinary state of awareness, or could be. In
other cases, material inaccessible in an ordinary state could be
brought into awareness, sometimes producing dramatic
transformations including death/rebirth experiences and
alleviation of symptoms. Reviews of the therapeutic effects of
psychedelics have not shown clear-cut results, but of course it
is very difficult to detect experimentally significant effects of
a single intervention. </p>

<p>For some of the subjects the occasional use of psychedelics
provided a continuously deepening marker of their progress. No
matter how much mental training and psychological exploration
they had done, further realms of experience could be revealed by
the psychedelics. With each major advance in their mental
training, a new realm would open to them. An especially common
event was to experience something in a psychedelic drug session
which would recur months or years later in the context of a
mental training discipline and then spontaneously during daily
life. All five subjects believed that both psychedelics and their
mental disciplines suggested that the range of experiences which
occurred in daily living represented only a small slice of a
vast, perhaps unlimited, spectrum. </p>

<h4>Traps and Complications</h4>

<p>Although they themselves have had few serious problems with
the psychedelics, all five subjects thought that there were a
number of potential traps and complications. They viewed the
major protection against such difficulties as consisting in a
commitment to a mental training discipline and the availability
of an advanced teacher for consultation about both the
psychedelic experiences and the discipline. Not one of the five
subjects saw the psychedelics as constituting in and of
themselves a path which could lead to deep levels of
psychological-spiritual growth or true enlightenment. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the subjects did not see acute painful
reactions, such as anxiety attacks or fear of losing control, as
necessarily adverse. Rather, they held that with appropriate
expectations, previous work, and guidance, such reactions could
lead to deep and valuable insights. This is contrary to the
traditional psychiatric and emergency room perspective which sees
such reactions as purely pathological and requiring medication. </p>

<p>Hedonism was mentioned as one of the traps associated with
psychedelics. Using these chemicals for trivial sensory
stimulation was seen not as wrong, but as unskillful and
unfulfilling. The subjects also noted that it was possible to
become attached to the more pleasant experiences, marring later
sessions by inappropriate expectations and calculated attempts to
recreate those experiences. </p>

<p>Since psychedelic experiences can be extraordinarily intense,
there is some danger of not recognizing a fantasy for what it is.
As one subject noted, it is not always easy to discern which
experiences are valid, especially for people who are
intellectually and psychologically sophisticated. Again, the best
remedy was seen as a commitment to open-mindedness, ongoing
mental training, and the instruction of an advanced teacher . </p>

<p>The same remedy was suggested for the tendency to overestimate
the profundity and long-term impact of insights which may be
mistaken for profound awakenings. This tendency was seen as
decreasing with further experience of either the psychedelics or
a mental training discipline. It was felt that deep exploration
of either would produce many insights, each one adding a small
piece to the gigantic jigsaw puzzle which is the mind. </p>

<p>An inadequate cognitive framework or context was also
mentioned as a limiting factor. Sometimes extremely deep insights
did occur under psychedelics, and in at least two cases there may
have been a transient enlightenment experience. In one of the
subjects it produced a prolonged period of confusion and partial
disorientation which in turn led to meditation training. This
subject experienced a deep level of enlightenment again after
several years' practice and this time found the experience
understandable and beneficial. </p>

<p>One subject thought that the main disadvantage of psychedelics
is the tendency to underestimate one's own role in creating the
resultant experiences. People have too little appreciation of
their own power and see themselves as passive victims of drug
effects rather than as active creators of experience . </p>

<p>One trap for people with limited experience, the subjects
said, is a failure to appreciate the enormous range of potential
experiences and the tendency to assume that all sessions will be
like the first. Many people have made pronouncements about the
nature of psychedelic effects after limited exposure and
therefore have failed to appreciate the extent of differences
between individuals or between one session and another in the
same individual. According to reports by these subjects, as well
as Stanislav Grof (4,5) and others, repeated exposure produces a
gradual unfolding and deepening sequence of experiences. </p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Here then are comments on the pros and cons of psychedelics
from five of the very healthiest individuals I have met in the
course of my research and personal investigations of various
psychological and consciousness disciplines. In each of these
individuals the psychedelics played an important yet unpublicized
role in their life orientations and professions. Taken in
conjunction with the similar findings which they have noticed in
their students and colleagues, these reports make it clear that
the psychedelics can sometimes have long-lasting beneficial
impact. While the five subjects discussed here do not see
psychedelics as constituting a pathway in themselves, they do see
them as potential facilitators of development for some people
engaged in a mental training program or a psychological or
consciousness discipline. The experiences and traps associated
with psychedelic drugs are not seen as unique but rather as
features of any mental training program, although the drugs
usually produce them more rapidly and intensely. Needless to say,
the capacity to benefit from an accelerated experience depends on
the maturity and skill of the individual; all five subjects took
it as self-evident that psychedelics should not be used
indiscriminately but should be respected as the powerful tools
they are. </p>

<h2>NEW LEARNING</h2>

<h3>Thomas Bradford Roberts</h3>

<p>From: <i>Psychedelic Reflections</i>, Lester Grinspoon and
James B. Bakalar<br>
copyright Human Sciences Press, 1983.</center> </p>

<p> &quot;Thomas B. Roberts is Associate Professor in the
Department of Learning and Development at Northern Illinois
University. He is coauthor of <i>The Second Centering Book</i>
and <i>Transpersonal Psychology in Education,</i> and has edited
the anthology <i>Four Psychologies Applied to Education:
Freudian, Behavioral, Humanistic, Transpersonal.</i>&quot; &#151;<i>Psychedelic
Reflections</i> </p>

<hr>

<p> It didn't make sense. Their speech was clear, their thoughts
logical, and their ideas and descriptions coherent. We were
fellow graduate students in a Stanford seminar on the human
potential. They were describing their first LSD trip, taken the
previous Saturday. And it didn't make sense&#151;to me&#151;then.
Like almost everyone else in the late 1960's, I had learned that
LSD was a dangerous, mind-altering drug, one that sensible people
didn't take; but they seemed sensible both before and after. I
had learned that LSD alienated people and ruined relationships;
but this young, married, graduate-student couple had shared a
deep and meaningful experience that brought them closer together.
They talked of increased love for each other and for humanity. I
had learned that LSD makes people suicidal, jumping out of high
windows and that sort of thing; yet they seemed well-grounded and
down to earth. I had learned that LSD makes people hysterical and
psychotic; but they seemed relaxed, rational, and
reality-oriented. I learned that LSD puts one into a nightmarish
hell, full of terrifying hallucinations and Goya-esque agonies;
they described a feeling of overwhelming awe for the beauty
surrounding them. They said things felt &quot;more sacred, more
intense, and indescribably wonder-filled.&quot; I had learned
that LSD drives one mad, yet they seemed saner than ever. I had
learned that LSD was an escape into unreality; yet their lives
seemed to be enriched somehow. A few others in the class nodded
understandingly, and exchanged words and smiles of warm
recognition&#151;even a sort of congratulation! This didn't make
sense. We weren't a class of long-haired freaks. We were hard-
working, high-achieving, graduate students from engineering, the
social sciences, humanities, and assorted professional schools.
This didn't make sense at all. </p>

<p> It does now. LSD helps people experience all these things,
good and bad, and many more. Like most people in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, I &quot;learned&quot; about LSD from TV,
newspapers, and magazines. I &quot;learned&quot; that doctors,
psychiatrists, and psychologists were treating many patients who
were suffering from &quot;LSD psychosis.&quot; I
&quot;learned&quot; that LSD was responsible for changes in
social mores, sexual openness, political activism, and a whole
cultural shift. </p>

<p> Since then, however, through my own experiences with
psychedelics and subsequent readings stimulated by those
experiences, I've learned it is easier to learn an erroneous
opinion than to correct it. The popular news media prefer to
focus public attention on the spectacular, bizarre, and
frightening. Mental and physical health professionals see only
those who have problems; sick people are their clientele. A
person who took LSD with beneficial effects would hardly be
likely to take the time and money to go to a doctor and report
that he is well. Finally, some of the experiences one commonly
has during psychedelic sessions run directly contrary to the
dominant intellectual positions of the 1960s, which assumed that
any deviation from our ordinary state of consciousness,
especially a mystical state, is error or sickness. Today's
sciences and psychologies are accommodating additional views, but
in the sixties and early seventies such positions were
intellectually heretical. </p>

<p> I followed the academic orthodoxies of the time. A son of
educators, reared on the campus of a New England university,
member of a highly rational Congregational church, undergraduate
devotee of behavioral psychology at Hamilton College, I became a
doctoral student who planned to study educational tests and
measurements and computer-assisted instruction while picking up
an MBA on the side. To me mind was limited to intellect, and
intellect implied reason, cognition, and their verbal expression.
Who would expect such a person to advocate the development of
nonverbal, nonrational, and noncognitive mental abilities? I
certainly wouldn't; but I certainly do. This widened definition
of mind marks a major effect of my own LSD experiences. LSD has
stimulated a new interest for me in examining human learning,
experience, thinking, and behavior in terms of states of
consciousness (SOCs). This essay exemplifies the fun of thinking
in a consciousness way. <a name="back1"></a><a href="#note1">(1)</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>NOTE TO MY STUDENTS: From my experiences and through
    reading, I have become increasingly respectful of the power
    of LSD. Like any powerful thing, it can be either destructive
    or constructive depending on how skillfully it is used. Among
    other things, it can concentrate your attention on the most
    vulnerable, most unpleasant parts of your mind. These should
    be explored only under the guidance of a qualified therapist,
    one who has had extensive psychedelic training. If you need
    help, most currently-trained mental health professionals are
    unlikely to be able to help you; in fact, because of their
    mistraining, they are likely to worsen your state.
    Furthermore, street dosages are of unknown strength and
    questionable purity. Until the time you can explore your mind
    using LSD of known strength and purity under qualified
    guidance within the law, I urge you to limit yourself to
    studying the literature and to working within professional
    and other organizations for the resumption of legal,
    scientific research. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Perception-extender</h4>

<p> Like a microscope, LSD magnifies. Instead of magnifying
things outside the body, it magnifies inner experiences.
Memories, ideas, fantasies, perceptions, thoughts, emotions,
fears, hopes, sensations, bodily processes, any one of these can
in effect come to occupy a person's whole attention. This
amplification, like that of a microscope, allows the experiencer
to investigate parts of his or her mind with increased attention
to the enlarged details. But, again like a microscope, it narrows
the field of perception, often temporarily distorting the
relationships among the parts. As with slide views through a
microscope, an LSD researcher must assemble a collage of close-up
fragments to obtain an overall view of his or her own mental
experience, and still more pieces for an overall map of the human
mind. </p>

<p> This essay neither describes these fragments nor composes a
collage. That has already been excellently done (e.g., Masters
&amp; Houston, 1966; Grof, 1975); and the research is surveyed by
Grinspoon and Bakalar (1979). My purpose is to look at the
influence of psychedelic experiences on myself and to speculate
about the implications of these experiences for the world of
learning. The essay assumes that studies done to date will be
confirmed by additional research. If past experiences is any
guide, some will be and others won't. The sooner we are clear
about which ones, the better off we will be. </p>

<p> One thing is clear: LSD (I am using &quot;LSD&quot; as
shorthand for the whole class of psychedelic drugs) raises
exciting and important questions. As an amateur psychologist, I
am interested in what LSD indicates about the mind. As an
educational psychologist, I am curious about the implications for
learning and development. As a human being and a citizen of my
country and my planet, I wonder what insights it provides for
culture and society. This essay is an attempt to think about
these issues rather than to solve them; to bring them forward for
open, intelligent discussion rather than to keep them buried in
an intellectual underground- to encourage additional careful,
legal research and its open communication rather than
clandestine, illegal research and word-of-mouth rumor. Although
this essay is based on my own experiences, it reflects more than
my individual case. Most of the ideas are common currency among
my consciousness colleagues. The essay is more collection than
creation. </p>

<h4>Learning</h4>

<p> I've titled this essay &quot;New Learning&quot; for several
reasons. As an educational psychologist, I'm interested in the
implications of LSD research for the study of human learning and
for further human development. Through LSD experiences I have
learned to look at myself and society in a new way. These
experiences have been, in effect, an additional higher education
for me, equal in impact, effort, knowledge, beauty, and scope to
obtaining a doctorate at Stanford. I value both sets of
experiences highly. To me, the LSD-Stanford comparison shines
brightly in both directions. Besides, this is a book written
largely by and for educators and others who want to increase
learning. Finally, I use the gerund to connote a continuing
process. The educational topics, philosophical issues,
intellectual questions, and personal insights which evolved from
my LSD experiences and subsequent investigations are a continuing
source of growth. They have piqued my curiosity about areas of
literature, religion, anthropology, and philosophy that I
underrated before. The sciences, social sciences, and arts have
taken on additional coloration and deeper meanings. In a very
real sense, LSD experiences resemble a liberal education.</p>

<hr>
<center>

<h3>ISSUES, TOPICS, AND QUESTIONS</h3>
</center>

<p> I developed an interest in this essay's ideas directly
through my psychedelic experiences and indirectly through reading
largely stimulated by these experiences. This is not to say that
LSD is the only road to such ideas. Clearly, it isn't. But in my
experience and in the experiences of some of my friends and
colleagues, LSD was our road. <center></p>

<h3>MINDMAP, MYSTICISM, MORALITY, AND METHODOLOGY</h3>
</center>

<h4>Redrawing the Mindmap</h4>

<p> Stanislav Grof may well be the living Western psychologist
with the widest and deepest sample of human psychological
behavior. He, his patients, and co-experimenters have crossed and
recrossed the mental terrain. Their combined observations have
strength not only because of their own diversity (other mapmakers
have used diverse populations) but primarily because they have
systematically mapped previously excluded regions. From a sample
of approximately 4,000 LSD sessions with a wide range of
psychotics, neurotics, and normals, he describes a four-level
mindcollage in <i>Realms of the Human Unconscious</i>. The
shallowest level consists of current thoughts and perceptions,
the &quot;Abstract and Aesthetic Level,&quot; as Grof calls it.
The second level consists of experiences and fantasies of the
person's life. Most therapies focus on this level, and Grof calls
this the &quot;Psychodynamic or Freudian Level.&quot; Below this
is the &quot;Perinatal Level,&quot; having to do with experiences
at or around birth; this level is associated with the work of
Otto Rank. These three levels all have to do with experiences of
the person. Beyond this is a region where personal identity,
time, and space become variables. This is the &quot;Transpersonal
Level.&quot; </p>

<p> If Grof's map served only in therapy and simply as a
phenomenological record of LSD experiences, it would be a useful
curiosity, but otherwise unimportant for the world of learning.
But the map is also congruent with the mindmaps of powerful
thinkers from several fields, notably the humanities, who draw on
many cultures for their evidence. <a name="back2"></a><a
href="#note2">(2)</a> This convergence of disciplines presents a
view of the human mind in agreement with current views in some
particulars, but at variance in others. </p>

<h4>Experimental Humanities?</h4>

<p> The disciplinary regularities described by these authors and
the general worldview they present were derived from large-scale
surveys of their fields. Grof's LSD research goes beyond this to
experimental verification which confirms their findings.
Humanistic studies in turn help to corroborate psychedelic
observations. Psychedelic research's roomy additions to the house
of intellect make it possible to found new disciplinary
specialties that hybridize science and the humanities, for
example, experimental symbolism and &quot;experiential
philosophy.&quot; All the books mentioned in <a name="backfig1"></a><a
href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> explicitly derive their ideas from
altered states of consciousness, yet our academic community is
predominantly consciousness-naive. Studies of human nature and
the human mind which omit non-ordinary states are clearly
incomplete. </p>

<h4>Mysticism and Mysticism</h4>

<p> A decade ago I, too, had learned the standard scientific
orthodoxy on mysticism: I despised and caricatured mysticism as a
view that the world is basically unknowable and that reason and
observation are useless, probably confusing. What would I, as a
rational human being, have to do with this holdover from the Dark
Ages? What good was a psychology that valued such trash? </p>

<p> After experiencing mystical states several times and reading
a bit about them, I now realize that I failed to make an
important distinction. Mysticism as a <i>philosophical</i> stand
on what can be known and how it can be known differs greatly from
the study of mystical events as <i>psychological</i> experiences.
My rejection of philosophical mysticism had led me blindly to
reject the psychological study of mystical experiences. </p>

<p> Several current psychotechnologies, including LSD, increase
the likelihood of mystical experiences. Now that we can stimulate
them, we can begin to bring to bear scientific experimentation.
Richards' dissertation, <i>Counseling, Peak Experiences and the
Human Encounter with Death: An Empirical Study of the Efficacy of
DPT-assisted Counseling in Enhancing the Quality of Life of
Persons with Terminal Cancer and Their Closest Family Members</i>
(1975), illustrates the scientific study of mystical states. His
work includes a survey of the literature on experimental
mysticism, repeatable treatment, standardized observations, and
confirmable/disconfirmable hypotheses and conclusions. The study
is replicable. </p>

<h4>A Science Growth-Spur</h4>

<p> When science expands, education follows. With consciousness
pioneers opening access to new territories, whole ranges of human
abilities are already beginning to be developed. For example, in
the 1960s I was taught that people could not voluntarily control
the autonomic nervous system&#151; the &quot;vegetative nervous
system,&quot; as my biology text pejoratively called it. In 1980
we teach that one can learn to control this system by
biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and various uses of imagery. As
with biofeedback learned states of consciousness, the study of
psychedelic-stimulated SOCs is, in principle, not opposed to
science and reason. On the contrary, the refusal to study them is
both unreasonable and antiscientific. </p>

<h4>The Therapeutic Effect of Mystical Experiences</h4>

<p> What did Richards and others discover across the Appalachians
of the Mind? When the travelers returned, had they been driven
crazy? Neurotic? Psychotic? Were they out of touch with reality?
Did they withdraw from family, friends, and loved ones?
&quot;Yes,&quot; said the stay-at- homes, clutching their
psychoanalytic maps. &quot;Beyond these mountains live fearful
beasts. Let no one enter there.&quot; </p>

<p> The travelers and their guides, however, told different
stories. Some alcoholics and addicts dropped their dependencies.
Suicidal patients discovered a love of life. Some who departed
neurotic and psychotic returned improved, although many needed
several additional trips. Patients with terminal diseases felt
less fear of death, and their general anxiety was lowered. Most
of all, they related honestly, lovingly, and openly with their
families and closest friends (Grof, 1975, 1981; Grof &amp;
Halifax, 1978; Richards, 1975; summarized in Grinspoon &amp;
Bakalar, 1979). </p>

<p> If mystical experiences are integrated into the personality,
they are highly therapeutic. Single-state scholars and
theoreticians are hard-pressed to explain this therapeutic value.
Denial is easier. But if an enlarged map of reality includes
altered states of consciousness, then experiencing such states
logically leads to a fuller view of reality, and therapists tell
us that a fuller view of reality is therapeutic. </p>

<h4>Moral Development: A Second Path?</h4>

<p> Bits of observation may fall together in unexpected ways when
a new methodology presents a new data or a new way of thinking
reorganizes existing observations. Looked at from a consciousness
perspective, some issues surrounding moral development combine in
a startling way. Four bits of information are linked together: </p>

<p> First, mystical experiences, or peak experiences, are by
their nature non-ego states, i.e., transpersonal states. It is
not surprising that people who experience this state report a
decrease in such ego needs as the neurotic accumulation of wealth
or power. In <i>Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences</i>,
Maslow reports this value-shift during peak experiences (1964),
and Huxley claims it is part of most major philosophical
traditions (1944). </p>

<p> Second, during peak or mystical experiences, people directly
experience what Maslow calls &quot;being values, &quot; and what
Kohlberg calls &quot;universal moral principles. &quot; These
include such things as the sanctity of life and compassion. </p>

<p> Third, these qualities then act as goals or motivations for
future actions. Personal compassion, social responsibility,
global awareness, and a cosmic perspective grow. </p>

<p> Fourth, LSD, the new therapies, and other psychotechnologies
can trigger, or at least facilitate, peak or mystical
experiences. </p>

<p> Putting these four together we have a sequence from the new
therapies to mystical experiences to &quot;being values&quot; to
moral action. Have we unintentionally, blindly, and unknowingly
stumbled onto another path of moral improvement? Have we
discovered rapid, even chemically- induced moral development? My
emotional reaction is an indignant &quot;No, it can't be!&quot;
Yet, that is what some of the evidence suggests. In any case, the
relationship between mystical states and morality is my
nomination as the most-needed piece of consciousness research. </p>

<p> Because it is based on the study of many states of
consciousness, the psychology of consciousness includes a greater
number and wider variety of observations than a single-state
psychology. It offers a source of hypotheses and research
designs. However, we should remember that many early findings are
probably inaccurate. Great contributions and great mistakes are
twins of new paradigms. Because of the newness of consciousness
research, some variables are probably still hidden. This speeds
up the frequency of disconfirmations, and slows confirmations. An
organized research agenda, regular dissemination channels,
research conferences, and so forth are now appropriate for this
field and will help separate false hopes from hot leads. </p>

<h4>Methodology&#151;Down the Mind Mine</h4>

<p> The greatest advances in civilization, science, and learning
often result from new ways of doing things, new methodologies. In
my judgment the most important thing about psychedelics is that
they give us a powerful and broadly applicable research
methodology. <a name="back3"></a><a href="#note3">(3)</a> </p>

<p> The typical Western approach to studying the mind is to look
at its activities and products and to infer its structure and
functions from them. Studying the great religions, philosophies,
and psychologies of the world, what similarities do we find? What
do language and literature indicate about the human mind? This is
the research method of many of the authors in Figure 1. One minor
benefit of psychedelic research is that it adds a few novel
boulders to the mountain of human experience. A larger
contribution is that psychedelic insights offer ways to
categorize some of these observations and ways to specify
relationships among them. </p>

<p> The second major Western way to study the mind is to look at
abnormal behavior to see what it indicates. Here, too, the
evidence is largely descriptive, although current therapeutic
interventions add some clinical and experimental notes.
Psychedelic and psycholytic therapies add to the knowledge we
receive via this route. Because psychedelics were developed and
used in recent history for therapy rather than for intellectual
research, a misleading connotation of mental illness as their
only appropriate domain blinds people to their research
potentials elsewhere. Instead of inferring the structure of the
mind from its surface geography and from occasional
interventions, psychedelic methodology provides direct access to
the underground veins and strata, the deep structures and
processes where thoughts, feelings, and motivation originate. </p>

<p> Fortunately for researchers, sometimes in these states it is
possible to alternate between deep mental experience and a
close-to-normal state. They can even happen simultaneously. For
example, once toward the end of a psychedelic session I
remembered a group of childhood nightmares. At the time they had
the quality of immediate experience rather than memory. Every few
minutes, I got up from bed to make notes on these experiences,
then returned again to re-experience them. The period of
alternating states lasted about 20 minutes, and I was able to
recall and record &quot;childhood nightmares&quot; which included
the name of a playmate whom I hadn't thought of for over a
quarter of a century. Some of these dreams came from very early
childhood and perhaps infancy. From this experience, I
hypothesized that some early childhood nightmares are birth
memories. This was not a new idea, but it was newly credible to
me. </p>

<p> As I look at my colleagues' professional contributions, I
find, rightly or wrongly, that I evaluate most highly the ideas
of those who are experienced in various states of consciousness
or who are at least familiar with the research from reading.
Within the consciousness group, I trust the theories and
hypotheses of psychedelic researchers more than those of
LSD-naive researchers. Researchers with knowledge of several
states have an even greater advantage. This is not to say that
all good research is psychedelic nor that all psychedelic
research is good research. Obviously, this isn't the case. But as
a general rule, it is preferable to generalize from diverse
observations rather than from a narrower field. I predict that by
the end of this decade, psychologists, philosophers, and
educators, as well as mental and physical health practitioners
who are unfamiliar with consciousness research will be as
out-of-date as they would be today if they were unfamiliar with
Freud, Skinner, or Piaget. </p>

<h4>Professional Creativity</h4>

<p> <a
href="http://cliffcompaq/druglibrary/schaffer/lsd/harman.htm">The
work of Harman et al. (1966)</a> indicates that psychedelics may
be a useful methodology in the incubation and illumination stages
of creative problem-solving. Most of the engineers, physicists,
mathematicians, architects, and designers in his samples reported
valuable solutions to their professional problems from
psychedelic acceleration of creativity. This
synthesis-facilitating use of psychedelics is different from the
mind-research mentioned above. We need more systematic research
on how to do psychedelic research. An unfortunate side-effect of
psychedelics' illegality is that the publication and sharing of
the methods and findings is discouraged.</p>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL FUTURES IN A CONSCIOUSNESS CONTEXT</h3>
</center>

<h4>Consciousness Roots of Mental Fruit</h4>

<p> When consciousness (the overall pattern of mental
functioning) is seen as a group of variables, cognition,
perception, affect, and so on, are seen as psychological
processes embedded in SOCs with each other and with other
psychological processes. All our cognitive structures and mental
processes seem to vary from one state of overall psychological
functioning to another. How much variation in thinking is there
from state to state? What alternate forms of thinking exist in
alternate patterns of mental functioning? What, if any, uses
might they have for humanity? </p>

<h4>Failure to Recognize the Primacy of States of Consciousness<br>
Is the Major Intellectual Error of our Times</h4>

<p> Present ideas of the mind are almost wholly derived from our
ordinary state's experience and cognition and are for use within
it. Although contributions to them may well have been aided by
reverie or other nearby SOCs, we ignore these origins. </p>

<p> We are largely hunter-gatherers of the mind. Its civilization
has just begun. We trim and prune here and there. We espalier
diverse facts with convenient theories. From a consciousness
perspective, increased harvests depend on acknowledging thought's
deep roots in other SOCs. A mind cultivator not only weeds the
surface ideas, but also tends the conceptual and preconceptual
soils. </p>

<p> The idea that such inner-directed attention is narcissistic
is a peculiar one. While they may be stimulated by external
events, aesthetic creation and awareness, problem-finding and
problem-solving, judgments of quality, spiritual experiences,
intellectual and other mental processes are all internal events,
processes happening &quot;inside the head.&quot; Calling
inner-directed attention &quot;narcissistic&quot; or
&quot;me-oriented&quot; is inaccurate, anti-intellectual, and
just plain ignorant. </p>

<h4>Cognition and Consciousness</h4>

<p> Can one intentionally improve inner processes? Some
improvement comes from better ideas, that is, more accurate,
useful, and varied concepts. Focusing on better cognitive
strategies to process or manipulate the content, cognitive
psychology asks a higher, second-level question: whether there
are more efficient ways of thinking. Consciousness studies ask a
third-level question: How do cognitive strategies and cognition
vary from state to state? From a cognitive perspective, different
states of consciousness are, among other things, radical
reorganizations of information processing systems and strategies.
Different states of consciousness also provide different
&quot;strategies&quot; of perception, abilities, memory, emotion,
etc. </p>

<p> At each level, the degree of mental freedom increases. It is
no accident that mystical experiences are associated with an
open-minded tolerance for ambiguity (Thomas &amp; Cooper, 1980).
This kind of tolerance is also correlated with abstract thought,
creativity, decreased prejudice, and low authoritarianism. From a
consciousness perspective, the first pair are associated with
higher stages of mental development, the latter pair with
decreased ego involvement. The two occur together. </p>

<h4>Consciousness Education</h4>

<p> Before LSD drew my attention to state of consciousness as a
variable, I accepted the usual cognitive goals of education:
knowing more facts and learning to think better, avoiding
fallacies, moving up Piaget's stages of intellectual development,
finding more useful concepts and theories, matching theory with
observations, and so forth. While I still value these aims, I now
see them in a different context. </p>

<p> The items below are discussed more thoroughly in <i>Consciousness,
Psychology, and Education</i> (Roberts, 1980a). </p>

<p> First, education has focused almost entirely on developing
the cognitive skills of our ordinary state. I am not suggesting
that we change this, at least not yet. But we should be aware
that this is a policy decision, not a necessary
&quot;given.&quot; What forms does cognition take in other
states? </p>

<p> Second, human abilities and disabilities depend on various
broader patterns of overall mental functioning, states of
consciousness. As SOC's change, certain skills are enhanced and
others are diminished. Previously rare or unusual abilities, such
as parapsychological abilities and the placebo ability, may be
learnable by providing access to the states of consciousness
where they reside. Many human physical and mental disabilities
seem to be best treated in unusual states of consciousness such
as hypnosis, meditation, and psychedelic therapy. So-called
&quot;spontaneous remission,&quot; &quot;miraculous&quot; cures,
and &quot;therapeutic touch&quot; all seem to be associated with
changes in SOC. In institutions other than schools (and perhaps
some day in schools) people may want to explore and develop the
capacities manifested in these states of consciousness. </p>

<p> Third, abstract formal operations do not necessarily
represent the highest type of intellectual development. That may
be true for our ordinary state (including suggested stages beyond
Piaget's); but other (perhaps more advanced) forms of
intellectual development with stages of their own may await us in
other states. </p>

<p> Fourth, educators and psychologists need not define
intelligence solely in ordinary-state ways. Intelligence may also
be seen as the general ability to use a large number of mental
patterns (states of consciousness), as the ability to select and
enter the most appropriate SOC for the task at hand, or as the
optimum use of each specific SOC. In this last sense the meaning
of &quot;intelligence&quot; varies from state to state (Roberts,
1980b). </p>

<p> Fifth, there is a contextual broadening best described from a
psychoanalytic perspective. This view sees secondary process
thinking (rational, adult thinking) as optimal. It now seems to
me that there is at least tertiary thinking, which consists of
selecting one's overall pattern of mental functioning. This is a
higher ability than learning to use any specific pattern or one
of its resident abilities. </p>

<p> Sixth, education in our usual state and all the research and
development surrounding it become additionally important viewed
in this context. Current educational goals, objectives, methods,
curricula, tests and measurements, developmental stages,
taxonomies, philosophies, and practices may all have analogues in
other states. How do we adapt our ideas about our current SOC and
its education to other SOCs? </p>

<h4>Liberal Education</h4>

<p> As its name indicates, liberal education is an education for
freedom: freedom from the accidents of locale, group, time,
class, and so on. It offers the freedom to develop one's mind
fully. Consistent with these objectives, consciousness education
adds the great states of consciousness to the great ideas and
great thinkers. The historic role of SOCs in the humanities,
arts, and sciences is neglected in current education, even as
content, despite an occasional titillating exception such as <i>Kubla
Khan</i>, bacchanalia, or a maligned saint's misconstrued
ecstasy. These are used more to enliven classes than to teach
about the further reaches of mind. A truly liberal education
should teach students about this part of themselves and our
civilizations, and should also give them rudimentary experience
with selected states and their resident capacities. Enriched by a
consciousness perspective, liberal education can extend freedom
and mental refinement far beyond the parochialism of single-state
learning. </p>

<h4>Placebo Ability</h4>

<p> We use a misnomer when we speak of &quot;the placebo
effect.&quot; &quot;Effect&quot; attributes improvement to
spurious treatments which are selected precisely because of their
lack of effect. The label is not only a logical inconsistency
which explains nothing, but a barrier to research. </p>

<p> If &quot;placebo-ing&quot; is seen as something we do, rather
than something that happens to us, it becomes an ability like any
other human ability, one which might be learned and practiced.
Regimens such as prayer, visualization, deep relaxation, and an
assortment of religious and psychological practices make good
&quot;placeboing&quot; sense. Physical educators should help
their students learn to assist their own natural immune
mechanisms, which are part of the placebo ability. Wellness and
illness are largely long-term physical performances. We know they
can be learned and unlearned, but we do not yet know the extent
of this learning. </p>

<h4>Consciousness Studies, a New Discipline</h4>

<p> What makes a discipline and differentiates it from other
disciplines? At least the following: separate theories and
concepts, specific problems addressed, explanations of
observations not otherwise explained, applications to life, a
distinctive research methodology, a separate literature, and an
identifiable group of people who share interests, professional
organizations, publications, and a system of information flow. By
these criteria, Consciousness Studies will soon deserve its own
place in the academic world. </p>

<p> Consciousness methodologies include traditional and new ways
of altering consciousness. Accepting both outside, objective
evidence and inner, subjective evidence, it offers a larger data
base than either of these alone. Correlating the two is an
important type of research. Training in subjective research
methods, for example through meditation or LSD, is as cognitively
demanding as traditional statistics, research design, and
instrumentation. As Needleman (1975) says: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In our modern world it has always been assumed . . . that
    in order to observe oneself all that is required is for a
    person to &quot;look within. &quot; No one even imagines that
    self- observation may be a highly disciplined skill which
    requires longer training than any other skill we
    know....The...bad reputation of &quot;introspection&quot;
    ...results from the particular notion that all by himself. .
    . a man can come to accurate and unmixed observations of his
    own thought and perception .... the heart of the
    psychological disciplines in the East and the ancient Western
    world consists of training at self-study. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Consciousness Studies form its related fields. Parts of the
scientific community have difficulty accepting data from other
SOCs, just as our ancestors found it hard to accept observations
from the telescope and microscope. If it is done properly,
consciousness research can meet the requirements of scientific
method: observation, free communication, replicability,
theorizing, and confirmation/disconfirmation (Tart, 1975). </p>

<p> By providing a more accurate and complete view of our
psychological apparatus, our mind, consciousness research can aid
other disciplines too. As Kubie (1954) points out: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A discipline comes of age and a student of that discipline
    reaches maturity when it becomes possible to recognize,
    estimate, and allow for the errors of their tools....Yet
    there is one instrument which every discipline uses without
    checking its errors, tacitly assuming that the instrument is
    error-free. This, of course, is the human psychological
    apparatus . </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Like statistical methods, consciousness methods, as well as
the particular findings themselves, may help other researchers
sophisticate their procedures and analyses. </p>

<p> A final reason to consider Consciousness Studies a separate
discipline is the subjective feelings of those in the field.
Consciousness colleagues in a variety of universities,
departments, and nonacademic occupations feel as much akin to one
another as to their departmental colleagues, if not more so. This
feeling of shared interests and perspectives is a powerful
uniting force which undercuts disciplinary differences. Although
there is little institutional structure reflecting these shared
ideas and values, the trust, common interests, and enjoyment form
an invisible Department of Consciousness Studies. </p>

<h4>Mindmagicians</h4>

<p> Mindpower is more fascinating than machine power. Such books
as the Carlos Castenada series and works by Tart, Ornstein, and
Grof surprised their publishers by selling well in a hitherto
unseen market. Best sellers such as Drawing on the Right Side of
the Brain (Edwards, 1979) are introducing consciousness education
to teachers and parents. Anatomy of an Illness (Cousins, 1979)
illustrates this interest in (holistic) health and wellness. I
don't want to make my case seem stronger than it is; I'm not
satying that consciousness culture is now dominant, only that it
will be if current trends continue. For the present, it is a
clear cultural leitmotiv. </p>

<h4>Want Ads</h4>

<p> What new organizations and industries may evolve? Prophecy is
not my line, but enough is clear now to spot a few needs. </p>

</blockquote>

<p> What role does LSD play in this? As the most powerful of many
consciousness techniques, it dramatically draws attention to
these needs. As it has been officially neglected and
misunderstood, it points to our neglect and misunderstanding of
the whole consciousness area. As a stimulator of consciousness
research in the academic and mental health communities, it is
likely to encourage development throughout our culture. </p>

<h4>Peace</h4>

<p> We think of peace as a political and social phenomenon,
seldom recognizing that these surface experiences interact with
deep layers of the mind. Experienced LSD researchers come in
touch with deep internal responses through the drug's
magnification of external events. Conversely, experiencing a
cluster of internal feelings/memories/fantasies/thoughts colors
the external world. At the perinatal level there are two clusters
(BPMs) which respond strongly to outside stimulation and
contribute to warlike feelings. Basic Perinatal Matrix II
involves feelings of constriction and helplessness; it is
appropriately called &quot;No Exit Hell.&quot;BPM III represents
enormous energy, natural and man-made cataclysms, especially
violence and wars; it is appropriately called &quot;Titanic
Struggle . &quot; </p>

<p> The wrong set of social and economic circumstances brings
these BPM's to the fore. For example, Grof noticed remarkable
detailed similarities between the memories of Nazi concentration
camp survivors and the unconscious fantasies of people who had
lived more ordinary lives (Grof, 1977). He hypothesizes that the
situation within the camps, especially toward the end of the war,
activated BPM's II and III, stimulating the camp guards to enact
violent and sadistic urges that inhabit these clusters. </p>

<p> War activates these BPM's and strengthens them, just as their
power is called on to justify war. As countries wind themselves
up to go to war, their leaders use perinatal symbols to marshal
public opinion, not consciously, but because the war-instigating
symbols feel right; and they feel right because of this
connection. Hitler used the BPM sequence to manipulate his
people: (1) BPM I, the &quot;Good Womb,&quot; was symbolized by
tales of the past golden age of the Germanic peoples; (2) BPM II,
&quot;No Exit Hell, &quot; was the present, constricted by
external and internal enemies, intensified by economic disaster;
the need to get out was expressed symbolically as the desire for
expansion, <i>lebensraum</i>; (3) the way out was titanic
struggle (BPM III), and (4) the birth of a 1,000 year Reich (BPM
IV). De Mause found this imagery to be typical in nations which
are preparing for war intentionally or merely blundering toward
it (cited in Grof, 1977). </p>

<p> While the informed public recognizes shallow
psychodynamic-level appeals to sexual interest, power, status,
and so forth in advertising and propaganda, we are not so aware
of manipulation on the perinatal level. Until we recognize this,
humanity will have a short war fuse which can easily be lit by
many social, economic, political, and cultural situations. Other
situations can transform this destructive energy into creative,
constructive, socially-beneficial actions. What are the perinatal
consequences of social conditions? What are the social
consequences of perinatal conditions? </p>

<p> As we come to understand the human mind more completely, we
will naturally see its roles in war and peace more completely.
The observations, speculations, and questions above suggest how
war and peace studies can be enriched by a fuller understanding
of mind and consciousness. This is merely one illustration of the
possibilities of consciousness analysis in the social sciences. </p>

<h4>Freedom of the Mind</h4>

<p> Who has the right to control your mind? To explore it? To use
it? With the invention of consciousness techniques, a new kind of
freedom faces a new kind of control. People want to explore and
develop their minds, and psychedelics are an efficient way to do
so. This desire is part of human nature, but law and social
ignorance block the way. I propose that we recognize a general
human right: the right to explore, control, and develop one's
mind. Other people or society at large can limit this right only
to the degree they are affected. It will not be so easy to
delimit this limitation . </p>

<h4>The High Cost of Bad Law</h4>

<p> When comparing the scientific and medical writings on LSD
with sensational newspaper, popular press, and TV accounts, a
startling observation leads to a startling conclusion. In the
scientific and medical research reports, psychological damage is
almost missing; in the popular news it is featured. During legal
research the patient or client is carefully screened and
expensively prepared for the experience. The dosage and its
purity are known. The setting, which is a major influence, is
chosen to maximize safety and minimize danger. And a qualified
professional is on hand to assist. In cases that make the popular
press, on the other hand, consciousness adventurers are neither
screened nor prepared. The dosage and purity are unknown. The
setting is random and often unpleasant. Professional help is
absent. These different conditions account for the rarity of
serious problems in the scientific reports and the presence of
frequent tragedy in the popular reports. </p>

<p> All the specific unfavorable conditions derive from one
larger situation: LSD is illegal. In the legal situation, the
LSD-taker can be prepared and high-risk people screened out; the
dosage and its purity are assured; setting can be planned for
optimum benefit. All this is difficult in illegal situations.
Under present laws, it is illegal for a professional to
administer LSD; and fear of police and public exposure increase
psychological stress at a time when the person is most
vulnerable. Given LSD's magnifying property, this fear can become
psychologically overwhelming. In an unstable person it could be
fatal. By driving LSD use underground, we multiply its dangers
while minimizing its benefits. </p>

<h4>Policy</h4>

<p> Given the consistent failure of anti-LSD legislation to stop
use since the mid-sixties, what is the most responsible course
for public polity? Over-the-counter purchase and prescription by
untrained professionals are both risky. I propose centers to
screen and prepare those who need or wish to take psychedelics.
We need to provide a place to administer doses of known purity
and strength under qualified, specially-trained guidance and with
optimal set and setting. Each state and most large cities could
use several psychedelic centers. Major universities, medical
schools, and research institutes would also benefit from these
centers. A professional staff training program would have to
precede the establishment of such institutions. </p>

<p> After incubating for a quarter of a century, after being
repressed by governmental and professional restraints for a
decade and a half, after struggling for recognition and
acceptance, psychedelic research is finally breaking through to
the clear light of evidence and reason. Intellectual curiosity,
civic duty, professional obligation, humanitarian values, and
moral responsibility provide grounds for further research. </p>

<p> For me (and I assume for some of my coauthors) my most
intensely intellectually stimulating, short-term experiences have
been psychedelic sessions. Psychedelics open wide the doors of
learning. Where will those mind-doors lead? Only when we do
additional research will we know. </p>

<p> Most of all, psychedelics are just one group among many
consciousness methodologies. There are also certain aspects of
biofeedback, meditation, hypnosis, prayer and other spiritual
practices, other mind-drugs, yoga and other movement disciplines,
nutrition, <i>t'ai chi</i> and the consciousness martial arts,
sex and exercise routines, training in intuition, relaxation and
visualization.... The list could go on for hundreds of trainings,
spiritual paths, and esoteric fields. Research might be done in
cooperation with groups which practice these. What insights, if
any, might they have about the human mind? Only when we do more
research will we learn. </p>

<p> For a wandering, directionless culture the full development
of our minds is a project equal in scale to pioneering west of
the Appalachians or exploring outer space. A new cultural mythic
ideal is emerging: the myth of the fully developed mind. It is an
eminently democratic ideal. Only some can become adventurers on
land or in space, but in mind exploration, everyone is at the
frontier. </p>

<h4>Note to My Colleagues</h4>

<p><center> &quot;The rejection of any source of evidence is
always treason to that ultimate rationalism<br>
which urges forward science and philosophy alike.&quot;<br>
&#151;Alfred North Whitehead</center> </p>

<p> I write this, not expecting you to believe what you read here
just because I say so, but hoping this essay will interest you
enough to examine LSD research yourself. If you apply the same
research standards and spirit of open intellectual inquiry to
this body of research as you apply to your own work and to the
reports you read, you'll find that psychedelic research raises as
many exciting questions for you, your students, and your field of
expertise as it does for me and mine. For 2 decades reason;
science, and philosophy have been betrayed because of our
irrational rejection of psychedelic evidence. It is a
professional duty to help redress this error. When you read the
evidence, I think you'll see it that way, too.</p>

<h4>NOTES</h4>

<p> <a name="note1"></a>(1) My apologies to grammarians offended
by the noun &quot;consciousness&quot; used as an adjective. I do
this because &quot;conscious&quot; has misleading common usages.
Avoiding grammatically correct but lengthy phrases such as
&quot;the psychology of states of consciousness,&quot; or
&quot;education which takes states of consciousness into
account,&quot; I opt for a simple, useful, and ungrammatical
barbarism by stipulating my adjectival use of
&quot;consciousness&quot; to mean &quot;pertaining to states of
consciousness . &quot; <a href="#back1">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note2"></a>(2) In contradistinction to writings on
the psychedelics which are occupied with experiences the mind can
hare, the concern here is with evidence they afford as to what
the mind is. Judged both by quantity of data encompassed and by
the explanatory power of the hypotheses that make sense of this
data, it is the most formidable evidence the psychedelics have
thus far produced. The evidence to which we refer is that which
has emerged through the work of Stanislav Grof. (Huston Smith,
Forgotten Truth. The Primordial Tradition, p. 156). <a
href="#back2">(back)</a> </p>

<p> <a name="note3"></a>(3) &quot;0bscurantism is the refusal to
speculate freely on the limitations of traditional methods. It is
more than that: it is the negation of the importance of such
speculation, the insistence on incidental dangers.... Today
scientific methods are dominant, and scientists are the
obscurantists.&quot; (Alfred North Whitehead) <a href="#back3">(back)</a></p>

<h2 align="center">A NOTE ON ADVERSE EFFECTS</h2>

<p align="center">From: <i>Psychedelic Reflections,</i> Lester
Grinspoon &amp; James B. Bakalar <br>

<hr>

<p>While we are talking about the uses of psychedelic drugs, it
is appropriate to discuss their dangers. The psychedelic voyage
does produce some casualties; the question is how many and how
serious they are, what causes them, and how to prevent them. This
has been a matter of controversy since the 1960s. Drug users
sometimes would not confess that they had any problems, because
doubts and regrets were supposed to be a sign of rigidity or
repression or some other inadmissible personal problem. Anti-drug
crusaders sometimes would not admit that there was such a thing
as a good trip or an insight to be derived from psychedelic
drugs. </p>

<p>The most common adverse effect is the bad trip, which takes
many forms, from anxiety or panic to a (rare) psychotic state.
The worst kind is a fixed intense emotion or distorted thought
that can seem like an eternity of hell; for example, remorse,
suspicion, delusions of persecution or of being irreversibly
insane. Bad trips do not outlast the immediate effect of the
drug, and recovery is usually complete. They are not adverse drug
reactions in the narrow sense of something completely unintended
and unexpected. Even the best trips may have moments of anxiety
or depression, and every psychedelic drug user knows that
eventually he may have a trip dominated by painful or frightening
feelings: they are hardly more avoidable than fear when climbing
a mountain or pain when running a marathon. Bad trips are
sometimes regarded as more valuable than good ones, on the ground
that they teach the drug taker more about himself; the suffering
has the virtue of not seeming meaningless. In one study of LSD
users, 24 percent of the subjects had had what they considered
bad trips, and 50 percent considered the bad trips beneficial
(McGlothlin &amp; Arnold, 1971, p. 47). </p>

<p>Prolonged adverse reactions to psychedelic drugs are just as
varied in form as bad trips, and defy diagnostic classification
just as much. In fact, one way of looking at them is as
prolonged, more or less attenuated, or more or less intermittent
bad trips. As the defenses of the ego are altered, repressed
feelings and memories rise into consciousness, and they may
create enough anxiety to disrupt the organization of the mind.
Almost always, the defenses are reconstituted when the drug's
influence wears off; but if the drug user's personality is
unstable or the situation unsuitable&#151;if the set and setting
are wrong&#151;the disorganization may persist or return under
stress, as a kind of continuation of the unfinished psychedelic
experience. The result is a great variety of altered mental
states, from a mild recurrence of some drug-induced perceptual
change to depersonalization or outright psychosis. </p>

<p>By far the most common of these altered states is the
spontaneous recurrence or flashback. By the broadest definition,
a flashback is the transitory recurrence of emotions and
perceptions originally experienced while under the influence of a
psychedelic drug. It can last seconds or hours; it can mimic any
of the myriad aspects of a trip; and it can be blissful,
interesting, annoying, or frightening. Ordinarily they are only
slightly disturbing, especially since the drug user usually
recognizes them for what they are; they may even be regarded
lightheartedly as &quot;free trips. &quot; Occasionally they last
longer, and in a small minority of cases they turn into repeated
frightening images or thoughts. Usually they quickly decrease in
number and intensity. Flashbacks are most likely to occur under
emotional stress or at a time of altered ego functioning; they
are often induced by conditions like fatigue, drunkenness,
marihuana intoxication, and even meditative states. Marihuana
smoking is probably the most common single source of flashbacks. </p>

<p>On a broad definition, flashbacks are very common. According
to some studies, as many as a quarter of psychedelic drug users
have experienced some form of flashback; about half consider them
frightening and half consider them pleasant (Naditch &amp;
Fenwick, 1977). If the term is defined more narrowly for clinical
purposes as &quot;repeated intrusions of frightening images in
spite of volitional efforts to avoid them, &quot; it seems that
about 5 percent of habitual psychedelic drug users have
experienced them (McGlothlin, 1974, p. 27). </p>

<p>Other prolonged adverse reactions are much rarer. They have
been classified as chronic anxiety reactions, depressive
reactions, and psychoses. One study describes 16 hospitalized
patients who suffered from &quot;philosophical delusions,&quot;
intense visual hallucinations, and what the authors call a
striking variety of affective and neurotic symptoms, often they
had at least partial insight into the nature of their problems.
Many of them received electroconvulsive therapy, and the average
hospital stay was five and one-half weeks (Dewhurst &amp;
Hatrick, 1972). </p>

<p>The following is an example of a chronic anxiety state
produced by LSD: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>After much persuasion by his friends a twenty-year-old
    university student took 150 micrograms of LSD It was an
    &quot;interesting but disturbing time. &quot; Thereafter it
    became very difficult for him to study or concentrate, and he
    decided to drop out of school. He was unable to continue his
    part- time job as a stock clerk. There were strong feelings
    of the meaninglessness of life and he said that he was
    &quot;philosophically confused.&quot; Some days he felt
    normal again for a few hours, but then the strange, moving,
    compressing walls and time standing still made him fear he
    was going crazy. He had occasional thoughts of
    self-destruction. He would become very upset and panicky,
    break out into a sweat and sometimes freeze in terror. With
    considerable support, strong reassurance and tranquilizer
    therapy, the condition subsided six months after the LSD
    session (Cohen, 1970 [1965], p. 92). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of inadequate reporting and problems in interpreting
symptoms and causes, it is hard to tell how common adverse
reactions are. At Bellevue Hospital in New York from early 1965
to 1967, 200 patients appeared with complaints related to
LSD&#151;mostly panic reactions and flashbacks (Frosch, 1969). By
1969 Bellevue was seeing only one LSD reaction every 2 weeks, and
most of these were thought to be borderline schizophrenics in
whom the drug had precipitated a psychosis (Stern &amp; Robbins,
1969). A 1971 Canadian government survey of the hospital records
of 22,885 psychiatric patients found 67 cases (0.3 percent) where
LSD was mentioned as a factor in the primary diagnosis; most of
these patients had used many drugs, and the precise influence of
LSD was often unclear (Final Report, 1973, p. 378). </p>

<p>A questionnaire survey by J. Thomas Ungerleider and his
colleagues suggests a much larger number of adverse reactions.
The period covered was July 1, 1966 to January 1, 1968, and the
questionnaire was sent to 2,700 physicians, psychiatrists,
psychologists, and other health professionals in Los Angeles
County. Of the 1,584 who replied, 27 percent (including 47
percent of the psychiatrists) had seen adverse reactions to LSD;
the total number of adverse reactions was 8,958 (Ungerleider et
al., 1968). Unfortunately, the definition of adverse reaction was
left to the respondents, and the effect, the authors suggest, was
probably to define anything that made a drug user seek
professional help as an adverse reaction. The prevailing social
attitudes have to be taken into account; for example, it is
suspicious that in the same survey 1,887 adverse reactions to
marihuana were reported. Many of the &quot;adverse
reactions&quot; may have been nothing more than difficult moments
during drug trips that were mentioned in psychiatric interviews
because they seemed relevant to the problem under discussion;
some may have been simply drug-induced insights that made people
believe they needed help. </p>

<p>Serious adverse reactions to psychedelic drugs are rare today,
partly because they are being used more carefully and at smaller
doses than in the first flush of psychedelic enthusiasm, and
partly because LSD is no longer being unofficially promoted as a
solution for emotional crises in the lives of seriously disturbed
people. The most likely candidate for adverse reactions are
schizoid and pre-psychotic personalities with a barely stable ego
balance and a great deal of anxiety, who cannot cope with the
perceptual changes, body-image distortions, and symbolic
unconscious material produced by the drug. Murray Naditch has
found through questionnaires that adverse reactions to LSD and
marihuana (defined essentially as bad trips&#151;strong
unpleasant feelings, panic, fear of insanity or death, thoughts
of suicide) are associated with high scores on psychological test
scales representing schizophrenic tendencies, social
maladjustment, and regression (Naditch, 1975). L.J. Hekimian and
Samuel Gershon examined 47 patients admitted to Bellevue Hospital
between January and July 1967 after using a psychedelic drug in
the preceding 48 hours . In 31 cases psychotic conditions already
present were intensified. Ultimately 32 were diagnosed as
schizophrenic, 4 as schizoid, 6 as sociopaths, and 5 as
depressive or neurotic. The authors were struck by the frequency
of pre-existing schizophrenia (Hekimian &amp; Gershon, 1968). </p>

<p>It is certainly impossible to assume that anyone who suffers
from psychosis, depression, or chronic anxiety after using a
psychedelic drug would always have had the same problems in any
case, but it is also wrong to suppose that these problems are
likely to descend suddenly at any moment on a reasonably stable
person who takes a psychedelic drug in a reasonably protected
setting. The best analogy for adverse psychedelic drug reactions
is psychosis precipitated by cannabis. The egos of a few people
are so fragile that they can be precipitated into psychosis by
any severe stress or alteration in consciousness, including
surgery, an automobile accident, or alcohol intoxication; it is
they who will suffer the rare psychotic reactions to cannabis.
LSD and drugs like it are much more powerful mind-modifiers, and
more people are vulnerable to their disruptive effects, including
a few with no strong previous signs of emotional disturbance.
Psychedelic drugs are capable of magnifying and bringing into
consciousness almost any internal conflict, so there is no
typical prolonged adverse reaction to LSD in the sense in which
there is, say, a typical amphetamine psychosis (always paranoid).
Instead, as many different affective, neurotic, and psychotic
symptoms may appear as there are individual forms of
vulnerability. This makes it hard to distinguish between LSD
reactions and unrelated pathology, especially when some time
passes between the drug trip and the onset of the disturbance. </p>

<p>The best treatment for a bad trip is reassurance and
&quot;talking down&quot; in a quiet, friendly setting; that is
the way thousands have been handled with or without intervention
by psychiatrists. Sometimes this reassurance may take the form of
urging the drug user to go with it, give up resistance and allow
loss of control, dissolution of the ego, and a cathartic
resolution. Interpreting, judging, discussing, and being
&quot;objective&quot; are disastrous; asking questions almost
always exacerbates the problem by making impossible demands on
the drug taker. Anything that might cause suspicion and paranoia,
like superfluous movements or conversations, should be avoided.
Use of a tranquilizer or sedative should be only a last resort,
after talking down fails; diazepam (Valium) is better than
anti-psychotic drugs like chlorpromazine (Thorazine), which act
too abruptly and intensely. The appropriate treatment for
prolonged reactions to psychedelic drugs is the same as the
treatment for similar symptoms not produced by drugs:
psychotherapy and drugs where necessary. </p>

<p>The most important fact about chronic or long-term psychedelic
drug use is that there is very little of it. Psychedelic drugs
produce no psychological compulsion or craving and certainly no
physical addiction. A drug that takes people into a different
stretch of unfamiliar mental territory for 8 hours every time
they use it is not for every day or even every weekend. Drug
users soon come to understand that psychedelic trips are not to
be embarked on lightly, and they tend to stop using LSD or cut
down their consumption greatly after a short time. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, for a few people in the late sixties and early
seventies, LSD use became what H.S. Becker has called a
&quot;master trait.&quot; This kind of chronic user was known as
an acidhead or acid freak, and a not very flattering composite
portrait can be drawn from journalism, psychiatric papers, and
other sources. He speaks softly and his manner is meek; he is
passive and unwilling to take initiative. He talks a great deal
about love but fears genuine intimacy and often feels emotionally
lifeless. He is easily shattered by aggression or argument, finds
the &quot;hassles&quot; of daily life an ordeal, and prefers to
live in a world of drug-induced fantasy. He finds it difficult to
follow an argument or concentrate on a thought; he is given to
superstitious beliefs and magical practices. He does not work
regularly or go to school; he rejects the accepted social forms
and proselytized for LSD as a means of liberation from the
standard &quot;ego games&quot; that constitute most people's
lives, he blames society for his troubles and tends to see
himself as a martyr. On the other hand, he is often at least
superficially open, friendly, warm, relaxed, and uncompetitive;
he is childlike as well as childish, and people often like him
and feel protective toward him. But he may express aggression
indirectly through his unconventional dress and manner, by
absent- minded inconsiderateness, or by resentment of challenges
to his unjustified conviction of superior awareness and moral
insight. </p>

<p>Even if no one fits this stereotype perfectly and most
psychedelic drug users do not fit it at all, it does seem to have
some basis in reality. K.H. Blacker and his colleagues, using a
control group for comparison, studied 21 volunteer subjects who
had used LSD 15 to 300 times (average 65 times), and found some
of the features of the stereotypical acidhead: openness and
relaxation, likeableness, passivity and introversion, occult and
magical beliefs, hippie dress and hair styles. Four said they had
memory blanks and sometimes found it difficult to organize
thoughts and form sentences. </p>

<p>On the electroencephelogram (EEG), which records brain waves,
they did not have an unusually high rate of abnormalities; but
they did show significantly more energy in all frequency bands
than normal control subjects and psychiatric patients, and this
suggested lower than usual levels of anxiety. On tests of
intellectual capacity and auditory evoked response (both usually
sensitive to the disorganization produced by schizophrenia) the
LSD users were normal. But they were extraordinarily sensitive to
visual stimuli of low intensity, which confirmed their opinion
that they could observe gestures, postures, and shades of color
better than most people. They also seemed to modulate and
organize sensory stimuli in an unusual way, since there was no
relationship between their evoked visual responses and their
subjective tactile ones. The authors describe these subjects as
eccentric or childlike but not schizophrenic or otherwise
pathologically impaired. They emphasize that it was hard to
separate the effects of the drug from those of personality and
social climate. </p>

<p>Psychedelic drug users have also been tested for organic brain
damage. William McGlothlin and his colleagues (McGlothlin et al.,
1969) compared 16 subjects who had taken LSD 20 times or more
(the range was 20 to 1,100, the median was 75 times) with 16
controls; they examined the subjects clinically and also
administered the Halstead-Reitan test battery. There were no
clinical organic symptoms, and no scores on the
neuropsychological tests that suggested brain damage; but on a
test measuring capacity for nonverbal abstraction the LSD users
scored lower. As in the case of Tucker's Rorschach results, the
amount of LSD was not related to the score. Nevertheless, the
authors conclude that continual heavy use may cause minor organic
brain pathology: six of the LSD subjects, including the three
heaviest users, were regarded as &quot;moderately
suspicious&quot; in this respect. In another study, Morgan Wright
and Terrence P. Hogan (1972) found no difference between subjects
who had used LSD an average of 29 times and controls (matched for
age, sex, education, and IO) on a variety of neuropsychological
tests, including the ones used by McGlothlin. At most, these
studies confirm the existence of an eccentric acidhead
personality; they do not clearly imply mental illness or brain
damage. </p>

<p>In considering long-term psychedelic drug use, even more than
in assessing acute reactions, it is hard to extricate the
pharmacological contribution from the complex web of associations
tying it to personality and social setting. The limitations of
retrospective studies are notorious, but that is all we have. How
many long-term psychedelic drug users ever were really acidheads,
and how permanent is the condition? How often is psychopathology
associated with psychedelic drug use, and when it is, is the drug
cause, symptom, or attempted cure? In this case there is also a
potential for cultural bias that creates further complications.
When are eccentric beliefs and behavior pathological, and when
are they simply a hippie way of life? Now that some of the social
views and personal styles of the drug culture of the 1960s have
become more popular, we know that they never implied a
drug-induced personality change. </p>

<p>Obviously many heavy drug users are seriously disturbed
people, but the drug use is usually a symptom more than a cause
of the trouble. If emotional problems were always a cause and not
an effect of chronic psychedelic drug use, the status of acidhead
would be nothing but a refuge or role-disguise for certain
schizoid or inadequate personalities. But sometimes drug abuse
itself, whatever the original reasons for it, becomes the central
problem, notoriously so when the drug is addictive, like alcohol
or heroin. The same thing may happen with LSD, but that has been
rare since the 1960s and was not common even then . The best
model for understanding the changes in behavior that occur after
psychedelic drug use is not a drug-induced personality change or
modification of the brain but the changes in one's views of self
and world after a voyage to a strange country . </p>

<p>A note on genetic damage and birth defects has to be added,
because misconceptions about this subject still exist. Chromosome
damage from LSD was first reported by Maimon Cohen and his
colleagues in Science in 1967 (Cohen &amp; Marmilli, 1967). They
found a higher than normal proportion of chromosome breaks in a
paranoid schizophrenic patient who had been treated with LSD 15
times, as well as with chlorpromazine and other drugs; they also
found that LSD caused chromosome breaks in leukocytes (white
blood cells) artificially cultured in the laboratory. In the
rather overheated atmosphere of 1967, this paper gained an
immediate celebrity and became the basis for a sensationalistic
propaganda campaign featuring pictures of deformed children. Some
LSD users switched to what they thought was mescaline or
psilocybin and in fact was almost always mislabeled LSD or
phencyclidine (PCP). </p>

<p>Many other studies of this subject have appeared and continue
to appear; it would be impossible and pointless to review them
all. The literature review published in Science by Norman I.
Dishotsky and his colleagues in 1971 established the reassuring
conclusions that are now generally accepted. Examining nearly a
hundred papers, they found that LSD was a weak mutagen, effective
only at very high doses. It was not carcinogenic and did not
cause chromosome damage in human beings at normal doses. One
study showed that it caused no more chromosome breaks in
Laboratory-cultured cells than aspirin. Illicit drug users often
had more damaged chromosomes than control subjects; this was
attributable not to LSD but to malnutrition, infectious disease,
and general ill health as well as possible impurities in street
drugs. The few available prospective studies, mostly of
psychiatric patients before and after LSD use, showed no
chromosome damage. There was no evidence of a high rate of birth
defects in children of LSD users (Dishotsky et al., 1971). This
paper is well known and adequately covers the research up to
1971; later studies have allayed persisting doubts. There is also
no clear evidence that LSD or any other psychedelic drug causes
birth defects in the child when it is taken by a pregnant woman.
Nevertheless, pregnant women should avoid all drugs, especially
in the first three months. </p>

<p>To sum up, then, bad trips and mild flashbacks are common and
even expected, but usually considered a nuisance&#151;and
occasionally even an opportunity&#151;rather than a danger. More
serious but relatively rare problems are recurrent frightening
flashbacks, prolonged reactions (usually a few days but sometimes
weeks or longer), suicides, and accidents. Thought and perception
changes occur in some chronic users, but it is hard to say when
these are immediate drug effects and when they are the result of
reflection on the experience; in any case, they are rarely
pathological and and almost never irreversible. There is no good
evidence of organic brain damage or genetic alterations. The
dangers are greatest for unstable personalities and in
unsupervised settings. The most important limitation on the abuse
of these drugs is the absence of a reliable euphoria, which means
that people rarely go on using them, as they often go on using
stimulants and sedatives, in spite of repeated disasters. Bad
trips usually become deterrents before they become dangerous. </p>

<h3>A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE: FACT OR FANTASY ?</h3>

<h4>ALAN WATTS</h4>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since at least 1500 B.C. men have, from time to
time, held the view that our normal vision of the world is a
hallucination-a dream, a figment of the mind, or, to use the
Hindu word which means both art and illusion, a <i>maya</i>. The
implication is that, if this is so, life need never be taken
seriously. It is a fantasy, a play, a drama to be enjoyed. It
does not really <i>matter</i>, for one day (perhaps in the moment
of death) the illusion will dissolve, and each one of us will
awaken to discover that he himself is <i>what</i> there is and <i>all</i>
that there is-the very root and ground of the universe, or the
ultimate and eternal space in which things and events come and
go. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not simply an idea which someone
&quot;thought up,&quot; like science fiction or a philosophical
theory. It is the attempt to express an experience in which
consciousness itself, the basic sensation of being &quot;I,&quot;
undergoes a remarkable change. We do not know much about these
experiences. They are relatively common, and arise in every part
of the world. They occur to both children and adults. They may
last for a few seconds and come once in a lifetime, or they may
happen repeatedly and constitute a permanent change of
consciousness. With baffling impartiality they may descend upon
those who never heard of them, as upon those who have spent years
trying to cultivate them by some type of discipline. They have
been regarded, equally, as a disease of consciousness with
symptoms everywhere the same, like measles, and as a vision of
higher reality such as comes in moments of scientific or
psychological insight. They may turn people into monsters and
megalomaniacs, or transform them into saints and sages. While
there is no sure way of inducing these experiences, a favorable
atmosphere may be created by intense concentration, by fasting,
by sensory deprivation, by hyper-oxygenation, by prolonged
emotional stress, by profound relaxation, or by the use of
certain drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Experiences of this kind underlie some of the great
world religions-Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism in particular, and,
to a much lesser extent, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. As
expressed in the doctrines of these religions, they purport to be
an account of &quot;the way things are&quot; and therefore invite
comparison with descriptions of the universe and of man given by
physicists and biologists. They contradict common sense so
violently and are accompanied with such a powerful sense of
authenticity and reality (<i>more</i> real than reality is a
common description) that men have always wondered whether they
are divine revelations or insidious delusions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This problem becomes all the more urgent now that
the general public has become aware that experiences of this type
are available, with relative ease, through the use of such
chemicals as the so-called psychedelic drugs-LSD-25, mescaline,
psilocybin, hashish, and marijuana, to name only the better
known. The reality status of the modes of consciousness induced
by these chemicals becomes, then, a matter of most serious
concern for the guardians of our mental health, for psychiatrists
and psychologists, philosophers and ministers, for every
scientific investigator of the nature of consciousness, and,
above all, for a large section of the general public curious and
eager to get &quot;the experience&quot; for reasons of all kinds.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A proper study of the question runs, at the very
beginning, into two obstacles. The first is that we know very
little indeed about the structure and chemistry of the brain. We
do not know enough of the ways in which it gleans information
about the outside world and about itself to know whether these
chemicals help it (as lenses help the eyes) or confuse it. The
second is that the nature and use of these chemicals is
surrounded with an immense semantic fog, whose density is
increased by people who ought to know better. I mean
psychiatrists. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What we know, positively and scientifically, about
psychedelic chemicals is that they bring about certain
alterations of sense perception, of emotional level and tone, of
identity feeling, of the interpretation of sense data, and of the
sensations of time and space. The nature of these alterations
depends on three variables: the chemical itself (type and
dosage), the psycho-physiological state of the subject, and the
social and aesthetic context of the experiment. Their
physiological side effects are minimal, though there are
conditions (e.g., disease of the liver) in which some of them may
be harmful. They are not physiologically habit- forming in the
same way as alcohol and tobacco, though some individuals may come
to depend upon them for other (i.e., &quot;neurotic&quot;)
reasons. Their results are not easily predictable since they
depend so largely upon such imponderables as the setting, and the
attitudes and expectations of both the supervisor and the
subject. The (enormous) scientific literature on the subject
indicates that a majority of people have pleasant reactions, a
largish minority have unpleasant but instructive and helpful
reactions, while a very small minority have psychotic reactions
lasting from hours to months. It has never been definitely
established that they have led directly to a suicide. (I am
referring specifically here to LSD-25, mescaline, the mushroom
derivative psilocybin, and the various forms of <i>cannabis</i>,
such as hashish and marijuana.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus what we know for certain implies that these
chemicals cannot be used without caution. But this applies
equally to antibiotics, whiskey, household ammonia, the
automobile, the kitchen knife, electricity, and matches. No
worthwhile life can be lived without risks, despite current
American superstitions to the contrary-as that passing laws can
prevent people from being immoral and that technological power
can be made foolproof. The question is therefore whether the
risks involved in using these chemicals are worthwhile, and it
seems to me that what is worthwhile should be judged not only in
terms of useful known edge or therapeutic effect, but also in
terms of simple pleasure. (I have heard addiction to music
described in just the same vocabulary as addiction to drugs.) If
it turns out that psychedelics offer valid ways of exploring
man's &quot;inner world,&quot; the hidden ways of the mind and
brain, we should surely admit that new knowledge of this inmost
frontier may be worth quite serious risks. Psychoses and
compulsive delusions are, after all, no more dangerous than the
Indians and the mountain ranges that stood in the way of the
first settlers of the American West. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Psychiatrists often wonder why colleagues in other
branches of medicine and specialists in other fields of science
do not take them quite seriously. A typical reason may be found
in their haste to define the nature and effects of these
chemicals in terms which are simply prejudicial, and which boil
down to nothing more than gobbledygook with an authoritative
rumble. For example, the chemicals in question are commonly
classified as &quot;hallucinogenics&quot; or
&quot;psychotomimetics.&quot; The first word means that they
generate hallucinations, and the second that their effects
resemble, or mimic, certain forms of psychosis or insanity. Only
rarely do they give the impression of events in the external
world which are not actually happening (i.e., hallucinations) and
the ten-year-old notion that they induce &quot;model
psychoses&quot; such as temporary schizophrenia has long been
abandoned by those who are still in active research. But even if
these findings were to be contested, the words
&quot;hallucination&quot; and &quot;psychosis&quot; are loaded:
they designate <i>bad</i> states of mind, whereas a clean
scientific language should say only that these chemicals induce
different and unusual states of mind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is almost a standard joke that psychiatry has
pejorative or &quot;put-down&quot; words for every human emotion,
as &quot;euphoric&quot; for happy, &quot;fixated&quot; for
interested, and &quot;compulsive&quot; for determined. The
discussion of psychedelic chemicals, both in the scientific
literature and the public press, is thoroughly swamped with
question-begging language of this kind in articles that purport
to be impartial and authoritative. Right from the start the very
word &quot;drug,&quot; when used in this connection, evokes the
socially reprehensible image of people who are
&quot;drugged&quot; or &quot;doped&quot;-glassy-eyed, staggering,
or recumbent wrecks of humanity, withdrawn from reality into a
diabolical paradise of bizarre or lascivious dreams. The image of
the Fu Manchu opium den, with screaming meemies at the end of the
line. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus it is most common to find the action of
psychedelics called &quot;toxic&quot; (i.e., poisonous), and the
sensory and emotional changes induced referred to as
&quot;distortions,&quot; &quot;delusive mechanisms,&quot;
&quot;dissociations,&quot; and &quot;regressions,&quot; or as
&quot;loss of ego structure&quot; and &quot;abnormal perception
of body image.&quot; This is the language of pathology. Used
without explicit qualification, it implies that a consciousness
so changed is sick. Likewise, when-in the context of a scientific
article-the writer reports, &quot;Subjects experienced religious
exaltation, and some described sensations of being one with
God,&quot; and leaves it at that, the implication is plainly that
they went crazy. For in our own culture, to feel that you are God
is insanity almost by definition. But, in Hindu culture, when
someone says, &quot;I have just found out that I am God,&quot;
they say, &quot;Congratulations! You at last got the point.&quot;
Obviously, the word &quot;God&quot; does not mean the same thing
in both cultures. Yet psychiatrists toss off such utterly damning
remarks without scruple, and feel free to use their diagnostic
jargon of mental pathology for states of consciousness which many
of them have never even bothered to experience. For they expect
to get accurate information about these states from subjects
untrained in scientific description, fearing that if they
themselves entered into any new mode of consciousness it would
impair their scientific objectivity. This is pure scholasticism,
as when the theologians said to Galileo, &quot;We will not look
through your telescope because we already know how the universe
is ordered. If your telescope were to show us anything different,
it would be an instrument of the devil.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, so many practitioners of the inexact
sciences (e.g., psychology, anthropology, sociology) let it be
known most clearly that they already know what reality is, and
therefore what sanity is. For these poor drudges reality is the
world of non-party: it is the reduction of the physical universe
to the most banal and desiccated terms conceivable, in accordance
with the great Western myth that all nature outside the human
skin is a stupid and unfeeling mechanism. There is a sort of
&quot;official psychiatry&quot; of the army, state mental
hospital, and of what, in California, they call
&quot;correctional facility&quot; (i.e., prison), which defends
this impoverished reality with a strange passion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To come, then, to any effective evaluation of these
chemicals and the changed states of consciousness and perception
which they induce, we must begin with a highly detailed and
accurate description of what they do, both from the standpoint of
the subject and of the neutral observer, despite the fact that in
experiments of this kind it becomes startlingly obvious that the
observer cannot be neutral, and that the posture of
&quot;objectivity&quot; is itself one of the determinants of the
outcome. As the physicist well knows, to observe a process is to
change it. But the importance of careful description is that it
may help us to understand the kind or level of reality upon which
these changes in consciousness are taking place. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For undoubtedly they are happening. The dancing,
kaleidoscopic arabesques which appear before closed eyes are
surely an observation of <i>some</i> reality, though not,
perhaps, in the physical world outside the skin. But are they
rearranged memories? Structures in the nervous system? Archetypes
of the collective unconscious? Electronic patterns such as often
dance on the TV screen? What, too, are the fern-like structures
which are so often seen-the infinitude of branches upon branches
upon branches, or analogous shapes? Are these a glimpse of some
kind of analytical process in the brain, similar to the wiring
patterns in a computer? We really have no idea, but the more
carefully observers can record verbal descriptions and visual
pictures of these phenomena, the more likely that neurologists or
physicists or even mathematicians will turn up the physical
processes to which they correspond. The point is that these
visions are not mere imagination, as if there had ever been
anything mere about imagination The human mind does not just
perversely invent utterly useless images out of nowhere at all.
Every image tells us something about the mind or the brain or the
organism in which it is found. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The effects of the psychedelics vary so much from
person to person and from situation to situation that it is well
nigh impossible to say with any exactitude that they create
certain particular and invariable changes of consciousness. I
would not go so far as to say that the chemical effects are
simply featureless, providing no more than a vivid mirror to
reflect the fantasies and unconscious dispositions of the
individuals involved. For there are certain types of change which
are usual enough to be considered characteristic of psychedelics:
the sense of slowed or arrested time, and the alteration of
&quot;ego boundary&quot;-that is, of the sensation of one's own
identity. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The feeling that time has relaxed its pace may, to
some extent, be the result of having set aside the better part of
a day just to observe one's own consciousness, and to watch for
interesting changes in one's perception of such ordinary things
as reflected sunlight on the floor, the grain in wood, the
texture of linen, or the sound of voices across the street. My
own experience has never been of a distortion of these
perceptions, as in looking at oneself in a concave mirror. It is
rather that every perception becomes-to use a metaphor-more
resonant. The chemical seems to provide consciousness with a
sounding box, or its equivalent, for all the senses, so that
sight, touch, taste, smell, and imagination are intensified like
the voice of someone singing in the bathtub. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The change of ego boundary sometimes begins from
this very resonance of the senses. The intensification and
&quot;deepening&quot; of color, sound and texture lends them a
peculiar transparency. One seems to be aware of them more than
ever as vibration, electronic and luminous. As this feeling
develops it appears that these vibrations are continuous with
one's own consciousness and that the external world is in some
odd way inside the mindbrain. It appears, too, with overwhelming
obviousness, that the inside and the outside do not exclude one
another and are not actually separate. They go together; they
imply one another, like front and back, in such a way that they
become polarized. As, therefore, the poles of a magnet are the
extremities of a single body, it appears that the inside and the
outside, the subject and the object, the self and the world, the
voluntary and the involuntary, are the poles of a single process
which is my real and hitherto unknown self. This new self has no
location. It is not something like a traditional soul, using the
body as a temporary house. To ask <i>where</i> it is, is like
asking where the universe is. Things in space have a where, but
the thing that space is in doesn't need to be anywhere. It is
simply what there is, just plain basic isness! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How easily, then, an unsophisticated person might
exclaim, &quot;I have just discovered that I am God!&quot; Yet
if, during such an experience, one retains any critical faculties
at all, it will be clear that anyone else in the same state of
consciousness will also be God. It will be clear, too, that the
&quot;God&quot; in question is not the God of popular theology,
the Master Technician who controls, creates, and understands
everything in the universe. Were it so, a person in this state
should be able to give correct answers to all questions of fact.
He would know the exact height of Mount Whitney in millimeters.
On the other hand, this awareness of a deeper and universal self
would correspond exactly with that other type of God which
mystics have called the &quot;divine ground&quot; of the
universe, a sort of intelligent and superconscious space
containing the whole cosmos as a mirror contains images . . .
though the analogy fails in so far as it suggests something
immense: we cannot picture sizelessness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone moving into completely unfamiliar territory
may at first misunderstand and misinterpret what he sees, as is
so evident from the first impressions of visitors to foreign
lands where patterns of culture differ radically from their own.
When Europeans depicted their first impressions of China, they
made the roofs of houses exaggeratedly curly and people's eyes
slanted at least 45 degrees from the horizontal. Contrariwise,
the Japanese saw all Europeans as red-haired, sunken-eyed goblins
with immensely long noses. But the unfamiliarities of foreign
cultures are nothing to those of one's own inner workings. What
is there in the experience of clear blue sky to suggest the
structure of the optical nerves? Comparably, what is there in the
sound of a human voice on the radio to suggest the formations of
tubes and transistors? I raise this question because it is
obvious that any chemically induced alteration of the nervous
system must draw the attention of that system to itself. I am not
normally aware that the sensation of blue sky is a state of the
eyes and brain, but if I see wandering spots that are neither
birds nor flying saucers, I know that these are an abnormality
within the optical system itself. In other words, I am enabled,
by virtue of this abnormality, to become conscious of one of the
instruments of consciousness. But this is most unfamiliar
territory. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ordinarily, we remain quite unaware of the fact
that the whole field of vision with its vast multiplicity of
colors and shapes is a state of affairs inside our heads. Only
eyes within a nervous system within a whole biological organism
can translate the particles and/or waves of the physical world
into light, color, and form, just as only the skin of a drum can
make a moving hand go &quot;Boom!&quot; Psychedelics induce
subtle alterations of perception which make the nervous system
aware of itself, and the individual suddenly and unaccustomedly
becomes conscious of the external world as a state of his own
body. He may even go so far as to feel a confusion between what
other people and things are doing, on the one hand, and his own
volition, on the other. The particular feeling, or
&quot;cue,&quot; attached to thoughts and actions normally
understood to be voluntary may then be attached to what is
ordinarily classified as involuntary. (Similarly, in <i>deja vu</i>
or &quot;hasn't-this-happened-before?&quot; experiences,
perceptions of the immediate here and now come through with the
cue or signal usually attached to memories.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under such circumstances the naive observer might
well take these impressions so literally as to feel that the
universe and his own body are <i>in fact</i> one and the same,
that he is willing everything that happens, and that he is indeed
the God of populartheology. If that were all, the psychedelics
might certainly be dismissed as hallucinogens. We might conclude
that they merely confuse the &quot;wiring&quot; of the nervous
system in such a way that volition or &quot;I-am-doing-
this&quot; signals get mixed up with messages about the external
world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet the problem cannot be set aside so simply. Let
us suppose that a biologist wants to make a very detailed and
accurate description of the behavior of some particular organism,
perhaps of a sea bird feeding on the beach. He will be unable to
describe the behavior of the bird without also describing the
behavior of the water, of the sandworms or shellfish which the
bird is eating, of seasonal changes of tide, temperature, and
weather, all of which go together with the behavior of the bird.
He cannot describe the behavior of the organism without also
describing the behavior of its environment. We used to attribute
this to the fact that organisms are always reacting to things
that happen in their environments, and are even determined by
their environments in all that they do. But this is to speak as
if things were a collection of perfectly separate billiard balls
banging against one another. Today, however, the scientist tends
more and more to speak of the behavior of the organism and the
behavior of the environment as the behavior of a single
&quot;field,&quot; somewhat awkwardly named the
&quot;organism/environment.&quot; Instead of talking about
actions and reactions between different things and events, he
prefers to speak of transactions. In the transaction of buying
and selling, there is no selling unless there is simultaneously
buying, and <i>vice versa</i>. The relation of organism to
environment is also considered a transaction, because it has been
found that living creatures exist only in a balanced relationship
to one another. The present natural state of this planet
&quot;goes with&quot; the existence of human beings, just as
buying goes with selling. In any radically different environment,
man could survive only by becoming a different type of being. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The implications of this organism/environment
relationship are somewhat startling, for what is really being
said is this: The entity we are describing is not an organism in
an environment; it is a unified field or process, because it is
more simple and more convenient to think of what the organism
does and what the environment does as a single
&quot;behavior.&quot; Now substitute for &quot;entity we are
describing&quot; the idea of the self. I myself am not just what
is bounded by my skin. I myself (the organism) am what my whole
environmental field (the universe) is doing. It is, then, simply
a convention, a fashion, an arbitrary social institution, to
confine the self to some center of decision and energy located
within this bag of skin. This is no more than the rule of a
particular social game of cops and robbers, that is, of who shall
we praise and reward, and who shall we blame and punish? To play
this game, we pretend that the origin of actions is something
inside each human skin. But only force of long ingrained habit
makes it hard to realize that we could define and actually <i>feel</i>
ourselves to be the total pattern of the cosmos as focussed or
expressed <i>here</i>. This would be a sense of our identity
consistent with the scientific description of man and other
organisms. It would involve, too, the sensation that the external
world is continuous with and one with our own bodies-a sensation
very seriously needed in a civilization where men are destroying
their environment by misapplied technology. This is the
technology of man's <i>conquest</i> of nature, as if the external
world were his enemy and not the very matrix in which he is
brought forth and sustained. This is the technology of the dust
bowls, of polluted air, poisoned streams, chemical chickens,
pseudo- vegetables, foam-rubber bread, and the total Los
Angelization of man. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet how is this long-ingrained sense of insular
identity to be overcome? How is twentieth-century man to gain a
feeling of his existence consistent with twentieth-century
knowledge? We need very urgently to know that we are not
strangers and aliens in the physical universe. We were not
dropped here by divine whim or mechanical fluke out of some other
universe altogether. We did not arrive, like birds on barren
branches; we grew out of this world, like leaves and fruit. Our
universe &quot;humans&quot; just as a rosebush
&quot;flowers.&quot; We are living in a world where men all over
the planet are linked by an immense network of communications,
and where science has made us theoretically aware of our
interdependence with the entire domain of organic and inorganic
nature. But our ego-feeling, our style of personal identity, is
more appropriate to men living in fortified castles. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There seems to me a strong possibility that the
psychedelics (as a medicine rather than a diet) may help us to
&quot;trigger&quot; a new sense of identity, providing the
initial boost to get us out of the habit of restricting
&quot;I&quot; to a vague center within the skin. That they make
us aware that our whole knowledge of the external world is a
state of our own bodies is not a merely technical and trivial
discovery. It is the obverse of the fact that our own bodies are
functions, or behaviors, of the whole external world. This- at
first-weird and mystical sensation of &quot;unity with the
cosmos&quot; has been objectively verified. The mystic's
subjective experience of his identity with &quot;the All&quot; is
the scientist's objective description of ecological relationship,
of the organism/environment as a unified field. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our general failure (over the past three thousand
years of human history) to notice the inseparability of things,
and to be aware of our own basic unity with the external world,
is the result of specializing in a particular kind of
consciousness. For we have very largely based culture and
civilization on concentrated attention, on using the mind as a
spotlight rather than a floodlight, and by this means analyzing
the world into separate bits. Concentrated attention is drummed
into us in schools; it is essential to the three R's; it is the
foundation of all careful thought and detailed description, all
high artistic technique and intellectual discipline. But the
price we pay for this vision of the world in vivid detail, bit by
bit, is that we lose sight of the relationships and unities
between the bits. Furthermore, a form of attention which looks at
the world bit by bit doesn't have time to examine all possible
bits; it has to be programmed (or prejudiced) to look only at <i>significant</i>
bits, at things and events which are relevant to certain
preselected ends-survival, social or financial advancement, and
other fixed goals which exclude the possibility of being open to
surprises, and to those delights which are extra special because
they come without being sought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In my own experience, which is shared by very many
others, the psychedelics expand attention. They make the
spotlight of consciousness a floodlight which not only exposes
ignored relationships and unities but also brings to light
unsuspected details-details normally ignored because of their
lack of significance, or their irrelevance to some prejudice of
what ought to be. (For example, the tiniest hairs on people's
faces and blotchy variations of skin color, not really supposed
to be there, become marvelously visible.) There is thus good
reason to believe that the psychedelics are the opposite of
hallucinogens insofar as they decrease the selectivity of the
senses and expose consciousness to events beyond those that are
supposed to deserve notice. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Time after time, this unprogrammed mode of
attention, looking <i>at</i> things without looking <i>for</i>
things, reveals the unbelievable beauty of the everyday world.
Under the influence of programmed attention, our vision of the
world tends to be somewhat dusty and drab. This is for the same
reason that <i>staring</i> at things makes them blurred, and that
trying to get the utmost out of a particular pleasure makes it
something of a disappointment. Intense beauty and intense
pleasure are always gratuitous, and are revealed only to senses
that are not seeking and straining. For our nerves are not
muscles; to push them is to reduce their efficiency. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What, finally, of the strong impression delivered
both by the psychedelics and by many forms of mystical experience
that the world is in some way an illusion? A difficulty here is
that the word &quot;illusion&quot; is currently used
pejoratively, as the negative of everything real, serious,
important, valuable, and worthwhile. Is this because moralists
and metaphysicians are apt to be personality types lacking the
light touch? Illusion is related etymologically to the Latin <i>ludere</i>,
to play, and thus is distinguished from reality as the drama is
distinguished from &quot;real life.&quot; In Hindu philosophy,
the world is seen as a drama in which all the parts-each person,
animal, flower, stone, and star-are roles or masks of the one
supreme Self, which plays the <i>lila</i> or game of hide and
seek with itself for ever and ever, dismembering itself as the
Many and remembering itself as the One through endless cycles of
time, in the spirit of a child tossing stones into a pond through
a long afternoon in summer. The sudden awakening of the mystical
experience is therefore the one Self remembering itself as the
real foundation of the seemingly individual and separate
organism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the Hindu <i>maya</i>, or world illusion, is
not necessarily something bad. Maya is a complex word signifying
the art, skill, dexterity, and cunning of the supreme Self in the
exercise of its playful, magical, and creative power. The power
of an actor so superb that he is taken in by his own performance.
The Godhead amazing itself, getting lost in a maze. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Classical illustrations of <i>maya</i> include the
apparently continuous circle of fire made by a whirling torch,
and of the continuity of time and moving events by the whirring
succession of Asana, or atomic instants. Physicists use similar
metaphors in trying to explain how vibrating wavicles produce the
illusion of solid material. The impenetrability of granite, they
say, is something like the apparently solid disk made by the
blades of an electric fan: it is an intensely rapid motion of the
same minute orbits of light that constitute our fingers. Physics
and optics have also much to say about the fact that all reality,
all existence is a matter of relationship and transaction.
Consider the formula </p>

<p><center> a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; b = Rainbow</p>

<p> c&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; </center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; where <i>a</i> is the sun, <i>b</i> is moisture in
the atmosphere, and <i>c</i> is an observer, all three being at
the same time in a certain angular relationship. Deduct any one
term, <i>a, b</i> or <i>c,</i> or arrange them in positions
outside the correct angular relationship, and the phenomenon
&quot;rainbow&quot; will not exist. In other words, the actual
existence of rainbows depends as much upon creatures with eyes as
it depends upon the sun and moisture in the atmosphere. Common
sense accepts this in respect to diaphanous things like rainbows
which back off into the distance when we try to reach them. But
it has great difficulty in accepting the fact that chunky things
like apartment buildings and basic things like time and space
exist in just the same way-<i>only</i> in relation to certain
structures known as organisms with nervous systems. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our difficulty in accepting for ourselves so
important a part in the actual creation or manifestation of the
world comes, of course, from this thorough habituation to the
feeling that we are strangers in the universe-that human
consciousness is a fluke of nature, that the world is an external
object which we confront, that its immense size reduces us to
pitiful unimportance, or that geological and astronomical
structures are somehow more real (hard and solid?) than
organisms. But these are actually mythological images of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries-ideas which, for a
while, seemed extremely plausible, mostly for the reason that
they appeared to be hard-boiled, down to earth and tough-minded,
a currently fashionable posture for the scientist. Despite the
lag between advanced scientific ideas and the common sense of
even the educated public, the mythology of man as a hapless fluke
trapped in a mindless mechanism is breaking down. The end of this
century may find us, at last, thoroughly at home in our own
world, swimming in the ocean of relativity as joyously as
dolphins in the water. </p>

<h2>AFTERWORD<br>
<i>PSYCHEDELIC REFLECTIONS </i></h2>

<h3>By Lester Grinspoon and James B. Bakalar</h3>

<p>Copyright Human Sciences Press 1983</center></p>

<hr>

<p> One of the people we asked to write for this book replied
that after long thought he had to decline, because he feared the
effect on his ability to support himself and his family if he
said what he really thought about psychedelic drugs. This may be
an unusually strong expression of a feeling that is more common
in milder forms. Anyone, whatever his views on the drugs
themselves, ought to recognize that it is an unhealthy situation
in a free society. Even if this kind of fear is not
common&#151;even if it is not justified&#151; the fact that it
exists at all suggests something seriously wrong in our social
response to psychedelic drugs. They were once regarded by some as
the great liberating force of our time, the destined sacrament of
the Aquarian Age, and by others as a threat to sanity and
civilized society. In the last 10 years, since the end of the
psychedelic craze, they have been neglected almost entirely. All
these attitudes, as the essays in this anthology suggest, are
wrong, but apparently they can still affect people's actions to
the point of self-censorship. </p>

<p> It is hard to achieve balance in our thinking about
psychedelic drugs because the response to them is intimately
bound up with a whole set of attitudes about everything from
drugs in general to mysticism in general. As a drug abuse
problem, LSD and its relatives are no longer a very serious
issue. There has probably been a moderate decline in illicit use
of psychedelic drugs, and there has certainly been a substantial
decline in publicity about it. We are not ever likely to face an
epidemic of psychedelic drug abuse again. The question now is not
how to get these drugs off the streets&#151;which is probably
impossible anyway&#151;but how to get them back into
laboratories, hospitals, and other supervised settings. The irony
becomes obvious in rereading the public debates of the sixties.
The most determined opponents of the drug culture and advocates
of restrictive legislation continually warn against allowing the
concern about abuse of psychedelic drugs to prevent legitimate
research. But that is in effect what we have done. Uncontrolled
use continues, probably at the same level it would have reached
even without the laws, while controlled legal use has become
impossible. We should arrange ways for people to take psychedelic
drugs responsibly under appropriate guidance within the law, and
a way for those who want to administer them to volunteers for
therapeutic and general research to do so. This is not the place
to go into details about informed consent and selection,
preparation, and training of subjects and guides. But it is
important to keep in mind that from 1950 to 1962, when LSD and
mescaline were more freely available within the law than they are
ever likely to be again, there were very few reports of adverse
reactions. </p>

<p> To discuss how to handle the problem of psychedelic drugs
within the present system of rules and institutions, however, is
to suggest what a restricted and historically peculiar system it
is. LSD and its relatives are treated for research purposes very
much like a new antibiotic, as medicines to be tested for
specific, concrete, limited efficacy and safety and accepted or
rejected on that basis. In other words, the model is Western
physical medicine of the last 50 years. Compare the great variety
of more or less successful alternatives: Huichol peyote
ceremonies, Mazatec curing rites vision quests, psycholytic
therapy sessions, the Native American Church. These are the
arrangements that arise naturally in any culture where the drugs
are not suppressed, and analogues of them were developing among
us even when the LSD abuse problem was at its height. They still
exist, but they have been driven underground, and we have
effectively foreclosed our choices. For us anything called a drug
must be either a simple medicine or a &quot;drug of abuse.&quot;
Evaluating psychedelic drugs in the same way that we evaluate
aspirin will always be enormously to their disadvantage, since
they do not bring guaranteed relief for any simply defined
problem. The Mexican Indian who said, &quot;Aspirin is a drug,
peyote is sacred,&quot; was making a distinction that our laws do
not permit. </p>

<p> Using different analogies makes the anomalies in our laws and
attitudes obvious. For example, as a voyage and an adventure,
taking LSD might be compared to flying a plane or climbing a
mountain. Psychedelic drug use as a form of spiritual or
psychological exploration might be compared with methods like
kundalina yoga, Tantra, or the more emotionally intense forms of
psychotherapy, all of which induce drastic changes in
consciousness that may occasionally endanger emotional stability
for the sake of some alleged insight, awakening, or realization.
Even psychoanalysis can produce psychotic reactions. Yet no one
considers outlawing any of these practices. To many people
familiar with psychedelic drugs, such comparisons seem more
appropriate than an analogy with antibiotics or aspirin, or even
with drugs used mainly for pleasure or because of addiction . </p>

<p> Consider another analogy. Imagine that no one has ever
remembered his dreams before, except a few widely ignored
mystics, primitives, and madmen. Then someone invents an
electrical gadget that permits them to be recalled. At first,
dreams come as a revelation. People who use the machine are
overwhelmed by their depth of emotion and symbolic significance.
They rush out to look up the obscure literature about this
neglected state of awareness. Psychologists discover that dreams
are the royal road to the unconscious. Others examine them for
prophecies, philosophies, and religions, clues to personal
salvation and social revolution. Meanwhile, there are the many
who have never remembered their dreams and do not understand why
anyone considers them important or useful; they declare it all
mental illness and social decadence, and demand that the machines
be outlawed. Ultimately the dreamers too become somewhat
disillusioned. Remembering and interpreting dreams provides no
sure cure for any illness and no obvious alternative view of the
world. Their meaning for art, philosophy, and religion is
ambiguous. Many dreams are unpleasant or frightening. People
sometimes act foolishly in following the commands of their
dreams. Some dream interpretation is superstitious, some of the
popular dream interpreters are of dubious character, and some of
the dream cults have repellent practices. Dreams are not the
answer. </p>

<p> One possible outcome is that we decide to record and study
dreams, relate them to other states of consciousness and to
neurophysiology, find out their possible scientific, therapeutic,
and creative uses, and so on, while cautioning against
overvaluation of them. Another possibility is withdrawing in
fear, declaring that we were meant to forget our dreams and that
remembering them is pathological and socially debilitating, and
finally suppressing the means by which they are remembered. We
have removed a source of disturbance, at the price of denying
part of our own potential. Psychedelic drugs resemble this
imaginary machine. They sometimes allow people to see things
about themselves that they did not know before, without telling
them how to interpret and act on what they see. We have the
choice of ignoring and suppressing this knowledge or finding ways
to make use of it. </p>

<p> One of the main problems is that we have no appropriate
classification for psychedelic drugs. We cannot regard them as
divine: should we then treat them like aspirin or heroin? Are
they outlawed because we fear drugs, or because we fear the
social effects of altered states of awareness, religious
intensity, and mysticism? LSD use may be conceived as part of a
drug problem that also includes something as utterly different as
heroin addiction; it may also be seen as part of a social trend
toward irrationalist religious enthusiasm combined with scorn for
gainful labor and political participation; and these fears are in
practice inextricably entangled. </p>

<p> In modern society we are uneasy about experiences we cannot
quickly classify. We are unwilling to tolerate much ambiguity,
for example, about whether an activity is religious ritual,
medicinal, or recreation, and our legal arrangements depend on
these classifications. Use of psychoactive drugs in general and
of psychedelic drugs in particular crosses these lines and
muddies these distinctions, and that appears as a threat to
control and rationality, a problem for the law and society. We
have chosen, in effect, to divide psychoactive drugs into three
categories: first, medicines, second, drugs that may be used for
pleasure (alcohol is the main example) and third, so-called drugs
of abuse, a few of which also have medical uses. Psychedelic
drugs have been classified as drugs of abuse without medical
uses, and our legal and social attitudes toward them follow from
that. Some of the hostility to psychedelic drugs, especially
among people who are unsophisticated about them, is based on the
assumption that they are just another exotic vice providing
enviable but dangerous thrills, which like all such stereotypical
vices can also drive the user into addiction, madness, and
despair . </p>

<p> But at a deeper level the social response to psychedelic
drugs is also connected with their users' tendency to revert to
religious language and interpretations in talking about them. The
idea of drug use as a religious practice&#151;in fact, of any
connection between drugs and religion&#151;is one we are willing
to indulge in preindustrial cultures but violently reject for
ourselves. Orthodox religion in the West long ago abandoned the
sacramental use of drugs, so during the psychedelic era this
field was appropriated by sects, eclectic or syncretic, which
challenged the hegemony of established medical and police rules.
The &quot;LSD priest&quot; (Timothy Leary's term) who led a
&quot;drug cult&quot; was in effect a rival of the physician in
importing and applying expertise on drugs. The old calling of
priesthood or shamanism invaded territory claimed by modern
medical professionals. Modern medicine was even likened to a
state religion, with imposing organized strength, an
intellectually powerful ideology, an ability to create and
sustain faith, and the all-important support of civil authority;
it was said to treat unorthodox healing practices as heresy or
pagan superstition to be eliminated by a mixture of official
coercion and missionary activity. A religious war in which
medicine served as the ideological arm of cultural orthodoxy was
said to be disguised by scientific terminology and talk about
health hazards. </p>

<p> These quasi-religious disputes suggest that our attitudes
toward psychedelic drugs involve response to certain kinds of
experience as well as certain substances. We have a mysticism
problem as well as a drug problem, and its historical causes are
older and more complicated than the causes of the drug
controversy. Mystical, messianic, and shamanistic religion always
comes into conflict with established authority after social
evolution has reached the stage of hierarchical state systems.
Any contact with divinity not subject to priestly mediation and
formulation in terms of traditional doctrines appears as a threat
to the political and social order, and may be classified as
madness or vice. It is feared that all accepted standards will be
abandoned in a frenzied search for some individual or communal
self-realization. </p>

<p> The potential challenge to social order in all forms of
religious intoxication, drug-induced or not, is augmented by
special characteristics of modern Western society. Max Weber
discovered a cultural foundation of modernity in the Protestant
ethic of inner-worldly asceticism, which developed at about the
same time as the scientific revolution. The Protestant ethic
demands the attainment of salvation by work and activity
according to rational norms within this world. In identifying
religious duty with rule-governed mastery of everyday life, it
opposes all forms of otherworldliness in religion, including the
other-worldly asceticism of desert saints; it also opposes all
mysticism, for in mysticism the highest virtue is to be possessed
rather than active, a vessel rather than an instrument of
divinity. Both conservatives and radicals in a society devoted to
the extension of rule-governed control over the external world
are likely to see great dangers in mystical and messianic
religion, either because it is too passive and socially quietist,
or simply because it may tend to devaluate everyday life and
economic activity. </p>

<p> This mistrust of religious virtuosity, whether it takes the
generic or the specifically modern form, should not be regarded
as mere cowardice, intellectual rigidity, or defense of
established privilege. As the sadder aspects of hippie culture
showed, all standards of truth and social responsibility may be
abandoned in the search for spiritual revitalization by means of
magic, myth, and mystery. Mysticism claiming ineffability is a
common form of rebellion in rationalistic ages like our own; it
can be useful in moderating the excessive pretensions of
intellect, but the danger is that it will turn into a mere plea
of impotence: a denial of reason and an admission of incapacity
to cope with social problems that takes the form of quietism or
messianic fanaticism </p>

<p> So the belief that psychedelic religiosity may cause a
breakdown of social order (as conservatives fear) or abandonment
of the struggle for social change (as radicals fear) is no more
and no less reasonable than the fear of a breakdown of individual
mental stability during a drug trip; in some circumstances it
could be justified. But for the most part these circumstances do
not now exist. As the essays in this book prove, the vision
achieved in ecstatic states usually depends for its social
content on the intellectual set that is brought to it; once it
recedes it can serve as a backdrop for action as well as
passivity, and for moderate as well as extreme action. </p>

<p> If the self-image of modern Western society cannot easily
accommodate virtuoso religion and mysticism, it also precludes
the suppression of virtuoso religion and mysticism. Liberal
principles demand free speech, freedom of worship, and the right
of privacy. The government does not claim to know what sorts of
experiences and thoughts its subjects should and should not
cultivate. But drugs are a special case. We do not admit, even to
ourselves, that outlawing psychedelic drugs could be in part an
attempt to eliminate certain kinds of experience and thinking. By
regarding them as merely exotic vice, dangerous instruments, or
poisonous substances, we avoid the issue. Therefore, in the case
of drugs, the liberal principles that prevent expression of the
typical modern distrust of enthusiastic and mystical religion by
legally suppressing it do not operate. </p>

<p> Psychedelic drugs are a borderline case in many
ways&#151;therapeutically, intellectually, and socially. The
components of research, therapy, religion, and recreation in
their use are hard to separate (the awkward term
&quot;consciousness-expansion&quot; is an attempt to define a
role for them by avoiding all these familiar categories). Since
we do not know where to place them, they become an easy target
for confused fears about drugs in general or matters unrelated to
drugs. For example, the idea has been suggested that centers
should be established where people could go to take psychedelic
drugs in a safe environment. But are these centers conceived as
analogous to resorts, amusement parks, psychiatric clinics,
religious retreats, Outward Bound expeditions, or scientific
research institutions? Without any further examination, the very
ambiguity of purpose is enough to create hostility and suspicion.
And in this field liberal governments feel justified in asserting
themselves with the kind of confidence that only despotic
governments display with respect to other social questions. </p>

<p> Our legal and political institutions, like our natural
science and psychiatry, are failing to supply the complex
response these complex drugs demand. We should show more
confidence in our capacity to tolerate and make use of them. That
demands, first, a more consistent application of liberal
principles. We need to produce a suitable balance between
individual choice and protective authority, and in doing this it
is probably useless to try to find replacements for the existing
inadequate conceptual categories. We simply have to tolerate some
openly recognized ambiguity in dealing with psychedelic drugs.
The old forms of religious justification, for example, are
obviously no longer plausible. Except for a few isolated
individuals and groups like the peyote church, intoxication can
no longer be sacred in the primitive and ancient sense, no matter
how intensely religious it may seem as pure experience. Too much
has been changed by the intellectual and social revolutions of
the modern age; there is no point in mourning the loss, if it is
one. </p>

<p> But we have something to learn from religious forms of drug
use, especially about the protective and assimilative function of
ceremony. Preindustrial societies might also have something to
teach us about the proper balance between democracy and authority
in managing psychedelic drugs. When primary religious experience
is no longer restricted to specially qualified charismatic
individuals, the resulting democratization presents special
dangers and opportunities. The danger is that everyone will think
himself qualified to start his own religion, as Timothy Leary
once half-facetiously recommended, and some sort of authority and
tradition is needed to avoid this parody of liberal
individualism. </p>

<p> For example, in his last novel, <i>Island,</i> Aldous Huxley
tried to salvage a communal significance for the drug experience
by imagining a utopia in which psychedelic drugs play an integral
part. On his fictitious island in the Indian Ocean, a
decentralized political system and a Western science and
technology stripped of their excesses are guided by a Buddhist
philosophical/religious tradition, with the help of a psychedelic
drug called moksha medicine that is used on carefully defined
occasions, especially by the dying and in initiation rites.
Huxley's utopia avoids the danger of excessive individualism by
an emphasis on community, discipline, and tradition in the use of
psychedelic drugs. The usefulness of the drug depends on the
quality of the social system and not the other way around. He
also avoids the cultural limitations of primitive mythologies and
communities by incorporating the most tolerant and ecumenical of
the great world religions and the most universally applicable
body of human intellectual achievement. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, Huxley is pessimistic about his own solution,
at least for the short run. His utopia survives only because it
is an island that has been fortunately isolated for generations
from the malevolent forces of the modern world. In the moving and
horrifying final chapter, it is destroyed in a coup d'etat by a
neighboring ruler who represents Oil, Progress, Spiritual Values
(Huxley's ironic capital letters), military force, lying
propaganda, and demagogic tyranny in a combination with all the
worst features of capitalism, communism, and third-world
nationalism. If the fate of Huxley's island turns out to be the
fate of the world, there will certainly be no place in it for
psychedelic drugs. Whatever their dangers and potential for
abuse, they are worse than useless to a modern despotism. Unlike
Huxley's earlier invention,<i>soma</i>, they do not reconcile the
user to a routine or keep the fires of the intellect and passion
burning low. On the other hand, the hippie idea of drugging
ourselves into individual and social salvation is obviously
illusory, and Huxley certainly did not mean to promote that
illusion. </p>

<p> Something in the nature of our society and of the drug trip
itself tends to make us fall into attitudes of worshipful awe or
frightened contempt when thinking about psychedelic drugs. It is
as though they had to be either absolutely central or beyond the
periphery of normal human experience. But in primitive shamanism
that is not what happens; instead, at least ideally, &quot;the
otherwise unfettered power of the world beyond human society is
harnessed purposefully and applied to minister to the needs of
the community.&quot; (Lewis, 1971, p. 189). That is just what
technology, including drug technology, is supposed to do in our
society. We should find a modest role for psychedelic drugs, not
deifying or demonizing or ignoring them, and distinguishing
rational from irrational fears. The metaphysical hunger that
provides one reason for the interest in these drugs is a
permanent human condition, not an aberration that is created by
the drugs nor one that can be eliminated by suppressing them.
Huxley's <i>Island</i> expresses not faith in psychedelic drugs,
which would be a form of idolatry, but hope for mankind. It
dramatizes the conviction that the drugs can be used, rather than
condemned and neglected, and that finding a way to use them well
is a test for humanity. We should use our resources of
intelligence, imagination, and moral discernment to face that
test.</p>

<p>Introduction by Peter Webster</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In seeking to explore the elusive nature of consciousness,
    philosophers have sometimes resorted to &quot;thought
    experiments,&quot; much as physicists do when thinking about
    the enigmas of relativity. Todd C. Moody, associate professor
    in philosophy at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia,
    recently contributed a paper to <a
    href="http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint"><i>The Journal of
    Consciousness Studies</i></a> in which he proposed such a
    thought experiment. Professor Moody's ideas sparked a lively
    debate in the on-line discussion forum of the Journal, and
    led to a published <a
    href="http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint/jcs_2_4.html">Symposium</a>
    on the subject of his paper which was entitled,
    &quot;Conversations with Zombies&quot;. (<i>JCS,</i> <b>1</b>,
    (2), pp. 196-200, available at <a
    href="http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint">http://www.zynet.co.uk/imprint</a>)
    </p>
    <p> Moody's thought experiment was an attempt to understand
    whether, and perhaps how, consciousness might be a phenomenon
    independent from or non-essential to the processes of the
    nervous system and associated behavior. Would it be possible
    that a computer, or some hypothetical being, might have all
    the behavioral attributes and powers of a conscious human yet
    lack the self-awareness, and awareness of awareness that we
    call consciousness? In sum, Moody proposed at least the
    theoretical and philosophical existence of
    &quot;zombies,&quot; beings behaviorally identical to humans,
    yet lacking consciousness. </p>
    <p> One of the contributors to the Symposium, Charles T.
    Tart, submitted a short commentary inspired by ideas often
    expressed in Sufism, Zen, or other Eastern philosophies: that
    most human beings are, most of the time, not at all fully
    conscious, and require techniques such as meditation to
    awaken them from that functional but often profoundly
    unsatisfying state of normal everyday awareness. Professor
    Tart has written extensively on such subjects as meditation,
    hypnosis, dreams, and the use of psychedelics in the
    production of <i>Altered States of Consciousness,</i> (the
    title of one of his books). His contribution to <a

<h4>Observations on Moody's 'Conversations with Zombies'</h4>

<hr>

<p> Moody (1994) ends his provocative article on 'Conversations
with zombies' by raising the possibility that 'We might, after
all, be zombies'. By zombies he means creatures who appear to act
intelligently, like us, but who have no internal experience of
consciousness. My basic point in this brief commentary will be to
note as a basic observation that we are indeed, as a matter of
verifiable fact, like zombies most of the time <i>but</i> we have
a possibility of becoming conscious. The consequences of this
observable and testable reality are of enormous importance for
the development of a fuller understanding of consciousness and
its possibilities. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The approach I take here is empirical and
scientific, rather than philosophical. By 'science' I mean an
approach to understanding <i>all</i> of reality that puts
absolute and primary emphasis on observables, whether these
observables are external or internal to the observer, and
secondary emphasis on conceptual understanding. That is, creating
an elegant and logical understanding of something, a theory, is
fine, but if that understanding does not account for <i>all</i>
of the relevant observations, both postdictively and
predictively, that's too bad for the theory, not the
observations. My understanding of scientific method, and some
important aspects of its application to the investigation of
altered states of consciousness, has been described in detail
elsewhere (Tart, 1972). This approach is hardly unique to me:
except for the observation of how many 'scientists' there seem to
be who subrate or refuse to look at data which does not accord
with their theoretical convictions, I had always thought this was
the generally agreed-upon definition of what constituted science.
</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; To illustrate this primacy of observation: at
the beginning of my career, as a graduate student, I began
extensive research on the effects of post-hypnotic suggestions on
nocturnal dreaming (Tart, 1962; 1963). In the course of reviewing
the literature, I came across a monograph by a philosopher
(Malcolm, 1959) which logically and conclusively proved that
there were no such things as dreams: I had nightmares about it
all that night! Since then I have come to realize that one can
probably build a convincing and 'logical' case for almost
anything, especially if the conclusions appeal to one's hidden
prejudices. Thus I seldom pay much attention to arguments about
consciousness unless they work intimately and usefully with the <i>full</i>
range of relevant observables. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h4>Zombies</h4>
</center>

<p>Moody notes that </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Zombies are, in relation to us, in the same predicament
    that most of us are in relation to those mystics who report
    back to us their experiences of what is sometimes called
    superconsciousness. We can ape what they say if we want to,
    but we don't really know what we are talking about. This
    difficulty is sometimes referred to in the mystical
    literature as 'ineffability', but the mystics understand each
    other, just as human non-zombies do. (p. 200.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I would describe myself as an empiricist and
scientist and a very practical person, not the kind of person we
popularly associate with the term 'mystic'. I do not feel I am in
some special relation to a Higher Power or God, am not subject to
sudden states of ecstasy, and do not have any special, 'holy'
doctrine to defend. But as a result of more than 30 years of
observations, both external and internal, I would like to report
that: </p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#149; Ordinary, 'normal' consciousness is indeed a
    zombie-like state of greatly constricted and distorted, if
    not absent, 'consciousness'. I have given such ordinary
    consciousness the technical name of 'consensus consciousness'
    in the purely descriptive sense and 'consensus trance' when
    focusing on it as a restricted state (Tart, 1975, 1986,
    1994).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#149; I know from personal experience that there is a
    transient and perhaps permanent 'awakening' from consensus
    trance/consciousness, a clarification or lucidity, that is
    rewarding and adaptive in itself, as well as vividly
    illustrating the zombie-like qualities of ordinary
    consciousness. Although it is hard to describe this condition
    or state (it's more process than concrete state), for this
    paper we will refer to it as the 'expanded consciousness
    state'. The term Moody used, 'superconsciousness', is too
    grandiose for the experiences I speak of from direct
    knowledge. Such experiences also exist, but need not concern
    us in this paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#149; People in this expanded consciousness state or
    process seem indeed to understand each other fairly well,
    even though what they communicate may sometimes seem
    ineffable to those in ordinary, zombie-like consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Here I must make a vital point: the above three
observations are of quite limited value and possibly misleading
if one only thinks about them. But they can be understood and
verified through training and experience. Such experiential
understanding need not be limited to strange and unusual people,
such as the connotations of terms like 'mystics' bear. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; To illustrate: In the early 1970s, I took a
number of classes on meditation from a Tibetan lama, Tarthang
Tulku, living in Berkeley. One of the practice instructions he
frequently referred to was to look for the 'space between
thoughts'. I found the concept of the space between thoughts
fascinating. For one thing, it was of great theoretical
significance if thoughts were discrete entities with a gap
between them, rather than continuous, as I had previously
experienced them. It also made sense that if one could find such
a space, it could produce a sort of liberation from the tyranny
that thoughts often produced as they captured one's attention. I
had many interesting and exciting thoughts during my attempts at
meditation about what this space between thoughts would be like
and its possibilities. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; But I never <i>experienced</i> any gap or space
between my thoughts. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I have always tried to be as honest as possible
with myself, as well as with others, as both an essential part of
my scientific activity and as a guideline for living. Eventually
I had to admit to myself that I was fascinated by the <i>concept</i>
of a space between thoughts but that, for all practical purposes,
there was no observable space between <i>my</i> thoughts. While I
had fantasies about what such an experience would be like, I had
no real knowledge of it at all. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h4>Expanded Consciousness State</h4>
</center>

<p>Twenty years later I can report that I have now experienced
the space between thoughts many times, that I can often produce
and prolong that expanded consciousness state, to various
degrees, at will, and that from within that kind of
`spaciousness', it is clear that my ordinary consciousness, where
I live 99+% of my life, is indeed zombie-like. Yet in this state
of zombie consciousness, which is `normal' for our civilization,
I am generally considered an intelligent, articulate and
successful person. I am, in not quite the way I believe he
intended it, a living illustration of Moody's point about
zombies, viz. 'They engage in complex behaviours, very similar to
ours, but these behaviours are not accompanied by conscious
experience of any sort.' These behaviours can, unfortunately,
include talking and writing about 'awakening' and 'higher
consciousness', i.e. actually being in this more conscious state
is a quite distinct thing from conceptualizing about it. That is,
it is easier to have fantasies about being in a state of expanded
consciousness rather than actually living it. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; To be more precise, I am ordinarily conscious
in consensus trance by normal, social standards of consciousness:
internal experiences accompany most of my behaviour, often
including the intellectual knowledge that I am having specific
sorts of experiences &#151; what we usually call
self-consciousness. I think, I plan, I remember, I experience
sensations, I experience pleasure and pain, hope and fear. So I
am not a zombie in Moody's particular use of the term. But from
the perspective of the (usually fleeting but sometimes longer)
state of the gap between thoughts, of 'awakening' in Gurdjieff's
sense (Ouspensky, 1949; Tart, 1986, 1994), my ordinary state of
consciousness is zombie-like in the general pejorative sense of
the term. These zombie qualities include: (a) a greatly reduced
sense of aliveness and vitality; (b) a great narrowing of
perspective and perception; (c) a consuming psychological
identification with some small subset of my full potential; (d)
reduced intelligence stemming from this narrow perspective and
identification; and (e) a selfishness, a self-centredness as
compared to a more open and compassionate attention to the rest
of reality. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h4>The Dream Analogy</h4>
</center>

<p>To try to further communicate some of the differences between
the more 'awakened' state and ordinary consciousness, let me use
the traditional analogy drawn in Eastern enlightenment traditions
between nocturnal dreaming and ordinary waking. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; During a dream, we almost always take what is
happening as real. We are a real self having experiences within a
real world. When the dream situation is pleasant, fine, when it
is unpleasant, we suffer. When we wake up to ordinary waking
consciousness, however, we realize that the dream state was a
quite inferior state of consciousness in that (a) we did not know
our true condition, viz. dreaming; (b) we were not our usual
`real' self; (c) capacities we take for granted in the waking
state, such as ability to reason and draw up relevant memories
and skills were absent or distorted; and (d) our dream suffering
and problems were pseudo-suffering and pseudo-problems, and were
cured not on their own terms but by waking up to our real
identity and situation in the waking world. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, in moments or periods of that 'space
between thoughts' or expanded consciousness, I feel that I have
been unconscious (a) of my true condition (lost in the limited)
and of (b) my real identity (a non-verbalizable, non-concrete
sense of openness and process, rather than thingness); (c)
deprived of a clear perception and straightforward responsiveness
to the world; and (d) often suffering over 'problems' that were
not real, that only existed by virtue of my constricted mental
condition. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h4>Observational Status of these Points</h4>
</center>

<p>I shall make no attempt to argue or reason in support of the
above statements. Part of the understanding I have come to in my
three decades of research on consciousness is that reasoning and
logic (following rules, given a priori assumptions), while very
useful in a multitude of ways, are only a <i>part</i> of the
totality of conscious functioning and this part cannot reduce the
whole of consciousness to its terms. So, in the spirit of
science, the above are offered as observations that the reader
can potentially validate for herself if she is interested in
doing so. Space limitations here do not allow discussions of
methods, but the literature of the slowly growing field of
transpersonal psychology has many such discussions, as does the
traditional mystical literature. The methods that have worked
well for me are described in two books (Tart, 1986, 1994). I have
also found these methods for enhancing mindfulness in everyday
life quite teachable to selected graduate students. Excellent
introductions to mindfulness meditation, an important aspect of
method, are (Goldstein, 1987, 1994; Goldstein &amp; Kornfield,
1987; Kabat-Zinn, 1990; 1994; Kornfield, 1993; LeShan, 1975;
Salzberg, 1995). </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <center></p>

<h4>Will our Study of Consciousness go beyond Consciousness<sup>Z</sup>?</h4>
</center>

<p>In his final paragraph, Moody speculates: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Consider the possibility that a few zombies might discover
    a discipline that, after considerable practice, turns them
    into non-zombies like us. It would presumably be difficult to
    convince other zombies that such a discipline has any point,
    and it would be quite easy for the zombies to dismiss the
    phenomenon as marginal or pathological. The zombie scenario
    does not prove the `validity' of mystical experience,
    whatever that might mean, but it does entail that such
    experience cannot be dismissed on the grounds of its radical
    unfamiliarity to the rest of us. We might, after all, be
    zombies. (p. 200.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The interested reader is invited to experiment
with 'awakening', with finding the spaciousness between thoughts
(not to be confused with a suppression of thought or simple
blankness) that gives a much wider scope to our understanding of
consciousness. I believe everyone has had at least fleeting
moments of expanded consciousness, even if largely forgotten in
the hectic rush of zombie life<sup>Z</sup>, and this commentary
is to remind you of them and their importance. If we do not
develop this wider perspective, we shall, in Moody's terms, just
have our zombie science of consciousness<sup>Z</sup>, thought<sup>Z</sup>,
feeling<sup>Z</sup>, hope<sup>Z</sup>, fear<sup>Z</sup>, life<sup>Z</sup>
and death<sup>Z</sup>. Speaking from my occasional experiences of
expanded consciousness, that would be sad indeed. </p>

<h3>Alan W. Watts</h3>

<p>An excerpt from <i>In My Own Way<br>
An Autobiography, 1915&#151;1965</i><br>
©1972 by Alan Watts. Pantheon Books</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On returning to America [in 1958] I was
introduced to psychiatric adventures of a very different order,
for Aldous Huxley had recently published <i>Doors of Perception</i>
about his experiment with mescaline, and had by this time gone on
to explore the mysteries of LSD. Gerald Heard had joined him in
these investigations, and in my conversations with them I noticed
a marked change of spiritual attitude. To put it briefly, they
had ceased to be Manicheans. Their vision of the divine now
included nature, and they had become more relaxed and humane, so
that I found myself talking to men of my own persuasion. Yet it
struck me as highly improbable that a true spiritual experience
could follow from ingesting a particular chemical. Visions and
ecstasies, yes. A taste of the mystical, like swimming with
waterwings, perhaps. And perhaps a reawakening for someone who
had made the journey before, or an insight for a person well
practiced in something like Yoga or Zen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, on these &quot;inner planes&quot; I
am of an adventurous nature, and am willing to give most things a
try. Both Aldous and my former student at the Academy,
mathematician John Whittelsey, were in touch with Keith Ditman,
psychiatrist in charge of LSD research at the UCLA department of
neuropsychiatry. John was working with him as statistician in a
project designed both to test the effect of the drug on
alcoholics and to make a map of its effects on the human
organism. So many of their subjects had reported states of
consciousness that read like accounts of mystical experience that
they were interested in trying it out on &quot;experts&quot; in
this field, even though a mystic is never really expert in the
same way as a neurologist or a philologist, for his work is not a
cataloguing of objects. But I qualified as an expert insofar as I
had also a considerable intellectual knowledge of the psychology
and philosophy of religion: a knowledge that subsequently
protected me from the more dangerous aspects of this adventure,
giving me a compass and something of a map for this wild
territory. Furthermore, I trusted Keith Ditman. He wasn't scared,
like so many Jungians, of the unconscious. Nor was he foolhardy,
but seemed level-headed, cautious, tentative in opinion, yet
lively, bright-eyed, and intensely interested in his work. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We made, then, an initial experiment at Keith's
office in Beverly Hills in which I was joined by Edwin Halsey,
formerly private secretary to Ananda Coomaraswamy, and then
teaching comparative religions at Claremont. We each took one
hundred micrograms of d-lysergic acid diethylamide-25, courtesy
of the Sandoz Company, and set out on an eight-hour exploration.
For me the journey was hilariously beautiful&#151;as if I and all
my perceptions had been transformed into a marvelous arabesque or
multidimensional maze in which everything became transparent,
translucent, and reverberant with double and triple meanings.
Every detail of perception became vivid and important, even ums
and ers and throat-clearing when someone read poetry, and time
slowed down in such a way that people going about their business
outside seemed demented in failing to see that the destination of
life is this eternal moment. We walked across the street to a
white, Spanish-style church, surrounded with olive trees and
gleaming in the sun against a sky of absolute, primordial blue,
and saw the grass and the plants as inexplicably geometrized in
every detail so as to suggest that nothing in nature was
disordered. We went back and looked at a volume of Chinese and
Japanese <i>sumi</i>, or black-ink paintings, all of which seemed
to be perfectly accurate photographs. There were even highlights
and shadows on Mu-ch'i's persimmons that were certainly not
intended by the artist. At one time Edwin felt somewhat
overwhelmed and remarked, &quot;I just can't wait until I'm
little old me again, sitting in a bar.&quot; In the meantime he
was looking like an incarnation of Apollo in a supernatural
necktie, contemplatively holding an orange lily. (1) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All in all my first experience was aesthetic rather
than mystical, and then and there&#151;which is, alas, rather
characteristic of me&#151;I made a tape for broadcast saying that
I had looked into this phenomenon and found it most interesting,
but hardly what I would call mystical. This tape was heard by two
psychiatrists at the Langley-Porter Clinic in San Francisco,
Sterling Bunnell and Michael Agron, who thought I should
reconsider my views. After all, I had made only one experiment
and there was something of an art to getting it really working.
It was thus that Bunnell set me off on a series of experiments
which I have recorded in <i>The Joyous Cosmology</i>, and in the
course of which I was reluctantly compelled to admit that&#151;at
least in my own case&#151;LSD had brought me into an undeniably
mystical state of consciousness. But oddly, considering my
absorption in Zen at the time, the flavor of these experiences
was Hindu rather than Chinese. Somehow the atmosphere of Hindu
mythology and imagery slid into them, suggesting at the same time
that Hindu philosophy was a local form of a sort of undercover
wisdom, inconceivably ancient, which everyone knows in the back
of his mind but will not admit. This wisdom was simultaneously
holy and disreputable, and therefore necessarily esoteric, and it
came in the dress of a totally logical, obvious, and basic common
sense. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In sum I would say that LSD, and such other
psychedelic substances as mescaline, psilocybin, and hashish,
confer polar vision; by which I mean that the basic pairs of
opposites, the positive and the negative, are seen as the
different poles of a single magnet or circuit. This knowledge is
repressed in any culture that accentuates the positive, and is
thus a strict taboo. It carries Gestalt psychology, which insists
on the mutual interdependence of figure and background, to its
logical conclusion in every aspect of life and thought; so that
the voluntary and the involuntary, knowing and the known, birth
and decay, good and evil, outline and inline, self and other,
solid and space, motion and rest, light and darkness, are seen as
aspects of a single and completely perfect process. The
implication of this may be that there is nothing in life to be
gained or attained that is not already here and now, an
implication thoroughly disturbing to any philosophy or culture
which is seriously playing the game which I have called White <i>Must</i>
Win. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Polar vision is thus undoubtedly dangerous&#151;but
so is electricity, so are knives, and so is language. When an
immature person experiences the identity of the voluntary and the
involuntary, he may feel, on the one hand, utterly powerless, or
on the other, equal to the Hebrew-Christian God. If the former,
he may panic from the sense that no one is in charge of things.
If the latter, he may contract offensive megalomania.
Nevertheless, he has had immediate experience of the fact that
each one of us is an organism-environment field, of which the two
aspects, individual and world, can be separated only for purposes
of discussion. If such a person sees thus clearly the mutuality
of good and evil, he may jump to the conclusion that ethical
principles are so relative as to be without validity&#151;which
might be utterly demoralizing for any repressed adolescent.
Fortunately for me, my God was not so much the Hebrew-Christian
autocrat as the Chinese Tao, &quot;which loves and nourishes all
things, but does not lord it over them.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I hesitated a long time before writing <i>The
Joyous Cosmology</i>, considering the dangers of letting the
general public be further aware of this potent alchemy. But since
Aldous had already let the cat out of the bag in <i>Doors of
Perception</i> and <i>Heaven and Hell</i>, and the subject was
already under discussion both in psychiatric journals and in the
public press, I decided that more needed to be said, mainly to
soothe public alarm and to do what I could to forestall the
disasters that would follow from legal repression. For I was
seriously alarmed at the psychedelic equivalents of bathtub gin,
and of the prospect of these chemicals, uncontrolled in dosage
and content, being bootlegged for use in inappropriate settings
without any competent supervision whatsoever. I maintained that,
for lack of any better solution, they should be restricted for
psychiatric prescription. But the state and federal governments
were as stupid as I had feared, and by passing unenforceable laws
against LSD not only drove it underground but prevented proper
research. Such laws are unenforceable because any competent
chemist can manufacture LSD, or a close equivalent, and the
substance can be disguised as anything from aspirin to
blotting-paper. It has been painted on the thin pages of a small
Bible, and eaten sheet by sheet. But as a result of this terror,
the injudicious use of LSD (often mixed with strychnine or
belladonna or quite dangerous psychedelics) has afflicted
uncounted young people with paranoid, megalomanic, and schizoid
symptoms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I see this disaster in the larger context of
American prohibitionism, which has done more than anything else
to corrupt the police and foster disrespect for law, and which
our economic pressure has, in the special problem of drug abuse,
spread to the rest of the world. Although my views on this matter
may be considered extreme, I feel that in any society where the
powers of Church and State are separate, the State is without
either right or wisdom in enforcing sumptuary laws against crimes
which have no complaining victims. When the police are asked to
be armed clergymen enforcing ecclesiastical codes of morality,
all the proscribed sins of the flesh, of lust and luxury,
become&#151;since we are legislating against human
nature&#151;exceedingly profitable ventures for criminal
organizations which can pay both the police and the politicians
to stay out of trouble. Those who cannot pay constitute about
one-third of the population of our overcrowded and hopelessly
mismanaged prisons, and the business of their trial by due
process delays and over taxes the courts beyond all reason. These
are nomogenic crimes, caused by bad laws, just as iatrogenic
diseases are caused by bad doctoring. The offenders seldom feel
guilty but often positively righteous in their opposition to this
legal hypocrisy, and so emerge from prison loathing and despising
the social order more than ever. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I speak with passion on this problem because I have
often served as a consultant to the staffs of state institutions
for mental and moral deviants, such as the institutional hells
which the State of California maintains at San Quentin,
Vacaville, Atascadero, and Napa&#151;to mention only those I have
visited, and knowing that they are considerably worse in other
parts of the country, and most especially in those states
afflicted with religious fanaticism. Relative to our own times,
the prosecution of sumptuary laws is as tyrannical as any of the
excesses of the Holy Inquisition or the Star Chamber. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My retrospective attitude to LSD is that when one
has received the message, one hangs up the phone. I think I have
learned from it as much as I can, and, for my own sake, would not
be sorry if I could never use it again. But it is not, I believe,
generally known that very many of those who had constructive
experiences with LSD, or other psychedelics, have turned from
drugs to spiritual disciplines&#151;abandoning their water-wings
and learning to swim. Without the catalytic experience of the
drug they might never have come to this point, and thus my
feeling about psychedelic chemicals, as about most other drugs
(despite the vague sense of the word), is that they should serve
as medicine rather than diet. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was again through Aldous that I first heard of a
Dr. Leary of Harvard University who was doing experimental work
with the drug psilocybin, derived from a mushroom that had long
been used for religious purposes by some of the Indians of
Mexico. From the detached and scholarly flavor of Aldous's
account of this work I was expecting Timothy Leary to be a
formidable pandit, but the man I first met in a New York
restaurant was an extremely charming Irishman who wore a
hearing-aid as stylishly as if it had been a monocle. Nothing
could then have told me that anyone so friendly and intelligent
would become one of the most outlawed people in the world, a
fugitive from justice charged with the sin of Socrates, and all
upon the legal pretext of possessing trivial amounts of
marijuana. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It so happened that Timothy was working under a
department of the University that had long been of interest to
me, the Department of Social Relations, which had been
established by Henry Murray. On several occasions I had visited
Murray's domain, at 7 Divinity Avenue, and been entertained at
luncheons where, as host, he showed a special genius for arousing
intelligent conversation and for making other people appear at
their best. In his company there would turn up&#151;it might
be&#151; I. A. Richards, Mircea Eliade, Clyde Kluckhon, or Jerome
Bruner for such civilized intellectual discourse as is all too
rarely heard in academic circles, where it now seems a point of
honor to keep off one's subject and discuss the trivia of
departmental politics. But these gentlemen were ashamed neither
of their scholarship nor their personalities, and on one
occasion&#151;over an old-fashioned before lunch&#151;I
distinctly heard Richards remarking, &quot;Well, as a matter of
course, I always regard myself as the perfect human being.&quot;
I was so delighted with Murray's milieu that, with the assistance
of a wealthy friend, I managed to get myself a two-year
fellowship for travel and study under his and the University's
dispensation&#151;a breather which gave me time to compile <i>The
Two Hands of God</i> and to write <i>Beyond Theology</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The time I could actually spend at Harvard was all
too brief, for this is a university so assured of its
intellectual reputation that its faculty can afford to be
adventurous. But&#151;even at Harvard&#151;you must draw the line
somewhere, and Timothy did not know just where that was. Whenever
I was in Cambridge I kept closely in touch with him and with his
associates Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner, for&#151;quite aside
from the particular fascinations of chemical mysticism&#151;these
were the most lively and imaginative people in the department
other than Murray himself, who watched their doings with deep and
constructively critical interest even after his official
retirement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was also interested in the work of B. F. Skinner,
wondering how so absolute a determinist could write a utopia, <i>Walden
Two</i>, and digging into his beautifully reasoned writings until
I discovered the flaw in his system. This I explained in a
lecture which Skinner, though I had forewarned him in person, did
not attend.(2) I saw that his reasoning was still haunted by the
ghost of man as a something&#151;presumably a conscious
ego&#151;determined by environmental and other forces, for it
makes no sense to speak of a determinism unless there is some
passive object which is determined. But his own reasoning made it
clear, not so much that human behavior was determined by other
forces, but rather that it could not be described apart from
those forces and was, indeed, inseparable from them. It did not
seem to have occurred to him that &quot;cause&quot; and
&quot;effect&quot; are simply two phases of, or two ways of
looking at, one and the same event. It is not, then, that effects
(in this case human behaviors) are determined by their causes.
The point is that when events are fully and properly described
they will be found to involve and contain processes which were at
first thought separate from them, and were thus called causes as
distinct from effects. Taken to his logical conclusion, Skinner
is not saying that man is determined by nature, as something
external to him: he is actually saying that man is nature, and is
describing a process which is neither determined nor determining.
He simply provides reason for the essentially mystical view that
man and universe are inseparable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such problems were involved in my attempts to work
out an intellectual structure for what Timothy and his friends
were experiencing in their psychedelic states of consciousness.
For I saw that their enthusiasm for these states was leading them
further and further away from the ideals of rational objectivity
to which the department and the University were committed;
especially as the department had recently acquired a computer and
was going overboard for the statistical approach to psychology.
On the one hand, I was trying to persuade Timothy's clan to keep
command of intellectual rigor, and to express their experiences
in terms that people bending over backward to be scientific would
understand. On the other hand, I was trying to get such
conservatives as David McClelland, Murray's successor, and
Skinner to see that the so-called &quot;transactional&quot;
description of man as an organism-environment field was a
theoretical description of what the nature-mystic experiences
immediately, whereas most scientists continue to experience
themselves as separate and detached observers, determined or
otherwise. Their feelings lag far behind their theoretical views,
for psychologists, in particular, are still under the emotional
sway of Newtonian mechanics, and their personal feelings of
identity have not yet been modified by quantum mechanics and
field theory. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Timothy could not contain himself, and it
seemed to him more and more that, in practice, the procedures of
scientific objectivity and rigor were simply an academic ritual
designed to convince the university establishment that your work
was dull and trivial enough to be considered &quot;sound.&quot;
It so happens that psychedelic chemicals make one curiously
sensitive to pomposity. Anyone talking memorandumese, or
religious or political rhetoric, or anyone waxing enthusiastic
about a product in which he does not believe, sounds so
ridiculous that you cannot keep a straight face: one excellent
reason why no government can tolerate a &quot;turned-on&quot;
populace. Both Timothy and Richard Alpert began to see,
furthermore, that a distinguished academic career was not all
that important, since the university was already an obsolete
institution representing the nineteenth-century mythology of
scientific naturalism. But when one arrives at this point of view
after, if not because of, &quot;taking drugs,&quot; it becomes
impossible to maintain rational discourse with the establishment,
even though some of its more distinguished brains are pickled in
alcohol. Thus things came to the point where Timothy and Richard
were as suspect as if they had been lobotomized or become
Jehovah's Witnesses. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was present at the dinner party where Timothy
finally agreed with David McClelland to withdraw experimentation
with drugs from his work under the department. David was making
the point that they had become too enthusiastic about their work
to preserve scientific integrity, and with this I was in partial
agreement, because to be intellectually honest you must be able
to come to terms with any intelligible criticism of your ideas.
When I have received inspirations during an LSD session, I have
always reviewed them subsequently in the light of cold sobriety,
in which some, but by no means all, of them appear to be
nonsense. But David was going so far as to insist that no one
with a religious commitment could really do scientific work in
psychology, and this so amazed me that I protested, &quot;Now,
David, are you seriously saying that, for example, a very sober,
honest, and devoted Quaker, well educated and straight from
Philadelphia, could not be entrusted with scientific work?&quot;
I do not remember his reaction, but I was unaware at the time
that he himself was a concerned Quaker. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What followed is now a matter of history. Timothy
and Richard continued their experiments unofficially, and
scandalized the University authorities by including
undergraduates in their work. Henry Murray, however, with a wise
look on his face, reminisced about the days when psychoanalysis
first struck Harvard, and what an uproar of indignation had come
to pass when a psychoanalyzed faculty member had committed
suicide. Nevertheless, I myself began to be concerned, if mildly,
at the direction of Timothy's enthusiasm, for to his own circle
of friends and students he had become a charismatic religious
leader who, well trained as he was in psychology, knew very
little about religion and mysticism and their pitfalls. The
uninstructed adventurer with psychedelics, as with Zen or yoga or
any other mystical discipline, is an easy victim of what Jung
calls &quot;inflation,&quot; of the messianic megalomania that
comes from misunderstanding the experience of union with God. It
leads to the initial mistake of casting pearls before swine, and,
as time went on, I was dismayed to see Timothy converting himself
into a popular store-front messiah with his name in lights,
advocating psychedelic experience as a new world-religion. He was
moving to a head-on collision with the established religions of
biblical theocracy and scientific mechanism, and simply asking
for martyrdom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life with Timothy, as I saw it in his communes at
Newton Center and Millbrook, was never dull, even though it was
hard to understand how people who had witnessed the splendors of
psychedelic vision could be so aesthetically blind as to live in
relative squalor, with perpetually unmade beds, unswept floors,
and hideously decrepit furnishings. It could be, I suppose, that
being turned-on all the time is like looking through a
teleidoscope: it makes far more interesting patterns out of
messes (such as dirty ashtrays) than out of such orderly scenes
as neatly arranged books in shelves. But Timothy was the center
of a vortex which pulled in the intellectually and spiritually
adventurous from all quarters, and in his entourage student
hippies jostled with millionaires and eminent professors, while
to spend an evening with him in New York City or Los Angeles was
to be swept from one exotically sumptuous apartment to another. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through all this, Timothy himself remained an
essentially humorous, kindly, lovable, and (in some directions)
intellectually brilliant person, and therefore it was utterly
incongruous&#151; however predictable&#151;to become aware of the
grim watchfulness of police in the background. Now nothing so
easily deranges people using psychedelics as a paranoid
atmosphere, so that by their intervention the police created the
very evils from which they were supposed to be protecting us. In
the early days when LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline were used more
or less legitimately among reasonably mature people, there was
little trouble with &quot;bum trips,&quot; and episodes of
anxiety were usually turned into occasions for insight. But when
federal and state authorities began their systematic persecution,
the fears invoked to justify it became self-fulfilling
prophecies, and there was now real reason for a paranoid
atmosphere in all experiments conducted outside the sterile and
clinical surroundings of psychiatric hospitals. Although Timothy
won a case in the Supreme Court which technically quashed the
federal law against possessing and using (but not against
importing) marijuana, the state laws remained in force, and he
was harassed wherever he went, until finally imprisoned without
bail with so many technical charges against him that there was
nothing for it but to escape and seek such asylum in exile as he
could find. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard Alpert, who in all this had played a much
quieter role, also went into exile, but in another way. While
visiting India he realized that he had come to the end of the
identity as a psychologist which he had thus far played, so much
so that he could not envisage any normal role or career for
himself in the United States. Furthermore, he felt as I did that
he had learned all that he could get from psychedelics, and that
what remained was actually to live out the life of freedom from
worldly games and anxieties. He therefore took the name of Baba
Ram Dass, and came back as a white-robed and bearded <i>sannyasin</i>,
full of laughter and energy, dedicated simply to living in the
eternal now. And, as might be expected, people raised their
eyebrows and shook their heads, saying that the old showman was
playing another game, or, alas, what drugs had done to such a
promising young scientist, or that it was just great to be a <i>sannyasin</i>
with an independent income. But I felt that he had done just the
right thing for himself. I spent many hours with him and sensed
that he was genuinely happy, that his intelligence was as sharp
as ever, and that he was confident enough in what he was doing
not to try to persuade me to follow his example. Certainly he was
having great pleasure in the multitudes of young people who came
to listen to him, but in this respect he and I are alike, for we
enjoy thinking out loud with an appreciative and intelligent
audience just as we enjoy landscape or music. But would he be
going about in a white robe if he were really sincere? Indeed
yes. For in a country where a philosopher's sincerity is measured
by the ordinariness of his dress, I too will sometimes wear a
kimono or sarong in public, lest, like Billy Graham, I should
attract an enormous following of dangerously serious and
humorless people. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, in retrospect, it must be said that the
Psychedelic Decade of the sixties has really begun to awaken
psychotherapists from their studiedly pedestrian and reductionist
attitudes to life. Here I am using the word
&quot;psychedelic&quot; to mean all &quot;mind-manifesting&quot;
processes: not only chemicals, but also philosophies,
neurological experiments, and spiritual disciplines. At the
beginning of the decade one felt that so many psychiatrists saw
themselves as guardians of an official reality which might be
described as the world seen on a bleak Monday morning. They saw a
good orientation to reality as coping&#151;as having a normal
heterosexual (and preferably monogamous) sex life, a &quot;mature
adult relationship&quot; as it was called; as being able to drive
a car and hold down a nine-to-five job; as being able to recall
the product of g and 7 without hesitation; and as being able to
participate in group activities and show qualities of initiative
and leadership. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was, as I remember, in 1959 that I was asked to
speak before a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in
Los Angeles. Learned statistical papers had dragged on and on,
overtime, and my turn came when we were already late for lunch. I
abandoned my prepared remarks (being what the press calls a
textual deviate) and said: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Gentlemen, this is not going to be a
scientific paper because I am a simple philosopher, not a
psychiatrist, and you are hungry for lunch. We philosophers are
very grateful to you for showing us the unconscious emotional
bases of some of our ideas, but the time is coming for us to show
you the unconscious intellectual assumptions behind some of
yours. Psychiatric literature is full of unexamined metaphysics.
Even Jung, who is so readily repudiated for his 'mysticism,'
bends over backward to avoid metaphysical considerations on the
pretext that he is strictly a physician and a scientist. This is
impossible. Every human being is a metaphysician just as every
philosopher has appetites and emotions&#151;and by this I mean
that we all have certain basic assumptions about the good life
and the nature of reality. Even the typical businessman who
asserts that he is a practical fellow unconcerned with higher
things declares thereby that he is a pragmatist or a positivist,
and not a very thoughtful one at that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I wonder, then, how much consideration you
give to the fact that most of your own assumptions about the good
life and reality come directly from the scientific naturalism of
the nineteenth century, from the strictly metaphysical hypothesis
that the universe is a mechanism obeying Newtonian laws, and that
there is no other god beside it. Psychoanalysis, which is
actually psychohydraulics following Newton's mechanics, begins
from the mystical assertion that the psychosexual energy of the
unconscious is a blind and stupid outrush of pure lust, following
Haeckel's notion that the universe at large is a manifestation of
primordially oafish and undiscriminating energy. It should be
obvious to you that this is an opinion for which there has never
been the least evidence, and which, furthermore, ignores the
evidence that we ourselves, supposedly making intelligent
remarks, are manifestations of that same energy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;On the basis of this unexamined, derogatory,
and shaky opinion as to the nature of biological and physical
energy, some of your psychoanalytic members have this morning
dubbed all the so-called mystical states of consciousness as
'regressive,' as leading one back to a dissolution of the
individual intelligence in an acid bath of amniotic fluid,
reducing it to featureless identity with this&#151;your First
Cause&#151;mess of blindly libidinous energy. Now, until you have
found some substantial evidence for your metaphysics you will
have to admit that you have no way of knowing which end of your
universe is up, so that in the meantime you should abstain from
easy conclusions as to which directions are progressive and which
regressive. <i>[Laughter]&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It had always seemed to me that, by and large,
psychotherapists lacked the metaphysical dimension; in other
words, that they affected the mentality of insurance clerks and
lived in a world scrubbed and disinfected of all mystery, magic,
color, music, and awe, with no place in the heart for the sound
of a distant gong in a high and hidden valley. This is an
exaggeration from which I will except most of the Jungians and
such occasional freaks as Groddeck, Prinzhorn, G. R. Heyer,
Wilhelm Reich, and others less well known. Thus, writing of
American psychology in 1954, Abraham Maslow remarked that it was </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>overpragmatic, over-Puritan, and overpurposeful.... No
    textbooks have chapters on fun and gaiety, on leisure and
    meditation, on loafing and puttering, on aimless, useless,
    and purposeless activity.... American psychology is busily
    occupying itself with only half of life to the neglect of the
    other&#151;and perhaps most important&#151;half.(3) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The publication of my <i>Psychotherapy East and
West</i> and <i>Joyous Cosmology</i> early in the sixties brought
me into public and private discussion with many leading members
of the psychiatric profession, and I was astonished at what
seemed to be their actual terror of unusual states of
consciousness. I had thought that psychiatrists should have been
as familiar with these wildernesses and unexplored territories of
the mind as Indian guides, but as I perused something like the
two huge volumes of <i>The American Handbook of Psychiatry</i>, I
found only maps of the soul as primitive as ancient maps of the
world. There were vaguely outlined emptinesses called
Schizophrenia, Hysteria, and Catatonia, accompanied with little
more solid information than &quot;Here be dragons and
cameleopards.&quot; At a party in New York I fell into
conversation with one of that city's most eminent analysts, and
as soon as he learned that I had experimented with LSD his
personality became surgically professional. He donned his mask
and rubber gloves and addressed me as a specimen, wanting to know
all the surface details of perceptual and kinesthetic
alterations, which I could see him fitting into place zip, pop,
and clunk with his keenly calipered mind. I took part in a
televised debate on &quot;Open End,&quot; with David Susskind
trying to moderate between the two factions of psychedelic
enthusiasts and establishment psychiatrists, and in the ensuing
uproar and confusion of passions I found myself flung into the
position of moderator, telling both sides that they had no basis
in evidence for their respective fanaticisms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In all these contacts I began to feel that the only
psychiatrists who had any solid information were such
neurologists as David Rioch, of Walter Reed, and Karl Pribram, of
Stanford. They could tell me things I didn't know and were the
first to admit how little they knew, for they were realizing the
odd fact that their brains were more intelligent than their minds
or, to say the least, that the human nervous system was of such a
high order of complexity that we were only just beginning to
organize it in terms of conscious thought. I sat in on an
intimate seminar with Pribram in which he explained in most
careful detail how the brain is no mere reflector of the external
world, but how its structure almost creates the forms and
patterns that we see, selecting them from an immeasurable
spectrum of vibrations as the hands of a harpist pluck chords and
melodies from a spectrum of strings. For Karl Pribram is working
on the most delicate epistemological puzzle: how the brain evokes
a world which is simultaneously the world which it is in, and to
wonder, therefore, whether the brain evokes the brain.(4) Put it
in metaphysical terms, psychological terms, physical terms, or
neurological terms: it is always the same. How can we know what
we know without knowing knowing? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This question must be answered, if it can ever be
answered, before it can make any sense at all to say that reality
is material, mental, electrical, spiritual, a fact, a dream, or
anything else. But always, in contemplating this conundrum, a
peculiar feeling comes over me, as if I couldn't remember my own
name which is right on the tip of my tongue. It really does make
one wonder if, after all . . . if . . . <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyhow, at the end of these ten years I have the
impression that the psychiatric world has opened up to the
possibility that there are more things in heaven and earth than
were dreamed of in its philosophy. Orthodox psychoanalysis has
appeared more and more to be a religious cult and institutional
psychiatry a system of brainwashing. The field is giving way to
movements and techniques increasingly free from the tacit
metaphysics of nineteenth-century mechanism: Humanistic
Psychology, Transpersonal Psychology, Gestalt Therapy,
Transactional Psychology, Encounter Therapy, Psychosynthesis
(Assagioli), Bioenergetics (Reich), and a dozen more interesting
approaches with awkward names. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Historians and social commentators will try to
discover from any autobiographer how much he has influenced the
movements of his time and how much they have influenced him. I
can say only that as I get older I get back into that strange
childlike feeling of not being able to draw any certain line
between the world and my own action upon it, and I wonder if this
is also felt by people who have never been in the public eye or
had any claim to influence. A very ordinary person might have the
impression that there are millions of himself, and that all of
them, as one, are doing just what it is in humanity&#151;that is,
in himself &#151;to do. In this way he could perhaps feel more
important than someone who has taken a particular view and
followed a lonely path. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Part of the problem is that the closer I get to
present time, the harder it is to see things in perspective. The
events of twenty, thirty, and forty years ago are clearer in my
mind, and seem almost closer in time than what has happened quite
recently&#151; in years that seem fantastically and excitingly
crowded with people and happenings. I feel that I must wait
another ten years to find out just what I was doing, in the field
of psychotherapy, with Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, Fritz
Perls and Ronald Laing, Margaret Rioch and Anthony Sutich,
Bernard Aaronson and Stanley Krippner, Michael Murphy and John
Lilly; in theology with Bishops James Pike and John A. T.
Robinson, Dom Aelred Graham and Huston Smith; and in the
formation of the mystical counterculture with Lama Anagarika
Govinda and Shunryu Suzuki, Allen Ginsberg and Theodore Roszak,
Bernard Gunther and Gia-fu Feng, Ralph Metzner and Claudio
Naranjo, Norman 0. Brown and Nancy Wilson Ross, Lama Chogyam
Trungpa and Ch'ung-liang Huang, Douglas Harding and G. Spencer
Brown, Richard Weaver and Robert Shapiro&#151; to mention only a
few of the names and faces gathering out of the recent past to
tell me that I have hardly begun this story.</p>

As promised, no attempt has been made to examine <I>all</I> of
the causes of the restructuring of consciousness which is taking
place. Neither has any attempt been made to examine <I>all</I>
the ways in which it manifests itself. Such an effort would have
to range far beyond the rock phenomenon, the use of psychedelics,
the effects of urbanization and mass media and those other few
manifestations which have been touched upon here. The effort has
been rather to approach a few of these phenomena and reach for
the keys to their essential nature; to show, basically, how the
doors of perception are being unlocked. We have not yet faced
the central question: How can the new consciousness begin its
real work of taking power out of the hands of those who are in
the process of wrecking our world? There is a very specific deadline
involved: the point, likely sometime in the next ten or twenty
years, where the statistical probability of extinction will have
become a certainty.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To speak of a self-structuring hierarchical jump is to speak of
a revolution, a fundamental change in the way our affairs are
conducted. Without such a change, the overwhelming likelihood
is that we will kill ourselves off. No one suggests that men be
put in charge of nuclear reactors who are only capable of &quot;muddling
through.&quot; Yet exactly such a suggestion is made when it comes
to putting people in charge of the dynamic institutions which
deter
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
mine the course of society. The question is not whether a revolution
is needed. The question is: How can it succeed? Where are the
lines of least resistance? What are the weapons at the disposal
of the new consciousness? Are these weapons being picked up? Is
some sort of an apocalyptic bloodbath&#151;the &quot;shit storm&quot;
foreseen by Norman Mailer&#151;inevitable?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the past, in virtually every case, it was. Is there any good
reason for believing that conditions have changed in some mysterious
way? That a true revolution can now be effected without the streets
being littered with bodies?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
First, in order to get some sort of a perspective, let us consider
the odds <I>against</I> a successful revolution. So long as we
stick to the traditional definition of a revolution, the odds
seem formidable, more formidable perhaps than they have ever been
in the past. An impression of the sheer power of the existing
power structure, particularly in America, might best be conveyed
through the lens of personal experience:

It was as though the great buildings around us were hi-fi speakers
in the land of the giants with the volume on full. The vibrations
beat against the 162-ton Picasso sculpture, reverberating along
the Cor-ten weatherproofed steel walls of the 31-storey Chicago
Civic Plaza, a sound that had several dimensions: anger, frenzy,
fun, frustration, fear, surprise. It was therapeutic, as raw as
the first roar of a timid man who has discovered the heroic within
his grasp. It was defiant and exultant because the sound was composed
of ten thousand voices and each voice suggested the liberation
of a ninety-pound weakling who has completed his Charles Atlas
course and is now moving with a growl down onto the bully-inhabited
beach. And then it was also pure rooting-for-the-home-team stuff,
complete with cheerleaders:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>What do we want?</I> <BR>
PEACE!<BR>
<I>When do we want it?</I><BR>
NOW!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And, finally, it was frightening. &quot;PEACE, <I>NOW!</I>  PEACE,
<I>NOW!&quot;</I>  The sound was blurred, like the noises of waves,
and it was easy to close your eyes, let go of the mood for a moment,
and hear them chanting, &quot;SIEG <I>HEIL!</I>  SIEG <I>HEIL!&quot; </I>
There was that hypnotic rhythm to it, a pace close to that of
goose-stepping hordes. This was October 15, 1969, the First Moratorium
Day. The word was already out that the United States this day
had lurched like an elephant slammed by a hand grenade under the
impact of the biggest anti-war demonstration in history. And it
was only a month since the Woodstock music festival had gone off
like a land mine.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Now the speeches were done with, the Chicago six&#151;looking pale
and if not self-conscious, at least a bit uncertain&#151;have been
duly honored, every angle has been played except the last: time
for a moment's silence for the dead in Vietnam. Heads were bowed.
Even the traffic was stilled, the crowd having become so large
the streets around the Civic Plaza were sealed off. The swelling
silence engulfed the murmuring, and soon we were as quiet as ants,
a colony of ants amid a warehouse display of fridge-like buildings
and stacks of rusting canned goods; there was even an altar before
us-the First Methodist Church, the world's tallest place of worship.
The silence soon matched the height of the building. After a few
seconds, hands started fluttering up, making the V-sign of peace,
a gesture by now as religious as the Catholic sign of the cross.
Soon almost all the hands were raised in the V-sign, except for
those hands which were black, and all those black hands, thousands,
were making the clenched-fist Black Power salute. I saw no black
fingers making the peace sign. Something had happened....
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The demonstration was over. But the crowd was not quite prepared
to dissolve. And now came the cry: OINK! OINK! It was the warning
and battle-cry. It meant the riot cops were moving. Over the heads
around me, bobbing like bubbles in a stirred-up bathtub, I could
see a blue tide coming&#151;a line of robin's egg riot helmets. The
warning, almost a wave-action, had passed through me a second
before, an impulse transmitted from nerve to nerve, body to body,
thus flashing from one end of the plaza to the other, communicating
to nearly ten thousand of us in seconds what would have taken
several minutes to pass on by word of mouth&#151;a flicker of tension,
excitement and fear. Briefly, my senseof isolation, of self, of
individuality, <I>cracked.</I> I was a small unit in a larger
creature, one spark in the total field laid down by a brain composed
of ten thousand such sparks. And the brain is stupid, composed
of too few parts-it has not much more going for it than an insect.
(No metaphor is intended here&#151;a crowd is a gestalt, and its
currents work like magnetism on the ciphers of our &quot;identities,&quot;
creating whirlpools and floodstreams where none existed before.)
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
OINK! OINK! screamed thousands of voices.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The effect of the cry was to cauterize some of the automatic fear
which had been in the message of a few seconds before. Shout cops
and the impulse, maybe nothing more than the Pavlovian reaction
of children caught stealing apples, is nevertheless to run. Shout
OINK! OINK! and the impulse is to press forward to the edge of
the trough. Good mob psychology to change the object of terror
into an object of contempt.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The movement of the crowd was like water toward a cliff. The robin's
egg helmets might as well have been magnets attracting chips&#151;but
of course the police knew this, knew by now after years of riots
and demonstrations all about the psychology of mobs. It is a psychology
not so different from that of rats or very retarded children.
Knowing it, the police had purpose in their movement. They were
good cowboys. The round-up began. They were pulling us into a
new position, the better to control us.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The round-up was underway. I tried to hang back close to the Picasso
sculpture, rising like a giant steel bat over the plaza. Tried
to hang back. It didn't work. The surge of the crowd was too strong,
and too much of its deep herd impulse had gotten into my head-like
a primordial gorilla hand groping for the controls. I did not
fight as hard as I might to avoid being carried forward and, first
thing I knew, I was right up against the police line.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Easy to imagine that these cops gave off no odor. They were, in
fact, as odorless as astronauts or the hostesses at Disneyland
and the Playboy Club. The cop in front of me, looking by chance
into my eyes no more curiously than you would look into the eyes
of a passing dog, seemed like a steel robot, a big one, wearing
a rubber mask over a transistorized brain. His truncheon was at
least two and a half feet long. When the walkie-talkie order hit
that transistor of his, he would bash my face in as automatically
as an electronic door opening to let customers into a supermarket.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Now I could see the purpose to the movement of the police. They
had taken up positions at one end of the glass-walled civic plaza,
and the reaction of the crowd was not, after all, so unanimous.
Only a fragment&#151;the most hopped-up elements&#151;had been drawn
out, or, more precisely, <I>extracted.</I> So this was a dental
operation. The police knew now where the trouble would come from.
By their carefully-drilled movements, they had isolated the militants
from their buffer of tax-paying citizens. These Chicago police
were a good modern army. Beyond doubt their choreographer was
sitting up in one of the skyscrapers, directing the performance
like a man cutting a cake with sure strokes of his blue-edged
knife.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And the crowd&#151;the crowd was still a dull-witted gestalt. Part
puppy-dog, part wolf. But in the end, manageable, more manageable
than a baby. The police, having drawn the most dangerous part
of it into position, (having snagged the fangs) now kept it on
the line like a fisherman jerking his line to make sure the hook
is in place. This was done simply by moving the police line a
few dozen yards to the right, a few dozen to the left. The crowd
followed. Meanwhile, as anticipated in somebody's calculations,
the majority of the original ten thousand demonstrators had dissolved
back into the rush-hour traffic, and soon there were fewer than
one thousand left chanting and singing in front of the police
line. After a while, they decided to head over to the federal
building, where a few hundred others, many of them young blacks,
and Black Panthers, had gathered to make speeches and throw insults
(nothing more) up at the courtroom where the charade of the trial
of the Chicago six was in progress. The police line followed the
demonstrators. From the federal building, the movement was back
toward of the plaza, then over to Lincoln Park. All along the
way, police marched silently, shoulder-to-shoulder with the demonstrators.
At last we arrived at the park. It was late afternoon, and the
potent force of ten thousand had been whittled by the blue knife
down to less than a hundred. The skill in that whittling was at
least equal to the talent employed in the carving of totem poles.
The police had a very effective machine going for them.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Yet there, in Chicago, I was watching the functioning of a police
machine which was still only a primitive tool compared to the
computerized techno-structured operations now coming into existence.
The difference between this Chicago police machine and those modern
ones beginning to take shape everywhere is a matter of centuries
compressed into decades. Compare a knife to a laser beam. You
can at least see the knife coming. Against the laser beam you
have no chance at all.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Police machines, even the machines of Hitler and Stalin, were
clumsy, forced to resort to terrorism and brute force. It has
been shown that slave labor is poorly adapted to industrialization
and adapted to post-industrialization not at all. The new machineries
of police control are as far removed, in their most highly-developed
forms, from Nazi Germany as helicopters from Icarus. The efficiency
of the Chicago police on the occasion of the First Vietnam Moratorium
revealed more about their state of development than did the police
riot during the 1968 Democratic Convention. There, while the whole
world was watching, the police broke their ranks and the machine
sputtered to a halt. Under those circumstances, had the Chicago
police been faced by well-armed, welldrilled opponents, they would
have been cut to ribbons. As it was, they were chasing children,
attacking journalists and bystanders, and so they seemed to have
tremendous brute power. It was an illusion. In fact, at that particular
moment, the Chicago police were at their weakest. If the Democratic
Convention riots of 1968 had been the real measure of the effectiveness
of the Chicago police, then the Black Panthers could be certain
of victory. When the police become a mob, they are as helpless
against precision attack as that crowd on Moratorium Day was against
precision control. And yet the point here is that those chillingly-efficient
Moratorium Day police tactics were relatively unsophisticated.
The blue knife that worked so well was still not a laser beam.
In the very near future, control of mobs of ten thousand will
be child's play.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The mass media have communicated a false message to the younger
generation: Look at the Democratic Convention! Look at Watts!
Look at the cities that burned as funeral pyres in the wake of
Martin Luther King's assassination! Remember the night when a
tiny gadget near Niagara Falls broke down and all of New York
was plunged into darkness? See how easy it is to throw a monkey
wrench into the functionings of a modern industrial state? A bit
of LSD in the water supply, a few snipers moving along the rooftops,
a demonstration here, a reversal of a court decision concerning
marijuana there...so easy, so easy.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Yet one has only to walk through Watts, or along West Madison,
or through Harlem, to realize that probably fewer than a hundred
miles of streets out of all the millions of miles of paved roadway
in the United States actually were touched by flame the night
after King died. And nothing has changed in New York because of
the black-out, except that the hydro system is slightly more efficient
now. LSD breaks down in water. As for snipers&#151;they are killed,
and have about as much chance of beating the existing system as
a fly has of wresting power from the man with the fly-swatter.
An overturned pot law can be planted back even more firmly on
its feet a few weeks later. Guerrilla warfare? One might try reading
<I>Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung,</I> especially his ten
principles of operation. In the context of modern America, it
might well have been written by George Wallace. Point One: Attack
dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, strong
enemy forces <I>(universities?)</I> later. Point Two: Take small
and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big cities
later. Etc. It should be obvious to everyone that guerrillas can
only operate if the population supports them, and there is no
advanced industrial nation today where that basic condition exists.
A mass base is completely lacking for a <I>putsch</I> or revolution
in the old style of the French and Russian revolutions. And even
if it weren't, in order to beat the technological and organizational
opposition, the revolutionaries would have to forge a faster,
more powerful machine. To fight a revolution in an advanced industrial
nation today (on its own ground, in short) one would have to become
even better at the game than those who currently wield the blue
knife and the laser beam.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The argument against revolution in an advanced industrial nation,
in the old sense of a violent overthrow of the existing power
structure through the mechanism of an armed insurrection, proceeds
along three lines:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A. It's hopeless.<BR>
B. It accomplishes nothing, except a changing of the guard.<BR>
C. It diverts us from the real struggle, which is to attain a
higher level of consciousness, and to explore our potential (which
is still unknown).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Let us deal with these in turn:<P>&nbsp; 
<H4>A. It's hopeless. </H4>
<P>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The working class of late has not shown itself to be particularly
responsive to the rhetoric of the New Left. The evidence would
suggest that any insurrection at this stage in the affairs of
the American state is more likely to come from the right. Movements
such as Yippie!, the Black Panther Party, SDS, and so on have
proven to be shorter-lived and far less tolerated than the Minutemen
or the Ku Klux Klan. This is not simply because of the raw power
of the police machine.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
John Galbraith has pointed out that when capital was the key to
economic success, social conflict was between the rich and the
poor. But in recent times, education became the difference that
divides. &quot;Politics,&quot; he writes, &quot;reflect the new
division. In the United States suspicion or resentment is no longer
directed to the capitalists or the merely rich. It is the intellectuals
who are eyed with misgiving and alarm. This should surprise no
one. Nor should it be a matter for surprise when semi-literate
millionaires turn up leading or financing the ignorant in struggle
against the intellectually privileged and content. This reflects
the relevant class distinction of our time.&quot; It is a distinction
few intellectuals are willing to accept. Humanists and socialists
alike would prefer to steer away from any position which might
open them up to charges of elitism, yet everything points to a
sharp (and widening) cleavage not only between the generations
but between the new basic classes. Students can no longer appeal
to the workers with much hope of being listened to (or, for that
matter, of getting out of a union hall meeting without having
their heads beaten in).
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Add to that the fact that the very &quot;masses&quot; upon whom
all organized revolutionaries pin their long range hopes are the
people (in the highly industrialized states) who are the least
likely to rise up against anybody except the revolutionaries themselves.
Come the revolution, we will all be listening to Bob Hope. The
problem in part is that only a minority of the population in any
advanced industrialized nation is responsive to the new and accelerated
pace of change. A few, among them many of the young and many of
the intellectually privileged and content, are in tune with the
new culture; that is, change is not something that frightens them.
Mobility offers possibilities, not dread of being uprooted. The
&quot;broad masses,&quot; on the other hand, are still peeking
out at the world from around the corner of their memories of the
Depression and the Second World War.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Few will dispute that the guns and the tanks and the bombs and
the advertising agencies and the mass media are in the hands of
the established order. The target of any revolution cannot just
be the White House, the Pentagon, and Fort Knox. It must be, let's
say, &quot;the hearts and minds of the people,&quot; whether Vietnamese
or American. And these, at the moment, are largely under the control
of the establishment press, the advertisers, and the politicians.
So, already, the revolution must move against an enemy that commands
the heights and is dug in everywhere, who, furthermore, has overwhelming
firepower, with air and ground and naval support. And the odds
are not yet through being added up. The establishment also has
at its disposal a humming army of computers, an array of prototypal
technostructures whose function is not only to anticipate trouble,
pin-point likely danger spots, but, as a regular day-to-day operation,
keep a closer eye on every individual citizen than could be done
in any previous society. There is no one in America-or any advanced
industrial state, for that matter-whose identity is not magnetically
recorded on a tape somewhere. So, in addition to the overwhelming
firepower of the enemy, the revolutionary faces the dangers of
bugging, wiretapping, computerized surveillance, and so on.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So far, however, we have been ticking off the obvious. We have
not really got the <I>real</I> strength of the enemy, which is
that, unlike a banana republic, the modern industrial state is
not run by a strongman flanked by bullyboys, a division of armored
jeeps, and financed by a clutch of businessmen with vested interests
in keeping wages down. It may indeed stem from just such a basic
structure, but in the process of its evolution it has become too
complex, too bottomless, to be tackled as though it <I>remained</I>
nothing more than that. The power of the industrial state is greater
by several factors, and not just in terms of physical might.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Where we see progressiveness and openly liberal attitudes, we
see the technological reality refining its methods of manipulation,
organization, and, ultimately, control. It gets <I>better</I>
at it all the time, absorbing more, spreading out in ever-widening
circles, and turning every attack to its own advantage, simply
by accepting the attacker, swallowing him, and thus very nearly
literally feeding on opposition.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Historically, it has been hard enough to get broad masses of people
to bite the hand that <I>wouldn't</I> feed them; to hope, under
conditions of affluence, to get those same broad masses to bite
a hand that does feed them-and feeds them very well-is a thin
hope indeed. Add this stark reality to the problems already mentioned,
and one begins to see that it would have to be one hell of a super-revolution,
the one which could smash the technological society.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Even if the odds weren't so bad, consider the state the troops
are in. What happened to the crowd in the Chicago Civic Plaza
on Moratorium Day demonstrated clearly where the real organizational
muscle was. But there is more to it. Shortly before Moratorium
Day, I was in Berkeley, at the University of California campus.
Listen to one of the most radical students I talked to: &quot;It's
ready to blow, man. There's a revolution coming. It's overcrowded
here. Construction everywhere. Bad food. Lousy accommodation.
It's mean. Bad vibrations. Everybody's really uptight, only it's
low-level uptightedness. People are bugged, I mean, really bugged...
the food prices, the shortage of rooms, the noise... it's gonna
<I>go,</I> man. Wow.&quot; So there is a revolution about to erupt.
But follow the conversation further. It drifts. Soon, the student
is talking about the intensity of the mescaline experience as
compared to the hashish experience. A lot of quibbling gets going
with other students present about the virtues of hash. And from
there the conversation proceeds directly to the issue of the best
places to go skiing. One place is generally conceded to be much
better than the others, because &quot;dampness from the ground
soaks right up through your head and goes raining off in reverse
right into the sky from your head, all those pores in your scalp,
like they were sprinklers, man.&quot; This is, if you have been
smoking hash. Somehow, no contradiction is seen between the desire
to have a revolution and the desire to smoke hash and go skiing.
The revolutionary fever was heavily seasoned with hedonism, which
weakens it badly. And most conversations I got into on the campus
seemed spiced in much the same way. A friend reports meeting two
radicals at Berkeley, whose position is simple: Everything will
have to be smashed from stem to stern; America has become that
diseased. The conversation ends when they ask my friend if he
would like to blow a joint. Okay. They go down the street and
climb into a brand-new Thunderbird, property of the most talkative
radical and proceed to get stoned.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The story may be apocryphal, but not very.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Yet, through a process of nothing much more than elimination,
we have arrived at a position where the vanguard of a revolution
<I>must</I> be the &quot;alienated&quot; young. The working class
has become reactionary (labor and management may quibble over
the spoils, but none seeks to blow up the trough), the bourgeoisie
middle class are more dominant than ever, the poor are already
contained in ghettoes which are concentration camps lacking only
barbed wire. Let us look, therefore, at the picture these alienated
young presented as the 1960s drew to a close. Here is Barry Farrell's
description of the last two nights of the Woodstock festival:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As night fell the scene became more dramatic still, disclosing
a loud electric image of the future. From the fringes of the crowd,
the stage looked like a pearl at the bottom of a pond, a circle
of light fired down from towers as big as missile gantries. Just
beyond it, helicopters fluttered in and out of an LZ ringed with
Christmas lights, bringing in the rock groups, evacuating casualties
and stars. Much music was lost under the beat of their blades&#151;an
annoyance until it was perceived as a higher music than rock alone&#151;as
rock-helicopter music, space music to accompany the sound-and-light
vision of the American '70s.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The speaker's expert voice purred across the breadth of the farm,
reading off lists of the injured and ill, urging respect for the
fences. In the newspeak of our age, he praised the crowd for being
groovy, cautioning them not to blow the cool thing they had going
by breaking any of the rules. Then he would give way to another
group, and the musicians would appear, tiny forms bathed in lurid
light.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
On the festival's last night, when the field had turned to slime
and abandoned sleeping bags lay sprawled underfoot like corpses,
my feelings for the event began to darken. Everyone around me
was shivering under soaked coats and blankets. Their bonfires,
fed with newspapers and milk cartons, cast up a stench that hung
above the meadow in a yellow haze. On the dark roads, unseen faces
whispered the names of drugs to passing strangers. Mescaline?
Hash? At the central crossroads, anxious voices shouted the names
of lost friends. Gloria! Donald!
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The great stoned rock show had worked a counter-miracle, trading
on the freedom to get stoned, transforming it into a force that
tamed the crowd and extracted its compliance. Not that anyone
minded, of course-the freedom to get stoned was all the freedom
they wanted. And, being stoned, everyone was content to sit in
the mud and feed on a merchandised version of the culture they
created. In the cold acid light, the spoiled field took on the
aspect of an Orwellian concentration camp stocked with drugs and
music and staffed with charming police. The speaker's coaxing
voice only enriched the nightmare, which became complete when
I asked a trembling blue-faced boy if he was feeling all right.
&quot;Groovy,&quot; he said, adding a frozen smile.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Woodstock festival has already been recorded as a victory
for music and peace, and that is as it should be. But it should
also be remembered as a display of the authority of drugs over
a whole generation-an authority already being merchandised, exploited,
promoted. It was groovy, as the speaker kept saying, but I fear
it will grow groovier in memory, when the market in madness leads
on to shows we'd rather not see.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As for <I>Hair</I>, one had only to glance at the faces in the
lobby at intermission to see that these were not people about
to take to the barricades. Flushed, excited faces, titillated.
After all, hadn't they just had their jollies by becoming involved
enough to cheer all the heavy anti-draft lines, the pro-pot lines,
the ecstatic lyrics about beauty and truth? They got it out of
them, all right. Now they will go home feeling liberated, some
of them so liberated they will not even worry about how tired
they're going to feel in the morning when it comes time to go
back to work for The Machine.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
<I>Hair</I> was only incidentally a piece of show biz. Its real
significance lies in the fact that its arrival (along with the
effective total collapse of censorship, the popularity of pot,
the sudden militancy of every minority group, and the rediscovery
of holism) signaled the beginning of a new stage in the affairs
of the technological society. <I>Hair</I> was the death-knell
of revolution, ringing joyously and ecstatically through the industrialized
world. Then along came Woodstock, and as Barry Farrell wrote in
<I>Life,</I> &quot;no one there doubted that we were crossing
a cultural Rubicon.&quot; The question is: How many realized that
they had entered the gates of the comfortable concentration camp?
The trap had begun to close. The barricades, like the guillotine,
were suddenly relics of the past. As that small slice of humanity
which represents the cutting edge of our evolution rushed forward
to meet the dawn of the Age of Aquarius, they left their machine-guns
and ideologies and programs behind. Straitjackets were shedded
like old skins. We had begun to give up. What every pessimistic
modern philosopher from Huxley to Jacques Ellul had warned us
against was finally happening. We were losing control of our destiny,
losing our minds, throwing down our weapons and surrendering in
droves. We had stopped fighting. Hegel's historical man, whose
spirit was in &quot;a mighty conflict with itself,&quot; who could
advance to higher forms only by overcoming himself, was suddenly
as obsolete and pathetic as the Priest King of Nemi, who could
succeed to office only by slaying the incumbent, and having slain
him, retained power only until he himself was slain, with the
result that &quot;year in year out, in summer and winter, in fair
weather and in foul, he had to keep his lonely watch, (sword in
hand, pacing around the tree that was his throne) and whenever
he snatched a troubled slumber it was at the peril of his life.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Revolution, whose death-convulsions had taken the form of student
revolts in the fallopian tubes of the technological society, is
finally finished as the vehicle of human advance. And since revolution
really means cyclic recurrence, (a vicious circle) we do not have
to bemoan, as Marcuse does, the &quot;passing of historical forces&quot;
which seemed, at earlier stages, to represent the possibility
of change. There is no political institution left on the face
of the earth whose ideology is not basically technological, so
all a revolution hitched to realpolitik can offer now is more
of the same. Revolution is giving way to liberation and short-circuiting
the vicious circle entirely. If <I>Hair</I> and Woodstock signal
the triumph of the technological society, they also signal the
end to futile and self-perpetuating conflict.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The <I>Hair</I> and Woodstock phenomena are complex, like the
flight of Apollo 11; the question has to be asked: What is the
effect? Do these phenomena liberate or do they add a deeper dimension,
a new twist, to the elaborate and subtle mechanisms of aggregate
control? The immediate problem with <I>Hair</I> is that its emergence&#151;or
the emergence of some immensely popular show employing exactly
the same devices of protest, outrage, anger, obscenity and revolutionary
rhetoric&#151;was anticipated as far back as the 1950s by French
philosopher Jacques Ellul, who argued that the more restrictive
the social mechanism, the more exaggerated are the associated
ecstatic phenomena. (Neither <I>Hair</I> nor Woodstock could be
described as other than ecstatic.) &quot;Technique,&quot; wrote
Ellul, &quot;encourages and enables the individual to express
his ecstatic reactions in a way never before possible. He can
express criticism of his culture, and even loathing. He is permitted
to propose the maddest solutions. The great law here is that all
things are necessary to make a society and even revolt is necessary
to make a technical society.&quot; <I>Hair,</I> which expresses
plenty of loathing and not a few mad solutions, is tolerated (along
with pornography, obscenity, and even, to an increasing degree,
pot and homosexuality) not because there is more freedom than
before, but because the expression of criticism allows people
to let off steam. And having let off steam they are less likely
to get serious about changing the social order.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Marcuse has a word for it: &quot;repressive de-sublimation,&quot;
which is the &quot;release of sexuality in modes and forms which
reduce and weaken erotic energy.&quot; (Erotic energy being the
source of real rebellion as opposed to burlesques.) In tolerating
a show like <I>Hair</I> or a happening like Woodstock, the technocratic
order would be doing nothing less than moving into the realm of
&quot;pleasant forms of social control and cohesion.&quot; The
thrust of the argument is that pleasant forms of control work
more effectively than repression. Thus, there is the appearance
of rebellion, but no substance. As Ellul puts it: &quot;Technique
defuses the revolt of the few and thus appeases the need of the
millions for revolt.&quot;<P>&nbsp;  
<H4>B. It accomplishes nothing, except a changing of the guard.
</H4>
<P>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Leonard Cohen remarked in 1968, when asked if there was a revolution
going on: &quot;Of course it's a revolution. But I want to see
the <I>real</I> revolution. I don't want it siphoned off by the
mobilization people. It's got to take place in every room. Revolutionaries,
in their heart of hearts, are excited by the tyranny they wield.
The lines are being drawn and people on both sides are beginning
to terrorize each other. Somehow we have to break out of this
process, which can only lead to both sides becoming <I>like</I>
each other. I'm afraid that when the Pentagon is finally stormed
and taken, it will be by guys wearing uniforms very much like
those worn by the guys defending it.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Many of us advance into our lives by little more than cause and
effect. That is, we take a step for a variety of reasons and,
having taken this small initial step, discover the consequences.
We are then forced to deal with those consequences. and we do
that by rationalizing the original act. Having rationalized it,
one has then set up the crude framework of a behavioral pattern
which can now be fleshed out by further actions&#151;<I>proceeding
in the same direction.</I> Each new action, so long as it continues
to proceed in the same direction, becomes slightly easier than
the one before. It's like learning to drive, acquiring reflexes.
Once one is familiar with the gears it becomes largely automatic.
Strong men, or men of action (such as revolutionaries must be),
are therefore those whose behavior has been most effectively rationalized.
They set themselves in motion automatically. Revolutionary heroes
are therefore bound to a large degree to be behavioral automatons.
Further, all revolutionaries are forced to accept a discipline
which forbids them to freely explore interpretations other than
those which serve as the basis for the revolution. Revolutionary
zeal is one of the worst forms of tyranny, locking the individual
into a position every bit as static as that of his opposite number,
the reactionary. At the extremes, in terms of individual personality,
the revolutionary and the reactionary merge. For both, the doors
leading to personal growth and development of their own unrealized
potential are closed.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The man of action requires an uncluttered setting with simple
ground rules in order to function. Ideally: A setting as stark
as a boxing ring. Only then can the Aristotelian proposition of
either/or be put to work. The object of the revolutionary (or
reactionary) game is to reduce complex on-going processes to a
fixed game board involving nothing more than two players; black
vs. white, good vs. bad, freedom vs. slavery. If he is successful
in reducing multi-ordinal reality to a simple game, the revolutionary
has then &quot;set the stage&quot; for an uprising. Needless to
say, in a complex highly-integrated modern industrial state, the
initial task of the revolutionary is that much more difficult.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The point here is simply that the revolutionary stance is an <I>id&eacute;e
fixe,</I> monomania. Further, it is, on a grand scale, a kind
of decadence&#151;a rejection of the complex (and real) in favor
of the simple (and less real). What the revolutionary offers us,
finally, is one other idea about how things should be done. His
goal is to ram that idea down our throats, and in order to be
able to do that, he must first seize power.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Which brings us to the heart of the matter. Chairman Mao advises
us that &quot;the seizure of power by armed force, the settlement
of the issue by war, is the central task and the highest form
of revolution.&quot; It is a power struggle first and foremost.
Exactly the sort of thing for which the Priest Kings of Nemi stand
as the central metaphor. The revolutionary does not want change,
he wants <I>one</I> change, the change which will bring him into
power. And then...? Why then his task is to fight off the next
wave of revolutionaries who want another change. &quot;Everybody
wants to save the world,&quot; Henry Miller once noted, &quot;but
nobody wants to help his neighbor.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&quot;The urge to manipulate others,&quot; writes George B. Leonard,
&quot;whether to 'solve' a 'problem' or build an empire, begins
in the nursery&#133;The drive for surplus power&#133;is born of
lack and nourished by deprivation. 'Power'&#151;the word itself&#151;appears
only when there are unfulfilled needs. We would never have heard
the term 'Black Power' if blacks had been treated fairly. 'Woman
Power' is a statement of denial, a cry for justice. Ultimately,
little will be gained if blacks, women, and others of the oppressed
merely gain dominance, thus triggering yet another cycle of deprivation
and desperation....'Power' is derived from an Old French word
meaning, 'to be able.' When we return to this definition, the
real question becomes, 'What do you want to be able to do or be,
to feel or enjoy?' The past has taught us well: Playing power
games and losing is a waste of time. Playing power games and getting
exactly what you want is the ultimate despair.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
All political parties, whether revolutionary or established (along
with their ideologies and systems) are built on a narrow base
of power. Some specialize in humanism, others on exploitation,
yet others on inevitable conflict. In all cases, the issue of
power remains the locus of activity. All existing political organizations
(again whether revolutionary or not) remain essentially anthropomorphic.
The struggle is between people and groups of people, each locked
into a monomaniacal opposing stance. Any disinclination to accept
the whole ideological package is a sign of betrayal&#151;one becomes
a &quot;revisionist&quot; or a &quot;Commie-lover&quot; or something
to that effect, depending on where and what you are. Revolutions
are seen as mechanisms whereby our sickness might be cured: racism,
greed, insanity, hate, fear, distrust, alienation, poverty, dictatorship.
Revolution, at best, is seen as a kind of heart transplant; at
worst, lobotomy. Always, of course, for the good of the patient,
and always on the assumption that the operation will cure all
ills. &quot;Social change&quot; is the vehicle, the means toward
the higher end of more moral behavior, of greater brotherly love,
of physical well-being, an end to hunger and deprivation
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And to affect these tremendous social changes, it remains absolutely
necessary to seize power. Underdog must overthrow topdog. Underdog
is then the new topdog and the old topdog now has a taste of being
underdog. The guard has been changed. There is a new man in the
saddle. Beyond that stage, what happens?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The operational mode of thinking remains the trigger of all practical
change. Today, Marxism is the mirror image of capitalism, but
basically no different. Because Communists and Socialists and
Capitalists have all hitched their social wagons to the engine
of technology, there can be no basic change. Exploitation of nature
remains the key to wealth, whether equally distributed or not.
And through the domination of nature, the men continue to dominate
each other and be dominated.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Theodore Roszak puts it well:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To immerse oneself in the old ideologies-with the notable exception
of the anarchist tradition which flows from such figures as Kropotkin,
Tolstoy, Thoreau&#151;is to find oneself stifling in the stone and
steel environment of unquestionable technological necessity. It
is a literature of seriousness and grim resolve, tightly bounded
by practicality, class discipline, the statistics of injustice,
and the lust for retribution. To speak of the ecstasies of life
in such a somber environment is to risk folly. Here where all
men trudge, none may dance. Dancing is . . . for later. If the
demise of the old ideologies begins anywhere, it begins with this
delaying gesture. For to postpone until 'later' consideration
of the humanly essential in the name of 'being realistic' is to
practise the kind of deadly practicality which now stands our
civilization in peril of annihilation. It is to deliver us into
the hands of the dehumanized commissars, managers, and operational
analysts&#151;all of whom are professional experts at postponing
the essential. These are the practitioners of what C. Wright Mills
called 'crackpot realism.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Revolution is based in part on the proposition that institutions
must be shuffled, and <I>then</I> the hearts of men and women
can be affected. Control&#151;through the institutional agencies&#151;is
the prerequisite for real change. It does not cross the revolutionary
mind that institutions are the last extensions of man&#151;that to
begin attempting to cure human ills through the agencies of institutions
is to start at the ass end. Institutions, laws, legislation and
flags can be easily changed&#151;what, we must ask, has that got
to do with individuals? Such thinking misses completely the basic
psychological insight that we cannot deliberately bring about
changes in ourselves or in others. Any intention toward change
will have the opposite effect. A &quot;successful&quot; revolution
means simply that we are saddled with a new set of controllers.
Meanwhile, in our hearts nothing has changed. The power games
go on. Exploitation of nature continues. Man is still assumed
to be, &quot;realistically,&quot; the center of the universe.
A king of flat-earth psychology continues to dominate our collective
behavior.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Meanwhile, the earth continues to die.<P>&nbsp;  
<H4>C. It diverts us from the real struggle, which is to attain
a higher level of consciousness, and to explore our potential
(which is still unknown.) </H4>
<P>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Leon Trotsky once prophesied that the final revolution in the
world would consist of a series of small and violent upheavals
going on everywhere, lasting perhaps for generations. This sounds
dead on, yet not even Trotsky could have envisioned how &quot;small&quot;
and how &quot;violent.&quot; The final revolution will be taking
place in an arena no larger than my head and your head, and it
will involve a psychic and emotional violence whose measure has
not yet been taken. So long as we are concentrating our energies
on power struggles, on toppling institutions only to replace them
with others, we are channeling our energies outward; it is an
exercise as futile as the trip to the moon, all part of an outward
voyage whose aim is exploitation, whose method is manipulation,
whose end is power and control. History is a stuck record, with
human struggle caught in a single groove, the vicious circle of
cyclic recurrence. Down goes one king, and up goes another. The
day after a palace is stormed, the new bosses set up shop across
the street. We have not yet escaped from collective childhood,
in the sense that we still need leaders, and still do not trust
our own senses. (Liberals, with their tremendous fear of being
&quot;judgmental,&quot; are among the worst offenders. It is the
liberals who have come closest to building systems on a fusion
of man and his works, yet they have not learned that their weakness&#151;equivocality&#151;is
also their greatest potential source of strength.) Revolution
is seen always as the means to an end which is human liberation,
freedom not only from want, but from the tyranny of the emotions,
racism, hatred, murder, crime, and exploitation. &quot;Social
change&quot; will lead to a change in consciousness. Yet this
is in reality a Rube Goldberg course. The possibility of moving
directly from A to B. without having to climb to the top of the
pyramid in order to get down to the bottom of it, has not even
historically been considered; except, of course, by theologians
and artists. The only way for the greater human being to come
into existence is directly, giving birth to himself. No ideology
is prepared to accept the idea that the cure might precede the
revolutionary operation, that perhaps the operation might only
make the patient sicker. Change&#151;real change, as opposed to a
change of political underwear&#151;will only come after the fact
of individual liberation. And since this is something that cannot
be organized or led, that does not lend itself to political or
ideological frames of reference, it is dismissed (by the operationalists)
as being nothing at all. Yet we might with good cause demand:
Revolutionary, heal thyself! The real revolution works in exactly
the opposite fashion to what has always been assumed to be the
case-changing the social institutions does no good, because the
last link in the chain, the individual, is the farthest removed
from the locus of power. When however, the individual is the <I>first</I>
link to be affected, it turns out that the seats of power are
themselves the last to be changed. Institutions and thrones are
about as far removed from the ordinary citizen as anything in
the social landscape. The aim of revolutionary types has been
to organize the people to move against the thrones, to tear down
the institutions. In the process, people submit to discipline
and the need for violence, and thus become violent disciplinarians
themselves. The fact that they may be crushing an entrenched set
of violent disciplinarians at this point makes no real difference.
How far have they progressed in the direction of realization of
themselves? Nowhere. They may have succeeded in brutalizing themselves,
in reverting to the logic of domination and can be certain of
emerging from the bloodbath convinced that the operational point
of view is the only point of view. Other than that, there is no
progress in the critical direction&#151;which is to explore unknown
territory, to move upward, not downward, in terms of personal
and collective evolution, to acquire a keener vision, a deepening
of the senses, an enlargement of vision, to the point where we
might perceive subtler harmonies, regularities which were not
noticed before, and, finally, to bring our shattered selves back
into a working whole. The task is to complete the human being,
not turn him back into a barbarian.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The question arises: It's all very well to say that we must all
&quot;save ourselves,&quot; no one can do it for us, but what
about the obvious inequalities of the present system? What about
corruption? Police brutality? Militarism? Murder? What good does
it do if you liberate yourself and achieve a state of &quot;higher
morality&quot; or whatever, if, in the meantime, Vietnamese peasants
continue to be bombed, Blacks are starving in ghettoes, Indians
are processed and reprocessed through prisons, millions are dying
of starvation, madmen have their fingers poised on the nuclear
trigger, and the planet is being destroyed by parasitic corporations
and governments? Isn't 'self-liberation&quot; at this stage a
luxury we can ill afford to indulge ourselves in? There is real
work to be done, and done in a hurry if we are to survive.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The short answer lies in what Gestalt therapist Fritz Perls describes
as the most important phenomenon in all pathology: &quot;self-regulation
versus external regulation. The anarchy which is usually feared
by the controllers is not an anarchy which is without meaning.
On the contrary, it means the organism is left alone to take care
of itself, without being meddled with from outside. And I believe
this is the great thing to understand: <I>that awareness per se&#151;by
and of itself&#151;can be curative.</I> Because with full awareness
you become aware of this organismic self-regulation, you can let
the organism take over without interfering, without interrupting;
we can rely on the wisdom of the organism.&quot; In the sociological
context, the message is clear enough: <I>awareness</I> is the
starting point for action which is not pre-determined by ideological
bias; without awareness, without having gotten to the &quot;center&quot;
of our beings, as the Gestaltists call it, without having transcended
the operational mode of thinking which reduces our actions to
little more than acted-out equations, without having &quot;cured&quot;
ourselves of our refusal to let the situation dictate our actions
(rather than vice-versa), there is nothing we can do with certainty
which will not simply amount to a subtler kind of power-game,
a reversal of roles, or&#151;and this is the unavoidable trap&#151;which
will not amount in the long run to a projection of our own disequilibrium
This is not to suggest a &quot;moratorium&quot; on political activity,
which in itself can be therapeutic, but it is to say that the
blind have no right to be leading the blind. Only when our own
eyes are open can we presume to lead. Otherwise we may rest assured
that whatever illusions we may have about &quot;progress&quot;
are in reality nothing more than circular gropings in the dark,
with pitfalls everywhere. The answers, once one's eyes are open,
can be clearly perceived.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Before proceeding to look beyond the barricades (a garbage heap
of antique social furniture) there is a point which needs to be
cleared up, since much of what has been said so far about the
futility of revolution can easily be misconstrued as a put-down
of very real and just revolutions taking place not only in America,
but in Canada and Vietnam and elsewhere. My argument is simply
that revolution must take the shape of its container; it defines
itself in relation to the system it seeks to defy or overthrow.
But I am speaking of revolution in the context of the technological
society, or one-dimensional society, or the affluent society,
or whatever label one chooses to describe what is mainly a white
man's modern world. Not everyone in North America lives in that
world. The ghettoes&#151;&#151;-whether black ghettoes in Los Angeles
or Chicago or Eskimo or Indian ghettoes in Canada and in the Arctic-are
truly another country. And the struggles that go on within these
territories are against colonialism, imperialism, and brutal oppression.
They have much in common with the struggle of the Vietnamese.
The &quot;container&quot; in these cases is quite different from
the kind of container in which those of us who are predominantly
white and living in suburbs and high-rise apartments find ourselves.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Hudson Institute has calculated that within thirty years the
first four post-industrial societies will have surfaced on the
face of the planet. They will be, in this order, the United States,
Canada, Japan, and Sweden. They will be characterized by the fact
that <I>per capita</I> income will range from $4,000 to $20,000;
most economic activity will have shifted from industrial production
to the service industries, research institutes and non-profit
organizations; private enterprise will no longer be a major source
of scientific and technical development. Large-scale integration
will be all but complete. We will be far down the path of convergence
with the Communist world. At this point, the technological society
will have clamped its iron arms around the world, bioelectronics
will have succeeded in literally plugging us into world-wide hookups
and a <I>de facto</I> police state will have emerged. It is in
these areas (the post-industrialized regions) that the obsolescence
of revolution will be most apparent.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This is not to say that, <I>outside</I> the affluent sphere, revolution
will be obsolete. The &quot;wretched of the earth&quot; will still
be with us, old-style police states based on brutality and oppression
will still exist, colonialism in a variety of forms will likely
still prevail. In these &quot;outside regions,&quot; there is
no reason to assume that armed insurrection, revolution, and violent
overthrown of corrupt and brutal administrations is in any way
unjustified or unnecessary.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To draw our models for revolutionary behavior from these other
regions, however, is to refuse to recognize the qualitative differences
between these societies. Within a single generation, there will
be a difference between the most advanced societies and the ones
trailing behind them which will not only be a matter of degree
but of kind. Those of us in the most advanced regions will be
living in a different world. A fundamental change is involved.
For us to continue to assume that revolutionary programs applicable
in China, India, most of South America and Africa (areas which
have not even approached the industrialized stage) can somehow
have any relevance in our own advanced industrial context, is,
at best, an unsophisticated notion; at worst, plain stupidity.
Within the comfortable concentration camp, inside a system which
can absorb and contain and feed on all forms of protest and rebellion,
a whole new set of tactics must be evolved, and <I>are</I> being
evolved. Moreover, we have no choice in the matter, since old-style
revolutionary activity simply will not work. We will be effectively
blocked from indulging in the kind of uprising and overthrow which
amounts to cyclic recurrence. We will have no Bastilles left to
storm except those within our skulls, no oppressors left whom
we can get our hands on except our egos. The struggles which were
always directed outward&#151;against tyrants and dictators-will have
been effectively thwarted, and will be turned back on themselves.
Inward will go the revolution, turning every man's head into a
battlefield.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The &quot;social bottle&quot; of those regions on planet earth
which are furthest into the future is different, unique; by the
standards of other ages and other cultures, it is downright freaky.
It has been molded into a new form&#151;by the computer, by television,
by changes in social character, by technoplanning, cybernetics,
chemistry, psychology, technique. We all agree it is made from
new materials: plastic, nuclear power, vinyl, electronic circuitry,
datapoints and programming. Yet how many of us are prepared to
see that revolution, the counterpoint to all that is totalitarian
and repressive (even when rationally totalitarian and repressive)
must also change; it must, in fact, become as strange, as novel,
as freaky as its container. And it is becoming all of that&#151;so
much so that most of us fail to recognize it as revolution. In
drama we see, as Martin Esslin put it, &quot;By all <I>traditional</I>
standards of critical appreciation of the drama, these [modern
absurd] dramas are not only abominably bad, they do not even deserve
the name of drama.&quot; Mark Gerzon goes on to say: &quot;Many
people have realized that nothing can be judged by traditional
standards, for we do not live any longer in a traditional society.
How many parents have said about modern music and painting that
they do not even deserve the name? The arts have broken with tradition
because they found the limitations on style and structure unnecessary
and artificial...&quot; Similarly, &quot;revolution&quot; is in
the process of breaking from traditional style and structure.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Before proceeding, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between
this ultimate struggle and the penultimate struggles being waged
by oppressed people living outside the perimeter of The Machine.
Basically, these next-to-last struggles are efforts to break into
the area already inhabited by those of us who are affluent. Although
our own struggle is of a different nature, we cannot ignore those
other struggles and neither can we afford to refuse to help. But
first we must have some understanding of the <I>difference</I>.
To this end, let me focus on the Black Panther Party, which is
a real revolutionary force (in the old pre-technological style).

<h3>Introduction to the Peyote Wisdom Collection</h3>

<p> by Guy Mount, Editor <i>The Peyote Book,</i> Sweetlight
Books, Cottonwood California, 1993. Copyright Guy Mount</p>

<hr>

<p> At this moment in American History, the practitioners of
alternative herbal medicine and religion are the most persecuted
and prosecuted members of society. Peyote itself is under attack
from oil well development companies, dry land ranching
techniques, and an ever increasing number of consumers. There is
an immediate need to 1) pass laws in each state that protect the
rights of all people, regardless of race or ethnic origin, to
practice the peyote religion and pursue alternative healing
strategies (which may employ herbs on the &quot;controlled
substances&quot; list), and 2) protect peyote by developing
nature preserves in south Texas and encouraging cultivation. The
Peyote Religion and the herbal sacrament it depends on will soon
be extinct unless something radical is done to establish
environmental protection and decriminalize cultivation. </p>

<p> There is also a great need to provide educational curriculum
that supports a peaceful transition from an abusive &quot;War on
Drugs&quot; to a knowledgeable use of herbal medicines. Our
educational system presently teaches children that &quot;drug
use&quot; is crazy and criminal. There is no distinction made
between herbs and drugs, nor are any positive images of herbal
medicines provided; so it's not surprising that American
teenagers act crazy and commit crimes when they use herbs and
drugs---that's what they've been taught to do! </p>

<p> Fortunately, the Native American Church and Native American
philosophy in general provide us with the lessons we need to grow
as individuals, and to improve the overall health of our society.
Insofar as America learned from its native people, it has
provided Light to the world through democracy, religious freedom
and economic reciprocity. Therefore, I hope the Peyote Religion
will grow substantially in the near future to include many new
practitioners from all races, and legal Peyote Churches and
greenhouses in all states. Our world needs this medicine, this
lifeline to the future. </p>

<h4>HUMPHRY OSMOND </h4>

<p> This article originally appeared in <i>Tomorrow</i> magazine,
Spring 1961. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif"> <br>
</p>

<p> The Native American Church is a religious movement which
originated among the Indians of the Southwestem United States.
Its main features involve the use of peyote, a psychedelic, or
mind-manifester, drug obtained from the dried tops of a cactus
that contains mescaline, in a ceremony combining Indian religious
motifs with certain Christian themes. The drug and the ceremony
are fused together in a manner acceptable to many Indians today.
My interest in this church was a professional one, springing from
my researches into psychedelics, the vision-producing drugs the
Indians use in a group setting. So far as our research group
could make out, the Indians were the first people who used these
substances together with certain aspects of Christianity. We had
heard about them in different ways. Religious people who wanted
this sect suppressed had published complaints in various
newspapers. In my country, Canada, there had been questions and
statements from a Minister in the House of Commons at Ottawa. A
police report we read suggested that peyote was both a dangerous
poison and a drug of addiction. Professor Charles Seevers of Ann
Arbor, one of the world's leading authorities on both peyote and
mescaline, one of its active principles, has frequently stated
that it was of low toxicity and that he had no evidence of anyone
becoming addicted to it. The U. S. Public Health Service
Narcotics Section at Fort Leavenworth have never treated a peyote
addict. </p>

<p> One of the clearest and kindest accounts of them and their
religion came from the late Professor J. S. Slotkin of the
University of Chicago. He had visited the Canadian branches of
the Native American Church of North America in the summer of
1956. He told us they were being persecuted, not very obviously,
thoroughly or determinedly, but although it was mild and
intermittent, it was persecution all the same. Some of these
persecutors did not deserve the label, for they were good people
genuinely concerned about the Indians, who had been misinformed
about the nature of the peyote rite. They were naturally worried
by reports that the Indians were obtaining a dangerous and
addictive substance and engaging in wild orgies. There was reason
to be concerned after the damage liquor has done to some Indians
in the past. Along with these people who had a real interest in
the Indians, there were others who never lose an opportunity to
meddle in other people's affairs. There is not too much scope for
this hobby in western Canada today, but the Indians, being
government wards and a special minority group, are particularly
susceptible to this sort of interference. As the scholarly
Slotkin explained to us, &quot;Their conditions are wretched.
They are demoralized. Many of them hate and despise farming. The
Native American Church is something of their own, born of their
misfortunes and developed from their pre-Columbian traditions. It
has grown and flourished in spite of white men, and this makes it
even more precious to the Indians.&quot; </p>

<p> Slotkin thought we could do no harm by attending one of their
services, and we might help. It would at least show them that all
white men were not hostile. Their services have been described as
orgies only by those who have never attended them. It is curious
that the early Christians had much the same accusations leveled
at them by the Romans, whose staid, formalized, official religion
had become little more than an annex to politics, devoid of
enthusiasm and feeling. Any young religion (Quakers in Fox's day
or the Methodists in Wesley's are examples) usually manages to
offend longer-established churches, just as young lovers are
something of a reproach to long-wed people, for they reflect a
vision of love that time has more or less dimmed. Long-married
people in whom time does not produce this dimming can be
embarrassing to their more habituated contemporaries. </p>

<p> We corresponded in a desultory way with the Indians of the
Red Pheasant Band, from among whose members most of the
congregation of the Native American Church of Canada was drawn.
The Church had been duly registered as a religious body and so
was safe from direct persecution. But the supply of peyote, their
ceremonial cactus, came from the United States, and this made
them vulnerable to administrative pressure, as later events have
shown. </p>

<p> In September 1956, we learned that Mr. Frank Takes Gun,
President of the Native American Church of North America, was
planning to come north from his home in Montana to see how his
fellow church members were faring in Canada. Shortly after this,
we were invited to North Battleford. We drove north, picking up
Dr. Abram Hoffer in Saskatoon, armed with a tape recorder,
blankets, and lots of notebooks. Two members of the Saskatoon
Star Phoenix staff traveled with us. It was a glowing early fall
day, and the stubble was still live enough to give the land a
blond, crew-cut look. We arrived in North Battleford late in the
afternoon of the sixth of October, 1956. Mr. Takes Gun and his
companion, Mr. Russell, came to see us in our hotel. They had had
a harassing time getting the hard-pressed Red Pheasant Band to
organize the ceremony. They are poor Indians. Mr. Takes Gun had
helped them to get permission to pitch a tepee for the meeting in
the grounds of old Fort Battleford. He was also inquiring into
the legal help the Indians were getting in Canada. The Indians'
way of conducting business is still not very like that of the
white man, and there is much misunderstanding. </p>

<p> I was tired and a little apprehensive on at least two counts.
My colleagues and I had decided that, while they would watch and
record the ceremony, I should take part in it, and observe from
the inside, as it were. I did not wholly enjoy the idea of taking
peyote, although I have used a variety of mind-changing
substances in the past few years. These have included taking
harmola, the seeds of Syrian rue, which has a disgusting taste;
kavakava, the roots and leaves of a South Sea Island pepper
plant; ololiuqui, the seeds of Rivea corymbosa, a vinelike plant
from Mexico, once the chief and sacred narcotic of the Aztecs. I
had also taken chemically pure mescaline, one active principle of
peyote, and the immensely powerful Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,
both derived from plants. In addition, we had worked with a new
group of substances derived from adrenalin, whose use in this
field had been discovered in Saskatchewan. I had, however, never
taken peyote before. I found its dried, shriveled, and furry
appearance uninviting, and reports said it frequently produced
nausea and vomiting. I did not relish the idea of vomiting in
public. My second worry was a more serious one. I had much
sympathy for the Indians and wanted to assist their cause, but as
an honest observer I would have to report everything that
happened. I was concerned lest the service should be
ill-conducted. </p>

<p> Mr. Takes Gun was clearly worried about me. He told me
repeatedly that they would have good, clean city water and that
the cups would be personal and hygienic. The peyote, he assured
me, would not be difficult to take, but would be made soft with a
coffee grinder and wrapped individually in Kleenex. He is of
medium height and very solidly built, of that almost pure
mesomorphy that one finds often among the Plains Indians. His
face might have been carved from old, oiled, highly polished
teakwood. He glistened in the afternoon sun-for he was nervous.
His eyes and hair were black. He had the longest ears I have ever
seen. His face was impassive. This made one notice the eloquence
of his hands all the more (one finger was missing from the left
one); his gestures were as expressive as a Latin's. </p>

<p> Mr. Takes Gun left us to make the final preparations for the
ceremony. We agreed to be at North Battleford a little after
sundown, and, before he left, he gave me a final reassurance
about the purity of the water. We crossed the golden valley of
the South Saskatchewan River and drove up the hillside to the old
fort. They had set the tepee on the short grass inside the
stockade. It was small and pale, its ventilator flapping in the
breeze. The clear night sky with the stars appearing and the
faint swirl of nothern lights seemed about to engulf us. Outside
the tepee there was a great stack of small logs. </p>

<p> The ceremonial fire in the center of the tepee was ready for
lighting. It was between the horns of the low, crescent-moon
altar shaped from molded earth. Only the fire tender occupied
this middle space. The rest of us, eight observers, including two
journalists, and fourteen Indian worshipers, were ranged around
the circumference of the tepee. Apart from Mr. Takes Gun, and Mr.
Russell, who had driven up from Montana, our hosts came from
Saskatchewan, mostly from the Red Pheasant Band, though a few had
driven over from Alberta. The elders of this group were Mr.
Nicotine and Mr. Stone. There were several younger men and two
Indian ladies. All looked spruce and neat. They had clearly put
on their best clothes for the service. I sat on Mr. Takes Gun's
left so that I could learn about the ceremony from him. He was
the leader, and Mr. Russell, on his right, was his drummer. </p>

<p> In a tepee, one sits with one's back slightly bent and one's
head forward. However one places the legs, they get stiff, the
long hamstring muscles in particular. Cramping pains can be a
nuisance. Mr. Russell played the fire taps on his drum, and the
fire tender lit the prepared wood. Sparks rose up and fluttered
in the darkness above us before vanishing. The tepee was filled
with the pleasant, acrid smell of sage, thyme, and burning logs.
Mr. Takes Gun put a single leaf and then a large peyote button on
the moon altar. The rest of us remained seated, and he was
silent. He consulted his watch from time to time. At eight-thirty
he began to read a written address he had with him. He asked for
&quot;Religious freedom for the Indian form of
Christianity.&quot; He quoted the Declaration of Independence
with its inalienable rights, which include religious freedom and
the pursuit of happiness. The long Indian faces, dark in the fire
glow, expressed melancholy, dolor, tragedy. &quot;We want to be
let alone to worship our God as we wish.&quot; He then addressed
the observers directly: &quot;I trust you will tell the truth and
nothing but the truth so help us God.&quot; It is no easy matter
even to observe accurately enough to be sure what the truth might
be, and having done this, how should one convey the truth so that
it will mean something to someone else? I wondered how I would be
able to communicate the solemnity of that frail tepee. It was
like being inside a lighted Japanese lantern, suspended in
eternity. </p>

<p> The smoke started the ceremony proper. The Indians are
masters of symbolism; a few eagle feathers, a pinch of sweet
herbs, a little water drum, a gourd rattle, a fire, and little
more, are all the aids they need for worship. For them,
everything that is, is holy. They have no written prayers, but as
among the Quakers, everyone prays according to his conscience. So
a cigarette made from cornhusks symbolizes for them the
purification and dedication of the human spirit to a greater
spirit. The tobacco was handed around in a soft leather pouch. It
was runny, with many small grains. I am not a smoker. I fashioned
my cigarette clumsily and the tobacco leaked out, and the result
was rather emaciated. A glowing brand was passed around for
lighting the cigarettes. Shortly after mine was lit, I choked.
The fire felt very hot on my face, almost scorching, while behind
I was chilly. It did not seem a good start for the evening. </p>

<p> While Mr. Russell beat the drum, Mr. Takes Gun chanted and
shook the rattle. Sometimes he used English and sometimes his own
tongue. The wind noises were lost in the chanting and the
drumming. His voice rose effortlessly from a firm baritone to a
high, clear falsetto. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Dear Heavenly Father, </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>We are representing our folks under this tepee. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Dear Heavenly Father, Dear Heavenly Father </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Bless these men that are observers here. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Dear Heavenly Father, </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These poor people surrendered all their lands </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To the Government of Canada---their conditions </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Are pitiful. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Dear Heavenly Father---bless my people back home. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Then he continued in his own tongue, which seemed made for
rhetoric, for declamation, and his voice rose in searching
falsetto. The Indians maintained a low background of song in
their three different languages. The faces of his fellow
worshipers were angry, resigned, supplicating, shifting with the
changes of rhythm and the flickering fire. The chorus ceased from
time to time and the leader continued alone, his voice cascading
and dying away, the song of a bird fluttering against a great
storm. The fire glowed. An Indian wept. We placed our cigarettes
around the base of the moon altar. </p>

<p> At about 9 P.M. the peyote was brought in. It was carried in
a little white cloth sack, which was handed from person to
person. Mine came separately; it had been macerated in a coffee
grinder and each button wrapped in a white tissue, so courteous
are the Indians. They themselves crunched the hard, dry, furry
cactus tops determinedly, as one cracks nuts with one's teeth. I
nibbled cautiously at my soft, damp residue. It has a sharp
taste, which lingers in the mouth. It is bitter and sour on the
stomach. It repeats on one. It is not as bad as ololiuqui, and is
pleasant compared with the sour, oily, rancid seed of the Syrian
rue. Mr. Takes Gun belched a little after swallowing his. Peyote
takers, making a virtue of necessity, sometimes allege there is
something especially valuable about the nausea it induces in some
people. As in other religions, rationalizations are always ready
to help out anything unpalatable. I was glad when I swallowed the
last bit of peyote. My apprehensions about vomiting were
unnecessary. </p>

<p> The drumming and singing continued. The water drum is made of
blackened iron covered with hide. Seven knobs on the side
represent the dipper stars. Behind the singing there is always
drumming and rattling. The drum beat in the brain and wearied me;
every drummer seemed much the same. The fire tender moved the
ashes into the space between the horns of the moon, so that it
gradually filled up with fine wood ashes. I had respect for the
ceremony. It was reverent and well conducted. But I was still not
of the group, even though I was among them. I scribbled away at
my note pad and often watched my observing colleagues, who were
at the other side of the tepee. </p>

<p> At about nine-fifteen I wrote, &quot;The young man with the
superb face, puzzled by his fate---he has a kingly face,&quot;
and again, &quot;if feeling gets to God, this must.&quot; By nine
forty-five there was a ghost of brilliant color in my eye grounds
when I closed my lids. I felt remote and slightly depressed. The
roof flap fluttered like a lost soul. The tepee is a microcosm, a
tiny mirror of the universe. The fire glowed red and smokeless;
the fire tender handed around a smoldering brand for those who
wanted to smoke. Mr. Takes Gun recited prayers in his
language---as he smoked, his hands moved with extraordinary
delicacy. It was an unorgiastic orgy. The Indians sing without
opening their mouths much, and often they hardly move their lips.
They sing with their sound box and chest, while we use our lips,
tongue, and sound box. I was never quite sure where the singing
was coming from, and it was sometimes almost impossible to decide
who was singing and who was not. </p>

<p> By about ten I had become more aware of what was happening,
and recognized that peyote was starting to affect me. My sight
was sharper and my hearing more acute. Looking around the tepee,
it struck me that we white men, outnumbered in this tiny world,
were an even smaller fraction of the larger one. I found it hard
to write and did so reluctantly because, as I noted, &quot;. . .
it broke the chain of feeling.&quot; I got nothing down on my pad
for the next hour and a half. Visual changes continued and
increased during this time. They never became very marked, but at
times the Indians seemed hostile. Their faces became distorted
with anger. I realized that this was probably the effect of
peyote and so did not become panicky. I felt that I was an
intruder whom the Indians did not trust-they had no special
reason to. I did not seem close to them. Peyote works slowly and
subtly. It is well suited for a gathering of this sort, where
people of differing temperaments, who do not necessarily share a
common language, worship together and explore reality without the
cushion of words and supported mainly by ritual. </p>

<p> A photographer took some flash pictures at about ten or
fifteen minutes before midnight, and then I started writing
again. The Indians chanted, drummed, and used the gourd rattle.
Only their faces were impassive. The ceremonial swept me along
with it. </p>

<p> At midnight, water was brought in. This was the pure city
water Mr. Takes Gun had promised me earlier. It was in a new,
white enamel pail with a swan transfer on the outside. It was
passed around, and we drank from individual paper cups. It could
have been depressingly hygienic, but the intention was a generous
one to put me at ease. He then said, &quot;Pray to God and ask
him to bless the water.&quot; He explained that the Indians held
their services at night, while the white man sleeps, because God
would have time to spare for his Indian friends. He urged his
fellow Indians to bring up their children to be intelligent and
progressive, adding, &quot;We are representing our lives
here.&quot; Then he left us and, walking around the outside of
the tepee, blew piercing blasts on an eagle's-bone whistle at the
four compass points. The sound shrilled through aeons of space
and corridors of time. It echoed to eternity. When he came back
to us, he prayed, &quot;. . . that the Universe may
prevail.&quot; </p>

<p> Shortly after this my fellow observers left for what must
have been twenty minutes or so, but it could have been as many
centuries. I stayed behind with the Indians, and I became part of
the worshipers. I entered their world, where for generation upon
generation they had hunted the buffalo. They had lived with and
on the buffalo. They were of one piece. They were the buffalo.
Their lives were part of those shaggy lumbering herd beasts whose
myriads roamed the great plains. On these wide prairies, where
trees and hills are almost equally scarce, sound often conveyed
as much as sight. So the Indians call up their past with song,
with drum, and with rattle. For them, minute alterations of
rhythm and pace evoke ever-changing images. Because we cannot
hear as they do, the drumming and rattling seem endlessly
repetitive to us. The drumming was the steady running of a man
with his dog padding beside him. It was the pawing and thudding
of buffalo hooves crescendoing in thunder. It was the gentle
crumpling of dung falling or the soft plop of a calf dropping on
turf, soundless, yet heard by the hunter. The gourd evoked the
endlessly sifting wind, catching at scrub and grass as it passed.
It was the hissing of an arrow as it leaves the bow or snakes by
one's head in battle. It was the sizzling of buffalo meat
grilling on the campfire and the creak of a hide tepee as the
blizzard twists and whirls around it. The drumming was life and
death, scarlet blood spurting from a stricken buffalo or from a
fallen warrior. Yet it was also the first fluttering of a child
inside its mother. As he sang, a young man wept, and Frank Takes
Gun said, &quot;Shed tears on mother earth that the Universal God
may take pity on him.&quot; </p>

<p> When my friends returned, I felt that the Indians and I were
one and that, for a little time, or more accurately, a different
sort of time, I was of their world rather than that of my
colleagues, their conquerors. It was not simply that I realized
they had a point of view I could respect, but that I felt in my
bones as they felt in theirs. Looking back, I do not believe that
this was an illusion, for I continued to be much more aware of
their way of looking at things. But how could one prove such an
opinion-without fine instruments for measuring a man's system of
values. </p>

<p> The women did not drum, sing or use the gourd rattle, but
they smoked, took peyote, and played a large part in the morning
ceremony. They also prepared the feast for the next day. Women
only very rarely enjoy their highest status among nomadic people.
</p>

<p> The Indians must have begun to filter down from Siberia about
ten thousand years ago, and as they reached the great central
plains they spread out in the wake of the buffalo. For some
mysterious reason, horses, which had once lived in America, died
out long before man arrived. So the newcomers hunted on foot.
Unlike our forebears, who were harassed and pushed west by waves
of horsemen from Central Asia, many tiny Indian societies grew up
far apart from each other, isolated by vast distances. There were
occasionally brief, savage, and ceremonious wars on the prairies,
in which little groups of men raided the enemies. In these,
courage counted more than killing. Apart from this, their whole
lives, their very existence, was at the heels of those heavy
monsters. Pursuing them, they had endured drought and cold,
furious rainstorms and blinding blizzards. For a very short time,
a few generations only, they had horses, which, escaping from the
Spaniards, bred splendidly on the grasslands. Few people accept
an innovation so quickly and successfully as the Indians took to
the horse. They were centaurs. The drumming told of that age of
glory when, to the beat of horses' hooves, they swept across the
prairies like wildfire and hunted with a splendor never
surpassed. Then the white settlers invaded the prairies, and the
unequal struggle between hunting peoples who lived in space
without time, and the season-bound rapacity of the cultivators of
the soil, began. The hunting grounds were eroded. Finally the
buffalo were slaughtered wantonly by the million. With that
holocaust, their traditions, their way of life, their world,
their universe collapsed, and the veil of their souls was rent.
Braves became bums, for there was nothing manly left to do. Their
women mourned for them. </p>

<p> I was drenched in that world of sound, of singing, drumming,
and the subtly changing rhythms of drum, rattle, and voice. We
are a more visual people than the Indians, and this is perhaps
why they seem impassive to us. We watch, in particular, for
changes in facial expression and do not notice the auditory
signals with which the Indians communicate their feelings. Those
long silences during which they let the unspoken flow between
people simply make us tense, embarrassed, uneasy, and ready to
burst into nervous chattering. </p>

<p> The blue-shirted young man who had been weeping said,
&quot;Frank, can I have some more medicine?&quot; and the little
sack was passed along to him. He crunched two more buttons and
began to sing and use the gourd rattle while his companion
drummed. His song rose above the drumming, was drowned by it, and
rose again and again, faltering but struggling still. It was an
agony. The drumbeats were strides of fate. Life must go on, pain
or no pain. There could be no concessions. The young man wept and
sang for himself, for his people, for every human being who has
ever quailed before the harshness of life. After singing, he was
easier, and the rhythm of his drumming reflected this. There was
in it a little of that cosmic beat of Tchaikowsky's great Second
Movement of the Fifth Symphony, when, for a brief while, he heard
and transcribed what must surely be the pulsing of the galaxies.
I watched the young man, and I think I experienced some of the
queasiness that peyote induced in him. Like most young men, he
longed for a life that meant something-a life of action, danger,
pain, defeat, torture, and death at the hands of his enemies if
necessary. A life like that of his ancestors who lived on the
prairies for centuries before. Anything rather than the
humiliating meaninglessness of the present. But the drumming told
him, &quot;You cannot go back. You can go forward. It will be
rough, but it can be done.&quot; It is sad to be a warrior from
generations of warriors with nothing warlike to do-an Achilles
without Troy, staying at home among his mother's spinning women. </p>

<p> The fire tender kept the hearth meticulously, and the moon
altar, which had started as a thin crescent, filled up steadily.
When a singer had sung his song, the Indians sat in silence and
absorbed it. They applauded with a low guttural noise that might
be a hum. They were polite, sensitive, and seemed very courteous
and alert toward each other and to their guests. By now it was
almost three in the morning, and most of the observers were
asleep; one snored loudly and had to be prodded by his neighbor.
The visual imagery I usually experience with psychedelic
substances was much reduced in this setting, and the auditory
imagery very much increased. I responded to every nuance of their
drumming. They use a tiny range of sound with which to express
themselves, and this is saturated with emotion. </p>

<p> The sparks spangled the upper darkness of the tepee every
time the fire was stoked. The tepee was the universe. It had not
increased in size nor changed its shape, but the sound had
expanded it beyond thought. The young man still cannot bear his
fate. All the warrior in him is assailed by it and revolts
against it. But he must listen to the voice of the music, which
is greater than man. He sings again, this time in high falsetto.
There is a note of triumph in it, and perhaps peyote has
dissolved the aching in his heart---for a little while. </p>

<p> The tepee smelled of wood and wood smoke, burning herbs,
sweat. I noticed the tanginess of the smoke, like in a kippering
room. It clung to my hair and clothes for days afterward. The
Indians are creatures of sound and smell, with auditory symbolism
predominating. We are creatures of sight and sound, with visual
imagery predominating. Every drum tap has a meaning for them. </p>

<p> Through the small hours they sang of fleet horses and
tireless riders, of unwearying runners and faithful dogs padding
beside them. The stories are woven into the drum rhythms. They
fanned themselves with a few eagle's feathers, evoking arrow, war
bonnet, and battle club-endless parleys, powwows, and ceremonial
meetings. They had few songs of war, and they returned always to
the death of the buffalo, their banishment from the prairies, and
so their unmanning and loss of their warrior status. The buffalo
hoofbeats are in them as the sound of the sea is in me from
generations of seafarers. The Indians may be poor and defeated,
but they are not contemptible. They reveal themselves to each
other with peyote in humility, but also in pride. For although
they revere the Universal Spirit, they do not cringe. They are
not ashamed of being men, for so they were created. They do not
ascribe their misfortunes to sin, and are thus saved from much
futile self-blame. </p>

<p> Mr. Russell's drumming was splendid. Frank sang of the long
winter nights and their hopes of endless buffalo herds. He sang,
too, of that brief time when they tamed horses, molding
long-maned and long-tailed wildings to their will. This reminded
me that the Trojan hero Hector, tamer of horses, was exercizing
with his chariots on the windy plain of Ilium when their
ancestors were hunting the buffalo on foot, over these same
prairies. The service was very simple and drew the participants
into it. Once I lost my fear and unsureness, the Indians accepted
me with dignity, as an equal. I was impressed by their economy of
gesture, the faultless taste of their religious art; like a very
dry sherry, it is not for every palate. The prairies have molded
them over the centuries---they are a people of the open spaces;
their God is an open one of the wide earth and the limitless
sky---not a shadowy, hidden god of the forests and thickets.
Their Universal Spirit is mysterious in its immensity and
omnipresence. Man's problem is not to find God, for it is
impossible not to be aware of Him, but to relate oneself to Him
in the best possible way. </p>

<p> By four-thirty I was becoming more aware of my hosts as
individuals. We had experienced something together that cannot be
contained in language. Poetry or music would come closer, but I
am not a poet or a composer. The wind fretted around the tepee.
The singing was like voices calling in the dark, calling for dawn
to come, for winter to go, for the buffalo to return, for a child
to be born. </p>

<p> Mr. Russell had the black drum passed to him. He sucked a
little water from it, tautened the hide, and smoothed it with a
caress. Frank Takes Gun explained the next part of the ceremony.
&quot;You have only seen three last night-the leader, the
drummer, and the fireman. Now you will see the fourth. Thank God
we have lived to see another day. We represent our lives: we
don't imitate anything. The foundations of human life rest with
our mothers who delivered us into this world.&quot; The Mother
stepped into the tepee through the door flap, announced by the
shrilling of the eagle's-bone whistle. She sat down by the white
enamel waterpot. The tepee was dim, the fire was low, but some
wisps of smoke rising from it seemed to surround her. She had a
red blanket around her shoulders, a blue dress, smooth black
hair, and her face seemed very broad. She was greeted by a song
of welcome with voices, drum, and rattle. With the singing, she
became superb mother earth, mother prairie, grass, cow buffalo,
mare, and doe, the epitome of motherhood. The drum beating was
not restful or sleep inducing. It was the fecund pulsing of sex,
passion, generation, and death, sung without guilt and without
self-consciousness. The mother was weary, patient, tender, but
enduring. She stood behind all the men---drummer, fire tender,
leader. In front of her were the waters of life and death. </p>

<p> Frank addressed her in the highest falsetto, a tearing,
almost noiseless scream, the cry of the tiniest baby or of an old
man breathing his last. It was unbearable. The mother could have
been any age---maid, mother, or crone, from sixteen to a hundred
sixteen. </p>

<p> &quot;You have been good to us while we were here. You worked
hard and made this possible. God knows we worship Him. God knows
we respect the mothers of our children.&quot; </p>

<p> Mr. Dave Stone, the oldest man present, spoke to the mother
in his high, light voice. His voice was very clear and would
carry over great distances. The wind had risen, and the day was
being born with a storm. The old man called upon the mother and
sprinkled dried Sage on the fire, sweetening the air in her
honor. She took a cigarette and lit it from the fire tender's
brand. The smoke she exhales is the life she gives. Above her
head, the dawn lightened the tepee flap. The fire was low. She
drew on a cigarette. Its glowing tip was as evanescent as a man's
life, almost aflame one moment, out the next. She prayed and
smoked. </p>

<p> This is the mother who bears the baby, who nurses and cossets
the infant, who rears the child and watches him grow into a young
warrior, drummer, fire tender, or leader, who is possessed by him
and who laments him when he dies. She is indomitable. Warriors
die, but the mother, slave or matriarch, she is always there. Her
voice was low and clear. She dominated the tepee---the mother who
bears and the mother who buries her children. Her prayers were
followed by rumbles of agreement. She reaffirmed the will to
endure, to live on. The worshipers were deeply moved. Frank
whispered to me, &quot;That is how much they respect their
mothers.&quot; But it was more than respect. It was awe. She
conveyed the sorrow of a woman's lot in a destitute people. The
dawn caught the pointed top of the tepee, but below where we were
sitting, the fire was so low that I could hardly see to write. </p>

<p> Mr. Russell whispered to me, &quot;Praying with the
smoke---something good---something lasting forever.&quot; The
Plains Indians were a Dionysian, an apocalyptic people, frugal
but generous; no middle way existed for them---conquerors or
conquered, no in-between, no compromise. The smoke breath was
caught up with the warm air over the fire and twisted up into
dawnlight. It struck me that with another turn of the wheel of
history we Caucasians who, by means of gunpowder and printing,
have gained so much authority in the world, might find ourselves
subject to peoples who possess skills we do not have. No one who
had been with the Indians as I had been could feel superior to
them. The blue-shirted warrior is almost reconciled to living an
unheroic, undionysiac life. It is against his whole being. But
the drumming, the singing, and peyote have worked their magic.
The buffalo are no more; the dawn is coming; there is a life to
face now. </p>

<p> The observed were awake and alert, the observers mostly
sleeping. At six, dawn came to us as the tepee flap was opened.
We had wrestled with the angel. We had grappled with the Heavenly
Father. </p>

<p> Water was poured into the hygienic cups again, and a little
more was put into the drum. I was asked to say a few words, the
stranger whom they had made welcome and allowed to enter into
their mystery. I thanked them for their kindness to me and told
them that I would do my best to tell people about their worship
clearly and honestly. I also said that it would be no easy matter
to convey to those who had not shared our experience and who do
not have the Indian sense of oneness with life. </p>

<p> A child had come into the world again. Dawn lit the stockade,
and the wind was chilly. Life had begun again and must be faced.
The voice of the singers rose clear and high---a child's cry of
delight at buffalo hooves thundering far away. The fire flared a
little as if trying to hold back the morning, but it failed. The
center of the tent floor was covered by a great, grayish-white
half-moon of charred wood ashes. The mother left us. The barrier
of everyday life began to return. </p>

<h5>Aftermath </h5>

<p> The sun was just coming up when we left them at about half
past six. We felt that our Indian hosts would be easier if they
could have their morning feast without us. There were handshakes
and promises that we would do our best to tell our people about
their religion. As I left the tent, I took a last look at the
whitish-gray expanse of the moon altar: the three young men,
including blue-shirt, were singing and drumming together by the
door flap. They were very blithe. Outside, Mr. Nicotine and Mr.
Stone stood by the mother and waved to us as we left. The tepee
seemed too small and frail to have contained so much, but the
drumbeats surged out of it as evidence of the extraordinary power
concentrated there. I slept a little and thought much when I
returned to the hotel. I felt relaxed and happy. I felt that I
had seen the Indians, and what I had seen had cheered me. I wrote
at this time, only a few hours after the ceremony, &quot;We
cannot ape them, but we can learn from them and perhaps gradually
adapt their religion to our needs, as they have adapted
ours---feel tired, at peace, an enlarging of the spirit.&quot; A
little later, on my way back from North Battleford, I noted,
&quot;Peyote simply reveals what is the potential in all of us.
The Indians, whose gifts have for so long been run down by the
whites, have found that in spite of being poor Indians, the
spirit of God is still with them. This is an immense advance. It
is a new hope, a new humility, a new pride.&quot; </p>

<p> A day later I wrote, &quot;Indian singing is incomprehensible
to most white men simply because they have never learnt the fine
discrimination of the Indian in matters of sound. Clearly a
people who have lived in an almost soundless country (and the
prairies are almost soundless to the city ear even now) would
learn to pick up a different range of sounds and would use these
sounds in their music. Grasses, grasshoppers, dust sifting, the
wavelets on little rivers splashing, the shushing of wind among
low bushes, and wind sounds infinitely varied with the seasons.
Then, in great contrast, the very loud sounds---the sounds inside
one, the heart thudding, etc., particularly loud when one is
surrounded by great stillness; hooves stamping or clopping
regularly; the drubbing stampede of the buffalo---again
infinitely varied by terrain and weather, and the crash of
thunder reverberating over the endless prairies. Birds few in
number compared with the space, and therefore all the more
memorable. Color on the prairies in great general masses with
very small changes. The Indians would be used to the very large
and the very small. Also the effect of six months or so of
snow.&quot; </p>

<p> Then there was the matter of the resemblance between liquor
and peyote that has been raised so often in the press. I made a
special note about this: &quot;Alcohol and peyote (psychedelics
generally) are antithetical. Alcohol produces a downward
transcendence, peyote an upward one---the difference between
leveling up and leveling down. Alcohol allows one to relate to
others by being more sure of one's self. This, in small doses, is
much better than not being able to relate at all, but it is a
very precarious business, and selfishness may soon end in
brawling and ill temper. Peyote acts not by emphasizing one's own
self but by expanding it into the selves of others, with a
deepening empathy or in-feeling. The self is dissolved and, in
being dissolved, enriched. It becomes aware of the nobility of
other selves and so of itself.&quot; </p>

<p> I tried repeatedly in the next few months to organize my
experience, but it would not be organized. I carried my notes
around with me and made many drafts of papers that were never
completed, because they did not seem to carry out my obligation
to Frank Takes Gun and my fellow worshipers of that little band.
It was not until three years later, when I was quite unexpectedly
asked to give a short broadcast about the peyote ceremony, that I
began to see how I might be able to convey something of that
night in the tepee to people who had not been there and who had
never taken peyote or other psychedelics. </p>

<p> How does it look three years later? Has the wonder and beauty
of those astonishing ten and a half hours receded so that they
now seem unreal? Did my difficulty in writing about the
experience of that strange night arise from a growing feeling
that my notes were muddled and that I was as muddled as they? I
do not think so. </p>

<p> That night in the tepee has resulted in many studies by my
colleagues and me. We have observed the effects of psychedelic
substances on groups of people taking them together---for various
reasons, we did not use peyote. The Indians have been very
skillful in structuring their ceremony so that it best meets
their needs. They are such masters of symbol, ceremony, and
ritual, that this is hardly surprising. It would be unwise and
impertinent to ape their religion, which developed from their
agony when they lost their hunting grounds at the end of the
nineteenth century. Our needs are very different from theirs. So
we must follow a different route. </p>

<p> We have suggestive evidence that psychedelics, properly used,
can increase communication and understanding between those who
take them together, and this is not simply a drug-induced
delusion. It seems to persist long after the effects of the
chemical have disappeared. This has not yet been proved. Proof in
such a matter is not easy, and so for the moment we have to rely
on personal opinion. We have to find some way of showing these
effects so that they can be easily understood. But we have to
recognize that we are dealing with aspects of the human mind that
are even more elusive and mysterious than the depths of space and
time. </p>

<p> Due to the interest and generosity of Mrs. Eileen Garrett,
President of the Parapsychology Foundation, several of us have
taken part in two international conferences about psychedelics.
One was held in New York in November 1958 and the other in Le
Piol, France, in July 1959. Both these conferences were attended
by scientists of international repute. At both of them there was
general agreement that these experiences induced by psychedelics,
which fall into the category of what William James called
&quot;unhabitual perception,&quot; call for sustained inquiry and
research. It was encouraging that the impetus for these meetings,
which drew contributors from many countries, arose in a frail
tepee raised by members of the Native American Church, mostly
from the Red Pheasant Band, above the South Saskatchewan River
three years ago. </p>

<p> In one respect, however, we have failed, at least so far. We
have not been able to help members of the Native American Church
of Canada to obtain peyote, which is the sacrament of their
faith. Its importation is banned by the federal government
department concerned with these matters, by means of a legal
technicality. So far as we know, this has never been disputed in
a court of law or debated in Parliament. The attitude of
government, &quot;We are doing this for your own good; we can't
explain why because you wouldn't understand,&quot; is
infuriating, unwise, and unnecessary. Among its other objectives,
we hope that this article will lead others to question seriously
such well-meaning but arbitrary attempts to do good. The Native
American Church and the religion its members practice, far from
demoralizing them, is likely to help them in their struggle to
adapt to a very unfamiliar world. </p>

<p> Surely we can be fair-minded enough to pay respectful
attention to this bold attempt by the Indians to develop a new
way of coming closer to the source of all things. They do not
want to convert us to their ways. They do not claim that the
peyote road is the only way of reaching out toward their Great
Spirit and Heavenly Father. In Frank Takes Gun's words, &quot;We
just want to be let alone to worship our God as we wish.&quot;
Must we obstruct and attempt to crush a new religion, which is
beautiful and has never been shown to do any harm, simply because
it is unfamiliar and because we can't imagine that it would work?
Can we not let them tread their peyote road and see what
happens---provided they conduct their services decorously and
account properly for the peyote used? They would, I believe,
welcome observers from time to time. Those observers could see
and experience for themselves the form of worship that the
aboriginal inhabitants of these lands developed when their world
was tottering. The loss of the hunting grounds and the slaughter
of the buffalo was for them an even greater catastrophe than that
appalling event one early morning at Hiroshima in August 1945. </p>

<p> I shall not forget my Indian hosts, who took me back to a
life through which all mankind has passed. A harsh, fierce,
dangerous, passionate life where hunter and hunted are one. A
life rich in beauty and meaning. Little more than eighty years
ago, this was their life and had been so beyond the memory of
man. In a few short, terrible years it was torn from them, and
they are still bewildered at the world in which we are clumsily
trying to find a place for them. But then perhaps we share some
of that bewilderment, for our new world is unimaginably strange.
Should we not join them in their prayer that &quot;. . . the
Universe may prevail&quot;? <br>

<hr>

<p>My thoughts about Peyote are closely interwoven with the
religious context of the Native American Church, the Peyote
religion of the American Indian. In my experiences with this
sacred plant, Indian Peyotists have been my companions. I am
grateful to them for their patience and understanding, and their
willingness to adopt me into their church. Peyote is considered a
holy medicine among members of the church; and it is used with
the utmost respect. The teachings of Peyote go beyond the
confines of the tipi; my experiences sitting by the sacred
fireplace have helped guide my daily life. Peyote ceremonies have
also allowed me the opportunity of being closely associated with
the Sioux, who are quite remote psychically and geographically
from the mainstream of American life&#151;far more remote than
many of us realize. </p>

<p>Most Sioux Peyotists are full-bloods and traditionalists;
their great-grandfathers were buffalo hunters and warriors. They
live in the spacious beauty of a pine and prairie landscape, but
by our economic standards they are distressingly poor. As late as
the early 1970s many Indians in the Pine Ridge country were still
using kerosene lamps. They have retained their native language,
Lakota, and their knowledge of English is limited. Lakota is
spoken throughout the Peyote ceremony. At ceremonies someone has
often interpreted in English for me, but through the years I have
come to understand much of what is said; and much requires no
words. </p>

<p>I attended my first Peyote ceremony in 1964. That eventful
night in a tipi at Wounded Knee was the first of many meetings
and the beginning of my acculturation to the Indian way of life.
Although I was thirty-one in 1964, I was a child in the Peyote
religion. The Sioux have patiently watched me grow up in the
Peyote way, and in their eyes I am now a teenager of sixteen.
They liken their religion to a school; one peyotist has said:
&quot;You learn in here just like at school; it is graded and
becomes easier the farther along you go. &quot; In reference to
my learning, the same man said: &quot;It is good that you are
starting now; you can always learn more from Peyote, but you will
never learn it all.&quot; </p>

<p>Peyotists at Pine Ridge constitute less than 2 percent of the
population (about 15,000 in 1980). The church membership is
growing from within because of an increase of children in Peyote
families, but the number of new members from outside these
families is negligible. The Peyote religion at Pine Ridge is like
a large family: almost everyone knows everyone else. Other
reservations have a much higher percentage of Peyotists: among
the Navajo of the Southwest, about 50 percent. Despite the Sioux
Peyotists' small numbers, they are famous among Peyotists of
other tribes, especially for their songs. Since the Peyote
religion is pan-Indian, members often attend meetings with other
tribes. At one meeting I attended, seven tribes were represented.
Thus for an Indian visiting the reservation of a tribe not his
own, the Native American Church is a home away from home. </p>

<p>Although the Peyote religion is definitely Indian, it includes
some vital Christian elements. Christianity has influenced the
pre-Columbian Peyote religion since the early sixteenth century,
when Spanish friars came to the New World. Peyotists know and
accept the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Jesus; at Peyote
meetings participants often recite the Lord's Prayer, sometimes
in English. Considerable time during ceremonies is devoted to
prayers. Indians are an intensely religious people; their prayers
to God and Jesus come to them easily and naturally. My prayers
are still a little awkward, although as a member of the Native
American Church I have had ample practice. </p>

<p>Next to the prayers, Peyote songs are the most important part
of the ceremony. As each person receives the prayer staff and
musical gourd (rattle), he holds the staff in his left hand and
shakes the gourd with his right. The drummer and other
participants often sing along. These chants, sung with
compassion, create a marvelous world of sound and meaning for
Peyotists like myself, engendering visions, hope, and peace. Some
peyote songs are prayer chants which praise the name of Jesus.
Peyote is often referred to as a sacrament; it is considered a
mediator between God-Jesus and Man. </p>

<p>At Pine Ridge there are two contrasting ceremonial rituals and
organizations of the Native American Church: the traditional
Half-moon ritual and a more Christian version known as the
Cross-fire. The Half-moon ritual is much older and commonly
occurs inter-tribally in the United States; the Cross-fire occurs
chiefly among the Sioux of South Dakota and the Winnebago of
Nebraska and Wisconsin. The leaders (roadmen) of the Cross-fire
group are bona fide ordained clergy who have been appointed by
the High Priest of the organization in the State of South Dakota.
As ordained clergy they are qualified to perform baptisms and
marriages. </p>

<p>In the Half-moon ceremony each participant rolls a prayer
cigarette, which is a surrogate for the peace pipe; sometimes the
Bull Durham tobacco is rolled in a corn shuck. In the Cross- fire
ritual prayer cigarettes are not used; the Bible, which is set
next to the Peyote sacrament and holy altar, replaces the smoke.
At certain times during the Cross-fire ceremony the roadman reads
aloud from the Bible and interprets readings to the congregation
. </p>

<p>Another difference between the two fireplaces is that, at
Half-moon meetings, each participant is allowed to help himself
to the sacrament (generally four spoons of Peyote) each time it
is passed clockwise around the tipi; at Cross-fire meetings a man
stands in front of the participants and hands each of them four
spoons at least the first time the sacrament is sent around. The
roadman decides how many times Peyote should be passed around,
usually three or four. It is sometimes used in powdered form, but
more often as a gravy; an infusion of Peyote tea is also passed.
Although individual members usually attend meetings (ceremonies)
with their own group, they also freely attend the other group's
meetings. Each group has its own cemetery. I like both rituals,
but I have been raised in the Half-moon and prefer it. </p>

<p>The Native American Church is decidedly nationalistic.
Military veterans are granted special honor. Since I am a
veteran, I have the privilege of folding the flag at ceremonies.
The official colors of the church are red, white, and blue,
colors which also appear in the beadwork of religious
paraphernalia; veterans have beadwork designs of the national
flag. At almost all locations where meetings take place there is
a flagpole; the flag is raised on Veterans Day and Memorial Day
and for the funeral or memorial of a member who was a veteran.
The nationalism of the church is partly attributable to its
pan-Indian organization; it also reflects the fact that the
government recognizes the Peyote religion and allows the Indians
to practice it freely. But the military character of the Native
American Church may also be a continuation of the old warrior
society, which retains high prestige among the Indians. </p>

<p>Women were formerly excluded from the ceremony, except for
Peyote Woman, the roadman's wife. She came into the tipi in the
morning, bringing morning food and water over which she prayed as
a symbol of Mother Earth. It was not until the 1950s that women
in general started attending Peyote ceremonies at Pine Ridge. One
reason for their original exclusion was the Indian taboo against
allowing women near any medicine during their menses. It is still
considered dangerous to the health and life of anyone taking
Indian medicine, such as Peyote, to be in proximity to a woman
who is menstruating or has just given birth; thus, women during
these times respectfully stay away from meetings. Recently, a
woman who had just had a child ignored warnings and entered a
Peyote meeting; all the men at the meeting became violently ill,
and many of them vomited. </p>

<p>Aside from these two prohibitions, Sioux women today not only
freely attend meetings, but sit next to their spouses and
sometimes even sing Peyote songs. Indian women of other tribes
also attend meetings, but they tend to sit together, and they do
not sing. Sioux women are liberated women compared with their
sisters of other tribes. Yet the Peyote ceremony still remains a
man's world; the political organization and the ceremonial are
run by men, and men predominate in numbers. Children accompany
their parents to Peyote ceremonies; the family worship is
healthy. Children begin to take medicine ritually when they
become teenagers. </p>

<p>There is no single reason that a person is drawn to the Peyote
religion. Some take refuge in the church as a last resort to cure
a sickness after the white man's medicine fails. Some start
attending meetings out of sheer curiosity, and some want to
escape the monotony of reservation life. Many come because they
have heard that the Native American Church is a place where one
can talk to God and feel His presence. They have heard that
Peyote can change minds, habits, and lives for the better, or
that Peyote can bring happiness to man in this life. The actions,
words, and morals of Peyotists themselves have been positive
living examples to the Indian people. Another attraction is the
close fellowship of Peyote meetings. </p>

<p>Members of the Native American Church do not proselytize, nor
do they criticize other churches or beliefs; they prefer to live
unnoticed. But some Indians object to Peyote, the ceremony, and
the people connected with it. A few of these critics are
traditionalists who follow the old peace pipe religion of their
grandfathers and see the Peyote religion as a foreign intrusion
from Mexico. The major diffusion center of the Peyote religion
was Oklahoma, and tribes such as the Kiowa and Comanche were its
major disseminators. It did not arrive at Pine Ridge until some
time between 1904 and 1912. </p>

<p>Some Sioux Peyotists participate in ancestral rituals with the
peace pipe, such as the vision quest and sun dance, but I know of
no traditional medicine man who has become a Peyotist. Indian
alcoholics are especially fearful and critical of Peyote. They
sneeringly refer to Peyotists as &quot;cactus eaters. &quot; One
alcoholic told me, in a malignant tone of voice, that Peyote was
&quot;snake juice.&quot; One reason alcoholics tend to fear
Peyote is their knowledge that Peyote conquers the alcohol in a
person's body and pushes that poison out of his system; he would
thus suffer physically and mentally through an all-night
ceremony. But the alcoholic generally refuses to admit that his
recovery to sobriety and awareness may be the beginning of a new
life . </p>

<p>The Peyote road is the path chosen by members of the church.
In the imagery of some Peyotists, two roads diverge at a
junction. The profane road, paved and wide, with its worldly
passions and temptations, is considered to be an unholy road
which leads to trouble. The alternative is the Peyote road, a
narrow unpaved path surrounded by a wilderness of pristine
beauty. All Peyotists travel this way, but each must journey
alone, for it is the road of one's own life and wisdom. In the
Christian sense, it is the road to salvation. Ethically, it is a
path of sobriety (a major step for most Indians), industry, care
of the family, and brotherly love. Its symbol is a narrow groove
on top of a crescent-shaped earthen altar that encircles the west
end of the fireplace. Rather than a straight and narrow path, it
is a curved path all the way, but the curve on the crescent altar
is constant, never-varying, and so in a sense straight. The road
has not been easy for me, nor was it meant to be. Peyotists say
that up to the mid-mark of human life the Peyote road is uphill.
This is indicated by the earthen altar, which slopes up to the
center of the crescent, where the Peyote chief which is a
specially shaped Peyote plant placed on the altar by the leader
of the ceremony is set. To reach the downhill side of the Peyote
chief one has to go through (accept) Peyote, for it is considered
impossible to go around or over the sacred plant placed on top of
the altar. The downhill road symbolizes the latter half of one's
life, the easier half. </p>

<p>Those early years of my uphill journey were difficult because
of my preoccupation with death. This morbid obsession began when
I attended my third Peyote meeting. Several people present were
ill, and I feared the spread of disease by the communal sharing
of the spoon to eat Peyote and the cup to drink Peyote tea. Two
voices within me began to talk about my death, one stressing its
reality and the other constantly agreeing; the voice-exchange
continued until my awareness of death became intense. I had been
asleep to my death for thirty-one years; it now became an
intimate reality. At a meeting that I attended, a wise elderly
Peyotist said, &quot;You can see yourself in this fireplace; you
can see what kind of man you are. If you accept what you see, you
will be all right and stay in this religion; if you don't accept
what you see, you will never come back. &quot; More than one man
attending a meeting has thought himself attending his own
funeral; he believed that he saw his own body being brought into
the tipi instead of the morning food&#151;the church became for
him a funeral parlor. After such an experience, he may or may not
want to return to the Peyote religion. That night I arrived at
the junction and chose the Peyote road, which included the risk
of sickness and the anguish of mental torment. Yet, in the sense
that &quot;many are called, but few are chosen,&quot; Peyotists
say that &quot;Peyote chooses you, you don't choose it.&quot; </p>

<p>After that traumatic night I was aware of death every day for
a period of about 3 years. It was not an absorbing fixation, but
it was a daily reminder, my Dark Night of the Soul. I was often
awakened to the image of a black whiplash across my back and the
words resounding in my ears: &quot;You are some day going to
die.&quot; At a Peyote meeting, when I told the members of my
concern about death, one of the leaders stood up and said that I
was off to a good beginning in the Peyote way. During a meeting 3
years later I simply became aware that it was useless worrying
about the inevitable. To be uneasy is the original derivation of
the word disease; my anxiety and worry (uncertainty) about my
certain death was a disease. Perhaps there is in each of us a
level where the knowledge of our own death is so strange that it
comes as a shock. </p>

<p>The ceremonies not only exposed me to the unknown, but allowed
me an insight into Sioux psychology and culture, which is so
different from ours in many ways. Thanks to Peyote I have become
acquainted with the genius of the Sioux mind; it has been a
powerful catalyst in overcoming ethnocentric barriers. Peyote
magnified individual personalities and cultural differences in a
complementary manner, and showed what we all had in common as
human beings. During their meetings, which lasted from 12 to 15
hours, I respectfully followed the ceremonial rules of
conduct&#151;the Indian way. The ingestion of Peyote helped us to
endure the all- night ceremony and the socializing during the
following day. Alone and decidedly outnumbered, I absorbed their
culture under the aegis and power of Peyote. Although each
meeting was a culture-shock to my nervous system, my
acculturation was gradual rather than abrupt; it was a slow
blood-transfusion of cultural transformation. </p>

<p>After attending several Peyote ceremonies I started noticing a
change in my mannerisms. Especially noticeable was a change in my
body movements and gestures; my way of speaking and voice quality
also altered. My sense of humor and values became more
recognizable among the Sioux than among people of my own culture.
Sometimes I found myself willingly imitating the Sioux men I most
admired; at other times I passively observed those same strong
personalities controlling my actions and mannerisms. More than
once during a ceremony I suddenly felt as though I had left my
body, passing into a person sitting across from me and looking
through his eyes at me. I have often wondered whether that person
simultaneously had the same experience, but Peyotists rarely
comment on their visions and appear uninterested when I tell them
of mine. They generally refrain from telling anyone what they
have learned, especially their deepest mystical experiences; they
say that Peyote teaches each person differently. </p>

<p>As the Peyote religion and the Sioux became more important in
my life, I began feeling more distant from my own culture, which
appeared increasingly shallow, meaningless, aggressively
acquisitive, and boastfully noisy. I was more comfortable with
the Indians, who are a quiet, refined, and soft-spoken people;
their slower pace of life was more restful to my mind, and their
subtle sense of humor, especially Peyote humor, was a joy.
Indians love to joke even when the joke is on them, but there is
no scorn in their joking. Peyote humor is partly a play on words,
especially English words which are relatively new to the Indian;
they enjoy the fact that many different English words have the
same sound, and that different-sounding words have the same
meaning. </p>

<p>At the close of a Peyote ceremony, an elderly Indian was
explaining the difference between the southern and northern
Arapahoe language. He used English words for his example:
&quot;Where the southern Arapahoe would say 'match,' the northern
Arapahoe would say. . . ?&quot; He couldn't think of the cognate
word, so a member looked up and said &quot;lighter.&quot; Such
humor and laughter is encouraged after the ordeal of an all-night
ceremony. Often their humorous stories have a sober message; an
example is the tale of the &quot;monkey in the fireplace,&quot;
which warns against treating the ceremony as play. The story is
as follows: &quot;No monkey business allowed in this fireplace,
but everything is in this fireplace, so the monkey must be in
there too. This engineer on the railroad had a monkey who watched
everything he did. The engineer stopped the train and went in the
depot to get a cup of coffee. When he heard the toot-toot
outside, he ran out and saw the monkey taking this train down the
track. Hey, this monkey was really having fun. He was driving the
train just like a man. He was really driving that train fast. He
missed the curve and the train went off the track, but the
monkey, he jumped out of the window and grabbed hold of a tree
and was saved. He watched the train go into the ditch.&quot; </p>

<p>We both laughed; then he became serious and said: &quot;But
all the people and children on the train were killed. That's the
way the monkey is: if the man don't watch close, he will miss the
curve; the monkey, he's a monkey.&quot; Then this Indian Peyotist
slowly pointed to the fireplace and said: &quot;That monkey will
kill you if you don't watch him; no monkey business allowed in
this fireplace.&quot; Symbolically, this story indicates that if
you are careless on the curve of the Peyote road, you will fall
from the altar and burn up in the fireplace. </p>

<p>Through Peyote I have acquired many Indian friends and adopted
relatives. In particular, I became quite close to my adopted
brother, Silas, an Omaha-Ponca Indian who lived among the Sioux
for many years. He was a leader of the Peyote ceremony, an
official of the church, and a man of great charm and spiritual
power. He was about 20 years older than I, a wiser brother.
Together, we spent much time visiting and attending Peyote
meetings. He had been raised in the Peyote tradition, and he
taught me much about that tradition and about the good life. For
instance, he taught me the need for humility before entering the
tipi to pray. To attend a meeting with a know-it-all attitude,
that of a &quot;big shot,&quot; will usually cause suffering
throughout the night. He said: &quot;Over there are some tall
weeds that are now bent by the cold. That's what Peyote can do to
a man who thinks he knows everything. Peyote will bend him down
and turn him inside out. &quot; I have seen that happen since and
I know that his analogy was accurate. </p>

<p>Because of his vast experience and clear, quick mind, he was
always several steps ahead of me. I shall never forget that when
I told him I thought Peyote was good, his answer was: &quot;You
say that Peyote is good; what's good about it?&quot; No one has
satisfactorily answered his question. Once when Silas had a
ruptured hernia, a few Peyote boys helped him through to health.
They prayed, drummed, and sang through the night, and they
spoon-fed Silas about 150 Peyote. He was well by morning; the
ambulance returned to the hospital without him. </p>

<p>Silas told me of his vision when he ate that large amount of
Peyote: &quot;Brother George, I had so much Peyote in me that
when I raised up from the bed the Peyote would come up my throat
to my mouth. While the boys were drumming and singing I suddenly
got out of bed opened the door and went outside; a short distance
from the house was a large hill. I walked to the hill and saw a
shiny new ladder going all the way to the top. I climbed the
ladder to the top of the hill. I looked around, everything up
there was so beautiful. The air was clean and fresh; there were
all kinds of pretty colored flowers. When I looked back to the
ladder it was old and broken; many rungs were missing. Since I
had no way of getting back down, I decided to enjoy where I was;
later I looked back at the ladder and it was once again a shiny
new ladder. I finally climbed down the ladder and walked back to
the house. The people in the house looked very sad. I walked up
to the bed and looked down at the man lying on the bed; he had
his eyes closed and looked rested. I saw that the man on the bed
was myself. I then lay down to rest. When I awoke my sickness was
gone. The large hill was a hill of Peyote, all those Peyote
represented my sins. The top of the hill was paradise.&quot;
Although Silas often ate large amounts of Peyote, he told me that
if a person is in the right spirit &quot;just a taste of Peyote
on the tip of your tongue is enough. &quot; </p>

<p>At meetings, Silas was a strict disciplinarian. At a house
meeting in winter I fell unconscious from the lack of oxygen. The
one-room log house was sealed airtight; it was crowded and
stuffy. There was no air circulation; the fireman had brought in
a large pan filled with live coals which further heated an
already hot room. Silas was sitting next to me. When I fell
unconscious, I dropped my pheasant-feathered fan on the floor. I
was revived about 10 minutes later. The first thing Silas said to
me was, &quot;Pick up your fan!&quot; A few minutes later I told
Silas that I believed the reason for my passing out was that the
live coals were eating up the oxygen. He agreed, but nothing was
done about it. Under the influence of Peyote, the loss of
consciousness was especially meaningful. I felt as though I had
died; the darkness of unconsciousness came before I realized what
was about to happen. I wondered whether death would be like that,
quicker than conscious thought. A tall, quiet Arapahoe man
revived me; I saw him clearly before I could hear any sound, and
it was about a minute before I could hear. I went outside in the
bitter cold to get some fresh air. The Arapahoe man walked up to
me and said: &quot;You are doing all right in this Peyote way,
but don't be in a hurry; take your time. &quot; Several days
later, a leader in the Peyote religion who had heard about my
fainting said: &quot;I heard that Peyote finally caught up with
you.&quot; </p>

<p>I write of Silas in the past tense because he died in 1973.
Visiting his blood relations, the Omahas of eastern Nebraska, is
the closest I can come to being with him. In their eyes I am a
welcomed relative who has come home. Whenever I attend a Peyote
meeting, especially among his own people, he is close to me.
Although all tribes have essentially the same Peyote ritual,
there are variations which are highly important in the minds of
the Indians. Each tribe has its language and culture; each has
its own style; each has its own genius. At my first birthday
meeting among the Omahas, I said that since I was familiar with
the Sioux way, they could continue singing while I prayed with a
prayer cigarette during the main smoke. The Omahas looked
startled; the air seemed electrified by the cultural
transgression. After a silence which seemed to last an eternity,
Henry, the leader and my adopted nephew through Silas, said:
&quot;Uncle George, we will pick up these instruments (musical
instruments) again when you are finished with your prayer; that's
the way we do it here, so that's the way it is going to be, Uncle
George.&quot; </p>

<p>Although I continued to live and work within my own culture,
my heart, spirit, and mind resided with the Peyote religion and
the Indians. Thus, I lived in two worlds&#151;physically among my
own people, emotionally among the Indians. Living within an
hour's drive from the reservation allowed me easy access to the
source of my emotional life. Because of the increasing ease and
frequency with which I went back and forth, my image of the
reservation's entrance and exit was that of a swinging door. As I
felt an increasing need to be on the reservation, I began
attending more meetings and visiting more often. All of us
Peyotists needed emotional support as an integral part of group
solidarity and the fellowship of a community of seekers. The
social group using Peyote became as important to me as the plant
and its powers. Whatever their age, Peyotists are endearingly
called &quot; Peyote boys . &quot; They are a brotherhood of
seekers who are youthful in spirit and attitudes, in their
curiosity and willingness to learn. </p>

<p>As my cultural metamorphosis became less detectable to myself,
it became more obvious among friends and relatives of my own
culture. Yet I could never become fully Indian. A Peyotist made
this clear to me by saying: &quot;This way helps us to become
more Indian and it helps you to be more like George Morgan.
&quot; At first Peyote enabled me to see the Indians as I wanted
to see them: in an idealizing light. But eventually I learned
from Peyote that their culture had its own snags and
contradictions, and my view became more balanced. In time, Peyote
aided me in understanding and respecting my own culture. For
instance, Indians have a sharing culture; we do not. Peyote
helped me to understand the advantages and pitfalls of sharing.
Of course, any discerning mind might in time come to the same
understandings; one does become wiser with age. With Peyote too
it takes time to learn about life and cultural differences;
wisdom cannot be hurried . </p>

<p>By reconciling the opposed cultural values in my mind, I
diminished their hypnotic influence and escaped the clutching
grip of ethnicity. An identity crisis ended: the tenuous swinging
door vanished; I stepped out of both cultures and took a deep
breath of fresh air in a cultural void. I could now enjoy both
cultures, and I could move freely and safely through them. To
arrive at this point along the Peyote road took me years of
relentless effort . </p>

<p>The Peyote religion also advanced my formal education. One
morning as I sat by the sacred fireplace I felt an urgent desire
to journey to the land where Peyote grows and study the plant's
environment and trade channels. That impulse was prompted by
substantial price increases for the plant and occasional supply
shortages which troubled the Indians. My university training in
geography and plant ecology had prepared me to study the
biogeography and economic history of Peyote. As there was a gap
in the literature, I decided that this study would become my
doctoral dissertation, and I felt that the knowledge gained from
it would help Peyotists to secure a dependable supply in the
future. I spent several months over a period of 2 years in the
Texas brush country studying Peyote. I learned about the plant's
life cycle, habitat, growth rates, and geographic range past and
present. I also studied the history of Peyote trade between the <i>Peyoteros</i>
(a group of Spanish-American Peyote traders) and the Indians. </p>

<p>I sincerely believe that Peyote guided me in this study, for I
met no obstacles in seeking information about a delicate and
somewhat secretive subject. I also believe that Peyote protected
me from harm in the rattlesnake-infested thorn brushes. The
details of my study are too complicated to relate here, but the
thesis is of value in understanding the present problems of
Peyote supply and how they arose. If Indians make the effort, as
they surely will, there should be a dependable supply for their
needs in the future. In a strange way I feel as if Peyote
selected me to do that study, for other Peyotists with artistic
talent have been inspired through Peyote to paint religious
paintings connected with the ceremony; others have done beautiful
beadwork. </p>

<p>I would not casually suggest to anyone that he attend a Peyote
ceremony. It is difficult to sit through an all-night ceremony.
And Peyote is not easy to swallow: it is extremely bitter, even
to experienced Peyotists, and occasionally nauseating, especially
for beginners. A person of sincere intent would be welcome: it is
a church. He would find hospitality: Peyotists are courteous and
respectful. But it is well to remember that Peyote is not a
plaything; Peyotists say that &quot;if you play around with
Peyote, it will turn around and start playing with you. &quot;
The Native American Church is not for the curiosity seeker: it is
a serious religion. </p>

<p>The Peyote road has shown me many wonders, and I believe it is
the same for other Peyotists. I shall continue to follow that
adventurous path, that sublime way of life. </p>

<h2>The History of Peyotism in Nevada</h2>

<h3>OMER C. STEWART</h3>

<h4>from <i>Nevada Historical Society Quarterly, Vol 25 No 3,
1982</i></h4>
</center>

<hr>

<p> USING ONLY THE TRADITIONAL methods of history, which heavily
depend on published or unpublished written records, or
ethnography, which rely on data collected by interviews with
native informants and knowledge obtained by participant
observation, would leave a very incomplete and distorted picture
of Peyotism in Nevada Notwithstanding the fact that Peyotists
have always been a small minority in the total Nevada Indian
population, they have become known world-wide and provide
examples of a number of the peculiar circumstances connected with
the whole history of the Peyote religion in the New World.
Involved in that history is the nature of the unusual, small,
spineless cactus called by the Aztecs <i>Peyotl</i>, Peyote by
the Spanish, Mexicans and Indians in the area of its abundant
growth along the Rio Grande in south Texas and northern Mexico,
and by botanists named <i>Lophophora williamsii</i> (Lemaire) <i>Coulter</i>.
Also important is the strong American tradition whereby some
citizens try to legislate against behavior of which they
disapprove, exemplified by the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution which prohibited use of alcohol. The history of
Peyotism in Nevada is incomprehensible if not placed in the
national context. </p>

<p> In October of 1937 I learned of the presence of the Peyote
religion in Nevada during a conversation with Washoes Ben
Lancaster and Sam Dick, following our participation in a Peyote
meeting in Randlett, Utah, on the Uintah and Ouray Ute
reservation. It was known by officials of the Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) that Lancaster had started to hold Peyote
ceremonies among the Washo in October 1936, only a few months
after my first ethnographic research in the area I did my field
research for a Ph.D. thesis in the fall of 1938. </p>

<p> My ethnohistorical studies in recent years allow me to
reconstruct an outline of the history of Peyote in Nevada before
the return of Lancaster as a Peyote proselytizer. Christian
missionaries and BIA officials announced their opposition to
Peyotism when it was first discovered in Oklahoma in 1886, and
they continued that opposition actively until John Collier became
Indian commissioner in 1933. Until Collier, the BIA and
missionary societies both collected data on Peyotism and
disseminated reports throughout Indian country to combat it. The
process of data collection itself spread knowledge. For example,
the earliest documents on Peyote in Nevada were copies of three
letters sent to BIA agents in Stewart, Fallon and Owyhee in 1916.
These I found in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. The
tone of the inquiry suggests danger and opposition. For example,
&quot;Please let me have a report from you immediately, giving
the number of Indians addicted to its use, and the extent and
frequency of its use. Who are the leaders? Where do they get
their supply from, and how? What is the effect on the users as
shown by your own observations and from reports of employees,
missionaries, and others . . . What is physical condition of
users . . .&quot; The letter was signed Chief Special Officer,
i.e. detective, of the BIA. </p>

<p> The next reference to Peyote in Nevada is the state statute
regulating the Sale and Use of Poison, Section 5082, paragraph 8,
which added &quot;anhalonium (peyote or mescal button)&quot; in
February 1917 as a substance prohibited except on prescription. I
have found only one hint of local Nevada influence to bring about
that anti-Peyote amendment. In a 1922 letter from the agent of a
Crow reservation to the BIA during his campaign to have an
anti-Peyote law passed in Montana, Agent C. H. Asbury wrote to
the Commissioner: &quot;I had something to do with getting
special legislation against the use of certain drugs in Nevada
and I found no particular difficulty in having the proper words
inserted in the law.&quot; Asbury had been the Indian Agent at
the Duck Valley reservation for a number of years until
transferred in the fall of 1916. National forces against Peyote
may have been important in Nevada at that time, as they were in
Utah and Colorado where Peyote was outlawed also in February
1917. </p>

<p> The next mention of Peyote in Nevada is in a report of
Special Agent Dorrington dated May 12-13, 1917. Surprisingly, it
refers to Jack Wilson, the Messiah and originator of the Ghost
Dance of the 1890s. Wrote Dorrington: </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>Use of peyote and mescal</i>. There is absolutely no
    evidence indicating that either peyote or mescal is used on
    the reservations or that the Indians know anything about it .
    . . Jack Wilson resides in Mason Valley . . . He is the
    'Messiah' and the originator of the 'Ghost Dance'. He appears
    to attract but little attention from Indians in this locality
    but apparently has considerable influence among distant
    tribes and he seemingly keeps in close touch with them; that
    he is corresponding with certain individuals in Montana,
    South Dakota, Wyoming and Oklahoma . . . It is further
    learned that even delegations have paid him a visit . . . He
    is also known as a 'medicine man' and practices some among
    his people, but most of his time is believed to be spent
    visiting the distant and more prosperous tribes and
    individuals from whom he procures large sums of money . . .
    Jack Wilson is a very dignified and striking Indian . . .
    From all accounts he has always been friendly with whites . .
    . A recent picture of Jack, taken by myself, is attached. It
    cost me the sum of one dollar, that is Jack made a 'touch'
    for that amount after the picture had been taken . . . After
    careful inquiry I am satisfied that Jack Wilson does not use
    peyote or mescal, nor has he encouraged its use by others . .
    . he is very temperate in his habits . . . he is constantly
    advising the Indians to abstain from the use of all drugs and
    intoxicants. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> The next important BIA document prepared and widely
disseminated nationwide was shown to me by missionaries and
officials when I was studying Washo-Northern Paiute Peyotism in
1938. It was a thirty-eight page pamphlet prepared by Dr. Robert
E. L. Newberne, <i>Peyote, An Abridged Compilation from the Files
of the Bureau of Indian Affairs</i>, published in 1922. Newberne
summarized historical information on Peyote starting with Spanish
padres, and presented anti- Peyote reports of American
missionaries to the Indians. He included samples of data
collected in 1919 by means of a twenty-one item questionnaire
sent to Indian service employees such as agents, physicians,
farmers, field matrons, directors of Indian schools and sectarian
missionaries. Three hundred and two answers were received in
Washington, D.C. from 116 Indian agencies, for which 87,
including 6 located in Nevada, reported no use of Peyote. The
Nevada Indian population was listed at 10,854 and included no
known Peyotists. </p>

<p> From interviews with Indians in 1938 I learned of a Sioux
Indian Peyote missionary, named Sam Lone Bear. Lone Bear had been
proselytizing since 1914 in Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. He
conducted Peyote rituals at Fallon and Pyramid Lake during
several months in the summer of 1929. His success at
&quot;doctoring&quot; attracted participants to his Peyote
meeting at Nixon, Nevada, from as far away as McDermitt, Nevada,
and Bishop, California. Lone Bear made his headquarters with Joe
Green, a well-known and respected Paiute medicineman residing on
the Pyramid Lake Reservation. In 1938 Joe told me of his
conversion to Peyotism notwithstanding his being an active and
convinced Episcopalian, and also a practicing shaman. He had no
difficulties being simultaneously a leader in three religions, a
situation I have found repeatedly among Indian Peyotists. </p>

<p> In 1929 Sam Lone Bear used the name Leo Old Coyote (which I
heard as Leo O'Kio) in Nevada because he was trying to avoid
being arrested under a federal warrant for violation of the Mann
Act. He was arrested in 1932, tried, and sentenced to three years
in the federal prison at McNeil Island, Washington, but was
paroled in two years. On his way home he stopped at Fallon,
Nevada, and courted Mamie Charley, the sister of a Shoshone he
had converted in 1929. Sam and Mamie were married in South Dakota
and lived on Sam's allotment on Lone Bear Creek, Pine Ridge
Reservation, until he died on February 5, 1937. </p>

<p> No Nevada Indians learned how to obtain Peyote or acquired
the equipment and knowledge to conduct Peyote ceremonies from Sam
Lone Bear. Consequently no Peyote meetings were held in western
Nevada until about 1932 when a Ute Peyotist named Ralph
Kochampanaskin, usually called Raymond Lone Bear, married a Washo
and settled in Minden. One of his followers was Sam Dick, an
active old-fashioned Washo medicine man. After an initial
success, Ralph lost his following because he failed to live up to
the non-drinking rule of the Peyote religion. </p>

<p> During my interviewing in the fall of 1938 at the Indian
School near Carson City a woman from Owyhee, Nevada, told me that
Peyotism was introduced to the Duck Valley Reservation from Fort
Hall, Idaho, years before, but she could give me no details.
Later I found a 1939 letter from Owyhee in which the Indian Agent
reported that members of the tribal council agreed Peyote was
first used during a curing ceremony at Duck Valley in 1915.
During my first field work in Fallon in 1936, my Northern Paiute
interpreter praised the Peyote religion; I learned in 1938 that
he had been converted during a visit to Fort Hall in 1920. Since
then he had traveled regularly to other states to attend Peyote
meetings but had not introduced the ceremonies to his people in
Nevada. </p>

<p> Jim Street, a Shoshone living in Fallon, told me in 1938 that
he had been converted to Peyotism on the Gosllute reservation at
Ibapah, Utah, in 1932, hut had not attended any more Peyote
rituals until shortly before I interviewed him. </p>

<p> It is evident that the Indians of Nevada had gained
considerable experience and heard many rumors about Peyote before
Ben Lancaster firmly established the religion among the Washo and
Paiute of western Nevada. It is Lancaster's ceremony which
attracted the support of about 300 of the 2257 Indians in the
area. It is now appropriate to describe the Peyote ritual of
Lancaster and to summarize some of his teachings. It should be
said at the outset that the Washo- Northern Paiute rituals I
observed in 1938 were nearly identical to the rituals I had seen
among the Ute a year earlier; these Ute rituals closely
paralleled ones observed by anthropologists in Oklahoma and
elsewhere who supplied me information for a 265 item comparative
table published as part of my thesis. </p>

<p> A canvas tipi is the most desirable place to conduct the
Peyote ritual, but I attended services with the Washo and Paiute
in a canvas walled &quot;corral&quot; and at regular residences.
Before the participants assemble, a sand crescent altar about
four inches high and four feet long is constructed on the west
side of the meeting place. A fire is laid on a protective mound
or on the ground east of the altar. At dusk the congregation
meets at the entrance on the east side of the structure where the
leader, called the roadman, prays to Jesus, God, Mary and Peyote
for guidance during the ritual and for health and wisdom
throughout life. When the devotees enter, they always move
clockwise to find seats. They follow the same pattern whenever
leaving or entering. Four officials direct the ceremony &#151;
the roadman, chief drummer, and cedarman, who are seated on
blankets on the ground west of the altar, and the fireman or
doorman just inside the entrance. The normal equipment consists
of a water drum, bird-tail feather fans, gourd rattles, a staff,
dried Peyote, or Peyote tea, Bull Durham tobacco, and a
large-size Peyote button to place on the altar. The equipment is
incensed in cedar smoke at the beginning. After all pray through
Bull Durham cigarette smoke, the roadman passes clockwise the
sack of Peyote buttons. Each adult participant takes four
buttons, the ceremonial number, to prayerfully eat. Then the
roadman kneels and holds the three-foot staff and a fan in his
left hand. He shakes the rattle and sings four hymns, in which he
is accompanied by the chief drummer. Each male participant in
turn receives the paraphernalia, and sings while accompanied on
the drum by his neighbor to the right. The singing, drumming and
praying continue until dawn except for a midnight recess and
water drinking. At dawn. a ceremonial meal of water, fruit, meat,
and maize is blessed and passed clockwise; all present take four
spoonfuls of the food and four sips of the water. The water from
the dismantled drum is poured on the sand altar and the ceremony
ends. Women of the congregation prepare a ball(banquet which is
usually eaten about noon, and then members return to their homes.
</p>

<p> With the Peyote plant, dried with the appearance of home
dried peaches, Nevada Indians acquired beliefs and attitudes
about the bitter-tasting cactus which have been associated with
it since they were recorded by early Spanish explorers in Mexico
in the 1500s. Peyote itself is sacred, they emphasize, and has
many powers to help mankind. It is also a messenger to
supernatural powers, now usually named God and Jesus. When eaten
and prayed to in the proper ritual context, Peyote helps cure all
diseases and reveals many things: the location of lost objects or
persons, future events, and proper behavior, among others. Peyote
protects from the evil intentions of witches. It brings knowledge
for proper living, which includes avoiding alcoholic beverages
and always acting according to strict Christian ethics &#151; to
love your wife and children and kin, be patriotic and law
abiding, and to respect authority, God and elders. </p>

<p> When asked why they supported the Peyote religion, devotees
cited the success of Peyotists in curing. In tracing the history
of Peyotism in Nevada from the mid 1930s to the mid 1970s, one
discovers the interplay of a number of individuals, first the
Indians and BIA officials, then state and local authorities and
the general public. From the public emerged a few citizens who
actively opposed Peyotism and some who defended it. Christian
missionaries and their supporters disputed with Peyote religion
sympathizers, such as anthropologists and members of the American
Civil Liberties Union. </p>

<p> Lancaster and his rituals soon came under opposition by both
civil and religious authorities, but of course an awareness of
Peyotism and opposition to it was present in Nevada when it was
prohibited by law in 1917. Alida C. Bowler, Superintendent of the
Carson Indian Agency, reported to the BIA that she was suspicious
that Lancaster was a dope peddler. About three months later, the
Reverend S. R. Dunlop, a Baptist missionary to the Washo,
reported that Lancaster, in order to defend himself and Peyotism,
was saying that Commissioner John Collier's son Donald had
participated in Peyote rituals. (Donald Collier had attended a
Peyote meeting with the Kiowa in 1935.) Bowler maintained her
suspicions until she left the Nevada Indian Service at the end of
1939. For three years, BIA detectives kept an intermittent watch
on Lancaster, and his car was searched several times as he passed
the Nevada California state line. Samples of materials in his car
were chemically analysed for Bowler and instead of the morphine
she suspected, Lancaster was transporting ground Peyote and
sagebrush. </p>

<p> A number of Indians reacted to the Peyote religion as Joe
Green did, that is by adding it to their lives but still
maintaining the Christian denomination they followed, and
continuing to call on Indian medicine men from time to time. The
majority of the Indians rejected Peyotism, however. In April a
delegation of Washo presented a petition to Bowler requesting
that Peyote meetings be stopped. The Indian opponents used the
same arguments as the whites &#151; &quot;Peyote kills&quot;
&#151; while converts said Peyote saves. </p>

<p> While organizing the data I accumulated at the Carson Indian
Agency and trying to acquire a firmer basis to judge Miss
Bowler's opinion that Ben Lancaster was not a proper Peyotist, I
wrote to Mack Haag, President of the Native American Church
(NAC), a Cheyenne residing in Calumet, Oklahoma. He replied that
he knew Lancaster well and that &quot;he is well qualified&quot;
to start Peyote meetings in Nevada. </p>

<p> Inasmuch as the BIA in Washington in 1937 successfully
opposed an attempt to enact a national Peyote prohibition, and
replaced the antiPeyote pamphlet by Newberne (published in 1922)
with a mimeographed report favorable to Peyote entitled
&quot;Documents on Peyote,&quot; a new and widely publicized
campaign against the NAC which developed in Nevada in 1940 is
surprising. Accounts of these efforts, which resembled some of
those used in 1937 and 1938 which I evaluated in my Ph.D. thesis,
were recovered from the National Archives. Newspaper reports from
Nevada dated May 1940 contained opinions that several deaths had
occurred because Indians took Peyote in Lancaster's rituals. The
coroners' verdicts were that the deceased suffered from advanced
stages of tuberculosis before they attended the NAC ceremonies. </p>

<p> Opponents were not convinced and had reinserted into Nevada's
narcotics law a prohibition against Peyote in February 1941.
Under provisions of the amended law, Lancaster was arrested in
Reno in October 1941. A full account of his arrest and the people
who brought it about appeared in a half-page article in,
surprisingly, the New York <i>Sunday News</i> of November 30,
1941. The item, special to the News&quot;, included a photograph
of Ben Lancaster and one of Dr. Charles Lee Tranter, a
neurologist, with the caption &quot;Tranter....and Malcolm
Easterlin, attorney, who are leading movement to outlaw use of
peyote, 'Sacred mushroom of the Aztecs', among Indians of the
West, asserting addiction is spreading.&quot; The article
outlined a campaign against Peyote very reminiscent of those
which took place from 1914 to 1937 to support bills introduced in
Congress to prohibit Peyote. The <i>News</i> article reported: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Lancaster's arrest came at the end of a long
    investigation. The official finger was put on him by the Rev.
    Samuel R. Dunlop....Baptist missionary ...The Rev. Dunlop has
    been in Nevada since 1935, having come from Wisconsin where
    he administered to the Winnebago, who also used peyote.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While he [Lancaster] was gathering a congregation around
    him, the whites were observing with more and more alarm the
    growing use of peyote. Chief among these were Dr. Charles Lee
    Tranter. . .who heads the Association for Prevention of
    Peyotism, and Malcolm Easterlin, New York and Washington
    attorney. Also active is Representative Frances Bolton (R-
    Ohio), who is a member of the Indian Affairs Committee.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p> The article stated that Commissioner Collier had said that
Peyote as used in Indian ceremonies is not habit forming and not
harmful. </p>

<p> Also in 1941 an article appeared in <i>Scribner's Commentator</i>
(Vol. 11, pp. 77-82) with the title ''Peyote &#151; Indian
Problem No. 1,&quot; I)y Malcolm Easterlin. It started with a
disparaging evaluation of Commissioner Collier and then presented
a short history of Peyote; it faulted him for opposing the
anti-Peyote legislation Easterlin conveyed the impression that
only Collier had opposed laws to prohibit Peyote, whereas while
he was in office he worked against only one bill to outlaw
Peyote. Eight earlier similar hills had been sponsored by the BIA
from 1916 to 1926 hut were rejected by Congress. Easterlin
praised Dr. Tranter and accused Ben Lancaster of doping Indians
in order to get all of their money. </p>

<p> On March 17, 1942, Judge William McKnight dismissed the
charges against Lancaster on a legal technicality &#151; the 1941
legislature had voted to amend a &quot;repealed and non-existing
former act.&quot; But that did not stop Tranter, who was joined
by Dr. Walter Bromberg, a psychiatrist who had worked for the New
York Criminal Courts until he moved to Reno in December 1941. In
June 1942 Bromberg and Tranter presented a paper to the Western
Regional Conference of the Home Mission Council of North America
during its meeting at the Indian School in Stewart, Nevada. Data
presented came from earlier publications, yet the paper was
published in <i>The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease</i>
(Vol. 97, pp. 518-527), under the title &quot;Peyote
intoxication: Some psychological aspects of the Peyote
rite.&quot; The article was condensed and distributed at five
cents a copy by the National Fellowship of Indian Workers and was
published in a letter of August 6, 1943. An article less
blatantly critical of Peyotism by Bromberg appeared in <i>Nature
Magazine</i>, October 1942, entitled &quot;Storm Over
Peyote.&quot; </p>

<p> A really scurrilous article, containing many inaccuracies,
written by Charles L. Tranter, M.D., under the title &quot;Peyote
&#151; New Dope Menace,&quot; appeared in the national scandal-
mongering magazine <i>PIC</i>, on December 8, 1942. Included were
pictures of old Indian women said to be under the influence of
Peyote, hut who actually were known to never use Peyote.
Representative Frances Bolton inserted the article in a hearing
of the Committee on Indian Affairs and it was printed by the
government without the photographs in December 1944. Nothing more
by or about the leaders of the 1941-1942 campaign against Peyote
in Nevada has come to my attention. Except for a few news items
over the years reporting that NAC members had successfully
opposed new bills submitted to the Nevada legislature to outlaw
Peyote, since 1944 nearly all information on the subject coming
from Nevada has originated in anthropological research. </p>

<p> Publications by anthropologists began in 1940 with the notice
by Jack Harris about the Shoshone at Duck Valley which is
mentioned above, and the appearance in the <i>Proceedings</i> of
the Sixth Pacific Science Congress, in which I published a short
paper. This was the first report on Ben Lancaster in a
publication distributed internationally. My Ph.D. thesis was
issued in print in January 1944, and a review appeared in the <i>American
Anthropologist</i> in 1946. </p>

<p> In 1954 Warren d'Azevedo began research among the Washo and
was soon invited to participate in a Peyote meeting held by
Ramsey Walker at Woodfords, California He produced several
unpublished reports before he and musicologist Alan P. Merriam
published an article in the <i>American Anthropologist</i> (1957,
Vol. 59, pp. 615-641) entitled &quot;Washo Peyote Songs.&quot;
(In 1976, I discovered a listing in a <i>Schwann Guide to Tapes
and Records</i> an album by the same title issued as No. 4384, by
Folkway Records. I have not been able to ascertain if the two are
related. A Northern Paiute originally from McDermitt, Wilbur
Jack, recorded Peyote songs on Canyon Records, ARP 6054.) Other
anthropologists who have written on Washo Peyotism are James
Downs and John A. Price; d'Azevedo attempted to promote a general
public understanding of Peyotism with a long article in the <i>Native
Nevadan</i>, September 3, 1968, entitled &quot;Peyote: Fact and
Fancy.&quot; </p>

<p> Until his death in 1953, Ben Lancaster made annual
pilgrimages to Oilton, Texas, to collect and dry a year's supply
of Peyote. By not furnishing Peyote to others he strengthened his
own role as leader. As early as 1939, I assisted some other
Indians in receiving Peyote by mail, but because the State of
Nevada had passed a law against the transportation of Peyote,
commercial suppliers could not send it by U.S. Mail into the
state. Others began traveling to Texas and making arrangements
with Indians in Oklahoma to transship packages of the sacred
cactus. </p>

<p> Lancaster had been active with officials of the NAC before
becoming a Peyote proselytizer in Nevada in 1936; and although
the NAC organization has never attempted to control or direct
Peyotist missionaries, it did attempt to intercede in his behalf
with the BIA when he was being harassed by Dr. Tranter in 1941. </p>

<p> Copies of large quantities of official NAC correspondence
came into my possession from the estate of Sidney Slotkin after
his death in 1958. From letters in that file a clear record
emerges that others began communicating with the NAC by 1954.
That year Harry Sam of Smith, Nevada, and Burton John of
Gardnerville sent word to the president of the NAC that they
would attend a regional meeting at Fort Hall. </p>

<p> By 1955 and 1956, as shown in the Bulletin of the NAC edited
by anthropologist Slotkin in Chicago, and by other documents from
the Slotkin file, Washo and Northern Paiute Peyotists numbered
about sixty in and near Gardnerville. Louise Lancaster, the widow
of Ben, was one of the leaders and in 1955 contributed $115 to
the international organization of the NAC. Her financial support
probably stimulated the international officials to appoint her
the &quot;Regional Representative of NAC for Nevada and
California&quot; at the 1955 annual convention. </p>

<p> Reubin Hardin of McDermitt wrote to Slotkin in 1956 to
subscribe to the NAC Bulletin, and in 1958 Hardin was put forward
as a leading Peyotist in Nevada by Peyotists in Idaho. Reubin
Hardin was named a &quot;Delegate-at-Large&quot; by NAC officials
when he was present at the annual convention of the Peyote Church
during its 1978 meeting in Laredo, Texas. </p>

<p> The participation of Nevada Indians in the international
affairs of the NAC brought Vice-President Frank Takes Gun to the
state in 1958 so that local people would incorporate the NAC of
Nevada under the laws of the state. This was completed on May 20,
1958 with Washo, Paiute and Shoshone signing as incorporators
with Crow Indian Takes Gun. </p>

<p> In 1972, I had an opportunity to again talk with Peyotists on
the Goshute Reservation, and in Duck Valley, Pyramid Lake,
Fallon, Gardnerville, Elko and McDermitt. At McDermitt I was
allowed to be a participant-observer in a Peyote meeting
conducted by Grover Tom. </p>

<p> It was remarkable that a number of circumstances I had
discovered present among Peyotists in other states were
duplicated in Nevada. Several were exemplified by Grover Tom,
roadman at McDermitt. First was the surprise I felt that he was a
leader of Peyotism for the Paiute at McDermitt, yet he was a
Shoshone who learned to speak Paiute after he married a McDermitt
Paiute woman in 1950. He was thus an alien Peyote preacher to
those Paiute. Grover Tom insisted that his Peyote ritual was
different from others in Nevada because he had studied with
Comanche in Oklahoma for extended periods from 1939 to 1942 to
learn the original ritual. But he also said he remembered
attending a meeting conducted by Sam Lone Bear for the Shoshone
on the Goshute reservation when he happened to be visiting
relatives there in 1929. He had attended meetings with Washo and
with a Sioux conducting a meeting at Fort Hall. Foreign Indians,
that is, Indians from other tribes, conducted meetings for the
Paiute at McDermitt. Grover named Ramsey Walker, a Washo, and
Ralph Turtle, an Arapaho. </p>

<p> Stanley Smart, a McDermitt Paiute who had been fireman at the
meeting I attended there named additional visiting roadmen from
Fort Hall, Idaho, Wind River, Wyoming, and Oklahoma. Stanley had
attended meetings with Northern Cheyenne in Montana, with Ute in
Utah, with Navajo at Aneth, Utah, and others. He has been invited
to be roadman at Healdsburg, California, Fort Hall, Idaho and
Gardnerville, Nevada. </p>

<p> My most unusual discoveries in 1972 involved Sam Lone Bear,
such as the instance related by Grover Tom above. Several
families in Fallon remembered Sam Lone Bear, and knew that Mamie
Charley, a Shoshone of' that town, had married him. An old
Peyotist at Pyramid Lake recalled that Willie Hardin of McDermitt
had been nearly dead and had been cured by Sam at Pyramid Lake. </p>

<p> Most remarkable was finding a Shoshone Indian, Sam Long, on
the Te-Moak Reservation south of Elko who had as a sacred object
a carved staff that his father had received from Sam Lone Bear in
1929. I visited him a second time in 1978 and learned more about
the new rules for conducting a Peyote ceremony he said he had
learned directly from God through Peyote. God had told him to
reverse the ceremonial direction from clockwise to counter-
clockwise. He had no fire in the ritual and used a cloth altar.
His following is so small it is unlikely that his special ritual
will survive him. </p>

<p> The Native American Church of Nevada has converted a very
small percentage of' the total Indian population in Nevada.
However, cultural and social patterns connected with Peyote are
found similar to those elsewhere in the United States. Opposition
to Peyotism arrived from outside the state even before Peyote
ceremonies were practiced. The Nevada NAC has had regular
encouragement from outside Indians, and Nevada Peyotists since
1936 have been regularly bolstered by visits with Peyotists in
other states. In 1978 the vitality of Peyotism in Nevada
suggested it would continue indefinitely. </p>

<p> In Nevada, I discovered what appeared at first to be a unique
behavior pattern. Joe Green, an active Paiute medicineman, was at
the same time a devout Episcopalian and a devotee of Peyotism. He
believed in and practiced three religions at a time. Since I
became aware of that religious phenomenon in 1938, I have found
it many times among Peyotists throughout the United States and
Mexico. In time I came to realize (and then I confirmed this from
published examples) that human beings universally appear able and
willing to add religions together and practice them alternately,
yet maintaining them discrete. Except for peoples reared in or
fully converted to Christianity, Islam or Judaism the ability to
easily carry on three or more religions simultaneously appears to
be the rule. </p>

<H2>Apparent Safety Of Peyote</H2>
<P>
from: <I>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY</I><HR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Several states have passed laws against possession and use of
peyote. However, very little evidence has been reported on this
subject...My familiarity with the Native American Church has resulted
from the day-to-day work of the mental health program on the Navajo
area of the Indian Health Service working with the 125,000 Navajo
Indians, the largest tribe in the United States...We provide consultation
to many community organizations, including the Native American
Church. As a result, we seem to have good success in case finding,
and in general there is little reluctance to refer cases to us.
Nevertheless, we have seen almost no acute or chronic emotional
disturbance arising from peyote use.
<P>
For a period of four years we have followed up every report of
psychotic or other psychiatric episodes said to have arisen from
peyote use. There have been about 40 to 50 such reports, most
of which were hearsay that could never be traced to a particular
case. Some have been based on a physician's belief that Navajo
people use peyote and that if a particular person became disturbed
it must have been for this reason. There has been one relatively
clear-cut case of acute psychosis and four cases that are difficult
to interpret. (The &quot;acute psychosis&quot; occurred when a
Navajo man attended a peyote meeting after drinking alcohol-Ed.)
Assuming that all five of our cases represent true reactions to
peyote and that we hear about half of the cases occurring, the
resulting probably over-estimated rate would be approximately
one bad reaction per 70,000 ingestions...This rate is much lower
than others that have been reported for the use of hallucinogenic
agents.
<P>
We have seen many patients come through difficult crises with
the help of this religion. The Peyotists themselves are proud
in particular of the help the church has been to Indian people
who have drinking problems. In fact, Levy and Kunitz (1970) report
a greater success rate for the Peyotists than for any other agency
working with alcoholics in one part of the Navajo reservation.
<P>
Dr. Robert Bergman, Chief U.S. Public Health Service Navajo
Reservation, Arizona
<P>
Discussion: I concur in all that Dr. Robert Bergman has said.
I see the legal persecution that keeps cropping up as typical
of the reactionary regression of the day...Peyote is not harmful
to these people; it is beneficial, comforting, inspiring, and
appears to be spiritually nourishing. It is a better antidote
to alcohol than anything the missionaries, the white man, the
American Medical Association, and the public health services have
come up with. It is understandable that these organizations should
be a bit envious of the success of this...natural native remedy.

<h3>Antibiotic Activity Of An Extract Of Peyote</h3>

<hr>

<p> The use of peyote in religious rites by many Indian tribes is
common knowledge. In addition, curative properties for such
varied ailments as toothache, pain in childbirth, fever, breast
pain, skin diseases, rheumatism, diabetes, colds, and blindness,
among other things, have been claimed for this plant by the same
peoples...The U.S. DISPENSATORY lists peyote under the name <i>Anhalonium</i>
and indicates its use to some extent in various forms for
neurasthenia and hysteria and also in cases of asthma... </p>

<p> Extracts of whole peyote plants were prepared in various
solvents and screened for antimicrobial activity...and showed
positive microbial inhibition...the principle antibiotic
substance was given the name <i>Peyocactin.</i> </p>

<p> Swiss-Webster white mice were used for preliminary animal
toxicity tests and protection studies to indicate the degree of
inhibitory action of peocactin against fatal staphylococcal
infection. In every case the protected animals survived while
those in the control group succumbed within 60 hours after
infection with <i>S. aureus...</i> Summary: A water-soluble
crystalline substance separated from an ethanol extract of <i>Lophophora
williamsii...</i> exhibited antibiotic activity against a wide
spectrum of bacteria and a species of the imperfect fungi...Of
particular interest was its inhibitory action against 18 strains
of penicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus.</i> </p>

<h2>Peyote And The Law</h2>

<p> by: Guy Mount, editor, The Peyote Book, A study of Native
Medicine, Sweetlight Books, copyright 1993.</p>

<hr>

<p> We need spiritual freedom in America. The peyote religion has
been a lifeline from the past for native people. I believe it can
be a lifeline to the future for many others. But the truth is the
Peyote Religion has been suppressed by laws which discriminate
against followers according to their race, and by ideas which
discredit the Good Medicine by classifying it as a dangerous
drug. </p>

<p> In California, for example, the rights of Native Americans
seem protected because of a favorable decision by the California
Supreme Court in the 1964 &quot;Woody Case.&quot; However the
rights of non-Indian peyotists are ambiguous at best since their
use of peyote is a felony under state law despite the fact that
peyote proves to be spiritually nourishing and medically
beneficial regardless of ethnic ancestry, and despite the alleged
constitutional right to religious freedom for all Americans. </p>

<p> Three states have exempted peyote from &quot;controlled
substance&quot; prohibitions, and do permit the
&quot;bona-fide&quot; sacramental use of peyote by non-Indians
who are members of an established church: these are New York,
Arizona and New Mexico. The Federal District Court of New York
decided in 1979 that &quot;the use of peyote for sacramental
purposes...is not to be restricted solely to the Native American
Church.&quot; Thus a precedent has been clearly established, and
under Arizona laws the Peyote Way Church of God was licensed as
perhaps the first all-race organization with appropriate
authority. A recent decision by the Supreme Court of the United
States (1990) makes it clear that we do not have a constitutional
right to use any controlled substance as a religious sacrament.
Instead, each state has the right to pass laws which honor the
peyote religion, or continue to suppress it. Apparently the First
Amendment only applies to established religions. </p>

<p> The same Peyote Way Church which is legal in Arizona has
encountered difficulties in Texas, where church members were
arrested for harvesting medicine. Charges were dismissed, but the
Church filed a counter-suit against Texas for discrimination,
noting that members of the Native American Church were permitted
to harvest and purchase peyote from local licensed dealers. This
would seem to be a case of obvious racial and religious
discrimination on the part of Texas, but in a decision that makes
a mockery of American history, the Fifth Circuit Court declared
that &quot;Indian Nations were sovereign entities&quot; with
special rights to all of the peyote in the United States.
Therefore members of the Peyote Way Church, with membership open
to all people regardless of ethnic ancestry, could not pick or
purchase peyote in Texas. I would think the previously
unrecognized &quot;Indian Nations&quot; could now use the
language of this decision to sue Texas for the return of their
sovereign land and other natural resources. The American
legislative and judicial system conveniently recognizes Sovereign
Indian Nations only when that point of view perpetuates the
empire. </p>

<p> If the state of Texas really cared about Indian rights, or
preventing the depletion of the natural peyote gardens by
non-Indian peyotists, it would encourage commercial cultivation
of peyote and develop a peyote nature preserve in Starr County,
which had a perpetual harvest plan for providing medicine to the
Native American Church. This would put many south Texas ranchers
back in business, after years of recession-economics. And perhaps
the Native American Church might be more supportive of non-Indian
rights, if the increasingly diminishing natural supply of peyote
were not threatened by a growing demand. </p>

<h2>A Texas Decision</h2>

<hr>

<h6>Judge Maloney of the Fifth Circuit Court ruled against the
Peyote Way Church of God in Arizona on October 28, 1988 stating
that:</h6>

<p> 1 ) There is a limited supply of the Holy Sacrament peyote,
and all of it is needed for the Native American Church of North
America. </p>

<p> 2) The government is authorized to make laws to protect the
public even if those laws infringe on the Church's religious
rights, therefore the Federal and Texas State drug laws are
legitimate. </p>

<p> 3) Federal and Texas State laws are not racist, they're
political. Native American Church members belong to a sovereign
nation. </p>

<p> &quot;The court therefore concludes that regardless of the
sincerity of Peyote Way's members' beliefs in peyotism, the
exemption provided the Native American Church cannot be expanded
to include non-Native American Church use of peyote. </p>

<p> The Court further concludes that the overriding interest of
Congress to control the use of narcotics and psychotropic drugs
outweighs the interest of expanding an exemption that clearly was
meant to be a grandfather clause, and not a full-scale exemption
of religious peyote use. </p>

<p> Finding that Congress' intent to exempt the Native American
Church is not meant to extend to other Churches which use peyote,
the Court finds that Peyote Way's claims for violation of the
free exercise clause and establishment clause of the First
Amendment must fail. &quot; </p>

<h5 align="center">Argued November 6, 1989. Decided April 17,
1990.</h5>

<p> <b>Decision:</b> Oregon's prohibition of use of peyote in
religious ceremony held not to violate free exercise of religion
clause of Federal Constitution's First Amendment.</p>

<hr>

<h5>SUMMARY</h5>

<p> Two drug rehabilitation counselors, both of whom were members
of the Native American Church, were fired from their jobs with a
private corporation in Oregon because they had ingested peyote, a
hallucinogenic drug, for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of
the Church. The counselors applied to the Employment Division of
Oregon's Department of Human Resources for unemployment
compensation, but the department's Employment Appeals Board
ultimately denied their applications on the ground that the
counselors had been discharged for misconduct connected with
work. The Oregon Court of Appeals, reversing the board's
decisions, (1) held that the denial of benefits to persons who
were discharged for engaging in a religious act constituted an
unjustified burden on the right of free exercise of religion, and
(2) remanded the cases to the board for further findings as to
the religious nature of the counselors' acts (75 Or App 764, 707
P2d 1274, 709 P2d 246). The Supreme Court of Oregon, holding that
such further findings were unnecessary and that the counselors
were entitled to payment of unemployment benefits, affirmed both
judgments as modified (301 Or 209, 221, 721 P2d 445, 451). On
certiorari, the United States Supreme Court (1) noted that the
Oregon Supreme Court had not decided whether the counselors'
sacramental use of peyote was in fact proscribed by Oregon's
controlled substance law, and that this issue was a matter of
dispute between the parties, (2) determined that it would not be
appropriate, given this uncertainty, for the United States
Supreme Court to decide whether the practice was protected by the
Federal Constitution, and accordingly (3) vacated the Oregon
Supreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for further
proceedings (485 US 660, 99 L Ed 2nd 753, 108 S Ct 1444). On
remand, the Oregon Supreme Court held that (1) the Oregon statute
made no exception for the sacramental use of peyote, (2) the
counselors' use of peyote thus fell within the prohibition of the
statute, (3) the prohibition of the practice at issue was not
valid under the free exercise clause of the Federal
Constitution's First Amendment, and (4) the counselors could not
be denied unemployment benefits for having engaged in that
practice (307 Or 68, 763 P2d 146). </p>

<p> On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed. In
an opinion by Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, Ch. J., and White,
Stevens and Kennedy, JJ., it was held that (1) the free exercise
of religion clause permits a state to include religiously
inspired use of peyote within the reach of the state's general
criminal prohibition on use of that drug, where there is no
contention that the state's drug law represents an attempt to
regulate religious beliefs, the communication of religious
beliefs, or the raising of one's children in those beliefs; (2)
the free exercise of religion clause thus permitted Oregon to
deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs
because of such religiously inspired use; and (3) generally
applicable, religion-neutral criminal laws that have the effect
of burdening a particular religious practice need not be
justified, under the free exercise of religion clause, by a
compelling governmental interest. </p>

<p> O'Connor, J., concurred in the judgment and, in an opinion
joined in part (as to points 1-3 below) by Brennan, Marshall, and
Blackmun, JJ., expressed the view that (1 ) the question under
the free exercise of religion clause was properly presented in
the United States Supreme Court, (2) an individual's free
exercise of religion is burdened by neutral laws of general
applicability that make criminal the individual's religiously
motivated conduct, (3) the First Amendment requires at least a
case-by-case determination whether such a burden on specific
individuals is constitutionally significant and whether the
particular criminal interest asserted by the government is
compelling, and (4) under such a test, (a) Oregon had a
compelling interest in regulating peyote use by its citizens, (b)
a selective exemption from the prohibition would unduly interfere
with this interest, and therefore (c) the free exercise of
religion clause did not require Oregon to accommodate the
counselors conduct. </p>

<p> Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.,
dissenting, expressed the view that (1 ) a state statute that
burdens the free exercise of religion may stand only if the law
in general, and the state's refusal to allow a religious
exemption in particular, are justified by a compelling interest
that cannot be served by less restrictive means, (2) Oregon's
interest in refusing to make an exception for the religious use
of peyote was not sufficiently compelling to outweigh the
counselors' right to the free exercise of their religion, and
therefore (3) Oregon could not, consistent with the free exercise
of religion clause, deny the counselors unemployment benefits. </p>

<h2>A Real Commitment</h2>

<p> from: PEYOTE RELIGION: A HISTORY by Omer C. Stewart, 1987.
University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, OK.</p>

<hr>

<p> Peyotism today echoes the long-standing problem of its
opposition by the dominant population---the Spanish in Mexico and
other Americans in the United States, government officials,
Christian missionaries, educators, and U.S. senators and
representatives. Legally, peyotists today have won their fight
for religious freedom in the United States. Since 1978, with the
passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 USC
1996, P.L./ 95-341), the practice of peyotism by American Indians
is protected by law. This act orders all federal agencies to be
aware of American Indian sacred sites, objects, plants,
materials, etc.., and to protect them from destruction, if
possible, and to make their use available to Indians. Peyotism is
one of the several American Indian religions named as needing
protection. But there is still the possibility of harassment of
peyotists under the Drug Abuse Control Act of 1965, which
includes peyote among prohibited narcotics, and many state laws
which have similar restrictions. While a test in court will clear
anyone of arrest for possession of peyote if it is shown that the
peyote is for use in a ceremony of the NAC and that the possessor
is a member of the NAC, the arrest and detainment can be
discouraging. NAC members are learning to be careful not to carry
peyote around with them, to carry identification of membership in
some NAC congregation, and to know the law. While the efforts to
enforce the Drug Control Act where it involves peyote may be an
annoyance, most Peyotists are willing to conform to the law. </p>

<p> An unusual case of harassment under the Drug Control Act took
place in Grand Forks, North Dakota, in October, 1984, when a
white couple, Mr. and Mrs. John D. Warner, were arrested by the
FBI for possessing peyote, a controlled drug. The two were
members of the NAC of Tokio, North Dakota, and had been for a
number of years, and Mrs. Warner was custodian of the supply of
peyote for the Tokio congregation. The FBI had learned of the
possession of peyote by the Warners from the president of the NAC
of NA, Emerson Jackson (Navajo), so it was he who brought them to
trial. Jackson said that they were not bona fide members of the
NAC because they were not Indians. He maintained that in 1982 a
motion had been passed by the NAC of NA to the effect that
membership in that organization be limited to persons with
one-quarter Indian blood, thereby excluding this white couple. A
jury trial in Grand Forks Federal Court found the defendants
innocent of breaking the law, since they were able to prove that
although they were not Indians, nevertheless they were members in
good standing of the local congregation of peyotists. The charges
were dismissed. </p>

<p> This case not only illustrates harassment under the Drug
Control Act, but it also brings up the legality of non-Indians as
bona fide members of the NAC. From the beginning, attendance of
non-Indians to peyote meetings has been a somewhat personal or
tribal matter. For instance, very early in Oklahoma some Caddo
refused to allow non-Indians to attend any of their meetings. But
others, such as the Kiowa and Comanche, welcomed non-Indians,
black or white, as long as they were seriously interested. With
the formation of the NAC, the same attitude has generally
prevailed, and the presence of non-Indians has been no problem.
It was in the sixties when the hippie generation became
interested in peyote and became a nuisance in the peyote gardens
of Texas, bringing about the Texas law which forbids possession
of peyote by persons not having one-quarter Indian blood and
proof of membership in the NAC, that race became an issue in
membership. Since then, if non-Indians wish to be allowed to
possess peyote, they must show that their involvement in the
peyote religion is genuine---that it is not just a recreational,
frivolous, or passing interest but a real commitment. Then, as
the case against the Warners shows, race is not an issue. Still,
it is especially important for non-Indians to carry
identification of membership in the NAC if they have occasion to
carry peyote, and even so, non-Indians possessing peyote violate
Texas law. </p>

<p> The ruling of the NAC of NA that only Indians should be
enrolled in the Native American Church is new and is not shared
by most peyotists. The NAC of NA does not speak for all
peyotists, much as it would like to do so. All peyotists consider
themselves members of the Native American Church, but most are
not affiliated with the NAC of NA. Each congregation makes its
own rules, just as each meeting is conducted by its own roadman. </p>

<h2>The Church Of Father Peyote</h2>

<p> by: Carl A. Hammerschlag, M.D., Psychiatrist and Teacher</p>

<hr>

<p> The first time I attended the church of Father Peyote, I got
quite sick---and I was only sitting outside listening to the
music. They passed some tea around. I tried it and became
violently ill. </p>

<p> I thought that was the end of my relationship with Father
Peyote. There was no way that I would sit up all night just to
get sick. On that first visit to a Native America Church meeting
in 1965, I did not realize that the process it offered was not to
be taken lightly. It took me ten years to make a return visit,
but now the church has become a place of healing and
enlightenment for me. </p>

<p> To the believer, peyote constitutes a sacrament, not a drug.
Peyote has absolutely no recreational aspects for the church
participants. You must come to peyote as to truth, in an attitude
of worship. </p>

<p> Let me explain at the outset that in matters of the Peyote
Church, I am a guest who has come to dinner; that does not make
me an expert on the entire family. I know what I have seen, and
there is much I don't know. I go as a fellow traveler. I don't
bring friends to observe the colorful ritual. This is a sacred
time to me and to every other participant in the service. </p>

<p> The most spiritual place I know is the tipi of the Peyote
Church. I used to go to synagogue on the high Jewish holidays,
but I can no longer feel the presence of the spirit in a group
larger than forty. </p>

<p> Indians have a very different concept of where you worship.
The whole Earth is the temple. Any place you stand is a church.
The tipi is a nestling enclosure on the Earth Mother's breast, a
place of sharing among a small group. Here each can worship at
his or her own time, as the heart directs, in his or her own
language. </p>

<p> I sing my Jewish songs in the tipi, and I wear my father's
prayer shawl, the one he wore at his bar mitzvah in Germany. My
Indian friends say that it does not matter in what language you
sing; there are always at least two people who understand--- you
and the Creator. </p>

<p> The first time I sat before the coals in the tipi I saw
crematorium ashes. I do not see them as such anymore. I have
allowed myself to become liberated. I understand that I am flawed
and imperfect, so it's okay to feel small and weak. I am freer of
the domination of those fears. </p>

<p> The more you work with the mind, the more you realize you
can't know it. The more you seek to touch your spirit, the more
you realize that you must enter some altered state of
consciousness to burst free of the conventional limitations of
flesh and rationality. This is what the Peyote Church is about. </p>

<h2>Through The Lens Of Perception</h2>

<p> by Hal Zena Bennett</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>&quot;For now we see through a glass, darkly, but then
    face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even
    as also I am known. &quot; ---I Corinthians</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Nearly thirty years ago, I spent a summer in Mexico, much of
it in a small village two hours by bus up the coast from
Acapulco. As far as I know, the village had no name but was
referred to as &quot;the turnaround&quot; (in Spanish, of course)
because it was here that the third-class bus turned around and
headed back over the mountain to Acapulco. I had gone there on
the recommendation of a friend to escape the modern hotels and
the tourist crowd. But I was not entirely prepared for the
primitive conditions I met, or for a certain adventure that came
to me. Instead of a modern hotel room, I found myself sleeping on
a cot, covered only by a light sheet, just one of seven other
rugged souls who had chosen this thatched roof dormitory over the
more elegant accommodations available two hours south. </p>

<p> We always arose at sunrise, helped fold the cots, then
stashed them away in one corner of the room. That done, we sat
around and sipped coffee from crude, terra-cotta cups as we
waited for breakfast to be served by the proprietor and his wife.
Eating and sleeping under these conditions, created a bond
between strangers, in spite of the language barriers. I knew
enough Spanish to ask for basic life essentials, and the others,
mostly Mexican students from the City, knew enough English to
make small-talk. </p>

<p> One afternoon I met a man on the beach who said he was a
tourist guide. He offered to take me up to the top of the
mountain---I do not think I ever heard the name of it---where he
promised to show me the most spectacular view imaginable. The fee
for this jaunt was reasonable, and having nothing better to do I
agreed to go with him. </p>

<p> The man's name was &quot;Sen&quot;, and he was a wiry but
strong looking little man who appeared to be in his early
sixties. He wore only faded khaki pants and a red T- shirt with a
flying hawk emblazoned across the chest. Underneath the bird,
written in Spanish, was the name of a local beer. Sen was
dark-skinned and had long black hair that reached nearly to his
shoulders. His face had sharp Indian features, and when he smiled
he revealed two front teeth capped in gold. Just after noon, Sen
packed a small knapsack with staples that he purchased from a <i>groceria</i>
a short ways from our camp. Then we set out on foot in the most
casual way imaginable. He pointed to the mountain peak where we
were going. It looked to me to be miles and miles away. He
assured me, however, that it was a much shorter distance than it
looked, and I was not to worry. </p>

<p> We traveled on foot for most of the afternoon, taking what he
called &quot;<i>El Sombre</i>&quot;---the shaded trail on the
eastern slopes of the mountain, which protected us from the
torturous rays of the afternoon sun. The trail was difficult,
very steep at times, and not well maintained. I failed to keep
track of the time, but we must have traveled for at least four
hours before we stopped. </p>

<p> Finally Sen announced that we had arrived at our destination,
and he led me to the mouth of a large cave, where we sat down to
rest. I would guess that the cave was approximately two thousand
feet above the sea. Less than a mile to the west, and seemingly
straight down, was the ocean. </p>

<p> As Sen had promised me, it was a most spectacular view. The
steep walls of the mountain amplified the sounds of the waves far
below, giving the illusion that the sea might have been only a
stone's throw away. From this aerial view, somewhat magnified by
a peculiar atmospheric distortion, one could watch the waves
rolling gently in upon the beautiful white beach, appearing as
they might through binoculars. </p>

<p> I was aware of Sen squatting down on the ledge a few feet off
to my left and a foot or two behind me. I turned and watched as
he took a small package from his day-pack. He had something
wrapped up in newspapers, which he set down in front of him. </p>

<p> He carefully unfolded the papers, smoothing the edges out
over the ground. At the center of the square of newspaper were
six objects that looked like green cactus apples with flattened
tops. Each one had a feathery white tuft growing out of its top. </p>

<p> With a small, razor-sharp, stag handled jackknife, Sen
removed the tufts and sliced the cactus apples pie-like into
narrow wedges. &quot;What is it?&quot; I asked, in Spanish. </p>

<p> &quot;It is medicine for fixing your eyes,&quot; Sen said. He
looked up and grinned mischievously, making a peculiar fanning
gesture with his hands around the area of his eyes. </p>

<p> &quot;Peyote,&quot; I said. He nodded, inviting me to share
the peyote with him. </p>

<p> I would have been reluctant except that back in the States, I
had taken peyote three times. Each time had been under controlled
conditions, and in the name of medical research. We had taken our
peyote as a dried powder inside gelatin capsules. I had only seen
pictures of it in its raw form. </p>

<p> I had experienced a pleasant, mildly altered state of
consciousness in these experiments. So, naturally, I had no
particular anxiety about taking the peyote with my guide. </p>

<p> Sen showed me how to eat the narrow slices from the buttons.
He tipped back his head, opened his mouth wide, and placed a
single slice far back on his tongue. Then he rocked his head
forward and swallowed. On my first try, I failed to get the
peyote far enough back on my tongue, and the foul, earthy taste
made me wretch. </p>

<p> Sen repeated his instructions, and this time I got it right.
Together we consumed five ripe buttons in about a half an hour.
Then we sat quietly, breathing slowly and deeply in a way that
Sen said he had been taught to do. I recall feeling nauseous at
first, but had no trouble with it when I followed Sen's breathing
instructions. </p>

<p> It was late evening. The sun was setting, and the sky had
turned a deep scarlet. At the horizon, sea and sky blended as one
in a symphony of reds and yellows. </p>

<p> Spread out between the ocean and the cave where we sat, I saw
a strip of tropical jungle. Here was a world of lush greens,
ferns and palms in varying tone, now wearing an aura of pink
created by the fading sun. </p>

<p> Blowing in from the ocean, the evening air was cool, heavy
with the earthy fragrance of the jungle, of naturally composting
vegetation and moist soil, and of flowers which I could not see. </p>

<p> &quot;It is like I told you it would be,&quot; Sen said.
&quot;Do you agree?&quot; </p>

<p> I nodded, agreeing that indeed it was very beautiful. </p>

<p> Minutes passed; then Sen announced, &quot;Darkness will be
coming soon.&quot; </p>

<p> It took a moment for these words to sink in. And then the
horror of it struck me. We had just spent the entire afternoon
hiking up an extremely precipitous trail, along which we
encountered many hazards. Several times I had clung to the rock
face of the mountain to traverse a section of the trail washed
out by storms, risking a fall of several hundred feet. Another
time a large snake blocked the trail. Sen chased it off with a
stick, all the while assuring me that the snake was not
poisonous, though its bite could be harmful. </p>

<p> The realization that I might have to go down this same trail
in the darkness startled me. How could I have been so stupid! Why
had it not occurred to me, until now, that it would be dark when
we returned! </p>

<p> I was furious with Sen. What sort of person would guide me to
such a place, heedless of the threat to my well-being. Surely he
realized it would be dark before we returned. </p>

<p> I then became aware of a deep, groaning roar coming from deep
within the cave behind me, and I leapt to my feet with visions of
being attacked at any moment by a wild animal whose peace we had
disturbed. I began swearing and jumping around, unable to decide
which way to turn. I knew there was a washout less than a hundred
yards down the trail, and it was already too dark to safely cross
it. </p>

<p> Sen continued to sit at the mouth of the cave, completely
unperturbed. In fact, he was wearing a toothy grin that did
nothing for my sense of security. </p>

<p> Again I heard the groaning roar within the cave. &quot;What
the hell is that?&quot; I cried. &quot;Don't you think we should
get out of here?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Is it such a bad sound?&quot; Sen asked. &quot;I find
it rather pleasant.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Pleasant!&quot; I said, still searching for an escape.
&quot;How can you sit there so calmly? Do you know what it
is?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;It is a sound.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Of what?&quot; </p>

<p> Sen shrugged. &quot;Who knows?&quot; </p>

<p> At that moment, I sensed that he knew something which I
didn't. He'd been here before. Or at least he claimed that he had
been. He obviously knew that the sound wasn't a threat to our
safety. Or did he? I knew nothing about the man, other than what
I saw. He had told me nothing about himself. Where had he come
from? For all I knew he cold be a complete fool, or a
madman---some sort of murderer who lured people out into the
wilds where he slaughtered them. After all, who would ever find
me out here? Who even knew--- or for that matter cared---where
I'd gone? </p>

<p> &quot;Sit down,&quot; he said sternly, pointing to the empty
boulder at the mouth of the cave where moments before I had been
sitting. </p>

<p> &quot;Not on your life,&quot; I said. </p>

<p> He looked at me incredulously. &quot;No? Then, where are you
going to go?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;I'm leaving,&quot; I said. &quot;I'll go back down the
trail.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Surely you're joking.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;I'm not joking at all,&quot; I said. &quot;I've had
plenty of trail experience back in California. </p>

<p> &quot;Suit yourself,&quot; he said. &quot;But you'll miss the
best part of the sunset. Look.&quot; He pointed over the horizon.
</p>

<p> Against my better judgment I turned to find out what he
thought could possibly be so important. At the edge of the
horizon the sky was ablaze with a bright pattern of red and
yellow light, twisting slowly into a shape that resembled a
spiral galaxy. My breath was literally taken away by the beauty
of it, and for a moment I completely forgot my plight. &quot;My
god, what is it?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p> &quot;It is what I promised you,&quot; Sen said. &quot;I have
kept my word.&quot; </p>

<p> In spite of myself I sat down and stared out over the
horizon. For an hour or more I watched as the spiraling colors
played at the end of the ocean. The galaxy of colors was huge,
awesome in its proportions, and seemed to have a life of its own,
twisting and turning almost playfully, as though it had an
intelligence and was performing a dance with the Earth. Then
suddenly it was gone, and we were plunged into darkness. </p>

<p> The groaning roar rose from the cave behind us, and this time
I was able to study it, to listen with a calmer mind. Rather than
like an animal, it sounded this time like two gigantic boulders
being ground slowly together, emitting a voice from somewhere
deep down in the earth beneath our feet. I had visions of two
continental plates scraping against one another, their sound
amplified and made more resonant by a long tunnel in the cave. </p>

<p> &quot;Listen,&quot; Sen said. &quot;Listen.&quot; </p>

<p> I did, and the sound varied, not like a voice so much as like
music made by a gigantic instrument whose shape and mechanics I
could barely imagine. </p>

<p> &quot;Didn't I tell you?&quot; Sen said excitedly.
&quot;Didn't I tell you I would show you a wonderful place?&quot;
</p>

<p> He leaned down and picked up his knapsack. Reaching inside,
he produced a round object which he handed to me. It was too dark
to see what it was, but from the size and texture I guessed it
was an orange. </p>

<p> &quot;Supper,&quot; Sen said, announcing this in a completely
matter-of-fact tone. </p>

<p> Was he kidding? Was this really his idea of an adequate
supper after our arduous climb to this place? Without comment, I
sullenly peeled and sectioned the orange, determining that I
would eat it slowly, savoring every bite. </p>

<p> I was aware of Sen rolling his orange between his palms, the
peeling still in place. He was doing this in a very studied, very
methodical way, and I grew curious. As I watched him, I also
became aware that the mountain was growing brighter and brighter,
almost as though a huge spotlight was being pointed at us. I
looked up and saw the edge of a full moon just emerging from
behind the top of the mountain, another five hundred feet above
us. This was providing us with enough light to safely make our
way down the path, if that is what we chose to do. </p>

<p> I looked at Sen, meaning to suggest this to him. But now he
was ripping into the orange like a starving ape, tearing off
great chunks and burying his face in his hands as he sucked and
chewed at the fruit. I was disgusted by his behavior, and
wondered if he always ate like this. He finished, reached into
his knapsack for a bandanna, and wiped off his face and hands,
licking his fingers now and then to get rid of the sticky juice.
This done, he lay down, arranged the knapsack under his head, and
appeared for all the world to be getting ready to take a nap. </p>

<p> &quot;Shouldn't we be getting back while we still have some
light from the moon?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p> &quot;What's the hurry? Have you got an appointment with the
doctor or something?&quot; To this he chuckled stupidly, like a
man unaware of the fact that no one else thought his joke funny. </p>

<p> &quot;When are we going back?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Why don't you just enjoy yourself,&quot; he said.
&quot;Take it easy.&quot; </p>

<p> I don't know whether I was more angry than anxious, but I
could see that there was no sense in trying to budge him. He had
his own plans for us, and he was obviously not going to let me in
on them. I was completely at his mercy. </p>

<p> I leaned back and started picking at the orange that I had
sectioned so carefully. I picked up the first section and was
about to put it in my mouth when I felt something moving across
my hand. I looked down at the orange section. A tiny lizard,
about the length of my little finger, clung to the fruit. I
grabbed it by the tail and flung it out into space, disgusted by
the thought that had I not felt it moving in time, I would have
bitten into H. and might at this very moment be spitting out its
bleeding carcass. </p>

<p> I was careful after that, brushing off each section of fruit
and inspecting it in the moonlight before popping it into my
mouth. By the time I had finished eating, Sen was sound asleep.
His rasping snores indicated to me that it would be no use trying
to awaken him, at least not for an hour or more. </p>

<p> I felt restless and uneasy. From far below us I could hear
waves lapping against the beach, and this was soothing. Then,
every few minutes, the cave made that peculiar groaning sound, a
sound to which I had now become accustomed. To pass the time, I
decided that I would try to plot how long were the silences
between the cave's groans, but after an hour or more I could
determine no apparent pattern, and eventually gave it up. </p>

<p> The moonlight slowly faded, and again I became anxious as
darkness closed in around me. Now, every sound seemed amplified,
and I became aware of live things all around me. High-pitched
whistles from inside the cave suggested the presence of bats.
Rustling in the trees suggested night birds, or perhaps nocturnal
animals. None of these things particularly disturbed me, though
they didn't exactly put me at ease, either. I had spent many
nights under the stars back in the States, hiking in the Sierras.
But I have to admit that these sounds were not familiar to me,
and my inability to identify them put my nerves on edge. </p>

<p> The sky was brilliant with stars, the Milky Way like a great
sea of light. Several times I saw meteorites trailing across the
sky. In spite of my nervousness, I caught myself dozing, jerking
to attention when by body relaxed, and I almost lost the balance
of my sitting position. At last I gave into H and lay down,
staring up at the sky until I fell asleep. </p>

<p> The next thing I knew there was a shriek, and I sat bolt
upright, not knowing what to expect. The shriek shattered the
stillness once more and I looked up, having determined that the
sound had come from above and to my left. As I searched the
darkness, the shriek came again and a huge bird, with a wingspan
of at least six feet, swooped down, coming right for me. I leapt
behind Sen's rock--- where he continued to sleep soundly---just
as the great bird shot by. </p>

<p> As the bird passed, less than a foot from my face, I saw its
talons extended as though for a kill. But that was not the worst
of it. Just a few feet past me, it stopped in mid-flight, seemed
to gather itself into a ball, and suddenly changed directions,
facing me once again as thought preparing for another attack. I
shielded my face with both arms, fully expecting to feel its
sharp talons dig into me at any moment. But then it stopped.
Facing me directly, flapping its wings gently, hanging in the air
like a feathery helicopter, I thought I heard it make a sound. </p>

<p> Surely I was dreaming. But I knew I wasn't. I looked directly
at the bird and saw that it had a human face. I rubbed my eyes,
certain that what I was seeing couldn't possibly be true. But it
was. The bird had a human face. Moreover, it was a face I
recognized. It was Sen's face! Sen had taken the form of a giant
night-hunter. I glanced down on the ground where he had been
sleeping. Indeed, he was gone. And there, as clear as the paper
on which these words are printed, was the bird---Sen in the form
of a bird, hovering before my eyes, flapping his wings gently,
evenly, as he held his space in the air. </p>

<p> &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I asked, at the moment not
thinking how indescribably unbelievable it was to be talking to a
bird who had taken the face of my companion. </p>

<p> &quot;Coo! Coo! Coo!&quot; the bird said. This was followed
by laughter--- laughter that I knew was Sen's. The laughter ended
and was followed by his stupid chuckling. Did he somehow expect
me to share in his little joke? I didn't think it was funny. In
fact, I was shaking like a leaf, still unable to give a rational
explanation for what I'd seen. Besides, the bird was still there,
still hovering within an arm's length me. </p>

<p> I decided to treat it as an everyday occurrence. After all,
maybe it was a dream. I had heard that the best way to stop a
person or situation that you don't like in a dream was to rein in
your rational self and tell it to go away. I did this, and heard
the bird reply, &quot;Go away to where? You said yourself, it
wasn't safe to go down the trail in the dark.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;But you're a bird,&quot; I said. &quot;You can
fly.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Oh, right. That's right,&quot; I heard Sen say.
&quot;Goo'bye, then.&quot; </p>

<p> And with this, he disappeared. By the light of the stars I
watched him gather his wings under him and plunge off the cliff
where I was sitting. I watched as he circled gracefully, changed
direction, and disappeared, skimming the treetops in the jungle
below, apparently continuing his night hunt. </p>

<p> Then, startled, I suddenly realized that I was all alone at
the mouth of the cave. Could this have actually happened? Had Sen
been transformed, somehow, into the body of a bird, a giant owl
or whatever it was? In any case, it was very clear to me now that
I was left alone on the mountainside. </p>

<p> I heard the crunch of gravel on the path a hundred feet away,
off to my right. I called out, &quot;Sen, is that you?&quot; </p>

<p> Much to my relief, my companion came into view, hooking up
his pants. </p>

<p> &quot;Where were you?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p> &quot;I went to take a crap,&quot; he said. &quot;What's
wrong? Are you late for your appointment again?&quot; This was
followed by his usual stupid chuckle. Then he went back over to
his rock and stretched out, arranging the knapsack under his head
as before. </p>

<p> &quot;I've had enough of this,&quot; I said. &quot;Stop
fooling around with my head.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;I'm going back to sleep,&quot; he said. &quot;Wake me
when the movie's over.&quot; </p>

<p> I could not believe his audacity or his incredible coolness.
Within seconds he was sound asleep again, apparently oblivious to
everything going on around him. I lay brooding, angry, thoroughly
shaken by everything I had been through that night. I wanted to
grab Sen by the shoulders and shake him awake. I wanted to scream
at him, to tell him how much I resented the games he was playing
with me. I didn't know how he was accomplishing what he was
doing, and I didn't care. I just wanted it to stop. </p>

<p> I huddled close to my rock like an animal guarding its
territory. I myself began to feel like an animal, destined to
live out its life in the wild. I felt a warming sensation
throughout my body, a rippling of muscle. Perhaps it was due to a
warm breeze emitted from the mouth of the cave. It was certainly
possible that there were hot springs somewhere below that
occasionally emitted heat which escaped to the outer vestibules. </p>

<p> I found myself staring steadily and angrily at the sleeping
Sen. I had never felt such hatred for another man. But as I
stared at him I could not identify my anger. I felt a strange
fear, like nothing I'd ever felt before. It was as though this
man was an intruder in my life, that he was threatening me or
something that belonged to me. </p>

<p> I watched him cautiously, waiting for him to make the
slightest move in my direction, a move that would indicate that I
would have to fight with him---perhaps until one or the other of
us was dead. I determined that I would be the victor. After all,
I was larger, more powerful than he. </p>

<p> Sen's snoring stopped. He took a deep breath, then suddenly
began to tremble all over as though he was having some sort of
fit. The light changed and I saw a giant cat, a mountain lion or
a panther standing between me and him, teeth bared. </p>

<p> &quot;Sen,&quot; I cried, wanting to warn him. But a strange
sound came from my throat, a hissing that I could barely identify
with. </p>

<p> Sen sat bolt upright and looked calmly past the cat. In fact,
his gaze was piercing, looking right through the cat into my
eyes. &quot;Stop this nonsense right now,&quot; he said.
&quot;You need your sleep. You'll be exhausted in the
morning.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;The cat,&quot; I said. &quot;Don't you see it?&quot; At
that moment I wasn't certain of anything. I could not clearly see
the cat myself. It was too close for me to see. I was terribly
confused. Why couldn't he see it? I was aware only of its
threatening posture, baring its teeth, ready to pounce. </p>

<p> &quot;Of course I see it,&quot; Sen said. &quot;It's your
cat. It's not going to hurt me.&quot; </p>

<p> <i>My</i> cat, I thought to myself. <i>Mine?</i> And then I
asked, &quot;What makes you so sure?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;I am just sure. I am just sure.&quot; He waved his hand
in front of my face. Suddenly I was calm. I felt spellbound.
&quot;You see?&quot; Sen said. </p>

<p> Sen lay back down, and in seconds he was sound asleep again.
I drew back away from him, toward the mouth of the cave. The cat
came back into focus for me. It was just me and the cat now. The
cat turned, gazed into my face, and appeared to grin. </p>

<p> Was all this truly my own creation? I stared back at the cat.
Its face lit up, glowing, as though it had been a plastic mask;
now someone had turned on a light behind the cat mask, exposing
the illusion. The body of the cat vanished and I was looking just
at its face, at that backlit mask. Then the mask of the cat began
to dissolve, as though the heat of the light behind it was
causing it to melt. Soon it was nothing more than a molten blob
turning in space like a star. As I watched, it began to reshape
itself into a much more geometric form. </p>

<p> After a few moments its transformation was complete. Round,
saucer-shaped, it turned slowly in the space before my eyes. The
light still shown within it, as though it possessed its own
source of illumination. It turned again and again, revealing its
full configuration, thin and elliptical from the side, round and
perfectly symmetrical from the front. It was a lens, like the
lens from a telescope or a magnifying glass. But this lens had an
organic appearance---not unlike a living cell, translucent and
soft, definitely alive---a geometric jellyfish. </p>

<p> I moved closer to the lens. Deep inside it I saw movement.
What were these shapes? I saw many images from my childhood---my
brothers, the house where I'd lived during my high school years
in Michigan, my parents, my first lover. I thought about how
people often reported seeing their lives flash before their eyes
when they were faced with death. Could this be the case? Was I
near death? I looked deeper into the lens, as though I might find
the answer there. I saw a cat, a powerful mountain lion. There
was also a giant bird. There was a groaning cave, and a beautiful
sunset over the ocean. There was a rugged trail up a mountain,
and a man. I looked more closely. It was Sen. He was sleeping by
the rock, his head on his knapsack. I could not figure out where
he was---in the lens, or beyond it, or both? </p>

<p> The lens turned in the air. I closed my eyes, trying to block
it out, trying to see around it, or to see a clear place through
it where the world beyond would not be distorted by the images
inside the lens. But I could not escape the lens' influence, and
now I was aware that it was turning deep in my consciousness, in
the same space out of which dream and imagination are created. I
had never before noticed how large this mental space I called
imagination could be. It had no limits, no beginning or middle or
end. It seemed to stretch out in all directions, a vast landscape
whose borders were as unlimited as space itself. </p>

<p> At one moment I could be on the mountainside with Sen, in
Mexico. A second later I was back in Michigan, many years before,
a boy of twelve riding his bicycle on a rain-slick asphalt
street. A second after that I was driving across the Arizona
desert in January, with a carload of friends, all in our early
twenties, heading back to California after a Christmas holiday
with our families in Michigan. Now I shifted to a backpacking
trip in the high Sierras, where I fished for trout on the bank of
a mountain lake. </p>

<p> Where was the lens now? I couldn't find it. It seemed to have
merged with all the rest, lost in the jumble of everything I held
in my consciousness. I felt panic. Losing the image of the lens
was like losing a treasure I had dreamed of discovering all my
life. Then there was a long moment of perfect clarity when I
realized what had happened to the lens. I saw that it hadn't
disappeared at all; the lens was my consciousness, not simply a
piece of it. </p>

<p> For a long time I just sat quietly and thought about this. It
seemed to me that the lens was like a vehicle for my awareness,
giving me an identity separate from the rest of the world. This
was the image I had been seeking since I was a child. A thousand
questions and speculations that I had entertained along the way
now focused on this lens image. </p>

<p> Having the sense of separateness which the lens provided
seemed to me both exciting and frightening. It meant that I was
not like an ant, with instincts---that is, pre-programmed
responses built in---dictating my every action. It meant that I
was capable of creating my own program, or even of overriding
whatever biological or God-given programs might be built in. </p>

<p> My decisions, my fears, my dreams, my acquired knowledge, all
could come into play. In my present situation, up on the
mountain, I could make a decision, based on my fears or on other
factors contained in my lens, to leave my guide sleeping by the
mouth of the cave and make my way down the mountain trail alone.
Or I could choose to trust him, and wait for morning. Regardless
of which decision I made, because of my awareness of my
separateness--- achieved through the lens---it was now very clear
to me that I alone was responsible for my destiny. I was terribly
excited about being able to see all this. This vision of the lens
provided me with a symbol for making sense of knowledge I hadn't
even been aware that I was collecting over the years. I wanted to
awaken Sen and discuss it all with him. </p>

<p> &quot;Sen,&quot; I said. &quot;Sen, are you asleep?&quot; I
went over to him and gently shook his shoulder. </p>

<p> &quot;What do you want?&quot; he asked, turning his head to
face me. &quot;Have you created another cat? A bird?&quot; </p>

<p> I started to look for the words to explain what I was seeing.
But then I backed away. I realized that Sen already knew about
everything I had seen. To him it was common knowledge, and he had
no time for it. &quot;Never mind,&quot; I said, deeply hurt by
the realization that I had no one with whom to share my
discovery. &quot;I'm sorry to disturb you.&quot; </p>

<p> Sen mumbled something I couldn't understand and went back to
sleep. </p>

<p> I sat down and watched the world beyond the lens, and saw it
all merge with memories, images, ideas and feelings that I knew
belonged only to me. </p>

<p> As my companion slept, the shadows shortened on the ledge
where I sat and I saw that the lens was not something new in my
life. I saw it far more clearly than ever before, and that part
was new and unfamiliar, but the subtle mergings of external
sights, sounds, sensations, all seemed normal, automatic, even
familiar to me. I realized that these things had always
occurred---and the only difference was that now I could see them,
could feel their shifts and mergings, their constant
metamorphoses from one form to another. </p>

<p> I remembered many times in the past, all through my life,
when I had also had brief glimpses into these basic truths about
our ways of processing reality, glimpses never more substantial
than the sun's reflection from a bright chrome strip on a passing
car. I now saw why life really was not all it appeared to be.
Rather, it took on meaning only as it merged with our images
inside the lens. </p>

<p> Later that afternoon, as we made our way back down the
mountain, Sen listened patiently as I related the story of what
had happened to me up on the mountain. I wanted to know if he had
experienced any of it. Were the things I had seen a shared
reality? Had he seen any of it? </p>

<p> Sen shrugged. He was vague and elusive. He told me that the
Indians believed that the place where we spent the night was a
sacred spot, and that people often had visions there that changed
their lives. I asked if he had ever had visions there. </p>

<p> &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;That is why I sleep when
I go there. When I sleep it does what it must do and I am not
always jumping up and down thinking I have to do something about
it.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Unlike you, I am a very lazy
man.&quot; </p>

<p> When I tried to get him to explain this to me, he said it
wasn't important. He told me my Spanish wasn't good enough to
understand him if he really tried to go into it. And his English
wasn't good enough for him to even attempt it in my language. </p>

<p> He dismissed me with that phrase the Mexicans have for
stopping all further conversation on a subject: <i>&quot;No me
importa&quot;</i>---it is not important to me. &quot;You went to
the mountain and you saw what I promised you. I am a very good
guide. I hope you will tell your friends about me.&quot; </p>

<p> I promised him I would. </p>

<p> When I got back to the camp where I was staying, Sen
disappeared down the beach and I never saw him again. I asked the
owner of the hostel about him, and he told me that Sen was an
Indian, and that I was lucky to have come back from the trek at
all. Sen belonged to a tribe that still lived in the mountains,
and they were not known for their friendliness toward Anglos.
They had no respect at all for the laws of the Government, and
they lived their lives completely cut off from the rest of the
world. </p>

<p> I always took this warning with a grain of salt. After all,
if Sen's people were so isolated from the rest of civilization,
how had he learned English? He knew my language far better than I
knew his. Moreover, when I thought back on it I could not think
of a single incident in which Sen had acted in any way that I
considered directly harmful. Any harm that could have come to me
would have come from my own lens distorting reality in ways that
could have caused me to use bad judgment and perhaps bring me to
harm through my own actions. </p>

<p> The experience has stayed with me throughout my life and
become something far more than an unusual memory. The lens has
become a reference point for me, a kind of metaphor over which I
have puzzled for many years. Only in the past couple years has it
become comfortable for me to write about it, to relate the story
to others so that I might share the revelations that have come
from it. </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was in 1886 that the German pharmacologist,
Louis Lewin, published the first systematic study of the cactus,
to which his own name was subsequently given. <em>Anhalonium
lewinii</em> was new to science. To primitive religion and the
Indians of Mexico and the American Southwest it was a friend of
immemorially long standing. Indeed, it was much more than a
friend. In the words of one of the early Spanish visitors to the
New World, &quot;they eat a root which they call peyote, and
which they venerate as though it were a deity.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why they should have venerated it as a deity became
apparent when such eminent psychologists as Jaensch, Havelock
Ellis and Weir Mitchell began their experiments with mescalin,
the active principle of peyote. True, they stopped short at a
point well this side of idolatry; but all concurred in assigning
to mescalin a position among drugs of unique distinction.
Administered in suitable doses, it changes the quality of
consciousness more profoundly and yet is less toxic than any
other substance in the pharmacologist's repertory. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mescalin research has been going on sporadically
ever since the days of Lewin and Havelock Ellis. Chemists have
not merely isolated the alkaloid; they have learned how to
synthesize it, so that the supply no longer depends on the sparse
and intermittent crop of a desert cactus. Alienists have dosed
themselves with mescalin in the hope thereby of coming to a
better, a first-hand, understanding of their patients' mental
processes. Working unfortunately upon too few subjects within too
narrow a range of circumstances, psychologists have observed and
catalogued some of the drug's more striking effects. Neurologists
and physiologists have found out something about the mechanism of
its action upon the central nervous system. And at least one
Professional philosopher has taken mescalin for the light it may
throw on such ancient, unsolved riddles as the place of mind in
nature and the relationship between brain and consciousness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="back1"></a> There matters rested until,
two or three years ago, a new and perhaps highly significant fact
was <a href="#target1">observed.*</a> Actually the fact had been
staring everyone in the face for several decades; but nobody, as
it happened, had noticed it until a Young English psychiatrist,
at present working in Canada, was struck by the close similarity,
in chemical composition, between mescalin and adrenalin. Further
research revealed that lysergic acid, an extremely potent
hallucinogen derived from ergot, has a structural biochemical
relationship to the others. Then came the discovery that
adrenochrome, which is a product of the decomposition of
adrenalin, can produce many of the symptoms observed in mescalin
intoxication. But adrenochrome probably occurs spontaneously in
the human body. In other words, each one of us may be capable of
manufacturing a chemical, minute doses of which are known to
cause Profound changes in consciousness. Certain of these changes
are similar to those which occur in that most characteristic
plague of the twentieth century, schizophrenia. Is the mental
disorder due to a chemical disorder? And is the chemical disorder
due, in its turn, to psychological distresses affecting the
adrenals? It would be rash and premature to affirm it. The most
we can say is that some kind of a <em>prima facie</em> case has
been made out. Meanwhile the clue is being systematically
followed, the sleuths&#151;biochemists , psychiatrists,
psychologists&#151;are on the trail. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By a series of, for me, extremely fortunate
circumstances I found myself, in the spring of 1953, squarely
athwart that trail. One of the sleuths had come on business to
California. In spite of seventy years of mescalin research, the
psychological material at his disposal was still absurdly
inadequate, and he was anxious to add to it. I was on the spot
and willing, indeed eager, to be a guinea pig. Thus it came about
that, one bright May morning, I swallowed four-tenths of a gram
of mescalin dissolved in half a glass of water and sat down to
wait for the results. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We live together, we act on, and react to, one
another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves.
The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified
alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their
insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By
its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and
enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights,
fancies&#151;all these are private and, except through symbols
and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about
experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to
nation, every human group is a society of island universes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most island universes are sufficiently like one
another to Permit of inferential understanding or even of mutual
empathy or &quot;feeling into.&quot; Thus, remembering our own
bereavements and humiliations, we can condole with others in
analogous circumstances, can put ourselves (always, of course, in
a slightly Pickwickian sense) in their places. But in certain
cases communication between universes is incomplete or even
nonexistent. The mind is its own place, and the Places inhabited
by the insane and the exceptionally gifted are so different from
the places where ordinary men and women live, that there is
little or no common ground of memory to serve as a basis for
understanding or fellow feeling. Words are uttered, but fail to
enlighten. The things and events to which the symbols refer
belong to mutually exclusive realms of experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To see ourselves as others see us is a most
salutary gift. Hardly less important is the capacity to see
others as they see themselves. But what if these others belong to
a different species and inhabit a radically alien universe? For
example, how can the sane get to know what it actually feels like
to be mad? Or, short of being born again as a visionary, a
medium, or a musical genius, how can we ever visit the worlds
which, to Blake, to Swedenborg, to Johann Sebastian Bach, were
home? And how can a man at the extreme limits of ectomorphy and
cerebrotonia ever put himself in the place of one at the limits
of endomorphy and viscerotonia, or, except within certain
circumscribed areas, share the feelings of one who stands at the
limits of mesomorphy and somatotonia? To the unmitigated
behaviorist such questions, I suppose, are meaningless. But for
those who theoretically believe what in practice they know to be
true&#151;namely, that there is an inside to experience as well
as an outside&#151;the problems posed are real problems, all the
more grave for being, some completely insoluble, some soluble
only in exceptional circumstances and by methods not available to
everyone. Thus, it seems virtually certain that I shall never
know what it feels like to be Sir John Falstaff or Joe Louis. On
the other hand, it had always seemed to me possible that, through
hypnosis, for example, or auto-hypnosis, by means of systematic
meditation, or else by taking the appropriate drug, I might so
change my ordinary mode of consciousness as to be able to know,
from the inside, what the visionary, the medium, even the mystic
were talking about. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From what I had read of the mescalin experience I
was convinced in advance that the drug would admit me, at least
for a few hours, into the kind of inner world described by Blake
and AE. But what I had expected did not happen. I had expected to
lie with my eyes shut, looking at visions of many-colored
geometries, of animated architectures, rich with gems and
fabulously lovely, of landscapes with heroic figures, of symbolic
dramas trembling perpetually on the verge of the ultimate
revelation. But I had not reckoned, it was evident, with the
idiosyncrasies of my mental make-up, the facts of my temperament,
training and habits. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have
always been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words of
poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions
greet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something, the
memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or
object. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid
image of what happened yesterday afternoon, of how the Lungarno
used to look before the bridges were destroyed, of the Bayswater
Road when the only buses were green and tiny and drawn by aged
horses at three and a half miles an hour. But such images have
little substance and absolutely no autonomous life of their own.
They stand to real, perceived objects in the same relation as
Homer's ghosts stood to the men of flesh and blood, who came to
visit them in the shades. Only when I have a high temperature do
my mental images come to independent life. To those in whom the
faculty of visualization is strong my inner world must seem
curiously drab, limited and uninteresting. This was the
world&#151;a poor thing but my own&#151;which I expected to see
transformed into something completely unlike itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The change which actually took place in that world
was in no sense revolutionary. Half an hour after swallowing the
drug I became aware of a slow dance of golden lights. A little
later there were sumptuous red surfaces swelling and expanding
from bright nodes of energy that vibrated with a continuously
changing, patterned life. At another time the closing of my eyes
revealed a complex of gray structures, within which pale bluish
spheres kept emerging into intense solidity and, having emerged,
would slide noiselessly upwards, out of sight. But at no time
were there faces or forms of men or animals. I saw no landscapes,
no enormous spaces, no magical growth and metamorphosis of
buildings, nothing remotely like a drama or a parable. The other
world to which mescalin admitted me was not the world of visions;
it existed out there, in what I could see with my eyes open. The
great change was in the realm of objective fact. What had
happened to my subjective universe was relatively unimportant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I took my pill at eleven. An hour and a half later,
I was sitting in my study, looking intently at a small glass
vase. The vase contained only three flowers-a full-blown Belie of
Portugal rose, shell pink with a hint at every petal's base of a
hotter, flamier hue; a large magenta and cream-colored carnation;
and, pale purple at the end of its broken stalk, the bold
heraldic blossom of an iris. Fortuitous and provisional, the
little nosegay broke all the rules of traditional good taste. At
breakfast that morning I had been struck by the lively dissonance
of its colors. But that was no longer the point. I was not
looking now at an unusual flower arrangement. I was seeing what
Adam had seen on the morning of his creation-the miracle, moment
by moment, of naked existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Is it agreeable?&quot; somebody asked.
(During this Part of the experiment, all conversations were
recorded on a dictating machine, and it has been possible for me
to refresh my memory of what was said.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Neither agreeable nor disagreeable,&quot; I
answered. &quot;it just is.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Istigkeit</em>&#151;wasn't that the word
Meister Eckhart liked to use? &quot;Is-ness.&quot; The Being of
Platonic philosophy&#151; except that Plate seems to have made
the enormous, the grotesque mistake of separating Being from
becoming and identifying it with the mathematical abstraction of
the Idea. He could never, poor fellow, have seen a bunch of
flowers shining with their own inner light and all but quivering
under the pressure of the significance with which they were
charged; could never have perceived that what rose and iris and
carnation so intensely signified was nothing more, and nothing
less, than what they were&#151;a transience that was yet eternal
life, a perpetual perishing that was at the same time pure Being,
a bundle of minute, unique particulars in which, by some
unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, was to be seen the
divine source of all existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I continued to look at the flowers, and in their
living light I seemed to detect the qualitative equivalent of
breathing&#151;but of a breathing without returns to a starting
point, with no recurrent ebbs but only a repeated flow from
beauty to heightened beauty, from deeper to ever deeper meaning.
Words like &quot;grace&quot; and &quot;transfiguration&quot; came
to my mind, and this, of course, was what, among other things,
they stood for. My eyes traveled from the rose to the carnation,
and from that feathery incandescence to the smooth scrolls of
sentient amethyst which were the iris. The Beatific Vision, <em>Sat
Chit Ananda</em>, Being-Awareness-Bliss-for the first time I
understood, not on the verbal level, not by inchoate hints or at
a distance, but precisely and completely what those prodigious
syllables referred to. And then I remembered a passage I had read
in one of Suzuki's essays. &quot;What is the Dharma-Body of the
Buddha?&quot; ('&quot;the Dharma-Body of the Buddha&quot; is
another way of saying Mind, Suchness, the Void, the Godhead.) The
question is asked in a Zen monastery by an earnest and bewildered
novice. And with the prompt irrelevance of one of the Marx
Brothers, the Master answers, &quot;The hedge at the bottom of
the garden.&quot; &quot;And the man who realizes this
truth,&quot; the novice dubiously inquires, '&quot;what, may I
ask, is he?&quot; Groucho gives him a whack over the shoulders
with his staff and answers, &quot;A golden-haired lion.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It had been, when I read it, only a vaguely
pregnant piece of nonsense. Now it was all as clear as day, as
evident as Euclid. Of course the Dharma-Body of the Buddha was
the hedge at the bottom of the garden. At the same time, and no
less obviously, it was these flowers, it was anything that
I&#151;or rather the blessed Not-I, released for a moment from my
throttling embrace&#151;cared to look at. The books, for example,
with which my study walls were lined. Like the flowers, they
glowed, when I looked at them, with brighter colors, a profounder
significance. Red books, like rubies; emerald books; books bound
in white jade; books of agate; of aquamarine, of yellow topaz;
lapis lazuli books whose color was so intense, so intrinsically
meaningful, that they seemed to be on the point of leaving the
shelves to thrust themselves more insistently on my attention. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;What about spatial relationships?&quot; the
investigator inquired, as I was looking at the books. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was difficult to answer. True, the perspective
looked rather odd, and the walls of the room no longer seemed to
meet in right angles. But these were not the really important
facts. The really important facts were that spatial relationships
had ceased to matter very much and that my mind was perceiving
the world in terms of other than spatial categories. At ordinary
times the eye concerns itself with such problems as <em>Where?&#151;How
far?&#151;How situated in relation to what?</em> In the mescalin
experience the implied questions to which the eye responds are of
another order. Place and distance cease to be of much interest.
The mind does its Perceiving in terms of intensity of existence,
profundity of significance, relationships within a pattern. I saw
the books, but was not at all concerned with their positions in
space. What I noticed, what impressed itself upon my mind was the
fact that all of them glowed with living light and that in some
the glory was more manifest than in others. In this context
position and the three dimensions were beside the point. Not, of
course, that the category of space had been abolished. When I got
up and walked about, I could do so quite normally, without
misjudging the whereabouts of objects. Space was still there; but
it had lost its predominance. The mind was primarily concerned,
not with measures and locations, but with being and meaning. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And along with indifference to space there went an
even more complete indifference to time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;There seems to be plenty of it,&quot; was all
I would answer, when the investigator asked me to say what I felt
about time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Plenty of it, but exactly how much was entirely
irrelevant. I could, of course, have looked at my watch; but my
watch, I knew, was in another universe. My actual experience had
been, was still, of an indefinite duration or alternatively of a
perpetual present made up of one continually changing apocalypse.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the books the investigator directed my
attention to the furniture. A small typing table stood in the
center of the room; beyond it, from my point of view, was a
wicker chair and beyond that a desk. The three pieces formed an
intricate pattern of horizontals, uprights and diagonals&#151;a
pattern all the more interesting for not being interpreted in
terms of spatial relationships. Table, chair and desk came
together in a composition that was like something by Braque or
Juan Gris, a still life recognizably related to the objective
world, but rendered without depth, without any attempt at
photographic realism. I was looking at my furniture, not as the
utilitarian who has to sit on chairs, to write at desks and
tables, and not as the cameraman or scientific recorder, but as
the pure aesthete whose concern is only with forms and their
relationships within the field of vision or the picture space.
But as I looked, this purely aesthetic, Cubist's-eye view gave
place to what I can only describe as the sacramental vision of
reality. I was back where I had been when I was looking at the
flowers-back in a world where everything shone with the Inner
Light, and was infinite in its significance. The legs, for
example, of that chair&#151;how miraculous their tubularity, how
supernatural their polished smoothness! I spent several
minutes&#151;or was it several centuries?&#151;not merely gazing
at those bamboo legs, but actually <em>being</em> them&#151;-or
rather being myself in them; or, to be still more accurate (for
&quot;I&quot; was not involved in the case, nor in a certain
sense were &quot;they&quot;) being my Not-self in the Not-self
which was the chair. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reflecting on my experience, I find myself agreeing
with the eminent Cambridge philosopher, Dr. C. D. Broad,
&quot;that we should do well to consider much more seriously than
we have hitherto been inclined to do the type of theory which
Bergson put forward in connection with memory and sense
perception. The suggestion is that the function of the brain and
nervous system and sense organs is in the main <em>eliminative</em>
and not productive. Each person is at each moment capable of
remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving
everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The
function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from
being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless
and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should
otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only
that very small and special selection which is likely to be
practically useful.&quot; According to such a theory, each one of
us is potentially Mind at Large. But in so far as we are animals,
our business is at all costs to survive. To make biological
survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the
reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at
the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness
which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this
Particular planet. To formulate and express the contents of this
reduced awareness, man has invented and endlessly elaborated
those symbol-systems and implicit philosophies which we call
languages. Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the
victim of the linguistic tradition into which he has been
born&#151;the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to
the accumulated records of other people's experience, the victim
in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness
is the only awareness and as it bedevils his sense of reality, so
that he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his words
for actual things. That which, in the language of religion, is
called &quot;this world&quot; is the universe of reduced
awareness, expressed, and, as it were, petrified by language. The
various &quot;other worlds,&quot; with which human beings
erratically make contact are so many elements in the totality of
the awareness belonging to Mind at Large. Most people, most of
the time, know only what comes through the reducing valve and is
consecrated as genuinely real by the local language. Certain
persons, however, seem to be born with a kind of by-pass that
circumvents the reducing valve. In others temporary by-passes may
be acquired either spontaneously, or as the result of deliberate
&quot;spiritual exercises,&quot; or through hypnosis, or by means
of drugs. Through these permanent or temporary by-passes there
flows, not indeed the perception &quot;of everything that is
happening everywhere in the universe&quot; (for the by-pass does
not abolish the reducing valve, which still excludes the total
content of Mind at Large), but something more than, and above all
something different from, the carefully selected utilitarian
material which our narrowed, individual minds regard as a
complete, or at least sufficient, picture of reality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The brain is provided with a number of enzyme
systems which serve to co-ordinate its workings. Some of these
enzymes regulate the supply of glucose to the brain cells.
Mescalin inhibits the production of these enzymes and thus lowers
the amount of glucose available to an organ that is in constant
need of sugar. When mescalin reduces the brain's normal ration of
sugar what happens? Too few cases have been observed, and
therefore a comprehensive answer cannot yet be given. But what
happens to the majority of the few who have taken mescalin under
supervision can be summarized as follows. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) The ability to remember and to &quot;think
straight&quot; is little if at all reduced. (Listening to the
recordings of my conversation under the influence of the drug, I
cannot discover that I was then any stupider than I am at
ordinary times.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) Visual impressions are greatly intensified and
the eye recovers some of the perceptual innocence of childhood,
when the sensum was not immediately and automatically
subordinated to the concept. Interest in space is diminished and
interest in time falls almost to zero. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (3) Though the intellect remains unimpaired and
though perception is enormously improved, the will suffers a
profound change for the worse. The mescalin taker sees no reason
for doing anything in particular and finds most of the causes for
which, at ordinary times, he was prepared to act and suffer,
profoundly uninteresting. He can't be bothered with them, for the
good reason that he has better things to think about. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (4) These better things may be experienced (as I
experienced them) &quot;out there,&quot; or &quot;in here,&quot;
or in both worlds, the inner and the outer, simultaneously or
successively. That they are better seems to be self-evident to
all mescalin takers who come to the drug with a sound liver and
an untroubled mind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These effects of mescalin are the sort of effects
you could expect to follow the administration of a drug having
the power to impair the efficiency of the cerebral reducing
valve. When the brain runs out of sugar, the undernourished ego
grows weak, can't be bothered to undertake the necessary chores,
and loses all interest in those spatial and temporal
relationships which mean so much to an organism bent on getting
on in the world. As Mind at Large seeps past the no longer
watertight valve, all kinds of biologically useless things start
to happen. In some cases there may be extra-sensory perceptions.
Other persons discover a world of visionary beauty. To others
again is revealed the glory, the infinite value and
meaningfulness of naked existence, of the given, unconceptualized
event. In the final stage of egolessness there is an
&quot;obscure knowledge&quot; that All is in all&#151;that All is
actually each. This is as near, I take it, as a finite mind can
ever come to &quot;perceiving everything that is happening
everywhere in the universe.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this context, how significant is the enormous
heightening, under mescalin, of the perception of color! For
certain animals it is biologically very important to be able to
distinguish certain hues. But beyond the limits of their
utilitarian spectrum, most creatures are completely color blind.
Bees, for example, spend most of their time &quot;deflowering the
fresh virgins of the spring&quot;; but, as Von Frisch has shown,
they can recognize only a very few colors. Man's highly developed
color sense is a biological luxury&#151;inestimably precious to
him as an intellectual and spiritual being, but unnecessary to
his survival as an animal. To judge by the adjectives which Homer
puts into their mouths, the heroes of the Trojan War hardly
excelled the bees in their capacity to distinguish colors. In
this respect, at least, mankind's advance has been prodigious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mescalin raises all colors to a higher power and
makes the percipient aware of innumerable fine shades of
difference, to which, at ordinary times, he is completely blind.
It would seem that, for Mind at Large, the so-called secondary
characters of things are primary. Unlike Locke, it evidently
feels that colors are more important, better worth attending to,
than masses, positions and dimensions. Like mescalin takers, many
mystics perceive supernaturally brilliant colors, not only with
the inward eye, but even in the objective world around them.
Similar reports are made by psychics and sensitives. There are
certain mediums to whom the mescalin taker's brief revelation is
a matter, during long periods, of daily and hourly experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From this long but indispensable excursion into the
realm of theory, we may now return to the miraculous
facts&#151;four bamboo chair legs in the middle of a room. Like
Wordsworth's daffodils, they brought all manner of
wealth&#151;the gift, beyond price, of a new direct insight into
the very Nature of Things, together with a more modest treasure
of understanding in the field, especially, of the arts. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A rose is a rose is a rose. But these chair legs
were chair legs were St. Michael and all angels. Four or five
hours after the event, when the effects of a cerebral sugar
shortage were wearing off, I was taken for a little tour of the
city, which included a visit, towards sundown, to what is
modestly claimed to be the World's Biggest Drug Store. At the
back of the W.B.D.S., among the toys, the greeting cards and the
comics, stood a row, surprisingly enough, of art books. I picked
up the first volume that came to hand. It was on Van Gogh, and
the picture at which the book opened was &quot;The
Chair&quot;&#151;that astounding portrait of a <em>Ding an Sich</em>,
which the mad painter saw, with a kind of adoring terror, and
tried to render on his canvas. But it was a task to which the
power even of genius proved wholly inadequate. The chair Van Gogh
had seen was obviously the same in essence as the chair I had
seen. But, though incomparably more real than the chairs of
ordinary perception, the chair in his picture remained no more
than an unusually expressive symbol of the fact. The fact had
been manifested Suchness; this was only an emblem. Such emblems
are sources of true knowledge about the Nature of Things, and
this true knowledge may serve to prepare the mind which accepts
it for immediate insights on its own account. But that is all.
However expressive, symbols can never be the things they stand
for. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would be interesting, in this context, to make a
study of the works of art available to the great knowers of
Suchness. What sort of pictures did Eckhart look at? What
sculptures and paintings played a part in the religious
experience of St. John of the Cross, of Hakuin, of Hui-neng, of
William Law? The questions are beyond my power to answer; but I
strongly suspect that most of the great knowers of Suchness paid
very little attention to art&#151;some refusing to have anything
to do with it at all, others being content with what a critical
eye would regard as second-rate, or even, tenth-rate, works. (To
a person whose transfigured and transfiguring mind can see the
All in every <em>this</em>, the first-rateness or tenth-rateness
of even a religious painting will be a matter of the most
sovereign indifference.) Art, I suppose, is only for beginners,
or else for those resolute dead-enders, who have made up their
minds to be content with the <em>ersatz</em> of Suchness, with
symbols rather than with what they signify, with the elegantly
composed recipe in lieu of actual dinner. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I returned the Van Gogh to its rack and picked up
the volume standing next to it. It was a book on Botticelli. I
turned the pages. &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;-never one of my
favorites. &quot;Mars and Venus,&quot; that loveliness so
passionately denounced by poor Ruskin at the height of his
long-drawn sexual tragedy. The marvelously rich and intricate
&quot;Calumny of Apelles.&quot; And then a somewhat less familiar
and not very good picture, &quot;Judith.&quot; My attention was
arrested and I gazed in fascination, not at the pale neurotic
heroine or her attendant, not at the victim's hairy head or the
vernal landscape in the background, but at the purplish silk of
Judith's pleated bodice and long wind-blown skirts. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was something I had seen before-seen that very
morning, between the flowers and the furniture, when I looked
down by chance, and went on passionately staring by choice, at my
own crossed legs. Those folds in the trousers&#151;what a
labyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And the texture of
the gray flannel&#151;how rich, how deeply, mysteriously
sumptuous! And here they were again, in Botticelli's picture. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Civilized human beings wear clothes, therefore
there can be no portraiture, no mythological or historical
storytelling without representations of folded textiles. But
though it may account for the origins, mere tailoring can never
explain the luxuriant development of drapery as a major theme of
all the plastic arts. Artists, it is obvious, have always loved
drapery for its own sake&#151;-or, rather, for their own. When
you paint or carve drapery, you are painting or carving forms
which, for all practical purposes, are non-representational-the
kind of unconditioned forms on which artists even in the most
naturalistic tradition like to let themselves go. In the average
Madonna or Apostle the strictly human, fully representational
element accounts for about ten per cent of the whole. All the
rest consists of many colored variations on the inexhaustible
theme of crumpled wool or linen. And these non-representational
nine-tenths of a Madonna or an Apostle may be just as important
qualitatively as they are in quantity. Very often they set the
tone of the whole work of art, they state the key in which the
theme is being rendered, they express the mood, the temperament,
the attitude to life of the artist. Stoical serenity reveals
itself in the smooth surfaces, the broad untortured folds of
Piero's draperies. Torn between fact and wish, between cynicism
and idealism, Bernini tempers the all but caricatural
verisimilitude of his faces with enormous sartorial abstractions,
which are the embodiment, in stone or bronze, of the everlasting
commonplaces of rhetoric&#151;the heroism, the holiness, the
sublimity to which mankind perpetually aspires, for the most part
in vain. And here are El Greco's disquietingly visceral skirts
and mantles; here are the sharp, twisting, flame-like folds in
which Cosimo Tura clothes his figures: in the first, traditional
spirituality breaks down into a nameless physiological yearning;
in the second, there writhes an agonized sense of the world's
essential strangeness and hostility. Or consider Watteau; his men
and women play lutes, get ready for balls and harlequinades,
embark, on velvet lawns and under noble trees, for the Cythera of
every lover's dream; their enormous melancholy and the flayed,
excruciating sensibility of their creator find expression, not in
the actions recorded, not in the gestures and the faces
portrayed, but in the relief and texture of their taffeta skirts,
their satin capes and doublets. Not an inch of smooth surface
here, not a moment of peace or confidence, only a silken
wilderness of countless tiny pleats and wrinkles, with an
incessant modulation&#151;inner uncertainty rendered with the
perfect assurance of a master hand&#151;of tone into tone, of one
indeterminate color into another. In life, man proposes, God
disposes. In the plastic arts the proposing is done by the
subject matter; that which disposes is ultimately the artist's
temperament, proximately (at least in portraiture, history and
genre) the carved or painted drapery. Between them, these two may
decree that a <em>fête galante</em> shall move to tears, that a
crucifixion shall be serene to the point of cheerfulness, that a
stigmatization shall be almost intolerably sexy, that the
likeness of a prodigy of female brainlessness (I am thinking now
of Ingres' incomparable Mme. Moitessier) shall express the
austerest, the most uncompromising intellectuality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this is not the whole story. Draperies, as I
had now discovered, are much more than devices for the
introduction of non-representational forms into naturalistic
paintings and sculptures. What the rest of us see only under the
influence of mescalin, the artist is congenitally equipped to see
all the time. His perception is not limited to what is
biologically or socially useful. A little of the knowledge
belonging to Mind at Large oozes past the reducing valve of brain
and ego, into his consciousness. It is a knowledge of the
intrinsic significance of every existent. For the artist as for
the mescalin taker draperies are living hieroglyphs that stand in
some peculiarly expressive way for the unfathomable mystery of
pure being. More even than the chair, though less perhaps than
those wholly supernatural flowers, the folds of my gray flannel
trousers were charged with &quot;is-ness.&quot; To what they owed
this privileged status, I cannot say. Is it, perhaps, because the
forms of folded drapery are so strange and dramatic that they
catch the eye and in this way force the miraculous fact of sheer
existence upon the attention? Who knows? What is important is
less the reason for the experience than the experience itself.
Poring over Judith's skirts, there in the World's Biggest Drug
Store, I knew that Botticelli&#151;and not Botticelli alone, but
many others too-had looked at draperies with the same
transfigured and transfiguring eyes as had been mine that
morning. They had seen the <em>Istigkeit</em>, the Allness and
Infinity of folded cloth and had done their best to render it in
paint or stone. Necessarily, of course, without success. For the
glory and the wonder of pure existence belong to another order,
beyond the Power of even the highest art to express. But in
Judith's skirt I could clearly see what, if I had been a painter
of genius, I might have made of my old gray flannels. Not much,
heaven knows, in comparison with the reality, but enough to
delight generation after generation of beholders, enough to make
them understand at least a little of the true significance of
what, in our pathetic imbecility, we call &quot;mere things&quot;
and disregard in favor of television. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;This is how one ought to see,&quot; I kept
saying as I looked down at my trousers, or glanced at the jeweled
books in the shelves, at the legs of my infinitely more than
Van-Goghian chair. &quot;This is how one ought to see, how things
really are.&quot; And yet there were reservations. For if one
always saw like this, one would never want to do anything else.
Just looking, just being the divine Not-self of flower, of book,
of chair, of flannel. That would be enough. But in that case what
about other people? What about human relations? In the recording
of that morning's conversations I find the question constantly
repeated, &quot;What about human relations?&quot; How could one
reconcile this timeless bliss of seeing as one ought to see with
the temporal duties of doing what one ought to do and feeling as
one ought to feel? &quot;One ought to be able,&quot; I said,
&quot;to see these trousers as infinitely important and human
beings as still more infinitely important.&quot; One ought-but in
practice it seemed to be impossible. This participation in the
manifest glory of things left no room, so to speak, for the
ordinary, the necessary concerns of human existence, above all
for concerns involving persons. For Persons are selves and, in
one respect at least, I was now a Not-self, simultaneously
perceiving and being the Not-self of the things around me. To
this new-born Not-self, the behavior, the appearance, the very
thought of the self it had momentarily ceased to be, and of other
selves, its one-time fellows, seemed not indeed distasteful (for
distastefulness was not one of the categories in terms of which I
was thinking), but enormously irrelevant. Compelled by the
investigator to analyze and report on what I was doing (and how I
longed to be left alone with Eternity in a flower, Infinity in
four chair legs and the Absolute in the folds of a pair of
flannel trousers!), I realized that I was deliberately avoiding
the eyes of those who were with me in the room, deliberately
refraining from being too much aware of them. One was my wife,
the other a man I respected and greatly liked; but both belonged
to the world from which, for the moment, mescalin had delivered
me &quot;e world of selves, of time, of moral judgments and
utilitarian considerations, the world (and it was this aspect of
human life which I wished, above all else, to forget) of
self-assertion, of cocksureness, of overvalued words and
idolatrously worshipped notions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At this stage of the proceedings I was handed a
large colored reproduction of the well-known self-portrait by
Cézanne&#151;the head and shoulders of a man in a large straw
hat, red-cheeked, red-lipped, with rich black whiskers and a dark
unfriendly eye. It is a magnificent painting; but it was not as a
painting that I now saw it. For the head promptly took on a third
dimension and came to life as a small goblin-like man looking out
through a window in the page before me. I started to laugh. And
when they asked me why, &quot;What pretensions!&quot; I kept
repeating. &quot;Who on earth does he think he is?&quot; The
question was not addressed to Cézanne in particular, but to the
human species at large. Who did they all think they were? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;It's like Arnold Bennett in the
Dolomites,&quot; I said, suddenly remembering a scene, happily
immortalized in a snapshot, of A.B., some four or five years
before his death, toddling along a wintry road at Cortina
d'Ampezzo. Around him lay the virgin snow; in the background was
a more than gothic aspiration of red crags. And there was dear,
kind, unhappy A.B., consciously overacting the role of his
favorite character in fiction, himself, the Card in person. There
he went, toddling slowly in the bright Alpine sunshine, his
thumbs in the armholes of a yellow waistcoat which bulged, a
little lower down, with the graceful curve of a Regency bow
window at Brighten&#151;his head thrown back as though to aim
some stammered utterance, howitzer-like, at the blue dome of
heaven. What he actually said, I have forgotten; but what his
whole manner, air and posture fairly shouted was, &quot;I'm as
good as those damned mountains.&quot; And in some ways, of
course, he was infinitely better; but not, as he knew very well,
in the way his favorite character in fiction liked to imagine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Successfully (whatever that may mean) or
unsuccessfully, we all overact the part of our favorite character
in fiction. And the fact, the almost infinitely unlikely fact, of
actually being Cézanne makes no difference. For the consummate
painter, with his little pipeline to Mind at Large by-passing the
brain valve and ego-filter, was also and just as genuinely this
whiskered goblin with the unfriendly eye. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For relief I turned back to the folds in my
trousers. &quot;This is how one ought to see,&quot; I repeated
yet again. And I might have added,' 'These are the sort of things
one ought to look at.&quot; Things without pretensions, satisfied
to be merely themselves, sufficient in their Suchness, not acting
a part, not trying, insanely, to go it alone, in isolation from
the Dharma-Body, in Luciferian defiance of the grace of god. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The nearest approach to this,&quot; I said,
&quot;would be a Vermeer.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, a Vermeer. For that mysterious artist was
truly gifted-with the vision that perceives the Dharma-Body as
the hedge at the bottom of the garden, with the talent to render
as much of that vision as the limitations of human capacity
permit, and with the prudence to confine himself in his paintings
to the more manageable aspects of reality; for though Vermeer
represented human beings, he was always a painter of still life.
Cézanne, who told his female sitters to do their best to look
like apples, tried to paint portraits in the same spirit. But his
pippin-like women are more nearly related to Plato's Ideas than
to the Dharma-Body in the hedge. They are Eternity and Infinity
seen, not in sand or flower, but in the abstractions of some very
superior brand of geometry. Vermeer never asked his girls to look
like apples. On the contrary, he insisted on their being girls to
the very limit&#151;but always with the proviso that they refrain
from behaving girlishly. They might sit or quietly stand but
never giggle, never display self-consciousness, never say their
prayers or pine for absent sweethearts, never gossip, never gaze
enviously at other women's babies, never dirt, never love or hate
or work. In the act of doing any of these things they would
doubtless become more intensely themselves, but would cease, for
that very reason, to manifest their divine essential Not-self. In
Blake's phrase, the doors of Vermeer's perception were only
partially cleansed. A single panel had become almost perfectly
transparent; the rest of the door was still muddy. The essential
Not-self could be perceived very clearly in things and in living
creatures on the hither side of good and evil. In human beings it
was visible only when they were in repose, their minds
untroubled, their bodies motionless. In these circumstances
Vermeer could see Suchness in all its heavenly beauty&#151;could
see and, in some small measure, render it&#151;in a subtle and
sumptuous still life. Vermeer is undoubtedly the greatest painter
of human still lives. But there have been others, for example,
Vermeer's French contemporaries, the Le Nain brothers. They set
out, I suppose, to be genre painters; but what they actually
produced was a series of human still lives, in which their
cleansed perception of the infinite significance of all things is
rendered not, as with Vermeer, by subtle enrichment of color and
texture, but by a heightened clarity, an obsessive distinctness
of form, within an austere, almost monochromatic tonality. In our
own day we have had Vuillard, the painter, at his best, of
unforgettably splendid pictures of the Dharma-Body manifested in
a bourgeois bedroom, of the Absolute blazing away in the midst of
some stockbroker's family in a suburban garden, taking tea. </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>Ce qui fait que I'ancien bandagiste renie<br>
    Le comptoir dont le faste alléchait les passants,<br>
    C'est son jardin d'Auteuil, où, veufs de tout encens,<br>
    Les Zinnias ont l'air d'être en tôle vernie.</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Laurent Taillade the spectacle was merely
obscene. But if the retired rubber goods merchant had sat still
enough, Vuillard would have seen in him only the Dharma-Body,
would have painted, in the zinnias, the goldfish pool, the
villa's Moorish tower and Chinese lanterns, a corner of Eden
before the Fall. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But meanwhile my question remained unanswered. How
was this cleansed perception to be reconciled with a proper
concern with human relations, with the necessary chores and
duties, to say nothing of charity and practical compassion? The
age-old debate between the actives and the contemplatives was
being renewed&#151;renewed, so far as I was concerned, with an
unprecedented poignancy. For until this morning I had known
contemplation only in its humbler, its more ordinary
forms&#151;as discursive thinking; as a rapt absorption in poetry
or painting or music; as a patient waiting upon those
inspirations, without which even the prosiest writer cannot hope
to accomplish anything; as occasional glimpses, in Nature, of
Wordsworth's &quot;something far more deeply interfused&quot;; as
systematic silence leading, sometimes, to hints of an
&quot;obscure knowledge.&quot; But now I knew contemplation at
its height. At its height, but not yet in its fullness. For in
its fullness the way of Mary includes the way of Martha and
raises it, so to speak, to its own higher power. Mescalin opens
up the way of Mary, but shuts the door on that of Martha. It
gives access to contemplation&#151;but to a contemplation that is
incompatible with action and even with the will to action, the
very thought of action. In the intervals between his revelations
the mescalin taker is apt to feel that, though in one way
everything is supremely as it should be, in another there is
something wrong. His problem is essentially the same as that
which confronts the quietist, the arhat and, on another level,
the landscape painter and the painter of human still lives.
Mescalin can never solve that problem; it can only pose it,
apocalyptically, for those to whom it had never before presented
itself. The full and final solution can be found only by those
who are prepared to implement the right kind of <em>Weltanschauung</em>
by means of the right kind of behavior and the right kind of
constant and unstrained alertness. Over against the quietist
stands the active-contemplative, the saint, the man who, in
Eckhart's phrase, is ready to come down from the seventh heaven
in order to bring a cup of water to his sick brother. Over
against the <em>arhat</em>, retreating from appearances into an
entirely transcendental Nirvana, stands the Bodhisattva, for whom
Suchness and the world of contingencies are one, and for whose
boundless compassion every one of those contingencies is an
occasion not only for transfiguring insight, but also for the
most practical charity. And in the universe of art, over against
Vermeer and the other Painters of human still lives, over against
the masters of Chinese and Japanese landscape painting, over
against Constable and Turner, against Sisley and Seurat and
Cézanne, stands the all-inclusive art of Rembrandt. These are
enormous names, inaccessible eminences. For myself, on this
memorable May morning, I could only be grateful for an experience
which had shown me, more clearly than I had ever seen it before,
the true nature of the challenge and the completely liberating
response. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me add, before we leave this subject, that
there is no form of contemplation, even the most quietistic,
which is without its ethical values. Half at least of all
morality is negative and consists in keeping out of mischief. The
Lord's Prayer is less than fifty words long, and six of those
words are devoted to asking God not to lead us into temptation.
The one-sided contemplative leaves undone many things that he
ought to do; but to make up for it, he refrains from doing a host
of things he ought not to do. The sum of evil, Pascal remarked,
would be much diminished if men could only learn to sit quietly
in their rooms. The contemplative whose perception has been
cleansed does not have to stay in his room. He can go about his
business, so completely satisfied to see and be a part of the
divine Order of Things that he will never even be tempted to
indulge in what Traherne called &quot;the dirty Devices of the
world.&quot; When we feel ourselves to be sole heirs of the
universe, when &quot;the sea flows in our veins ... and the stars
are our jewels,&quot; when all things are perceived as infinite
and holy, what motive can we have for covetousness or
self-assertion, for the pursuit of power or the drearier forms of
pleasure? Contemplatives are not likely to become gamblers, or
procurers, or drunkards; they do not as a rule preach
intolerance, or make war; do not find it necessary to rob,
swindle or grind the faces of the poor. And to these enormous
negative virtues we may add another which, though hard to define,
is both positive and important. The <i>arhat</i> and the quietist
may not practice contemplation in its fullness; but if they
practice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports of
another, a transcendent country of the mind; and if they practice
it in the height, they will become conduits through which some
beneficent influence can how out of that other country into a
world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack of it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile I had turned, at the investigator's
request, from the portrait of Cézanne to what was going on,
inside my head, when I shut my eyes. This time, the inscape was
curiously unrewarding. The field of vision was filled with
brightly colored, constantly changing structures that seemed to
be made of plastic or enameled tin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Cheap,&quot; I commented. &quot;Trivial. Like
things in a five-and-ten.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all this shoddiness existed in a closed,
cramped universe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;It's as though one were below decks in a
ship,&quot; I said. &quot;A five-and-ten-cent ship.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as I looked, it became very clear that this
five-and-ten-cent ship was in some way connected with human
pretensions, with the portrait of Cézanne, with A.B. among the
Dolomites overacting his favorite character in fiction. This
suffocating interior of a dime-store ship was my own personal
self; these gimcrack mobiles of tin and plastic were my personal
contributions to the universe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I felt the lesson to be salutary, but was sorry,
none the less, that it had had to be administered at this moment
and in this form. As a rule the mescalin taker discovers an inner
world as manifestly a datum, as self-evidently &quot;infinite and
holy,&quot; as that transfigured outer world which I had seen
with my eyes open. From the first, my own case had been
different. Mescalin had endowed me temporarily with the power to
see things with my eyes shut; but it could not, or at least on
this occasion did not, reveal an inscape remotely comparable to
my flowers or chair or flannels &quot;out there.&quot; What it
had allowed me to perceive inside was not the Dharma-Body, in
images, but my own mind; not Suchness, but a set of
symbols&#151;in other words, a homemade substitute for Suchness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most visualizers are transformed by mescalin into
visionaries. Some of them&#151;and they are Perhaps more numerous
than is generally supposed&#151;require no transformation; they
are visionaries all the time. The mental species to which Blake
belonged is fairly widely distributed even in the
urban-industrial societies of the present day. The poet-artist's
uniqueness does not consist in the fact that (to quote from his <em>Descriptive
Catalogue</em>) he actually <em>saw</em> &quot;those wonderful
originals called in the Sacred Scriptures the Cherubim.&quot; It
does not consist in the fact that &quot;these wonderful originals
seen in my visions, were some of them one hundred feet in height
... all containing mythological and recondite meaning.&quot; It
consists solely in his ability to render, in words or (somewhat
less successfully) in line and color, some hint at least of a not
excessively uncommon experience. The untalented visionary may
perceive an inner reality no less tremendous, beautiful and
significant than the world beheld by Blake; but he lacks
altogether the ability to express, in literary or plastic
symbols, what he has seen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the records of religion and the surviving
monuments of poetry and the plastic arts it is very plain that,
at most times and in most places, men have attached more
importance to the inscape than to objective existents, have felt
that what they saw with their eyes shut possessed a spiritually
higher significance than what they saw with their eyes open. The
reason? Familiarity breeds contempt, and how to survive is a
problem ranging in urgency from the chronically tedious to the
excruciating. The outer world is what we wake up to every morning
of our lives, is the place where, willy-nilly, we must try to
make our living. In the inner world there is neither work nor
monotony. We visit it only in dreams and musings, and its
strangeness is such that we never find the same world on two
successive occasions. What wonder, then, if human beings in their
search for the divine have generally preferred to look within!
Generally, but not always. In their art no less than in their
religion, the Taoists and the Zen Buddhists looked beyond visions
to the Void, and through the Void at &quot;the ten thousand
things&quot; of objective reality. Because of their doctrine of
the Word made flesh, Christians should have been able, from the
first, to adopt a similar attitude towards the universe around
them. But because of the doctrine of the Fall, they found it very
hard to do so. As recently as three hundred years ago an
expression of thoroughgoing world denial and even world
condemnation was both orthodox and comprehensible. &quot;We
should feel wonder at nothing at all in Nature except only the
Incarnation of Christ.&quot; In the seventeenth century,
Lallemant's phrase seemed to make sense. Today it has the ring of
madness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In China the rise of landscape painting to the rank
of a major art form took place about a thousand, in Japan about
six hundred and in Europe about three hundred, years ago. The
equation of Dharma-Body with hedge was made by those Zen Masters,
who wedded Taoist naturalism with Buddhist transcendentalism. It
was, therefore, only in the Far East that landscape painters
consciously regarded their art as religious. In the West
religious painting was a matter of portraying sacred personages,
of illustrating hallowed texts. Landscape painters regarded
themselves as secularists. Today we recognize in Seurat one of
the supreme masters of what may be called mystical landscape
painting. And yet this man who was able, more effectively than
any other, to render the One in the many, became quite indignant
when somebody praised him for the &quot;poetry&quot; of his work.
'1 merely apply the System,&quot; he protested. In other words he
was merely a <em>pointilliste</em> and, in his own eyes, nothing
else. A similar anecdote is told of John Constable. One day
towards the end of his life, Blake met Constable at Hampstead and
was shown one of the younger artist's sketches. In spite of his
contempt for naturalistic art, the old visionary knew a good
thing when be saw it-except of course, when it was by Rubens.
'This is not drawing,&quot; he cried, &quot;this is
inspiration!&quot; &quot;I had meant it to be drawing,&quot; was
Constable's characteristic answer. Both men were right. It <em>was</em>
drawing, precise and veracious, and at the same time it <em>was</em>
inspiration &#151;inspiration of an order at least as high as
Blake's. The pine trees on the Heath had actually been seen as
identical with the Dharma-Body. The sketch was a rendering,
necessarily imperfect but still profoundly impressive, of what a
cleansed perception had revealed to the open eyes of a great
painter. From a contemplation, in the tradition of Wordsworth and
Whitman, of the Dharma- Body as hedge, and from visions, such as
Blake's, of the &quot;wonderful originals&quot; within the mind,
contemporary poets have retreated into an investigation of the
personal, as opposed to the more than personal, subconscious and
to a rendering, in highly abstract terms, not of the given,
objective fact, but of mere scientific and theological notions.
And something similar has happened in the held of painting, where
we have witnessed a general retreat from landscape, the
predominant art form of the nineteenth century. This retreat from
landscape has not been into that other, inner divine Datum, with
which most of the traditional schools of the past were concerned,
that Archetypal World, where men have always found the raw
materials of myth and religion. No, it has been a retreat from
the outward Datum into the personal subconscious, into a mental
world more squalid and more tightly closed than even the world of
conscious personality. These contraptions of tin and highly
colored plastic &#151;where had I seen them before? In every
picture gallery that exhibits the latest in nonrepresentational
art. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now someone produced a phonograph and put a
record on the turntable. I listened with pleasure, but
experienced nothing comparable to my seen apocalypses of flowers
or flannel. Would a naturally gifted musician <em>hear</em> the
revelations which, for me, had been exclusively visual? It would
be interesting to make the experiment. Meanwhile, though not
transfigured, though retaining its normal quality and intensity,
the music contributed not a little to my understanding of what
had happened to me and of the wider problems which those
happenings had raised. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instrumental music, oddly enough, left me rather
cold. Mozart's C-Minor Piano Concerto was interrupted after the
first movement, and a recording of some madrigals by Gesualdo
took its place. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;These voices,&quot; I said appreciatively,
&quot;these voices&#151; they're a kind of bridge back to the
human world.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And a bridge they remained even while singing the
most startlingly chromatic of the mad prince's compositions.
Through the uneven phrases of the madrigals, the music pursued
its course, never sticking to the same key for two bars together.
In Gesualdo, that fantastic character out of a Webster melodrama,
psychological disintegration had exaggerated, had pushed to the
extreme limit, a tendency inherent in modal as opposed to fully
tonal music. The resulting works sounded as though they might
have been written by the later Schoenberg. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;And yet,&quot; I felt myself constrained to
say, as I listened to these strange products of a
Counter-Reformation psychosis working upon a late medieval art
form, &quot;and yet it does not matter that he's all in bits. The
whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order,
is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails
even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the
broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a
completely coherent work. At least you aren't lulled into a sense
of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order.
You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate
order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its
advantages. But of course it's dangerous, horribly dangerous.
Suppose you couldn't get back, out of the chaos .. .&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From Gesualdo's madrigals we jumped, across a gulf
of three centuries, to Alban Berg and the <em>Lyric Suite</em>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;This&quot; I announced in advance, &quot;is
going to be hell.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, as it turned out, I was wrong. Actually the
music sounded rather funny. Dredged up from the personal
subconscious, agony succeeded twelve-tone agony; but what struck
me was only the essential incongruity between a psychological
disintegration even completer than Gesualdo's and the prodigious
resources, in talent and technique, employed in its expression. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Isn't he sorry for himself!&quot; I commented
with a derisive lack of sympathy. And then, &quot;<em>Katzenmusik</em>&#151;
learned <em>Katzenmusik</em>.&quot; And finally, after a few more
minutes of the anguish, &quot;Who cares what his feelings are?
Why can't he pay attention to something else?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a criticism of what is undoubtedly a very
remarkable work, it was unfair and inadequate-but not, I think,
irrelevant. I cite it for what it is worth and because that is
how, in a state of pure contemplation, I reacted to the <em>Lyric
Suite. </em> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When it was over, the investigator suggested a walk
in the garden. I was willing; and though my body seemed to have
dissociated itself almost completely from my mind&#151;or, to be
more accurate, though my awareness of the transfigured outer
world was no longer accompanied by an awareness of my physical
organism&#151;I found myself able to get up, open the French
window and walk out with only a minimum of hesitation. It was
odd, of course, to feel that &quot;I&quot; was not the same as
these arms and legs &quot;out there,&quot; as this wholly
objective trunk and neck and even head. It was odd; but one soon
got used to it. And anyhow the body seemed perfectly well able to
look after itself. In reality, of course, it always does look
after itself. All that the conscious ego can do is to formulate
wishes, which are then carried out by forces which it controls
very little and understands not at all. When it does anything
more&#151;when it tries too hard, for example, when it worries,
when it becomes apprehensive about the future&#151;it lowers the
effectiveness of those forces and may even cause the devitalized
body to fall ill. In my present state, awareness was not referred
to as ego; it was, so to speak, on its own. This meant that the
physiological intelligence controlling the body was also on its
own. For the moment that interfering neurotic who, in waking
hours, tries to run the show, was blessedly out of the way. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the French window I walked out under a kind of
pergola covered in part by a climbing rose tree, in part by
laths, one inch wide with half an inch of space between them. The
sun was shining and the shadows of the laths made a zebra-like
pattern on the ground and across the seat and back of a garden
chair, which was standing at this end of the pergola. That
chair&#151;shall I ever forget it? Where the shadows fell on the
canvas upholstery, stripes of a deep but glowing indigo
alternated with stripes of an incandescence so intensely bright
that it was hard to believe that they could be made of anything
but blue fire. For what seemed an immensely long time I gazed
without knowing, even without wishing to know, what it was that
confronted me. At any other time I would have seen a chair barred
with alternate light and shade. Today the percept had swallowed
up the concept. I was so completely absorbed in looking, so
thunderstruck by what I actually saw, that I could not be aware
of anything else. Garden furniture, laths, sunlight,
shadow&#151;these were no more than names and notions, mere
verbalizations, for utilitarian or scientific purposes, after the
event. The event was this succession of azure furnace doors
separated by gulfs of unfathomable gentian. It was inexpressibly
wonderful, wonderful to the point, almost, of being terrifying.
And suddenly I had an inkling of what it must feel like to be
mad. Schizophrenia has its heavens as well as its hells and
purgatories. I remember what an old friend, dead these many
years, told me about his mad wife. One day in the early stages of
the disease, when she still had her lucid intervals he had gone
to talk to her about their children. She listened for a time,
then cut him short. How could he bear to waste his time on a
couple of absent children, when all that really mattered, here
and now, was the unspeakable beauty of the patterns he made, in
this brown tweed jacket, every time he moved his arms? Alas, this
Paradise of cleansed perception, of pure one-sided contemplation,
was not to endure. The blissful intermissions became rarer,
became briefer, until finally there were no more of them; there
was only horror. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most takers of mescalin experience only the
heavenly part of schizophrenia. The drug brings hell and
purgatory only to those who have had a recent case of jaundice,
or who suffer from periodical depressions or a chronic anxiety.
If, like the other drugs of remotely comparable power, mescalin
were notoriously toxic, the taking of it would be enough, of
itself, to cause anxiety. But the reasonably healthy person knows
in advance that, so far as he is concerned, mescalin is
completely innocuous, that its effects will pass off after eight
or ten hours, leaving no hangover and consequently no craving for
a renewal of the dose. Fortified by this knowledge, he embarks
upon the experiment without fear&#151;in other words, without any
disposition to convert an unprecedentedly strange and other than
human experience into something appalling, something actually
diabolical. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Confronted by a chair which looked like the Last
Judgment&#151;or, to be more accurate, by a Last Judgment which,
after a long time and with considerable difficulty, I recognized
as a chair&#151;I found myself all at once on the brink of panic.
This, I suddenly felt, was going too far. Too far, even though
the going was into intenser beauty, deeper significance. The
fear, as I analyze it in retrospect, was of being overwhelmed, of
disintegrating under a pressure of reality greater than a mind,
accustomed to living most of the time in a cosy world of symbols,
could possibly bear. The literature of religious experience
abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those
who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation
of the <em>Mysterium tremendum</em>. In theological language,
this fear is due to the in- compatibility between man's egotism
and the divine purity, between man's self-aggravated separateness
and the infinity of God. Following Boehme and William Law, we may
say that, by unregenerate souls, the divine Light at its full
blaze can be apprehended only as a burning, purgatorial fire. An
almost identical doctrine is to be found in <em>The Tibetan Book
of the Dead</em>, where the departed soul is described as
shrinking in agony from the Pure Light of the Void, and even from
the lesser, tempered Lights, in order to rush headlong into the
comforting darkness of selfhood as a reborn human being, or even
as a beast, an unhappy ghost, a denizen of hell. Anything rather
than the burning brightness of unmitigated Reality&#151;anything!
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The schizophrenic is a soul not merely
unregenerate, but desperately sick into the bargain. His sickness
consists in the inability to take refuge from inner and outer
reality (as the sane person habitually does) in the homemade
universe of common sense&#151;the strictly human world of useful
notions, shared symbols and socially acceptable conventions. The
schizophrenic is like a man permanently under the influence of
mescalin, and therefore unable to shut off the experience of a
reality which he is not holy enough to live with, which he cannot
explain away because it is the most stubborn of primary facts,
and which, because it never permits him to look at the world with
merely human eyes, scares him into interpreting its unremitting
strangeness, its burning intensity of significance, as the
manifestations of human or even cosmic malevolence, calling for
the most desperate countermeasures, from murderous violence at
one end of the scale to catatonia, or psychological suicide, at
the other. And once embarked upon the downward, the infernal
road, one would never be able to stop. That, now, was only too
obvious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;If you started in the wrong way,&quot; I said
in answer to the investigator's questions, &quot;everything that
happened would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would
all be self-validating, You couldn't draw a breath without
knowing it was part of the plot.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;So you think you know where madness
lies?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My answer was a convinced and heartfelt,
&quot;Yes.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;And you couldn't control it?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;No I couldn't control it. If one began with
fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on to
the conclusion.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Would you be able,&quot; my wife asked,
&quot;to fix your attention on what <em>The Tibetan Book of The
Dead </em>calls the Clear Light?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was doubtful. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Would it keep the evil away, if you could
hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I considered the question for some time.
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; I answered at last, &quot;perhaps I
could&#151;but only if there were somebody there to tell me about
the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point,
I suppose, of the Tibetan ritual&#151;someone sitting there all
the time and telling you what's what.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After listening to the record of this part of the
experiment, I took down my copy of Evans-Wentz's edition of <em>The
Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>, and opened at random. &quot;O
nobly born, let not thy mind be distracted.&quot; That was the
problem&#151;to remain undistracted. Undistracted by the memory
of past sins, by imagined pleasure, by the bitter aftertaste of
old wrongs and humiliations, by all the fears and hates and
cravings that ordinarily eclipse the Light. What those Buddhist
monks did for the dying and the dead, might not the modern
psychiatrist do for the insane? Let there be a voice to assure
them, by day and even while they are asleep, that in spite of all
the terror, all the bewilderment and confusion, the ultimate
Reality remains unshakably itself and is of the same substance as
the inner light of even the most cruelly tormented mind. By means
of such devices as recorders, clock-controlled switches, public
address systems and pillow speakers it should be very easy to
keep the inmates of even an understaffed institution constantly
reminded of this primordial fact. Perhaps a few of the lost souls
might in this way be helped to win some measure of control over
the universe&#151;at once beautiful and appalling, but always
other than human, always totally incomprehensible-in which they
find themselves condemned to live. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; None too soon, I was steered away from the
disquieting splendors of my garden chair. Drooping in green
parabolas from the hedge, the ivy fronds shone with a kind of
glassy, jade-like radiance. A moment later a clump of Red Hot
Pokers, in full bloom, had exploded into my field of vision. So
passionately alive that they seemed to be standing on the very
brink of utterance, the flowers strained upwards into the blue.
Like the chair under the laths, they protected too much. I looked
down at the leaves and discovered a cavernous intricacy of the
most delicate green lights and shadows, pulsing with
undecipherable mystery. </p>

<p><center> Roses : <br>
The flowers are easy to paint,<br>
The leaves difficult. </center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shiki's <em>haiku</em> (which I quote in R. H.
Blyth's translation) expresses, by indirection, exactly what I
then felt&#151; the excessive, the too obvious glory of the
flowers, as contrasted with the subtler miracle of their foliage.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We walked out into the street. A large pale blue
auto- mobile was standing at the curb. At the sight of it, I was
suddenly overcome by enormous merriment. What complacency, what
an absurd self-satisfaction beamed from those bulging surfaces of
glossiest enamel! Man had created the thing in his own
image&#151;or rather in the image of his favorite character in
fiction. I laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We re-entered the house. A meal had been prepared.
Somebody, who was not yet identical with myself, fell to with
ravenous appetite. From a considerable distance and without much
interest, I looked on. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When the meal had been eaten, we got into the car
and went for a drive. The effects of the mescalin were already on
the decline: but the flowers in the gardens still trembled on the
brink of being supernatural, the pepper trees and carobs along
the side streets still manifestly belonged to some sacred grove.
Eden alternated with Dodona. Yggdrasil with the mystic Rose. And
then, abruptly, we were at an intersection, waiting to cross
Sunset Boulevard. Before us the cars were rolling by in a steady
stream&#151;thousands of them, all bright and shiny like an
advertiser's dream and each more ludicrous than the last. Once
again I was convulsed with laughter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Red Sea of traffic parted at last, and we
crossed into another oasis of trees and lawns and roses. In a few
minutes we had climbed to a vantage point in the hills, and there
was the city spread out beneath us. Rather disappointingly, it
looked very like the city I had seen on other occasions. So far
as I was concerned, transfiguration was proportional to distance.
The nearer, the more divinely other. This vast, dim panorama was
hardly different from itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We drove on, and so long as we remained in the
hills, with view succeeding distant view, significance was at its
everyday level, well below transfiguration point. The magic began
to work again only when we turned down into a new suburb and were
gliding between two rows of houses. Here, in spite of the
peculiar hideousness of the architecture, there were renewals of
transcendental otherness, hints of the morning's heaven. Brick
chimneys and green composition roofs glowed in the sunshine, like
fragments of the New Jerusalem. And all at once I saw what Guardi
had seen and (with what incomparable skill) had so often rendered
in his paintings&#151;a stucco wall with a shadow slanting across
it, blank but unforgettably beautiful, empty but charged with all
the meaning and the mystery of existence. The revelation dawned
and was gone again within a fraction of a second. The car had
moved on; time was uncovering another manifestation of the
eternal Suchness. &quot;Within sameness there is difference. But
that difference should be different from sameness is in no wise
the intention of all the Buddhas. Their intention is both
totality and differentiation.&quot; This bank of red and white
geraniums, for example&#151;it was entirely different from that
stucco wall a hundred yards up the road. But the
&quot;is-ness&quot; of both was the same, the eternal quality of
their transience was the same. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An hour later, with ten more miles and the visit to
the World's Biggest Drug Store safely behind us, we were back at
home, and I had returned to that reassuring but profoundly
unsatisfactory state known as &quot;being in one's right
mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That humanity at large will ever be able to
dispense with Artificial Paradises seems very unlikely. Most men
and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best so
monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing
to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has
always been one of the principal appetites of the soul. Art and
religion, carnivals and saturnalia, dancing and listening to
oratory&#151;all these have served, in H. G. Wells's phrase, as
Doors in the Wall. And for private, far everyday use there have
always been chemical intoxicants. All the vegetable sedatives and
narcotics, all the euphorics that grow on trees, the
hallucinogens that ripen in berries or can be squeezed from
roots&#151;all, without exception, have been known and
systematically used by human beings from time immemorial. And to
these natural modifiers of consciousness modern science has added
its quota of synthetics&#151;chloral, for example, and
benzedrine, the bromides and the barbiturates. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of these modifiers of consciousness cannot now
be taken except under doctor's orders, or else illegally and at
considerable risk. For unrestricted use the West has permitted
only alcohol and tobacco. All the other chemical Doors in the
Wall are labeled Dope, and their unauthorized takers are Fiends. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We now spend a good deal more on drink and smoke
than we spend on education. This, of course, is not surprising.
The urge to escape from selfhood and the environment is in almost
everyone almost all the time. The urge to do something for the
young is strong only in parents, and in them only for the few
years during which their children go to school. Equally
unsurprising is the current attitude towards drink and smoke. In
spite of the growing army of hopeless alcoholics, in spite of the
hundreds of thousands of persons annually maimed or killed by
drunken drivers, popular comedians still crack jokes about
alcohol and its addicts. And in spite of the evidence linking
cigarettes with lung cancer, practically everybody regards
tobacco smoking as being hardly less normal and natural than
eating. From the point of view of the rationalist utilitarian
this may seem odd. For the historian, it is exactly what you
would expect. A firm conviction of the material reality of Hell
never prevented medieval Christians from doing what their
ambition, lust or covetousness suggested. Lung cancer, traffic
accidents and the millions of miserable and misery-creating
alcoholics are facts even more certain than was, in Dante's day,
the fact of the Inferno. But all such facts are remote and
unsubstantial compared with the near, felt fact of a craving,
here and now, for release or sedation, for a drink or a smoke. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ours is the age, among other things, of the
automobile and of rocketing population. Alcohol is incompatible
with safety on the roads, and its production, like that of
tobacco, condemns to virtual sterility many millions of acres of
the most fertile soil. The problems raised by alcohol and tobacco
cannot, it goes without saying, be solved by prohibition. The
universal and ever-present urge to self-transcendence is not to
be abolished by slamming the currently popular Doors in the Wall.
The only reasonable policy is to open other, better doors in the
hope of inducing men and women to exchange their old bad habits
for new and less harmful ones. Some of these other, better doors
will be social and technological in nature, others religious or
psychological, others dietetic, educational, athletic. But the
need for frequent chemical vacations from intolerable selfhood
and repulsive surroundings will undoubtedly remain. What is
needed is a new drug which will relieve and console our suffering
species without doing more harm in the long run than it does good
in the short. Such a drug must be potent in minute doses and
synthesizable. If it does not possess these qualities, its
production, like that of wine, beer, spirits and tobacco will
interfere with the raising of indispensable food and fibers. It
must be less toxic than opium or cocaine, less likely to produce
undesirable social consequences than alcohol or the barbiturates,
less inimical to heart and lungs than the tars and nicotine of
cigarettes. And, on the positive side, it should produce changes
in consciousness more interesting, more intrinsically valuable
than mere sedation or dreaminess, delusions of omnipotence or
release from inhibition. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To most people, mescalin is almost completely
innocuous. Unlike alcohol, it does not drive the taker into the
kind of uninhibited action which results in brawls, crimes of
violence and traffic accidents. A man under the influence of
mescalin quietly minds his own business. Moreover, the business
he minds is an experience of the most enlightening kind, which
does not have to be paid for (and this is surely important) by a
compensatory hangover. Of the long-range consequences of regular
mescalin taking we know very little. The Indians who consume
peyote buttons do not seem to be physically or morally degraded
by the habit. However, the available evidence is still scarce and
<a href="#target2">sketchy.*</a> <a name="back2"></a> Although
obviously superior to cocaine, opium, alcohol and tobacco,
mescalin is not yet the ideal drug. Along with the happily
transfigured majority of mescalin takers there is a minority that
finds in the drug only hell or purgatory. Moreover, for a drug
that is to be used, like alcohol, for general consumption, its
effects last for an inconveniently long time. But chemistry and
physiology are capable nowadays of practically anything. If the
psychologists and sociologists will define the ideal, the
neurologists and pharmacologists can be relied upon to discover
the means whereby that ideal can be realized or at least (for
perhaps this kind of ideal can never, in the very nature of
things, be fully realized) more nearly approached than in the
wine-bibbing past, the whisky-drinking, marijuana-smoking and
barbiturate-swallowing present. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The urge to transcend self-conscious selfhood is,
as I have said, a principal appetite of the soul. When, for
whatever reason, men and women fail to transcend themselves by
means of worship, good works and spiritual exercises, they are
apt to resort to religion's chemical surrogates-alcohol and
&quot;goof pills&quot; in the modern West, alcohol and opium in
the East, hashish in the Mohammedan world, alcohol and marijuana
in Central America, alcohol and coca in the Andes, alcohol and
the barbiturates in the more up-to-date regions of South America.
In <i>Poisons Sacrés, Ivresses Divines</i> Philippe de Felice
has written at length and with a wealth of documentation on the
immemorial connection between religion and the taking of drugs.
Here, in summary or in direct quotation, are his conclusions. The
employment for religious purposes of toxic substances is
&quot;extraordinarily widespread.... The practices studied in
this volume can be observed in every region of the earth, among
primitives no less than among those who have reached a high pitch
of civilization. We are therefore dealing not with exceptional
facts, which might justifiably be overlooked, but with a general
and, in the widest sense of the word, a human phenomenon, the
kind of phenomenon which cannot be disregarded by anyone who is
trying to discover what religion is, and what are the deep needs
which it must satisfy.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ideally, everyone should be able to find
self-transcendence in some form of pure or applied religion. In
practice it seems very unlikely that this hoped for consummation
will ever be realized. There are, and doubtless there always will
be, good churchmen and good churchwomen for whom, unfortunately,
piety is not enough. The late G. K. Chesterton, who wrote at
least as lyrically of drink as of devotion, may serve as their
eloquent spokesman. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The modern churches, with some exceptions among the
Protestant denominations, tolerate alcohol; but even the most
tolerant have made no attempt to convert the drug to
Christianity, or to sacramentalize its use. The pious drinker is
forced to take his religion in one compartment, his
religion-surrogate in another. And perhaps this is inevitable.
Drinking cannot be sacramentalized except in religions which set
no store on decorum. The worship of Dionysos or the Celtic god of
beer was a loud and disorderly affair. The rites of Christianity
are incompatible with even religious drunkenness. This does no
harm to the distillers, but is very bad for Christianity.
Countless persons desire self-transcendence and would be glad to
find it in church. But, alas, &quot;the hungry sheep look up and
are not fed.&quot; They take part in rites, they listen to
sermons, they repeat prayers; but their thirst remains
unassuaged. Disappointed, they turn to the bottle. For a time at
least and in a kind of way, it works. Church may still be
attended; but it is no more than the Musical Bank of Butler's
Erewhon. God may still be acknowledged; but He is God only on the
verbal level, only in a strictly Pickwickian sense. The effective
object of worship is the bottle and the sole religious experience
is that state of uninhibited and belligerent euphoria which
follows the ingestion of the third cocktail. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We see, then, that Christianity and alcohol do not
and cannot mix. Christianity and mescalin seem to be much more
compatible. This has been demonstrated by many tribes of Indians,
from Texas to as far north as Wisconsin. Among these tribes are
to be found groups affiliated with the Native American Church, a
sect whose principal rite is a kind of Early Christian agape, or
love feast, where slices of peyote take the place of the
sacramental bread and wine. These Native Americans regard the
cactus as God's special gift to the Indians, and equate its
effects with the workings of the divine Spirit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor J. S. Slotkin, one of the very few white
men ever to have participated in the rites of a Peyotist
congregation, says of his fellow worshipers that they are
&quot;certainly not stupefied or drunk.... They never get out of
rhythm or fumble their words, as a drunken or stupefied man would
do.... They are all quiet, courteous and considerate of one
another. I have never been in any white man's house of worship
where there is either so much religious feeling or decorum.&quot;
And what, we may ask, are these devout and well-behaved Peyotists
experiencing? Not the mild sense of virtue which sustains the
average Sunday churchgoer through ninety minutes of boredom. Not
even those high feelings, inspired by thoughts of the Creator and
the Redeemer, the Judge and the Comforter, which animate the
pious. For these Native Americans, religious experience is
something more direct and illuminating, more spontaneous, less
the homemade product of the superficial, self-conscious mind.
Sometimes (according to the reports collected by Dr. Slotkin)
they see visions, which may be of Christ Himself. Sometimes they
hear the voice of the Great Spirit. Sometimes they become aware
of the presence of God and of those personal shortcomings which
must be corrected if they are to do His will. The practical
consequences of these chemical openings of doors into the Other
World seem to be wholly good. Dr. Slotkin reports that habitual
Peyotists are on the whole more industrious, more temperate (many
of them abstain altogether from alcohol), more Peaceable than
non-Peyotists. A tree with such satisfactory fruits cannot be
condemned out of hand as evil. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In sacramentalizing the use of peyote, the Indians
of the Native American Church have done something which is at
once psychologically sound and historically respectable. In the
early centuries of Christianity many pagan rites and festivals
were baptized, so to say, and made to serve the purposes of the
Church. These jollifications were not particularly edifying; but
they assuaged a certain psychological hunger and, instead of
trying to suppress them, the earlier missionaries had the sense
to accept them for what they were, soul-satisfying expressions of
fundamental urges, and to incorporate them into the fabric of the
new religion. What the Native Americans have done is essentially
similar. They have taken a pagan custom (a custom, incidentally,
far more elevating and enlightening than most of the rather
brutish carousals and mummeries adopted from European paganism)
and given it a Christian significance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though but recently introduced into the northern
United States, peyote-eating and the religion based upon it have
become important symbols of the red man's right to spiritual
independence. Some Indians have reacted to white supremacy by
becoming Americanized, others by retreating into traditional
Indianism. But some have tried to make the best of both worlds,
indeed of all the worlds&#151;the best of Indianism, the best of
Christianity, and the best of those Other Worlds of
transcendental experience, where the soul knows itself as
unconditioned and of like nature with the divine. Hence the
Native American Church. In it two great appetites of the
soul&#151; the urge to independence and self-determination and
the urge to self-transcendence-were fused with, and interpreted
in the light of, a third&#151;the urge to worship, to justify the
ways of God to man, to explain the universe by means of a
coherent theology.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Lo, the poor Indian, whose untutored mind <br>
    Clothes him in front, but leaves him bare behind. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> But actually it is we, the rich and highly educated whites,
who have left ourselves bare behind. We cover our anterior
nakedness with some philosophy&#151;Christian, Marxian,
Freudo-Physicalist&#151;but abaft we remain uncovered, at the
mercy of all the winds of circumstance. The poor Indian, on the
other hand, has had the wit to protect his rear by supplementing
the fig leaf of a theology with the breechclout of transcendental
experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not so foolish as to equate what happens under
the influence of mescalin or of any other drug, prepared or in
the future preparable, with the realization of the end and
ultimate purpose of human life: Enlightenment, the Beatific
Vision. All I am suggesting is that the mescalin experience is
what Catholic theologians call &quot;a gratuitous grace,&quot;
not necessary to salvation but potentially helpful and to be
accepted thankfully, if made available. To be shaken out of the
ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a few timeless hours
the outer and the inner world, not as they appear to an animal
obsessed with survival or to a human being obsessed with words
and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly and
unconditionally, by Mind at Large&#151;this is an experience of
inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual.
For the intellectual is by definition the man for whom, in
Goethe's phrase, &quot;the word is essentially fruitful.&quot; He
is the man who feels that &quot;what we perceive by the eye is
foreign to us as such and need not impress us deeply.&quot; And
yet, though himself an intellectual and one of the supreme
masters of language, Goethe did not always agree with his own
evaluation of the word. &quot;We talk,&quot; he wrote in middle
life, &quot;far too much. We should talk less and draw more. I
personally should like to renounce speech altogether and, like
organic Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches.
That fig tree, this little snake, the cocoon on my window sill
quietly awaiting its future-all these are momentous signatures. A
person able to decipher their meaning properly would soon be able
to dispense with the written or the spoken word altogether. The
more I think of it, there is something futile, mediocre, even (I
am tempted to say) foppish about speech. By contrast, how the
gravity of Nature and her silence startle you, when you stand
face to face with her, undistracted, before a barren ridge or in
the desolation of the ancient hills.&quot; We can never dispense
with language and the other symbol systems; for it is by means of
them, and only by their means, that we have raised ourselves
above the brutes, to the level of human beings. But we can easily
become the victims as well as the beneficiaries of these systems.
We must learn how to handle words effectively; but at the same
time we must preserve and, if necessary, intensify our ability to
look at the world directly and not through that half opaque
medium of concepts, which distorts every given fact into the all
too familiar likeness of some generic label or explanatory
abstraction. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Literary or scientific, liberal or specialist, all
our education is predominantly verbal and therefore fails to
accomplish what it is supposed to do. Instead of transforming
children into fully developed adults, it turns out students of
the natural sciences who are completely unaware of Nature as the
primary fact of experience, it inflicts upon the world students
of the humanities who know nothing of humanity, their own or
anyone else's. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gestalt psychologists, such as Samuel Renshaw, have
devised methods for widening the range and increasing the acuity
of human perceptions. But do our educators apply them? The answer
is, No. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teachers in every field of psyche-physical skill,
from seeing to tennis, from tightrope walking to prayer, have
discovered, by trial and error, the conditions of optimum
functioning within their special fields. But have any of the
great Foundations financed a project for coordinating these
empirical findings into a general theory and practice of
heightened creativeness? Again, so far as I am aware, the answer
is, No. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All sorts of cultists and queer fish teach all
kinds of techniques for achieving health, contentment, peace of
mind; and for many of their hearers many of these techniques are
demonstrably effective. But do we see respectable psychologists,
philosophers and clergymen boldly descending into those odd and
sometimes malodorous wells, at the bottom of which poor Truth is
so often condemned to sit? Yet once more the answer is, No. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now look at the history of mescalin research.
Seventy years ago men of first-rate ability described the
transcendental experiences which come to those who, in good
health, under proper conditions and in the right spirit, take the
drug. How many philosophers, how many theologians, how many
professional educators have had the curiosity to open this Door
in the Wall? The answer, for all practical purposes, is, None. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a world where education is predominantly verbal,
highly educated people find it all but impossible to pay serious
attention to anything but words and notions. There is always
money for, there are always doctorates in, the learned foolery of
research into what, for scholars, is the all-important problem:
Who influenced whom to say what when? Even in this age of
technology the verbal humanities are honored. The non-verbal
humanities, the arts of being directly aware of the given facts
of our existence, ale almost completely ignored. A catalogue, a
bibliography, a definitive edition of a third-rate versifier's <em>ipsissima
verba</em>, a stupendous index to end all indexes &#151;any
genuinely Alexandrian project is sure of approval and financial
support: But when it comes to finding out how you and I, our
children and grand- children, may become more perceptive, more
intensely aware of inward and outward reality, more open to the
Spirit, less apt, by psychological malpractices, to make
ourselves physically ill, and more capable of controlling our own
autonomic nervous system&#151;when it comes to any form of
non-verbal education more fundamental (and more likely to be of
some practical use) than Swedish drill, no really respectable
person in any really respectable university or church will do
anything about it. Verbalists are suspicious of the non-verbal;
rationalists fear the given, non-rational fact; intellectuals
feel that &quot;what we perceive by the eye (or in any other way)
is foreign to us as such and need not impress us deeply.&quot;
Besides, this matter of education in the non-verbal humanities
will not fit into any of the established pigeonholes. It is not
religion, not neurology, not gymnastics, not morality or civics,
not even experimental psychology. This being so the subject is,
for academic and ecclesiastical purposes, non-existent and may
safely be ignored altogether or left, with a Patronizing smile,
to those whom the Pharisees of verbal orthodoxy call cranks,
quacks, charlatans and unqualified amateurs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I have always found,&quot; Blake wrote rather
bitterly, &quot;that Angels have the vanity to speak of
themselves as the only wise. This they do with a confident
insolence sprouting from systematic reasoning.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Systematic reasoning is something we could not, as
a species or as individuals, possibly do without. But neither, if
we are to remain sane, can we possibly do without direct
perception, the more unsystematic the better, of the inner and
outer worlds into which we have been born. This given reality is
an infinite which passes all understanding and yet admits of
being directly and in some sort totally apprehended. It is a
transcendence belonging to another order than the human, and yet
it may be present to us as a felt immanence, an experienced
participation. To be enlightened is to be aware, always, of total
reality in its immanent otherness-to be aware of it and yet to
remain in a condition to survive as an animal, to think and feel
as a human being, to resort whenever expedient to systematic
reasoning. Our goal is to discover that we have always been where
we ought to be. Unhappily we make the task exceedingly difficult
for ourselves. Meanwhile, however, there are gratuitous graces in
the form of partial and fleeting realizations. Under a more
realistic, a less exclusively verbal system of education than
ours, every Angel (in Blake's sense of that word) would be
permitted as a sabbatical treat, would be urged and even, if
necessary, compelled to take an occasional trip through some
chemical Door in the Wall into the world of transcendental
experience. If it terrified him, it would be unfortunate but
probably salutary. If it brought him a brief but timeless
illumination, so much the better. In either case the Angel might
lose a little of the confident insolence sprouting from
systematic reasoning and the consciousness of having read all the
books. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Near the end of his life Aquinas experienced
Infused Contemplation. Thereafter he refused to go back to work
on his unfinished book. Compared with this, everything he had
read and argued about and written&#151;Aristotle and the
Sentences, the Questions, the Propositions, the majestic
Summas&#151;was no better than chaff or straw, For most
intellectuals such a sit-down strike would be inadvisable, even
morally wrong. But the Angelic Doctor had done more systematic
reasoning than any twelve ordinary Angels, and was already ripe
for death. He had earned the right, in those last months of his
mortality, to turn away from merely symbolic straw and chaff to
the bread of actual and substantial Fact. For Angels of a lower
order and with better prospects of longevity, there must be a
return to the straw. But the man who comes back through the Door
in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out.
He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but less
self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet better
equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of
systematic reasoning to the unfathomable Mystery which it tries,
forever vainly, to comprehend. </p>

<p> <a name="target2">*In his monograph, <em>Menomini Peyolism,</em>
published (December 1952) in the Transactions of the American
Philosophical Society, Professor J. S. Slotkin has written that
&quot;the habitual use of Peyote does not seem to produce any
increased tolerance or dependence. I know many people who have
been Peyotists for forty to fifty years. The amount of Peyote
they use depends upon the solemnity of the occasion; in general
they do not take any more Peyote now than they did years ago.
Also, there is sometimes an interval of a month or more between
rites, and they go without Peyote during this period without
feeling any craving for it. Personally, even after a series of
rites occurring on four successive weekends. I neither increased
the amount of Peyote consumed nor felt any continued need for
it.&quot; It is evidently with good reason that &quot;Peyote has
never been legally declared a narcotic, or its use prohibited by
the federal government.&quot; However, &quot;during the long
history of Indian-white contact, white offcials have usually
tried to suppress the use of Peyote, because it has been
conceived to violate their own mores. But these at- tempts have
always failed.&quot; In a footnote Dr. Slotkin adds that &quot;it
is amazing to hear the fantastic stories about the effects of
Peyote and the nature of the ritual, which are told by the white
and Catholic Indian officials in the Menomini Reservation. None
of them have had the slightest first-hand experience with the
plant or with the religion, yet some fancy themselves to be
authorities and write official reports on the subject.&quot; <a

<h3> Translator's Preface </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Numerous accounts of the discovery of
LSD have been published in English; none, unfortunately, have
been completely accurate. Here, at last, the father of LSD
details the history of his &quot;problem child&quot; and his long
and fruitful career as a research chemist. In a real sense, this
book is the inside story of the birth of the Psychedelic Age, and
it cannot be denied that we have here a highly candid and
personal insight into one of the most important scientific
discoveries of our time, the signiflcance of which has yet to
dawn on mankind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Surpassing its historical value is the immense
philosophical import of this work. Never before has a chemist, an
expert in the most materialistic of the sciences, advanced a <i>Weltanschauung</i>
of such a mystical and transcendental nature. LSD, psilocybin,
and the other hallucinogens do indeed, as Albert Hofmann asserts,
constitute &quot;cracks&quot; in the edifice of materialistic
rationality, cracks we would do well to explore and perhaps
widen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a writer, it gives me great satisfaction to know
that by this book the American reader interested in hallucinogens
will be introduced to the work of Rudolf Gelpke, Ernst Junger,
and Walter Vogt, writers who are all but unknown here. With the
notable exceptions of Huxley and Wasson, English and American
writers on the hallucinogenic experience have been far less
distinguished and eloquent than they. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This translation has been carefully overseen by
Albert Hofmann, which made my task both simpler and more
enjoyable. I am beholden to R. Gordon Wasson for checking the
chapters on LSD's &quot;Mexican relatives&quot; and on &quot;Ska
Maria Pastora&quot; for accuracy and style. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two chapters of this book&#151;&quot;How LSD
Originated&quot; and &quot;LSD Experience and
Reality&quot;&#151;were presented by Albert Hofmann as a paper
before the international conference &quot;Hallucinogens,
Shamanism and Modern Life&quot; in San Francisco on the afternoon
of Saturday, September 30, 1978. As a part of the conference
proceedings, the first chapter has been published in the <i>Journal
of Psychedelic Drugs,</i> Vol. 11 (1-2), 1979. <br>

<h3>Foreword </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are experiences that most of us are hesitant
to speak about, because they do not conform to everyday reality
and defy rational explanation. These are not particular external
occurrences, but rather events of our inner lives, which are
generally dismissed as figments of the imagination and barred
from our memory. Suddenly, the familiar view of our surroundings
is transformed in a strange, delightful, or alarming way: it
appears to us in a new light, takes on a special meaning. Such an
experience can be as light and fleeting as a breath of air, or it
can imprint itself deeply upon our minds. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One enchantment of that kind, which I experienced
in childhood, has remained remarkably vivid in my memory ever
since. It happened on a May morning&#151;I have forgotten the
year&#151;but I can still point to the exact spot where it
occurred, on a forest path on Martinsberg above Baden,
Switzerland. As I strolled through the freshly greened woods
filled with bird song and lit up by the morning sun, all at once
everything appeared in an uncommonly clear light. Was this
something I had simply failed to notice before? Was I suddenly
discovering the spring forest as it actually looked? It shone
with the most beautiful radiance, speaking to the heart, as
though it wanted to encompass me in its majesty. I was filled
with an indescribable sensation of joy, oneness, and blissful
security. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no idea how long I stood there spellbound.
But I recall the anxious concern I felt as the radiance slowly
dissolved and I hiked on: how could a vision that was so real and
convincing, so directly and deeply felt&#151;how could it end so
soon? And how could I tell anyone about it, as my overflowing joy
compelled me to do, since I knew there were no words to describe
what I had seen? It seemed strange that I, as a child, had seen
something so marvelous, something that adults obviously did not
perceive - for I had never heard them mention it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While still a child, I experienced several more of
these deeply euphoric moments on my rambles through forest and
meadow. It was these experiences that shaped the main outlines of
my world view and convinced me of the existence of a miraculous,
powerful, unfathomable reality that was hidden from everyday
sight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was often troubled in those days, wondering if I
would ever, as an adult, be able to communicate these
experiences; whether I would have the chance to depict my visions
in poetry or paintings. But knowing that I was not cut out to be
a poet or artist, I assumed I would have to keep these
experiences to myself, important as they were to me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unexpectedly&#151;though scarcely by
chance&#151;much later, in middle age, a link was established
between my profession and these visionary experiences from
childhood. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because I wanted to gain insight into the structure
and essence of matter, I became a research chemist. Intrigued by
the plant world since early childhood, I chose to specialize in
research on the constituents of medicinal plants. In the course
of this career I was led to the psychoactive,
hallucination-causing substances, which under certain conditions
can evoke visionary states similar to the spontaneous experiences
just described. The most important of these hallucinogenic
substances has come to be known as LSD. Hallucinogens, as active
compounds of considerable scientific interest, have gained entry
into medicinal research, biology, and psychiatry, and
later&#151;especially LSD also obtained wide diffusion in the
drug culture. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In studying the literature connected with my work,
I became aware of the great universal significance of visionary
experience. It plays a dominant role, not only in mysticism and
the history of religion, but also in the creative process in art,
literature, and science. More recent investigations have shown
that many persons also have visionary experiences in daily life,
though most of us fail to recognize their meaning and value.
Mystical experiences, like those that marked my childhood, are
apparently far from rare. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is today a widespread striving for mystical
experience, for visionary breakthroughs to a deeper, more
comprehensive reality than that perceived by our rational,
everyday consciousness. Efforts to transcend our materialistic
world view are being made in various ways, not only by the
adherents to Eastern religious movements, but also by
professional psychiatrists, who are adopting such profound
spiritual experiences as a basic therapeutic principle. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I share the belief of many of my contemporaries
that the spiritual crisis pervading all spheres of Western
industrial society can be remedied only by a change in our world
view. We shall have to shift from the materialistic, dualistic
belief that people and their environment are separate, toward a
new consciousness of an all-encompassing reality, which embraces
the experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel their
oneness with animate nature and all of creation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Everything that can contribute to such a
fundamental alteration in our perception of reality must
therefore command earnest attention. Foremost among such
approaches are the various methods of meditation, either in a
religious or a secular context, which aim to deepen the
consciousness of reality by way of a total mystical experience.
Another important, but still controversial, path to the same goal
is the use of the consciousness-altering properties of
hallucinogenic psychopharmaceuticals. LSD finds such an
application in medicine, by helping patients in psychoanalysis
and psychotherapy to perceive their problems in their true
significance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deliberate provocation of mystical experience,
particularly by LSD and related hallucinogens, in contrast to
spontaneous visionary experiences, entails dangers that must not
be underestimated. Practitioners must take into account the
peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability to
influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.
The history of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic
consequences that can ensue when its profound effect is misjudged
and the substance is mistaken for a pleasure drug. Special
internal and external advance preparations are required; with
them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful experience. Wrong
and inappropriate use has caused LSD to become my problem child. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is my desire in this book to give a
comprehensive picture of LSD, its origin, its effects, and its
dangers, in order to guard against increasing abuse of this
extraordinary drug. I hope thereby to emphasize possible uses of
LSD that are compatible with its characteristic action. I believe
that if people would learn to use LSD's vision-inducing
capability more wisely, under suitable conditions, in medical
practice and in conjunction with meditation, then in the future
this problem child could become a wonder child. </p>

<h3>1. How LSD Originated </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; <center><i>In the realm of scientific observation, luck<br>
is granted only to those who are prepared. </i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &#151;Louis Pasteur</center></p>

<p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Time and again I hear or read that LSD was
discovered by accident. This is only partly true. LSD came into
being within a systematic research program, and the
&quot;accident&quot; did not occur until much later: when LSD was
already five years old, I happened to experience its
unforeseeable effects in my own body&#151;or rather, in my own
mind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking back over my professional career to trace
the influential events and decisions that eventually steered my
work toward the synthesis of LSD, I realize that the most
decisive step was my choice of employment upon completion of my
chemistry studies. If that decision had been different, then this
substance, which has become known the world over, might never
have been created. In order to tell the story of the origin of
LSD, then, I must also touch briefly on my career as a chemist,
since the two developments are inextricably interrelated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the spring of 1929, on concluding my chemistry
studies at the University of Zurich, I joined the Sandoz
Company's pharmaceutical-chemical research laboratory in Basel,
as a co-worker with Professor Arthur Stoll, founder and director
of the pharmaceutical department. I chose this position because
it afforded me the opportunity to work on natural products,
whereas two other job offers from chemical firms in Basel had
involved work in the field of synthetic chemistry. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>First Chemical Explorations </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My doctoral work at Zurich under Professor Paul
Karrer had already given me one chance to pursue my interest in
plant and animal chemistry. Making use of the gastrointestinal
juice of the vineyard snail, I accomplished the enzymatic
degradation of chitin, the structural material of which the
shells, wings, and claws of insects, crustaceans, and other lower
animals are composed. I was able to derive the chemical structure
of chitin from the cleavage product, a nitrogen-containing sugar,
obtained by this degradation. Chitin turned out to be an analogue
of cellulose, the structural material of plants. This important
result, obtained after only three months of research, led to a
doctoral thesis rated &quot;with distinction.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I joined the Sandoz firm, the staff of the
pharmaceutical-chemical department was still rather modest in
number. Four chemists with doctoral degrees worked in research,
three in production. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Stoll's laboratory I found employment that
completely agreed with me as a research chemist. The objective
that Professor Stoll had set for his pharmaceutical-chemical
research laboratories was to isolate the active principles (i.e.,
the effective constituents) of known medicinal plants to produce
pure specimens of these substances. This is particularly
important in the case of medicinal plants whose active principles
are unstable, or whose potency is subject to great variation,
which makes an exact dosage difficult. But if the active
principle is available in pure form, it becomes possible to
manufacture a stable pharmaceutical preparation, exactly
quantifiable by weight. With this in mind, Professor Stoll had
elected to study plant substances of recognized value such as the
substances from foxglove <i>(Digitalis),</i> Mediterranean squill
<i>(Scilla maritima)</i>, and ergot of rye (<i>Claviceps purpurea</i>
or <i>Secale cornutum</i>), which, owning to their instability
and uncertain dosage, nevertheless, had been little used in
medicine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My first years in the Sandoz laboratories were
devoted almost exclusively to studying the active principles of
Mediterranean squill. Dr. Walter Kreis, one of Professor Stoll's
earliest associates, launched me in this field of research. The
most important constituents of Mediterranean squill already
existed in pure form. Their active agents, as well as those of
woolly foxglove (<i>Digitalis lanata</i>), had been isolated and
purified, chiefly by Dr. Kreis, with extraordinary skill. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The active principles of Mediterranean squill
belong to the group of cardioactive glycosides (glycoside =
sugar-containing substance) and serve, as do those of foxglove,
in the treatment of cardiac insufficiency. The cardiac glycosides
are extremely active substances. Because the therapeutic and the
toxic doses differ so little, it becomes especially important
here to have an exact dosage, based on pure compounds. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the beginning of my investigations, a
pharmaceutical preparation with Scilla glycosides had already
been introduced into therapeutics by Sandoz; however, the
chemical structure of these active compounds, with the exception
of the sugar portion, remained largely unknown. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My main contribution to the <i>Scilla</i> research,
in which I participated with enthusiasm, was to elucidate the
chemical structure of the common nucleus of Scilla glycosides,
showing on the one hand their differences from the <i>Digitalis </i>glycosides,
and on the other hand their close structural relationship with
the toxic principles isolated from skin glands of toads. In 1935,
these studies were temporarily concluded. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking for a new field of research, I asked
Professor Stoll to let me continue the investigations on the
alkaloids of ergot, which he had begun in 1917 and which had led
directly to the isolation of ergotamine in 1918. Ergotamine,
discovered by Stoll, was the first ergot alkaloid obtained in
pure chemical form. Although ergotamine quickly took a
significant place in therapeutics (under the trade name Gynergen)
as a hemostatic remedy in obstetrics and as a medicament in the
treatment of migraine, chemical research on ergot in the Sandoz
laboratories was abandoned after the isolation of ergotamine and
the determination of its empirical formula. Meanwhile, at the
beginning of the thirties, English and American laboratories had
begun to determine the chemical structure of ergot alkaloids.
They had also discovered a new, water-soluble ergot alkaloid,
which could likewise be isolated from the mother liquor of
ergotamine production. So I thought it was high time that Sandoz
resumed chemical research on ergot alkaloids, unless we wanted to
risk losing our leading role in a field of medicinal research,
which was already becoming so important. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Stoll granted my request, with some
misgivings: &quot;I must warn you of the difficulties you face in
working with ergot alkaloids. These are-exceedingly sensitive,
easily decomposed substances, less stable than any of the
compounds you have investigated in the cardiac glycoside field.
But you are welcome to try.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so the switches were thrown, and I found myself
engaged in a field of study that would become the main theme of
my professional career. I have never forgotten the creative joy,
the eager anticipation I felt in embarking on the study of ergot
alkaloids, at that time a relatively uncharted field of research.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Ergot </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It may be helpful here to give some background
information about ergot itself.[For further information on ergot,
readers should refer to the monographs of G. Berger, <i>Ergot and
Ergotism</i> (Gurney and Jackson, London, 1931 ) and A. Hofmann, <i>Die
Mutterkornalkaloide</i> (F. Enke Verlag, Stuttgart, 1964). The
former is a classical presentation of the history of the drug,
while the latter emphasizes the chemical aspects.] It is produced
by a lower fungus (<i>Claviceps purpurea</i>) that grows
parasitically on rye and, to a lesser extent, on other species of
grain and on wild grasses. Kernels infested with this fungus
develop into light-brown to violet-brown curved pegs (sclerotia)
that push forth from the husk in place of normal grains. Ergot is
described botanically as a sclerotium, the form that the ergot
fungus takes in winter. Ergot of rye (<i>Secale cornutum</i>) is
the variety used medicinally. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ergot, more than any other drug, has a fascinating
history, in the course of which its role and meaning have been
reversed: once dreaded as a poison, in the course of time it has
changed to a rich storehouse of valuable remedies. Ergot first
appeared on the stage of history in the early Middle Ages, as the
cause of outbreaks of mass poisonings affecting thousands of
persons at a time. The illness, whose connection with ergot was
for a long time obscure, appeared in two characteristic forms,
one gangrenous (<i>ergotismus gangraenosus</i>) and the other
convulsive (<i>ergotismus convulsivus</i>). Popular names for
ergotism&#151;such as &quot;mal des ardents,&quot; &quot;ignis
sacer,&quot; &quot;heiliges Feuer,&quot; or &quot;St. Anthony's
fire&quot;&#151;refer to the gangrenous form of the disease. The
patron saint of ergotism victims was St. Anthony, and it was
primarily the Order of St. Anthony that treated these patients. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until recent times, epidemic-like outbreaks of
ergot poisoning have been recorded in most European countries
including certain areas of Russia. With progress in agriculture,
and since the realization, in the seventeenth century, that
ergot-containing bread was the cause, the frequency and extent of
ergotism epidemics diminished considerably. The last great
epidemic occurred in certain areas of southern Russia in the
years 1926-27. [The mass poisoning in the southern French city of
Pont-St. Esprit in the year 1951, which many writers have
attributed to ergot-containing bread, actually had nothing to do
with ergotism. It rather involved poisoning by an organic mercury
compound that was utilized for disinfecting seed.] <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first mention of a medicinal use of ergot,
namely as an ecbolic (a medicament to precipitate childbirth), is
found in the herbal of the Frankfurt city physician Adam Lonitzer
(Lonicerus) in the year 1582. Although ergot, as Lonitzer stated,
had been used since olden times by midwives, it was not until
1808 that this drug gained entry into academic medicine, on the
strength of a work by the American physician John Stearns
entitled <i>Account of the Putvis Parturiens, a Remedy for
Quickening Childbirth.</i> The use of ergot as an ecbolic did
not, however, endure. Practitioners became aware quite early of
the great danger to the child, owing primarily to the uncertainty
of dosage, which when too high led to uterine spasms. From then
on, the use of ergot in obstetrics was confined to stopping
postpartum hemorrhage (bleeding after childbirth). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not until ergot's recognition in various
pharmacopoeias during the first half of the nineteenth century
that the first steps were taken toward isolating the active
principles of the drug. However, of all the researchers who
assayed this problem during the first hundred years, not one
succeeded in identifying the actual substances responsible for
the therapeutic activity. In 1907, the Englishmen G. Barger and
F. H. Carr were the first to isolate an active alkaloidal
preparation, which they named ergotoxine because it produced more
of the toxic than therapeutic properties of ergot. (This
preparation was not homogeneous, but rather a mixture of several
alkaloids, as I was able to show thirty-five years later.)
Nevertheless, the pharmacologist H. H. Dale discovered that
ergotoxine, besides the uterotonic effect, also had an
antagonistic activity on adrenaline in the autonomic nervous
system that could lead to the therapeutic use of ergot alkaloids.
Only with the isolation of ergotamine by A. Stoll (as mentioned
previously) did an ergot alkaloid find entry and widespread use
in therapeutics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The early 1930s brought a new era in ergot
research, beginning with the determination of the chemical
structure of ergot alkaloids, as mentioned, in English and
American laboratories. By chemical cleavage, W. A. Jacobs and L.
C. Craig of the Rockefeller Institute of New York succeeded in
isolating and characterizing the nucleus common to all ergot
alkaloids. They named it lysergic acid. Then came a major
development, both for chemistry and for medicine: the isolation
of the specifically uterotonic, hemostatic principle of ergot,
which was published simultaneously and quite independently by
four institutions, including the Sandoz laboratories. The
substance, an alkaloid of comparatively simple structure, was
named ergobasine (syn. ergometrine, ergonovine) by A. Stoll and
E. Burckhardt. By the chemical degradation of ergobasine, W. A.
Jacobs and L. C. Craig obtained lysergic acid and the amino
alcohol propanolamine as cleavage products. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I set as my first goal the problem of preparing
this alkaloid synthetically, through chemical linking of the two
components of ergobasine, lysergic acid and propanolamine (see
structural formulas in the appendix). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lysergic acid necessary for these studies had
to be obtained by chemical cleavage of some other ergot alkaloid.
Since only ergotamine was available as a pure alkaloid, and was
already being produced in kilogram quantities in the
pharmaceutical production department, I chose this alkaloid as
the starting material for my work. I set about obtaining 0.5 gm
of ergotamine from the ergot production people. When I sent the
internal requisition form to Professor Stoll for his
countersignature, he appeared in my laboratory and reproved me:
&quot;If you want to work with ergot alkaloids, you will have to
familiarize yourself with the techniques of microchemistry. I
can't have you consuming such a large amount of my expensive
ergotamine for your experiments.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ergot production department, besides using
ergot of Swiss origin to obtain ergotamine, also dealt with
Portuguese ergot, which yielded an amorphous alkaloidal
preparation that corresponded to the aforementioned ergotoxine
first produced by Barger and Carr. I decided to use this less
expensive material for the preparation of lysergic acid. The
alkaloid obtained from the production department had to be
purified further, before it would be suitable for cleavage to
lysergic acid. Observations made during the purification process
led me to think that ergotoxine could be a mixture of several
alkaloids, rather than one homogeneous alkaloid. I will speak
later of the far-reaching sequelae of these observations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here I must digress briefly to describe the working
conditions and techniques that prevailed in those days. These
remarks may be of interest to the present generation of research
chemists in industry, who are accustomed to far better
conditions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We were very frugal. Individual laboratories were
considered a rare extravagance. During the first six years of my
employment with Sandoz, I shared a laboratory with two
colleagues. We three chemists, plus an assistant each, worked in
the same room on three different fields: Dr. Kreiss on cardiac
glycosides; Dr. Wiedemann, who joined Sandoz around the same time
as I, on the leaf pigment chlorophyll; and I ultimately on ergot
alkaloids. The laboratory was equipped with two fume hoods
(compartments supplied with outlets), providing less than
effective ventilation by gas flames. When we requested that these
hoods be equipped with ventilators, our chief refused on the
ground that ventilation by gas flame had sufficed in
Willstatter's laboratory. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the last years of World War I, Professor
Stoll had been an assistant in Berlin and Munich to the
world-famous chemist and Nobel laureate Professor Richard
Willstatter, and with him had conducted the fundamental
investigations on chlorophyll and the assimilation of carbon
dioxide. There was scarcely a scientific discussion with
Professor Stoll in which he did not mention his revered teacher
Professor Willstatter and his work in Willstatter's laboratory. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The working techniques available to chemists in the
field of organic chemistry at that time (the beginning of the
thirties) were essentially the same as those employed by Justus
von Liebig a hundred years earlier. The most important
development achieved since then was the introduction of
microanalysis by B. Pregl, which made it possible to ascertain
the elemental composition of a compound with only a few
milligrams of specimen, whereas earlier a few centigrams were
needed. Of the other physical-chemical techniques at the disposal
of the chemist today&#151;techniques which have changed his way
of working, making it faster and more effective, and created
entirely new possibilities, above all for the elucidation of
structure - none yet existed in those days. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the investigations of <i>Scilla</i> glycosides
and the first studies in the ergot field, I still used the old
separation and purification techniques from Liebig's day:
fractional extraction, fractional precipitation, fractional
crystallization, and the like. The introduction of column
chromatography, the first important step in modern laboratory
technique, was of great value to me only in later investigations.
For structure determination, which today can be conducted rapidly
and elegantly with the help of spectroscopic methods (UV, IR,
NMR) and X-ray crystallography, we had to rely, in the first
fundamental ergot studies, entirely on the old laborious methods
of chemical degradation and derivatization. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Lysergic Acid and Its Derivatives </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Lysergic acid proved to be a rather unstable
substance, and its rebonding with basic radicals posed
difficulties. In the technique known as Curtius' Synthesis, I
ultimately found a process that proved useful for combining
lysergic acid with amines. With this method I produced a great
number of lysergic acid compounds. By combining lysergic acid
with the amino alcohol propanolamine, I obtained a compound that
was identical to the natural ergot alkaloid ergobasine. With
that, the first synthesis&#151;that is, artificial
production&#151;of an ergot alkaloid was accomplished. This was
not only of scientific interest, as confirmation of the chemical
structure of ergobasine, but also of practical significance,
because ergobasine, the specifically uterotonic, hemostatic
principle, is present in ergot only in very trifling quantities.
With this synthesis, the other alkaloids existing abundantly in
ergot could now be converted to ergobasine, which was valuable in
obstetrics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After this first success in the ergot field, my
investigations went forward on two fronts. First, I attempted to
improve the pharmacological properties of ergobasine by
variations of its amino alcohol radical. My colleague Dr. J.
Peyer and I developed a process for the economical production of
propanolamine and other amino alcohols. Indeed, by substitution
of the propanolamine contained in ergobasine with the amino
alcohol butanolamine, an active principle was obtained that even
surpassed the natural alkaloid in its therapeutic properties.
This improved ergobasine has found worldwide application as a
dependable uterotonic, hemostatic remedy under the trade name
Methergine, and is today the leading medicament for this
indication in obstetrics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I further employed my synthetic procedure to
produce new lysergic acid compounds for which uterotonic activity
was not prominent, but from which, on the basis of their chemical
structure, other types of interesting pharmacological properties
could be expected. In 1938, I produced the twenty-fifth substance
in this series of lysergic acid derivatives: lysergic acid
diethylamide, abbreviated LSD-25 (Lyserg-säure-diäthylamid) for
laboratory usage. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had planned the synthesis of this compound with
the intention of obtaining a circulatory and respiratory
stimulant (an analeptic). Such stimulating properties could be
expected for lysergic acid diethylamide, because it shows
similarity in chemical structure to the analeptic already known
at that time, namely nicotinic acid diethylamide (Coramine).
During the testing of LSD-25 in the pharmacological department of
Sandoz, whose director at the time was Professor Ernst Rothlin, a
strong effect on the uterus was established. It amounted to some
70 percent of the activity of ergobasine. The research report
also noted, in passing, that the experimental animals became
restless during the narcosis. The new substance, however, aroused
no special interest in our pharmacologists and physicians;
testing was therefore discontinued. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the next five years, nothing more was heard of
the substance LSD-25. Meanwhile, my work in the ergot field
advanced further in other areas. Through the purification of
ergotoxine, the starting material for lysergic acid, I obtained,
as already mentioned, the impression that this alkaloidal
preparation was not homogeneous, but was rather a mixture of
different substances. This doubt as to the homogeneity of
ergotoxine was reinforced when in its hydrogenation two
distinctly different hydrogenation products were obtained,
whereas the homogeneous alkaloid ergotamine under the same
condition yielded only a single hydrogenation product
(hydrogenation = introduction of hydrogen). Extended, systematic
analytical investigations of the supposed ergotoxine mixture led
ultimately to the separation of this alkaloidal preparation into
three homogeneous components. One of the three chemically
homogeneous ergotoxine alkaloids proved to be identical with an
alkaloid isolated shortly before in the production department,
which A. Stoll and E. Burckhardt had named ergocristine. The
other two alkaloids were both new. The first I named ergocornine;
and for the second, the last to be isolated, which had long
remained hidden in the mother liquor, I chose the name
ergokryptine (kryptos = hidden). Later it was found that
ergokryptine occurs in two isomeric forms, which were
differentiated as alfa- and beta-ergokryptine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The solution of the ergotoxine problem was not
merely scientifically interesting, but also had great practical
significance. A valuable remedy arose from it. The three
hydrogenated ergotoxine alkaloids that I produced in the course
of these investigations, dihydroergocristine,
dihydroergokryptine, and dihydroergocornine, displayed
medicinally useful properties during testing by Professor Rothlin
in the pharmacological department. From these three substances,
the pharmaceutical preparation Hydergine was developed, a
medicament for improvement of peripheral circulation and cerebral
function in the control of geriatric disorders. Hydergine has
proven to be an effective remedy in geriatrics for these
indications. Today it is Sandoz's most important pharmaceutical
product. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dihydroergotamine, which I likewise produced in the
course of these investigations, has also found application in
therapeutics as a circulation- and blood-pressure-stabilizing
medicament, under the trade name Dihydergot. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While today research on important projects is
almost exclusively carried out as teamwork, the investigations on
ergot alkaloids described above were conducted by myself alone.
Even the further chemical steps in the evolution of commercial
preparations remained in my hands&#151;that is, the preparation
of larger specimens for the clinical trials, and finally the
perfection of the first procedures for mass production of
Methergine, Hydergine, and Dihydergot. This even included the
analytical controls for the development of the first galenical
forms of these three preparations: the ampoules, liquid
solutions, and tablets. My aides at that time included a
laboratory assistant, a laboratory helper, and later in addition
a second laboratory assistant and a chemical technician. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Discovery of the Psychic Effects of LSD </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The solution of the ergotoxine problem had led
to fruitful results, described here only briefly, and had opened
up further avenues of research. And yet I could not forget the
relatively uninteresting LSD-25. A peculiar presentiment&#151;the
feeling that this substance could possess properties other than
those established in the first investigations&#151;induced me,
five years after the first synthesis, to produce LSD-25 once
again so that a sample could be given to the pharmacological
department for further tests. This was quite unusual;
experimental substances, as a rule, were definitely stricken from
the research program if once found to be lacking in
pharmacological interest. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, in the spring of 1943, I repeated the
synthesis of LSD-25. As in the first synthesis, this involved the
production of only a few centigrams of the compound. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the final step of the synthesis, during the
purification and crystallization of lysergic acid diethylamide in
the form of a tartrate (tartaric acid salt), I was interrupted in
my work by unusual sensations. The following description of this
incident comes from the report that I sent at the time to
Professor Stoll: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Last Friday, April 16,1943, I was forced to interrupt my
    work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and
    proceed home, being affected by a remarkable restlessness,
    combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank
    into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition,
    characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a
    dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be
    unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of
    fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense,
    kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this
    condition faded away. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was, altogether, a remarkable
experience&#151;both in its sudden onset and its extraordinary
course. It seemed to have resulted from some external toxic
influence; I surmised a connection with the substance I had been
working with at the time, lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate.
But this led to another question: how had I managed to absorb
this material? Because of the known toxicity of ergot substances,
I always maintained meticulously neat work habits. Possibly a bit
of the LSD solution had contacted my fingertips during
crystallization, and a trace of the substance was absorbed
through the skin. If LSD-25 had indeed been the cause of this
bizarre experience, then it must be a substance of extraordinary
potency. There seemed to be only one way of getting to the bottom
of this. I decided on a self-experiment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exercising extreme caution, I began the planned
series of experiments with the smallest quantity that could be
expected to produce some effect, considering the activity of the
ergot alkaloids known at the time: namely, 0.25 mg (mg =
milligram = one thousandth of a gram) of lysergic acid
diethylamide tartrate. Quoted below is the entry for this
experiment in my laboratory journal of April 19, 1943.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Self-Experiments </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>4/19/43 16:20: 0.5 cc of 1/2 promil aqueous solution of
    diethylamide tartrate orally = 0.25 mg tartrate. Taken
    diluted with about 10 cc water. Tasteless. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>17:00: Beginning dizziness, feeling of anxiety, visual
    distortions, symptoms of paralysis, desire to laugh. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Supplement of 4/21: Home by bicycle. From 18:00- ca.20:00
    most severe crisis. (See special report.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here the notes in my laboratory journal cease. I
was able to write the last words only with great effort. By now
it was already clear to me that LSD had been the cause of the
remarkable experience of the previous Friday, for the altered
perceptions were of the same type as before, only much more
intense. I had to struggle to speak intelligibly. I asked my
laboratory assistant, who was informed of the self-experiment, to
escort me home. We went by bicycle, no automobile being available
because of wartime restrictions on their use. On the way home, my
condition began to assume threatening forms. Everything in my
field of vision wavered and was distorted as if seen in a curved
mirror. I also had the sensation of being unable to move from the
spot. Nevertheless, my assistant later told me that we had
traveled very rapidly. Finally, we arrived at home safe and
sound, and I was just barely capable of asking my companion to
summon our family doctor and request milk from the neighbors. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In spite of my delirious, bewildered condition, I
had brief periods of clear and effective thinking&#151;and chose
milk as a nonspecific antidote for poisoning. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dizziness and sensation of fainting became so
strong at times that I could no longer hold myself erect, and had
to lie down on a sofa. My surroundings had now transformed
themselves in more terrifying ways. Everything in the room spun
around, and the familiar objects and pieces of furniture assumed
grotesque, threatening forms. They were in continuous motion,
animated, as if driven by an inner restlessness. The lady next
door, whom I scarcely recognized, brought me milk&#151;in the
course of the evening I drank more than two liters. She was no
longer Mrs. R., but rather a malevolent, insidious witch with a
colored mask. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even worse than these demonic transformations of
the outer world, were the alterations that I perceived in myself,
in my inner being. Every exertion of my will, every attempt to
put an end to the disintegration of the outer world and the
dissolution of my ego, seemed to be wasted effort. A demon had
invaded me, had taken possession of my body, mind, and soul. I
jumped up and screamed, trying to free myself from him, but then
sank down again and lay helpless on the sofa. The substance, with
which I had wanted to experiment, had vanquished me. It was the
demon that scornfully triumphed over my will. I was seized by the
dreadful fear of going insane. I was taken to another world,
another place, another time. My body seemed to be without
sensation, lifeless, strange. Was I dying? Was this the
transition? At times I believed myself to be outside my body, and
then perceived clearly, as an outside observer, the complete
tragedy of my situation. I had not even taken leave of my family
(my wife, with our three children had traveled that day to visit
her parents, in Lucerne). Would they ever understand that I had
not experimented thoughtlessly, irresponsibly, but rather with
the utmost caution, an-d that such a result was in no way
foreseeable? My fear and despair intensified, not only because a
young family should lose its father, but also because I dreaded
leaving my chemical research work, which meant so much to me,
unfinished in the midst of fruitful, promising development.
Another reflection took shape, an idea full of bitter irony: if I
was now forced to leave this world prematurely, it was because of
this Iysergic acid diethylamide that I myself had brought forth
into the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By the time the doctor arrived, the climax of my
despondent condition had already passed. My laboratory assistant
informed him about my self-experiment, as I myself was not yet
able to formulate a coherent sentence. He shook his head in
perplexity, after my attempts to describe the mortal danger that
threatened my body. He could detect no abnormal symptoms other
than extremely dilated pupils. Pulse, blood pressure, breathing
were all normal. He saw no reason to prescribe any medication.
Instead he conveyed me to my bed and stood watch over me. Slowly
I came back from a weird, unfamiliar world to reassuring everyday
reality. The horror softened and gave way to a feeling of good
fortune and gratitude, the more normal perceptions and thoughts
returned, and I became more confident that the danger of insanity
was conclusively past. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, little by little I could begin to enjoy the
unprecedented colors and plays of shapes that persisted behind my
closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me,
alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves in
circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, rearranging
and hybridizing themselves in constant flux. It was particularly
remarkable how every acoustic perception, such as the sound of a
door handle or a passing automobile, became transformed into
optical perceptions. Every sound generated a vividly changing
image, with its own consistent form and color. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Late in the evening my wife returned from Lucerne.
Someone had informed her by telephone that I was suffering a
mysterious breakdown. She had returned home at once, leaving the
children behind with her parents. By now, I had recovered myself
sufficiently to tell her what had happened. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exhausted, I then slept, to awake next morning
refreshed, with a clear head, though still somewhat tired
physically. A sensation of well-being and renewed life flowed
through me. Breakfast tasted delicious and gave me extraordinary
pleasure. When I later walked out into the garden, in which the
sun shone now after a spring rain, everything glistened and
sparkled in a fresh light. The world was as if newly created. All
my senses vibrated in a condition of highest sensitivity, which
persisted for the entire day. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This self-experiment showed that LSD-25 behaved as
a psychoactive substance with extraordinary properties and
potency. There was to my knowledge no other known substance that
evoked such profound psychic effects in such extremely low doses,
that caused such dramatic changes in human consciousness and our
experience of the inner and outer world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What seemed even more significant was that I could
remember the experience of LSD inebriation in every detail. This
could only mean that the conscious recording function was not
interrupted, even in the climax of the LSD experience, despite
the profound breakdown of the normal world view. For the entire
duration of the experiment, I had even been aware of
participating in an experiment, but despite this recognition of
my condition, I could not, with every exertion of my will, shake
off the LSD world. Everything was experienced as completely real,
as alarming reality; alarming, because the picture of the other,
familiar everyday reality was still fully preserved in the memory
for comparison. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another surprising aspect of LSD was its ability to
produce such a far-reaching, powerful state of inebriation
without leaving a hangover. Quite the contrary, on the day after
the LSD experiment I felt myself to be, as already described, in
excellent physical and mental condition. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was aware that LSD, a new active compound with
such properties, would have to be of use in pharmacology, in
neurology, and especially in psychiatry, and that it would
attract the interest of concerned specialists. But at that time I
had no inkling that the new substance would also come to be used
beyond medical science, as an inebriant in the drug scene. Since
my self-experiment had revealed LSD in its terrifying, demonic
aspect, the last thing I could have expected was that this
substance could ever find application as anything approaching a
pleasure drug. I failed, moreover, to recognize the meaningful
connection between LSD inebriation and spontaneous visionary
experience until much later, after further experiments, which
were carried out with far lower doses and under different
conditions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The next day I wrote to Professor Stoll the
above-mentioned report about my extraordinary experience with
LSD-25 and sent a copy to the director of the pharmacological
department, Professor Rothlin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As expected, the first reaction was incredulous
astonishment. Instantly a telephone call came from the
management; Professor Stoll asked: &quot;Are you certain you made
no mistake in the weighing? Is the stated dose really
correct?&quot; Professor Rothlin also called, asking the same
question. I was certain of this point, for I had executed the
weighing and dosage with my own hands. Yet their doubts were
justified to some extent, for until then no known substance had
displayed even the slightest psychic effect in
fraction-of-a-milligram doses. An active compound of such potency
seemed almost unbelievable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Rothlin himself and two of his colleagues
were the first to repeat my experiment, with only one-third of
the dose I had utilized. But even at that level, the effects were
still extremely impressive, and quite fantastic. All doubts about
the statements in my report were eliminated. </p>

<h3>2. LSD in Animal Experiments and Biological Research </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the discovery of its extraordinary psychic
effects, the substance LSD-25, which five years earlier had been
excluded from further investigation after the first trials on
animals, was again admitted into the series of experimental
preparations. Most of the fundamental studies on animals were
carried out by Dr. Aurelio Cerletti in the Sandoz pharmacological
department, headed by Professor Rothlin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before a new active substance can be investigated
in systematic clinical trials with human subjects, extensive data
on its effects and side effects must be determined in
pharmacological tests on animals. These experiments must assay
the assimilation and elimination of the particular substance in
organisms, and above all its tolerance and relative toxicity.
Only the most important reports on animal experiments with LSD,
and those intelligible to the layperson, will be reviewed here.
It would greatly exceed the scope of this book if I attempted to
mention all the results of several hundred pharmacological
investigations, which have been conducted all over the world in
connection with the fundamental work on LSD in the Sandoz
laboratories. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Animal experiments reveal little about the mental
alterations caused by LSD because psychic effects are scarcely
determinable in lower animals, and even in the more highly
developed, they can be established only to a limited extent. LSD
produces its effects above all in the sphere of the higher and
highest psychic and intellectual functions. It is therefore
understandable that specific reactions to LSD can be expected
only in higher animals. Subtle psychic changes cannot be
established in animals because, even if they should be occurring,
the animal could not give them expression. Thus, only relatively
heavy psychic disturbances, expressing themselves in the altered
behavior of research animals, become discernible. Quantities that
are substantially higher than the effective dose of LSD in human
beings are therefore necessary, even in higher animals like cats,
dogs, and apes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the mouse under LSD shows only motor
disturbances and alterations in licking behavior, in the cat we
see, besides vegetative symptoms like bristling of the hair
(piloerection) and salivation, indications that point to the
existence of hallucinations. The animals stare anxiously in the
air, and instead of attacking the mouse, the cat leaves it alone
or will even stand in fear before the mouse. One could also
conclude that the behavior of dogs that are under the influence
of LSD involves hallucinations. A caged community of chimpanzees
reacts very sensitively if a member of the tribe has received
LSD. Even though no changes appear in this single animal, the
whole cage gets in an uproar because the LSD chimpanzee no longer
observes the laws of its finely coordinated hierarchic tribal
order. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the remaining animal species on which LSD was
tested, only aquarium fish and spiders need be mentioned here. In
the fish, unusual swimming postures were observed, and in the
spiders, alterations in web building were apparently produced by
LSD. At very low optimum doses the webs were even better
proportioned and more exactly built than normally: however, with
higher doses, the webs were badly and rudimentarily made.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>How Toxic Is LSD? </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The toxicity of LSD has been determined in
various animal species. A standard for the toxicity of a
substance is the LD<sub>50</sub>, or the median lethal dose, that
is, the dose with which 50 percent of the treated animals die. In
general it fluctuates broadly, according to the animal species,
and so it is with LSD. The LD<sub>50</sub> for the mouse amounts
to 50-60 mg/kg. i.v. (that is, 50 to 60 thousandths of a gram of
LSD per kilogram of animal weight upon injection of an LSD
solution into the veins). In the rat the LD<sub>50</sub> drops to
16.5 mg/kg, and in rabbits to 0.3 mg/kg. One elephant given 0.297
g of LSD died after a few minutes. The weight of this animal was
determined to be 5,000 kg, which corresponds to a lethal dose of
0.06 mg/kg (0.06 thousandths of a gram per kilogram of body
weight). Because this involves only a single case, this value
cannot be generalized, but we can at least deduce from it that
the largest land animal reacts proportionally very sensitively to
LSD, since the lethal dose in elephants must be some 1,000 times
lower than in the mouse. Most animals die from a lethal dose of
LSD by respiratory arrest. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The minute doses that cause death in animal
experiments may give the impression that LSD is a very toxic
substance. However, if one compares the lethal dose in animals
with the effective dose in human beings, which is 0.0003-0.001
mg/kg (0.0003 to 0.001 thousandths of a gram per kilogram of body
weight), this shows an extraordinarily low toxicity for LSD. Only
a 300- to 600-fold overdose of LSD, compared to the lethal dose
in rabbits, or fully a 50,000- to 100,000fold overdose, in
comparison to the toxicity in the mouse, would have fatal results
in human beings. These comparisons of relative toxicity are, to
be sure, only understandable as estimates of orders of magnitude,
for the determination of the therapeutic index (that is, the
ratio between the effective and the lethal dose) is only
meaningful within a given species. Such a procedure is not
possible in this case because the lethal dose of LSD for humans
is not known. To my knowledge, there have not as yet occurred any
casualties that are a direct consequence of LSD poisoning.
Numerous episodes of fatal consequences attributed to LSD
ingestion have indeed been recorded, but these were accidents,
even suicides, that may be attributed to the mentally disoriented
condition of LSD intoxication. The danger of LSD lies not in its
toxicity, but rather in the unpredictability of its psychic
effects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some years ago reports appeared in the scientific
literature and also in the lay press, alleging that damage to
chromosomes or the genetic material had been caused by LSD. These
effects, however, have been observed in only a few individual
cases. Subsequent comprehensive investigations of a large,
statistically significant number of cases, however, showed that
there was no connection between chromosome anomalies and LSD
medication. The same applies to reports about fetal deformities
that had allegedly been produced by LSD. In animal experiments,
it is indeed possible to induce fetal deformities through
extremely high doses of LSD, which lie well above the doses used
in human beings. But under these conditions, even harmless
substances produce such damage. Examination of reported
individual cases of human fetal deformities reveals, again, no
connection between LSD use and such injury. If there had been any
such connection, it would long since have attracted attention,
for several million people by now have taken LSD.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Pharmacological Properties of LSD </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD is absorbed easily and completely through
the gastrointestinal tract. It is therefore unnecessary to inject
LSD, except for special purposes. Experiments on mice with
radioactively labeled LSD have established that intravenously
injected LSD disappeared down to a small vestige, very rapidly
from the bloodstream and was distributed throughout the organism.
Unexpectedly, the lowest concentration is found in the brain. It
is concentrated here in certain centers of the midbrain that play
a role in the regulation of emotion. Such findings give
indications as to the localization of certain psychic functions
in the brain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The concentration of LSD in the various organs
attains maximum values 10 to 15 minutes after injection, then
falls off again swiftly. The small intestine, in which the
concentration attains the maximum within two hours, constitutes
an exception. The elimination of LSD is conducted for the most
part (up to some 80 percent) through the intestine via liver and
bile. Only 1 to 10 percent of the elimination product exists as
unaltered LSD; the remainder is made up of various transformation
products. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the psychic effects of LSD persist even after it
can no longer be detected in the organism, we must assume that
LSD is not active as such, but that it rather triggers certain
biochemical, neurophysiological, and psychic mechanisms that
provoke the inebriated condition and continue in the absence of
the active principle. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD stimulates centers of the sympathetic nervous
system in the midbrain, which leads to pupillary dilatation,
increase in body temperature, and rise in the blood-sugar level.
The uterine-constricting activity of LSD has already been
mentioned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An especially interesting pharmacological property
of LSD, discovered by J. H. Gaddum in England, is its
serotonin-blocking effect. Serotonin is a hormone-like substance,
occurring naturally in various organs of warm-blooded animals.
Concentrated in the midbrain, it plays an important role in the
propagation of impulses in certain nerves and therefore in the
biochemistry of psychic functions. The disruption of natural
functioning of serotonin by LSD was for some time regarded as an
explanation of its psychic effects. However, it was soon shown
that even certain derivatives of LSD (compounds in which the
chemical structure of LSD is slightly modified) that exhibit no
hallucinogenic properties, inhibit the effects of serotonin just
as strongly, or yet more strongly, than unaltered LSD. The
serotonin-blocking effect of LSD thus does not suffice to explain
its hallucinogenic properties. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD also influences neurophysiological functions
that are connected with dopamine, which is, like serotonin, a
naturally occurring hormone-like substance. Most of the brain
centers receptive to dopamine become activated by LSD, while the
others are depressed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As yet we do not know the biochemical mechanisms
through which LSD exerts its psychic effects. Investigations of
the interactions of LSD with brain factors like serotonin and
dopamine, however, are examples of how LSD can serve as a tool in
brain research, in the study of the biochemical processes that
underlie the psychic functions. </p>

<h3>3. Chemical Modifications of LSD </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When a new type of active compound is discovered in
pharmaceutical-chemical research, whether by isolation from a
plant drug or from animal organs, or through synthetic production
as in the case of LSD, then the chemist attempts, through
alterations in its molecular structure, to produce new compounds
with similar, perhaps improved activity, or with other valuable
active properties. We call this process a <i>chemical
modification </i>of this type of active substance. Of the
approximately 20,000 new substances that are produced annually in
the pharmaceutical-chemical research laboratories of the world,
the overwhelming majority are modification products of
proportionally few types of active compounds. The discovery of a
really new type of active substance&#151;new with regard to
chemical structure and pharmacological effect&#151;is a rare
stroke of luck. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after the discovery of the psychic effects of
LSD, two coworkers were assigned to join me in carrying out the
chemical modification of LSD on a broader basis and in further
investigations in the field of ergot alkaloids. The work on the
chemical structure of ergot alkaloids of the peptide type, to
which ergotamine and the alkaloids of the ergotoxine group
belong, continued with Dr. Theodor Petrzilka. Working with Dr.
Franz Troxler, I produced a great number of chemical
modifications of LSD, and we attempted to gain further insights
into the structure of lysergic acid, for which the American
researchers had already proposed a structural formula. In 1949 we
succeeded in correcting this formula and specifying the valid
structure of this common nucleus of all ergot alkaloids,
including of course LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The investigations of the peptide alkaloids of
ergot led to the complete structural formulas of these
substances, which we published in 1951. Their correctness was
confirmed through the total synthesis of ergotamine, which was
realized ten years later in collaboration with two younger
coworkers, Dr. Albert J. Frey and Dr. Hans Ott. Another coworker,
Dr. Paul A. Stadler, was largely responsible for the development
of this synthesis into a process practicable on an industrial
scale. The synthetic production of peptide ergot alkaloids using
lysergic acid obtained from special cultures of the ergot fungus
in tanks has great economic importance. This procedure is used to
produce the starting material for the medicaments Hydergine and
Dihydergot. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now we return to the chemical modifications of LSD.
Many LSD derivatives were produced, since 1945, in collaboration
with' Dr. Troxler, but none proved hallucinogenically more active
than LSD. Indeed, the very closest relatives proved themselves
essentially less active in this respect. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are four different possibilities of spatial
arrangement of atoms in the LSD molecule. They are differentiated
in technical language by the prefix <i>iso- </i>and the letters <i>D</i>
and <i>L</i>. Besides LSD, which is more precisely designated as
D-lysergic acid diethylamide, I have also produced and likewise
tested in self-experiments the three other spatially different
forms, namely D-isolysergic acid diethylamide (iso-LSD),
L-lysergic acid diethylamide (L-LSD), and L-isolysergic acid
diethylamide (L-iso-LSD). The last three forms of LSD showed no
psychic effects up to a dose of 0.5 mg, which corresponds to a
20-fold quantity of a still distinctly active LSD dose. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A substance very closely related to LSD, the
monoethylamide of lysergic acid (LAE-23), in which an ethyl group
is replaced by a hydrogen atom on the diethylamide residue of
LSD, proved to be some ten times less psychoactive than LSD. The
hallucinogenic effect of this substance is also qualitatively
different: it is characterized by a narcotic component. This
narcotic effect is yet more pronounced in lysergic acid amide
(LA-111), in which both ethyl groups of LSD are displaced by
hydrogen atoms. These effects, which I established in comparative
self-experiments with LA-111 and LAE-32, were corroborated by
subsequent clinical investigations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fifteen years later we encountered lysergic acid
amide, which had been produced synthetically for these
investigations, as a naturally occurring active principle of the
Mexican magic drug <i>ololiuqui.</i> In a later chapter I shall
deal more fully with this unexpected discovery. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Certain results of the chemical modification of LSD
proved valuable to medicinal research; LSD derivatives were found
that were only weakly or not at all hallucinogenic, but instead
exhibited other effects of LSD to an increased extent. Such an
effect of LSD is its blocking effect on the neurotransmitter
serotonin (referred to previously in the discussion of the
pharmacological properties of LSD). As serotonin plays a role in
allergic-inflammatory processes and also in the generation of
migraine, a specific serotonin-blocking substance was of great
significance to medicinal research. We therefore searched
systematically for LSD derivatives without hallucinogenic
effects, but with the highest possible activity as serotonin
blockers. The first such active substance was found in bromo-LSD,
which has become known in medicinal-biological research under the
designation BOL-148. In the course of our investigations on
serotonin antagonists, Dr. Troxler produced in the sequel yet
stronger and more specifically active compounds. The most active
entered the medicinal market as a medicament for the treatment of
migraine, under the trademark &quot;Deseril&quot; or, in
English-speaking countries, &quot;Sansert.&quot; </p>

<h3>4. Use of LSD in Psychiatry </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after LSD was tried on animals, the first
systematic investigation of the substance was carried out on
human beings, at the psychiatric clinic of the University of
Zurich. Werner A. Stoll, M.D. (a son of Professor Arthur Stoll),
who led this research, published his results in 1947 in the <i>Schweizer
Archiv fur Neurologie und Psychiatrie,</i> under the title
&quot;Lysergsäure-diathylämid, ein Phantastikum aus der
Mutterkorngruppe&quot; [Lysergic acid diethylamide, a
phantasticum from the ergot group]. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The tests involved healthy research subjects as
well as schizophrenic patients. The dosages&#151;substantially
lower than in my first self-experiment with 0.25 mg LSD
tartrate&#151;amounted to only 0.02 to 0.13 mg. The emotional
state during the LSD inebriation was here predominantly euphoric,
whereas in my experiment the mood was marked by grave side
effects resulting from overdosage and, of course, fear of the
uncertain outcome. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This fundamental publication, which gave a
scientific description of all the basic features of LSD
inebriation, classified the new active principle as a
phantasticum. However, the question of <i>therapeutic application</i>
of LSD remained unanswered. On the other hand, the report
emphasized the extraordinarily high activity of LSD, which
corresponds to the activity of trace substances occurring in the
organism that are considered to be responsible for certain mental
disorders. Another subject discussed in this first publication
was the possible application of LSD as a research tool in
psychiatry, which follows from its tremendous psychic activity.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>First Self-Experiment by a Psychiatrist </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In his paper, W. A. Stoll also gave a detailed
description of his own personal experiment with LSD. Since this
was the first self-experiment published by a psychiatrist, and
since it describes many characteristic features of LSD
inebriation, it is interesting to quote extensively from the
report. I warmly thank the author for kind permission to
republish this extract. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>At 8 o'clock I took 60 mcg (0.06 milligrams) of LSD. Some
    20 minutes later, the first symptoms appeared: heaviness in
    the limbs, slight atactic (i.e., confused, uncoordinated)
    symptoms. A subjectively very unpleasant phase of general
    malaise followed, in parallel with the drop in blood pressure
    registered by the examiners. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A certain euphoria then set in, though it
    seemed weaker to me than experiences in an earlier
    experiment. The ataxia increased, and I went
    &quot;sailing&quot; around the room with large strides. I
    felt somewhat better, but was glad to lie down. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Afterward the room was darkened (dark
    experiment); there followed an unprecedented experience of
    unimaginable intensity that kept increasing in strength. It w
    as characterized by an unbelievable profusion of optical
    hallucinations that appeared and vanished with great speed,
    to make way for countless new images. I saw a profusion of
    circles, vortices, sparks, showers, crosses, and spirals in
    constant, racing flux. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The images appeared to stream in on me
    predominantly from the center of the visual field, or out of
    the lower left edge. When a picture appeared in the middle,
    the remaining field of vision was simultaneously filled up
    with a vast number of similar visions. All were colored:
    bright, luminous red, yellow, and green predominated. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I never managed to linger on any picture. When
    the supervisor of the experiment emphasized my great
    fantasies, the richness of my statements, I could only react
    with a sympathetic smile. I knew, in fact, that I could not
    retain, much less describe, more than a fraction of the
    pictures. I had to force myself to give a description. Terms
    such as &quot;fireworks&quot; or &quot;kaleidoscopic&quot;
    were poor and inadequate. I felt that I had to immerse myself
    more and more deeply into this strange and fascinating world,
    in order to allow the exuberance, the unimaginable wealth, to
    work on me. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; At first, the hallucinations were elementary:
    rays, bundles of rays, rain, rings, vortices, loops, sprays,
    clouds, etc. Then more highly organized visions also
    appeared: arches, rows of arches, a sea of roofs, desert
    landscapes, terraces, flickering fire, starry skies of
    unbelievable splendor. The original, more simple images
    continued in the midst of these more highly organized
    hallucinations. I remember the following images in
    particular: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A succession of towering, Gothic vaults, an
    endless choir, of which I could not see the lower portions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A landscape of skyscrapers, reminiscent of
    pictures of the entrance to New York harbor: house towers
    staggered behind and beside one another with innumerable rows
    of windows. Again the foundation was missing. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A system of masts and ropes, which reminded me
    of a reproduction of a painting seen the previous day (the
    inside of a circus tent). <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; An evening sky of an unimaginable pale blue
    over the dark roofs of a Spanish city. I had a peculiar
    feeling of anticipation, was full of joy and decidedly ready
    for adventure. All at once the stars flared up, amassed, and
    turned to a dense rain of stars and sparks that streamed
    toward me. City and sky had disappeared. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I was in a garden, saw brilliant red, yellow,
    and green lights falling through a dark trelliswork, an
    indescribably joyous experience. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It was significant that all the images
    consisted of countless repetitions of the same elements: many
    sparks, many circles, many arches, many windows, many fires,
    etc. I never saw isolated images, but always duplications of
    the same image, endlessly repeated. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I felt myself one with all romanticists and
    dreamers, thought of E. T. A. Hoffmann, saw the maelstrom of
    Poe (even though, at the time I had read Poe, his description
    seemed exaggerated). Often I seemed to stand at the pinnacle
    of artistic experience; I luxuriated in the colors of the
    altar of Isenheim, and knew the euphoria and exultation of an
    artistic vision. I must also have spoken again and again of
    modern art; I thought of abstract pictures, which all at once
    I seemed to understand. Then again, there were impressions of
    an extreme trashiness, both in their shapes and their color
    combinations. The most garish, cheap modern lamp ornaments
    and sofa pillows came into my mind. The train of thought was
    quickened. But I had the feeling the supervisor of the
    experiment could still keep up with me. Of course I knew,
    intellectually, that I was rushing him. At first I had
    descriptions rapidly at hand. With the increasingly frenzied
    pace, it became impossible to think a thought through to the
    end. I must have only started many sentences. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; When I tried to restrict myself to specific
    subjects, the experiment proved most unsuccessful. My mind
    would even focus, in a certain sense, on contrary images:
    skyscrapers instead of a church, a broad desert instead of a
    mountain. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I assumed that I had accurately estimated the
    elapsed time, but did not take the matter very seriously.
    Such questions did not interest me in the slightest. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; My state of mind was consciously euphoric. I
    enjoyed the condition, was serene, and took a most active
    interest in the experience. From time to time I opened my
    eyes. The weak red light seemed mysterious, much more than
    before. The busily writing research supervisor appeared to me
    to be very far away. Often I had peculiar bodily sensations:
    I believed my hands to be attached to some distant body, but
    was not certain whether it was my own. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; After termination of the first dark experiment,
    I strolled about in the room a bit, was unsure on my legs,
    and again felt less well. I became cold and was thankful that
    the research supervisor covered me with a blanket. I felt
    unkempt, unshaven, and unwashed. The room seemed strange and
    broad. Later I squatted on a high stool, thinking all the
    while that I sat there like a bird on the roost. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The supervisor emphasized my own wretched
    appearance. He seemed remarkably graceful. I myself had
    small, finely formed hands. As I washed them, it was
    happening a long way from me, somewhere down below on the
    right. It was questionable, but utterly unimportant, whether
    they were my own hands. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In the landscape outside, well known to me,
    many things appeared to have changed. Besides the
    hallucinations, I could now see the real as well. Later this
    was no longer possible, although I remained aware that
    reality was otherwise. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A barracks, and the garage standing before it
    to the left, suddenly changed to a landscape of ruins,
    shattered to pieces. I saw wall wreckage and projecting
    beams, inspired undoubtedly by the memory of the war events
    in this region. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In a uniform, extensive field, I kept seeing
    figures, which I tried to draw, but could get no farther than
    the crudest beginnings. I saw an extremely opulent sculptural
    ornamentation in constant metamorphosis, in continuous flux.
    I was reminded of every possible foreign culture, saw
    Mexican, Indian motifs. Between a grating of small beams and
    tendrils appeared little caricatures, idols, masks, strangely
    mixed all of a sudden with childish drawings of people. The
    tempo was slackened compared to the dark experiment. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The euphoria had now vanished. I became
    depressed, especially during the second dark experiment,
    which followed. Whereas during the first dark experiment, the
    hallucinations had alternated with great rapidity in bright
    and luminous colors, now blue, violet, and dark green
    prevailed. The movement of larger images was slower milder,
    quieter, although even these were composed of finely raining
    &quot;elemental dots,&quot; which streamed and whirled about
    quickly. During the first dark experiment, the commotion had
    frequently intruded upon me; now it often led distinctly away
    from me into the center of the picture, where a sucking mouth
    appeared. I saw grottoes with fantastic erosions and
    stalactites, reminding me of the child's book <i>Im
    Wunderreiche des Bergkonigs </i>[In the wondrous realm of the
    mountain king]. Serene systems of arches rose up. On the
    right-hand side, a row of shed roofs suddenly appeared; I
    thought of an evening ride homeward during military service.
    Significantly it involved a homeward ride: there was no
    longer anything like departure or love of adventure. I felt
    protected, enveloped by motherliness, was in peace. The
    hallucinations were no longer exciting, but instead mild and
    attenuated. Somewhat later I had the feeling of possessing
    the same motherly strength. I perceived an inclination, a
    desire to help, and behaved then in an exaggeratedly
    sentimental and trashy manner, where medical ethics are
    concerned. I realized this and was able to stop. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; But the depressed state of mind remained. I
    tried again and again to see bright and joyful images. But to
    no avail; only dark blue and green patterns emerged. I longed
    to imagine bright fire as in the first dark experiment. And I
    did see fires; however, they were sacrificial fires on the
    gloomy battlement of a citadel on a remote, autumnal heath.
    Once I managed to behold a bright ascending multitude of
    sparks, but at half-altitude it transformed itself into a
    group of silently moving spots from a peacock's tail. During
    the experiment I was very impressed that my state of mind and
    the type of hallucinations harmonized so consistently and
    uninterruptedly. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; During the second dark experiment I observed
    that random noises, and also noises intentionally produced by
    the supervisor of the experiment, provoked simultaneous
    changes in the optical impressions (synesthesia). In the same
    manner, pressure on the eyeball produced alterations of
    visual perceptions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the end of the second dark experiment, I
    began to watch for sexual fantasies, which were, however,
    totally absent. In no way could I experience sexual desire. I
    wanted to imagine a picture of a woman; only a crude
    modern-primitive sculpture appeared. It seemed completely
    unerotic, and its forms were immediately replaced by agitated
    circles and loops. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; After the second dark experiment I felt
    benumbed and physically unwell. I perspired, was exhausted. I
    was thankful not to have to go to the cafeteria for lunch.
    The laboratory assistant who brought us the food appeared to
    me small and distant, of the same remarkable daintiness as
    the supervisor of the experiment. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometime around 3:00 P.M. I felt better, so
    that the supervisor could pursue his work. With some effort I
    managed to take notes myself. I sat at the table, wanted to
    read, but could not concentrate. Once I seemed to myself like
    a shape from a surrealistic picture, whose limbs were not
    connected with the body, but were rather painted somewhere
    close by.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I was depressed and thought with interest of
    the possibility of suicide. With some terror I apprehended
    that such thoughts were remarkably familiar to me. It seemed
    singularly self-evident that a depressed person commits
    suicide.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; On the way home and in the evening I was again
    euphoric, brimming with the experiences of the morning. I had
    experienced unexpected, impressive things. It seemed to me
    that a great epoch of my life had been crowded into a few
    hours. I was tempted to repeat the experiment. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The next day I was careless in my thinking and
    conduct, had great trouble concentrating, was apathetic. . .
    . The casual, slightly dream-like condition persisted into
    the afternoon. I had great trouble reporting in any organized
    way on a simple problem. I felt a growing general weariness,
    an increasing awareness that I had now returned to everyday
    reality. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The second day after the experiment brought an
    irresolute state.... Mild, but distinct depression was
    experienced during the following week, a feeling which of
    course could be related only indirectly to LSD. </p>

<h4>The Psychic Effects of LSD </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The picture of the activity of LSD obtained from
these first investigations was not new to science. It largely
matched the commonly held view of mescaline, an alkaloid that had
been investigated as early as the turn of the century. Mescaline
is the psychoactive constituent of a Mexican cactus <i>Lophophora
williamsii </i>(syn. <i>Anhalonium lewinii)</i>. This cactus has
been eaten by American Indians ever since pre-Columbian times,
and is still used today as a sacred drug in religious ceremonies.
In his monograph <i>Phantastica </i>(Verlag Georg Stilke, Berlin,
1924), L. Lewin has amply described the history of this drug,
called peyotl by the Aztecs. The alkaloid mescaline was isolated
from the cactus by A. Heffter in 1896, and in 1919 its chemical
structure was elucidated and it was produced synthetically by E.
Spath. It was the first hallucinogen or phantasticum (as this
type of active compound was described by Lewin) to become
available as a pure substance, permitting the study of chemically
induced changes of sensory perceptions, mental illusions
(hallucinations), and alterations of consciousness. In the 1920s
extended experiments with mescaline were carried out on animal
and human subjects and described comprehensively by K. Beringer
in his book <i>Der Meskalinrausch </i>(Verlag Julius Springer,
Berlin, 1927). Because these investigations failed to indicate
any applications of mescaline in medicine, interest in this
active substance waned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the discovery of LSD, hallucinogen research
received a new impetus. The novelty of LSD as opposed to
mescaline was its high activity, lying in a different order of
magnitude. The active dose of mescaline, 0.2 to 0.5 g, is
comparable to 0.00002 to 0.0001 g of LSD; in other words, LSD is
some 5,000 to 10,000 times more active than mescaline. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD's unique position among the
psychopharmaceuticals is not only due to its high activity, in a
quantitative sense. The substance also has qualitative
significance: it manifests a high specificity, that is, an
activity aimed specifically at the human psyche. It can be
assumed, therefore, that LSD affects the highest control centers
of the psychic and intellectual functions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychic effects of LSD, which are produced by
such minimal quantities of material, are too meaningful and too
multiform to be explained by toxic alterations of brain function.
If LSD acted only through a toxic effect on the brain, then LSD
experiences would be entirely psychopathological in meaning,
without any psychological or psychiatric interest. On the
contrary, it is likely that alterations of nerve conductivity and
influence on the activity of nerve connections (synapses), which
have been experimentally demonstrated, play an important role.
This could mean that an influence is being exerted on the
extremely complex system of cross-connections and synapses
between the many billions of brain cells, the system on which the
higher psychic and intellectual functions depend. This would be a
promising area to explore in the search for an explanation of
LSD's radical efficacy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The nature of LSD's activity could lead to numerous
possibilities of medicinal-psychiatric uses, as W. A. Stoll's
ground-breaking studies had already shown. Sandoz therefore made
the new active substance available to research institutes and
physicians as an experimental drug, giving it the trade name
Delysid (D-Lysergsäure-diäthylamid) which I had proposed. The
printed prospectus below describes possible applications of this
kind and voices the necessary precautions. <center></p>

<h4>Delysid (LSD 25)</h4>

<h4>D-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate </h4>

<p>&nbsp; Sugar-coated tablets containing 0.025 mg. (25 µg) <br>
Ampoules of 1 ml. containing 0.1 mg. (100 µg) for <br>
oral administration</p>

<p> The solution may also be injected s.c. or i.v. The <br>
effect is identical with that of oral administration <br>
but sets in more rapidly.</center></p>

<p> <center><b>PROPERTIES </b></center></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The administration of very small doses of
Delysid (1/2-2 µg/kg body weight) results in transitory
disturbances of affect, hallucinations, depersonalization,
reliving of repressed memories, and mild neurovegetative
symptoms. The effect sets in after 30 to 90 minutes and generally
lasts 5 to 12 hours. However, intermittent disturbances of affect
may occasionally persist for several days.</p>

<p> <center><b>METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION </b></center></p>

<p> For oral administration the contents of 1 ampoule of Delysid
are diluted with distilled water, a 1% solution of tartaric acid
or halogen-free tap water. The absorption of the solution is
somewhat more rapid and more constant than that of the tablets.
Ampoules which have not been opened, which have been protected
against light and stored in a cool place are stable for an
unlimited period. Ampoules which have been opened or diluted
solutions retain their effectiveness for 1 to 2 days, if stored
in a refrigerator.</p>

<p> <center><b>INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE </b></center></p>

<p> a) Analytical psychotherapy, to elicit release of repressed
material and provide mental relaxation, particularly in anxiety
states and obsessional neuroses.<br>
The initial dose is 25 µg (1/4 of an ampoule or 1 tablet). This
dose is increased at each treatment by 25 µg until the optimum
dose (usually between 50 and 200 µg) is found. The individual
treatments are best given at intervals of one week.<br>
b) Experimental studies on the nature of psychoses: By taking
Delysid himself, the psychiatrist is able to gain an insight into
the world of ideas and sensations of mental patients. Delysid can
also be used to induce model psychoses of short duration in
normal subjects, thus facilitating studies on the pathogenesis of
mental disease.<br>
In normal subjects, doses of 25 to 75 µg re generally sufficient
to produce a hallucinatory psychosis (on an average 1 µg/kg body
weight). In certain forms of psychosis and in chronic alcoholism,
higher doses are necessary (2 to 4 µg/kg body weight).</p>

<p> <center><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></center></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Pathological mental conditions may be
intensified by Delysid. Particular caution is necessary in
subjects with a suicidal tendency and in those cases where a
psychotic development appears imminent. The psycho-affective
liability and the tendency to commit impulsive acts may
occasionally last for some days.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Delysid should only be administered under strict
medical supervision. The supervision should not be discontinued
until the effects of the drug have completely orn off.</p>

<p> <center><b>ANTIDOTE </b></center></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The mental effects of Delysid can be rapidly
reversed by the i.m. administration of 50 mg chlorpromazine.</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The use of LSD in analytical psychotherapy is based
mainly on the following psychic effects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In LSD inebriation the accustomed world view
undergoes a deep-seated transformation and disintegration.
Connected with this is a loosening or even suspension of the
I-you barrier. Patients who are bogged down in an egocentric
problem cycle can thereby be helped to release themselves from
their fixation and isolation. The result can be an improved
rapport with the doctor and a greater susceptibility to
psychotherapeutic influence. The enhanced suggestibility under
the influence of LSD works toward the same goal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another significant, psychotherapeutically valuable
characteristic of LSD inebriation is the tendency of long
forgotten or suppressed contents of experience to appear again in
consciousness. Traumatic events, which are sought in
psychoanalysis, may then become accessible to psychotherapeutic
treatment. Numerous case histories tell of experiences from even
the earliest childhood that were vividly recalled during
psychoanalysis under the influence of LSD. This does not involve
an ordinary recollection, but rather a true reliving; not a <i>réminiscence,</i>
but rather a <i>réviviscence,</i> as the French psychiatrist
Jean Delay has formulated it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD does not act as a true medicament; rather it
plays the role of a drug aid in the context of psychoanalytic and
psychotherapeutic treatment and serves to channel the treatment
more effectively and to shorten its duration. It can fulfill this
function in two particular ways. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In one procedure, which was developed in European
clinics and given the name <i>psychotytic therapy,</i> moderately
strong doses of LSD are administered in several successive
sessions at regular intervals. Subsequently the LSD experiences
are worked out in group discussions, and in expression therapy by
drawing and painting. The term <i>psycholytic therapy </i>was
coined by Ronald A. Sandison, an English therapist of Jungian
orientation and a pioneerof clinical LSD research. The root <i>-lysis
</i>or <i>-lytic </i>signifies the dissolution of tension or
conflicts in the human psyche. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a second procedure, which is the favored
treatment in the United States, a single, very high LSD dose (0.3
to 0.6 mg) is administered after correspondingly intensive
psychological preparation of the patients. This method, described
as <i>psychedelic therapy</i>, attempts to induce a
mystical-religious experience through the shock effects of LSD.
This experience can then serve as a starting point for a
restructuring and curing of the patient's personality in the
accompanying psychotherapeutic treatment. The term <i>psychedelic</i>,
which can be translated as &quot;mind-manifesting&quot; or
&quot;mind-expanding,&quot; was introduced by Humphry Osmond, a
pioneer of LSD research in the United States. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD's apparent benefits as a drug auxiliary in
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are derived from properties
diametrically opposed to the effects of tranquilizer-type
psychopharmaceuticals. Whereas tranquilizers tend to cover up the
patient's problems and conflicts, reducing their apparent gravity
and importance: LSD, on the contrary, makes them more exposed and
more intensely experienced. This clearer recognition of problems
and conflicts makes them, in turn, more susceptible to
psychotherapeutic treatment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The suitability and success of LSD in
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are still a subject of
controversy in professional circles. The same could be said,
however, of other procedures employed in psychiatry such as
electroshock, insulin therapy, or psychosurgery, procedures that
entail, moreover, a far greater risk than the use of LSD, which
under suitable conditions can be considered practically safe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because forgotten or repressed experiences, under
the influence of LSD, may become conscious with considerable
speed, the treatment can be correspondingly shortened. To some
psychiatrists, however, this reduction of the therapy's duration
is a disadvantage. They are of the opinion that this
precipitation leaves the patient insufficient time for
psychotherapeutic working-through. The therapeutic effect they
believe, persists for a shorter time than when there is a gradual
treatment, including a slow process of becoming conscious of the
traumatic experiences. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Psycholytic and especially psychedelic therapy
require thorough preparation of the patient for the LSD
experience, to avoid his or her being frightened by the unusual
and the unfamiliar. Only then is a positive interpretation of the
experience possible. The selection of patients is also important,
since not all types of psychic disturbance respond equally well
to these methods of treatment. Successful use of LSD-assisted
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy presupposes specific knowledge
and experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this respect self-examination by psychiatrists,
as W. A. Stoll has pointed out, can be most useful. They provide
the doctors with direct insight, based on firsthand experience
into the strange world of LSD inebriation, and make it possible
for them truly to understand these phenomena in their patients,
to interpret them properly, and to take full advantage of them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The following pioneers in use of LSD as a drug aid
in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy deserve to be named in the
front rank: A. K. Busch and W. C. Johnson, S. Cohen and B.
Eisner, H. A. Abramson, H. Osmond, and A. Hoffer in the United
States; R. A. Sandison in England; W. Frederking and H. Leuner in
Germany; and G. Roubicek and S. Grof in Czechoslovakia. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The second indication for LSD cited in the Sandoz
prospectus on Delysid concerns its use in experimental
investigations on the nature of psychoses. This arises from the
fact that extraordinary psychic states experimentally produced by
LSD in healthy research subjects are similar to many
manifestations of certain mental disturbances. In the early days
of LSD research, it was often claimed that LSD inebriation has
something to do with a type of &quot;model psychosis.&quot; This
idea was dismissed, however, because extended comparative
investigations showed that there were essential differences
between the manifestations of psychosis and the LSD experience.
With the LSD model, nevertheless, it is possible to study
deviations from the normal psychic and mental condition, and to
observe the biochemical and electrophysiological alterations
associated with them. Perhaps we shall thereby gain new insights
into the nature of psychoses. According to certain theories,
various mental disturbances could be produced by psychotoxic
metabolic products that have the power, even in minimal
quantities, to alter the functions of brain cells. LSD represents
a substance that certainly does not occur in the human organism,
but whose existence and activity let it seem possible that
abnormal metabolic products could exist, that even in trace
quantities could produce mental disturbances. As a result, the
conception of a biochemical origin of certain mental disturbances
has received broader support, and research in this direction has
been stimulated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One medicinal use of LSD that touches on
fundamental ethical questions is its administration to the dying.
This practice arose from observations in American clinics that
especially severe painful conditions of cancer patients, which no
longer respond to conventional pain-relieving medication, could
be alleviated or completely abolished by LSD. Of course, this
does not involve an analgesic effect in the true sense. The
diminution of pain sensitivity may rather occur because patients
under the influence of LSD are psychologically so dissociated
from their bodies that physical pain no longer penetrates their
consciousness. In order for LSD to be effective in such cases, it
is especially crucial that patients be prepared and instructed
about the kind of experiences and transformations that await
them. In many cases it has proved beneficial for either a member
of the clergy or a psychotherapist to guide the patient's
thoughts in a religious direction. Numerous case histories tell
of patients who gained meaningful insights about life and death
on their deathbeds as, freed from pain in LSD ecstasy and
reconciled to their fate, they faced their earthly demise
fearlessly and in peace. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hitherto existing knowledge about the
administration of LSD to the terminally ill has been summarized
and published by S. Grof and J. Halifax in their book <i>The
Human Encounter with Death</i> (E. P. Dutton, New York, 1977).
The authors, together with E. Kast, S. Cohen, and W. A. Pahnke,
are among the pioneers of this application of LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The most recent comprehensive publication on the
use of LSD in psychiatry, <i>Realms of the Human Unconscious:
Observations from LSD Research</i> (The Viking Press, New York,
1975), likewise comes from S. Grof, the Czech psychiatrist who
has emigrated to the United States. This book offers a critical
evaluation of the LSD experience from the viewpoint of Freud and
Jung, as well as of existential analysis. </p>

<h3>5. From Remedy to Inebriant </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the first years after its discovery, LSD
brought me the same happiness and gratification that any
pharmaceutical chemist would feel on learning that a substance he
or she produced might possibly develop into a valuable
medicament. For the creation of new remedies is the goal of a
pharmaceutical chemist's research activity; therein lies the
meaning of his or her work.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Nonmedical Use of LSD </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This joy at having fathered LSD was tarnished
after more than ten years of uninterrupted scientific research
and medicinal use when LSD was swept up in the huge wave of an
inebriant mania that began to spread over the Western world,
above all the United States, at the end of the 1950s. It was
strange how rapidly LSD adopted its new role as inebriant and,
for a time, became the number-one inebriating drug, at least as
far as publicity was concerned. The more its use as an inebriant
was disseminated, bringing an upsurge in the number of untoward
incidents caused by careless, medically unsupervised use, the
more LSD became a problem child for me and for the Sandoz firm. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was obvious that a substance with such fantastic
effects on mental perception and on the experience of the outer
and inner world would also arouse interest outside medical
science, but I had not expected that LSD, with its unfathomably
uncanny, profound effects, so unlike the character of a
recreational drug, would ever find worldwide use as an inebriant.
I had expected curiosity and interest on the part of artists
outside of medicine&#151;performers, painters, and
writers&#151;but not among people in general. After the
scientific publications around the turn of the century on
mescaline&#151;which, as already mentioned, evokes psychic
effects quite like those of LSD&#151;the use of this compound
remained confined to medicine and to experiments within artistic
and literary circles. I had expected the same fate for LSD. And
indeed, the first non-medicinal self-experiments with LSD were
carried out by writers, painters, musicians, and other
intellectuals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD sessions had reportedly provoked extraordinary
aesthetic experiences and granted new insights into the essence
of the creative process. Artists were influenced in their
creative work in unconventional ways. A particular type of art
developed that has become known as psychedelic art. It comprises
creations produced under the influenced of LSD and other
psychedelic drugs, whereby the drugs acted as stimulus and source
of inspiration. The standard publication in this field is the
book by Robert E. L. Masters and Jean Houston, <i>Psychedelic Art</i>
(Balance House, 1968). Works of psychedelic art are not created
while the drug is in effect, but only afterward, the artist being
inspired by these experiences. As long as the inebriated
condition lasts, creative activity is impeded, if not completely
halted. The influx of images is too great and is increasing too
rapidly to be portrayed and fashioned. An overwhelming vision
paralyzes activity. Artistic productions arising directly from
LSD inebriation, therefore, are mostly rudimentary in character
and deserve consideration not because of their artistic merit,
but because they are a type of psychoprogram, which offers
insight into the deepest mental structures of the artist,
activated and made conscious by LSD. This was demonstrated later
in a large-scale experiment by the Munich psychiatrist Richard P.
Hartmann, in which thirty famous painters took part. He published
the results in his book <i>Malerei aus Bereichen des Unbewussten:
Kunstler Experimentieren unter LSD</i> [Painting from spheres of
the unconscious: artists experiment with LSD], Verlag M. Du Mont
Schauberg, Cologne, 1974). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD experiments also gave new impetus to
exploration into the essence of religious and mystical
experience. Religious scholars and philosophers discussed the
question whether the religious and mystical experiences often
discovered in LSD sessions were genuine, that is, comparable to
spontaneous mysticoreligious enlightenment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This nonmedicinal yet earnest phase of LSD
research, at times in parallel with medicinal research, at times
following it, was increasingly overshadowed at the beginning of
the 1960s, as LSD use spread with epidemic-like speed through all
social classes, as a sensational inebriating drug, in the course
of the inebriant mania in the United States. The rapid rise of
drug use, which had its beginning in this country about twenty
years ago, was not, however, a consequence of the discovery of
LSD, as superficial observers often declared. Rather it had
deep-seated sociological causes: materialism, alienation from
nature through industrialization and increasing urbanization,
lack of satisfaction in professional employment in a mechanized,
lifeless working world, ennui and purposelessness in a wealthy,
saturated society, and lack of a religious, nurturing, and
meaningful philosophical foundation of life. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The existence of LSD was even regarded by the drug
enthusiasts as a predestined coincidence&#151;it had to be
discovered precisely at this time in order to bring help to
people suffering under the modern conditions. It is not
surprising that LSD first came into circulation as an inebriating
drug in the United States, the country in which
industrialization, urbanization, and mechanization, even of
agriculture, are most broadly advanced. These are the same
factors that have led to the origin and growth of the hippie
movement that developed simultaneously with the LSD wave. The two
cannot be dissociated. It would be worth investigating to what
extent the consumption of psychedelic drugs furthered the hippie
movement and conversely. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The spread of LSD from medicine and psychiatry into
the drug scene was introduced and expedited by publications on
sensational LSD experiments that, although they were carried out
in psychiatric clinics and universities, were not then reported
in scientific journals, but rather in magazines and daily papers,
greatly elaborated. Reporters made themselves available as guinea
pigs. Sidney Katz, for example, participated in an LSD experiment
in the Saskatchewan Hospital in Canada under the supervision of
noted psychiatrists; his experiences, however, were not published
in a medical journal. Instead, he described them in an article
entitled &quot;My Twelve Hours as a Madman&quot; in his magazine <i>MacLean's
Canada National Magazine,</i> colorfully illustrated in fanciful
fullness of detail. The widely distributed German magazine <i>Quick,</i>
in its issue number 12 of 21 March 1954, reported a sensational
eyewitness account on &quot;Ein kuhnes wissenschaftliches
Experiment&quot; [a daring scientific experiment] by the painter
Wilfried Zeller, who took &quot;a few drops of lysergic
acid&quot; in the Viennese University Psychiatric Clinic. Of the
numerous publications of this type that have made effective lay
propaganda for LSD, it is sufficient to cite just one more
example: a large-scale, illustrated article in <i>Look</i>
magazine of September 1959. Entitled &quot;The Curious Story
Behind the New Cary Grant,&quot; it must have contributed
enormously to the diffusion of LSD consumption. The famous movie
star had received LSD in a respected clinic in California, in the
course of a psychotherapeutic treatment. He informed the Look
reporter that he had sought inner peace his whole life long, but
yoga, hypnosis, and mysticism had not helped him. Only the
treatment with LSD had made a new, self-strengthened man out of
him, so that after three frustrating marriages he now believed
himself really able to love and make a woman happy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The evolution of LSD from remedy to inebriating
drug was, however, primarily promoted by the activities of Dr.
Timothy Leary and Dr. Richard Alpert of Harvard University. In a
later section I will come to speak in more detail about Dr. Leary
and my meetings with this personage who has become known
worldwide as an apostle of LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Books also appeared on the U.S. market in which the
fantastic effects of LSD were reported more fully. Here only two
of the most important will be mentioned: <i>Exploring Inner Space</i>
by Jane Dunlap (Harcourt Brace and World, New York, 1961) and <i>My
Self and I </i>by Constance A. Newland (N A.L. Signet Books, New
York, 1963). Although in both cases LSD was used within the scope
of a psychiatric treatment, the authors addressed their books,
which became bestsellers, to the broad public. In her book,
subtitled &quot;The Intimate and Completely Frank Record of One
Woman's Courageous Experiment with Psychiatry's Newest Drug, LSD
25,&quot; Constance A. Newland described in intimate detail how
she had been cured of frigidity. After such avowals, one can
easily imagine that many people would want to try the wondrous
medicine for themselves. The mistaken opinion created by such
reports&#151; that it would be sufficient simply to take LSD in
order to accomplish such miraculous effects and transformations
in oneself&#151;soon led to broad diffusion of
self-experimentation with the new drug. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Objective, informative books about LSD and its
problems also appeared, such as the excellent work by the
psychiatrist Dr. Sidney Cohen, <i>The Beyond Within</i>
(Atheneum, New York, 1967), in which the dangers of careless use
are clearly exposed. This had, however, no power to put a stop to
the LSD epidemic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As LSD experiments were often carried out in
ignorance of the uncanny, unforeseeable, profound effects, and
without medical supervision, they frequently came to a bad end.
With increasing LSD consumption in the drug scene, there came an
increase in &quot;horror trips&quot;&#151;LSD experiments that
led to disoriented conditions and panic, often resulting in
accidents and even crime. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rapid rise of nonmedicinal LSD consumption at
the beginning of the 1960s was also partly attributable to the
fact that the drug laws then current in most countries did not
include LSD. For this reason, drug habitués changed from the
legally proscribed narcotics to the still-legal substance LSD.
Moreover, the last of the Sandoz patents for the production of
LSD expired in 1963, removing a further hindrance to illegal
manufacture of the drug. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rise of LSD in the drug scene caused our firm a
nonproductive, laborious burden. National control laboratories
and health authorities requested statements from us about
chemical and pharmacological properties, stability and toxicity
of LSD, and analytical methods for its detection in confiscated
drug samples, as well as in the human body, in blood and urine.
This brought a voluminous correspondence, which expanded in
connection with inquiries from all over the world about
accidents, poisonings, criminal acts, and so forth, resulting
from misuse of LSD. All this meant enormous, unprofitable
difficulties, which the business management of Sandoz regarded
with disapproval. Thus it happened one day that Professor Stoll,
managing director of the firm at the time, said to me
reproachfully: &quot;I would rather you had not discovered
LSD.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At that time, I was now and again assailed by
doubts whether the valuable pharmacological and psychic effects
of LSD might be outweighed by its dangers and by possible
injuries due to misuse. Would LSD become a blessing for humanity,
or a curse? This I often asked myself when I thought about my
problem child. My other preparations, Methergine,
Dihydroergotamine, and Hydergine, caused me no such problems and
difficulties. They were not problem children; lacking extravagant
properties leading to misuse, they have developed in a satisfying
manner into therapeutically valuable medicines. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The publicity about LSD attained its high point in
the years 1964 to 1966, not only with regard to enthusiastic
claims about the wondrous effects of LSD by drug fanatics and
hippies, but also to reports of accidents, mental breakdowns,
criminal acts, murders, and suicide under the influence of LSD. A
veritable LSD hysteria reigned.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Sandoz Stops LSD Distribution </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In view of this situation, the management of
Sandoz was forced to make a public statement on the LSD problem
and to publish accounts of the corresponding measures that had
been taken. The pertinent letter, dated 23 August 1965, by Dr. A.
Cerletti, at the time director of the Pharmaceutical Department
of Sandoz, is reproduced below: </p>

<p> <center></p>

<h4>Decision Regarding LSD 25 and Other Hallucinogenic Substances</h4>
</center>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; More than twenty years have elapsed since
    the discovery by Albert Hofmann of LSD 25 in the SANDOZ
    Laboratories. Whereas the . fundamental importance of this
    discovery may be assessed by its impact on the development of
    modern psychiatric research, it must be recognized that it
    placed a heavy burden of responsibility on SANDOZ, the owner
    of this product. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The finding of a new chemical with outstanding
    biological properties, apart from the scientific success
    implied by its synthesis, is usually the first decisive step
    toward profitable development of a new drug. In the case of
    LSD, however, it soon became clear that, despite the
    outstanding properties of this compound, or rather because of
    the very nature of these qualities, even though LSD was fully
    protected by SANDOZ-owned patents since the time of its first
    synthesis in 1938, the usual means of practical exploitation
    could not be envisaged. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, all the evidence obtained
    following the initial studies in animals and humans carried
    out in the SANDOZ research laboratories pointed to the
    important role that this substance could play as an
    investigational tool in neurological research and in
    psychiatry. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It was therefore decided to make LSD available
    free of charge to qualified experimental and clinical
    investigators all over the world. This broad research
    approach was assisted by the provision of any necessary
    technical aid and in many instances also by financial
    support. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; An enormous amount of scientific documents,
    published mainly in the international biochemical and medical
    literature and systematically listed in the &quot;SANDOZ
    Bibliography on LSD&quot; as well as in the &quot;Catalogue
    of Literature on Delysid&quot; periodically edited by SANDOZ,
    gives vivid proof of what has been achieved by following this
    line of policy over nearly two decades. By exercising this
    kind of &quot;nobile officium&quot; in accordance with the
    highest standards of medical ethics with all kinds of
    self-imposed precautions and restrictions, it was possible
    for many years to avoid the danger of abuse (i.e., use by
    people neither competent nor qualified), which is always
    inherent in a compound with exceptional CNS activity. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In spite of all our precautions, cases of LSD
    abuse have occurred from time to time in varying
    circumstances completely beyond the control of SANDOZ. Very
    recently this danger has increased considerably and in some
    parts of the world has reached the scale of a serious threat
    to public health. This state of affairs has now reached a
    critical point for the following reasons: (1) A worldwide
    spread of misconceptions of LSD has been caused by an
    increasing amount of publicity aimed at provoking an active
    interest in laypeople by means of sensational stories and
    statements; (2) In most countries no adequate legislation
    exists to control and regulate the production and
    distribution of substances like LSD; (3) The problem of
    availability of LSD, once limited on technical grounds, has
    fundamentally changed with the advent of mass production of
    lysergic acid by fermentation procedures. Since the last
    patent on LSD expired in 1963, it is not surprising to find
    that an increasing number of dealers in fine chemicals are
    offering LSD from unknown sources at the high price known to
    be paid by LSD fanatics. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Taking into consideration all the
    above-mentioned circumstances and the flood of requests for
    LSD which has now become uncontrollable, the pharmaceutical
    management of SANDOZ has decided to stop immediately all
    further production and distribution of LSD. The same policy
    will apply to all derivatives or analogues of LSD with
    hallucinogenic properties as well as to Psilocybin, Psilocin,
    and their hallucinogenic congeners. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For a while the distribution of LSD and
psilocybin was stopped completely by Sandoz. Most countries had
subsequently proclaimed strict regulations concerning possession,
distribution, and use of hallucinogens, so that physicians,
psychiatric clinics, and research institutes, if they could
produce a special permit to work with these substances from the
respective national health authorities, could again be supplied
with LSD and psilocybin. In the United States the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) undertook the distribution of
these agents to licensed research institutes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these legislative and official precautions,
however, had little influence on LSD consumption in the drug
scene, yet on the other hand hindered and continue to hinder
medicinal-psychiatric use and LSD research in biology and
neurology, because many researchers dread the red tape that is
connected with the procurement of a license for the use of LSD.
The bad reputation of LSD&#151;its depiction as an &quot;insanity
drug&quot; and a &quot;satanic invention&quot; - constitutes a
further reason why many doctors shunned use of LSD in their
psychiatric practice. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of recent years the uproar of
publicity about LSD has quieted, and the consumption of LSD as an
inebriant has also diminished, as far as that can be concluded
from the rare reports about accidents and other regrettable
occurrences following LSD ingestion. It may be that the decrease
of LSD accidents, however, is not simply due to a decline in LSD
consumption. Possibly the recreational users, with time, have
become more aware of the particular effects and dangers of LSD
and more cautious in their use of this drug. Certainly LSD, which
was for a time considered in the Western world, above all in the
United States, to be the number-one inebriant, has relinquished
this leading role to other inebriants such as hashish and the
habituating, even physically destructive drugs like heroin and
amphetamine. The last-mentioned drugs represent an alarming
sociological and public health problem today.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Dangers of Nonmedicinal LSD Experiments </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; While professional use of LSD in psychiatry
entails hardly any risk, the ingestion of this substance outside
of medical practice, without medical supervision, is subject to
multifarious dangers. These dangers reside, on the one hand, in
external circumstances connected with illegal drug use and, on
the other hand, in the peculiarity of LSD's psychic effects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The advocates of uncontrolled, free use of LSD and
other hallucinogens base their attitude on two claims: (l) this
type of drug produces no addiction, and (2) until now no danger
to health from moderate use of hallucinogens has been
demonstrated. Both are true. Genuine addiction, characterized by
the fact that psychic and often severe physical disturbances
appear on withdrawal of the drug, has not been observed, even in
cases in which LSD was taken often and over a long period of
time. No organic injury or death as a direct consequence of an
LSD intoxication has yet been reported. As discussed in greater
detail in the chapter &quot;LSD in Animal Experiments and
Biological Research,&quot; LSD is actually a relatively nontoxic
substance in proportion to its extraordinarily high psychic
activity.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Psychotic Reactions</h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the other hallucinogens, however, LSD is
dangerous in an entirely different sense. While the psychic and
physical dangers of the addicting narcotics, the opiates,
amphetamines, and so forth, appear only with chronic use, the
possible danger of LSD exists in every single experiment. This is
because severe disoriented states can appear during any LSD
inebriation. It is true that through careful preparation of the
experiment and the experimenter such episodes can largely be
avoided, but they cannot be excluded with certainty. LSD crises
resemble psychotic attacks with a manic or depressive character. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the manic, hyperactive condition, the feeling of
omnipotence or invulnerability can lead to serious casualties.
Such accidents have occurred when inebriated persons confused in
this way&#151;believing themselves to be invulnerable&#151;walked
in front of a moving automobile or jumped out a window in the
belief that they were able to fly. This type of LSD casualty,
however, is not so common as one might be led to think on the
basis of reports that were sensationally exaggerated by the mass
media. Nevertheless, such reports must serve as serious warnings.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, a report that made the rounds
worldwide, in 1966, about an alleged murder committed under the
influence on LSD, cannot be true. The suspect, a young man in New
York accused of having killed his mother-in-law, explained at his
arrest, immediately after the fact, that he knew nothing of the
crime and that he had been on an LSD trip for three days. But an
LSD inebriation, even with the highest doses, lasts no longer
than twelve hours, and repeated ingestion leads to tolerance,
which means that extra doses are ineffective. Besides, LSD
inebriation is characterized by the fact that the person
remembers exactly what he or she has experienced. Presumably the
defendant in this case expected leniency for extenuating
circumstances, owing to unsoundness of mind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The danger of a psychotic reaction is especially
great if LSD is given to someone without his or her knowledge.
This was demonstrated in an episode that took place soon after
the discovery of LSD, during the first investigations with the
new substance in the Zurich University Psychiatric Clinic, when
people were not yet aware of the danger of such jokes. A young
doctor, whose colleagues had slipped LSD into his coffee as a
lark, wanted to swim across Lake Zurich during the winter at
-20!C (-4!F) and had to be prevented by force. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a different danger when the LSD-induced
disorientation exhibits a depressive rather than manic character.
In the course of such an LSD experiment, frightening visions,
death agony, or the fear of becoming insane can lead to a
threatening psychic breakdown or even to suicide. Here the LSD
trip becomes a &quot;horror trip.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The demise of a Dr. Olson, who had been given LSD
without his knowledge in the course of U.S. Army drug
experiments, and who then committed suicide by jumping from a
window, caused a particular sensation. His family could not
understand how this quiet, well-adjusted man could have been
driven to this deed. Not until fifteen years later, when the
secret documents about the experiments were published, did they
learn the true circumstances, whereupon the president of the
United States publicly apologized to the dependents. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The conditions for the positive outcome of an LSD
experiment, with little possibility of a psychotic derailment,
reside on the one hand in the individual and on the other hand in
the external milieu of the experiment. The internal, personal
factors are called set, the external conditions setting. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The beauty of a living room or of an outdoor
location is perceived with particular force because of the highly
stimulated sense organs during LSD inebriation, and such an
amenity has a substantial influence on the course of the
experiment. The persons present, their appearance, their traits,
are also part of the setting that determines the experience. The
acoustic milieu is equally significant. Even harmless noises can
turn to torment, and conversely lovely music can develop into a
euphoric experience. With LSD experiments in ugly or noisy
surroundings, however, there is greater danger of a negative
outcome, including psychotic crises. The machine- and
appliance-world of today offers much scenery and all types of
noise that could very well trigger panic during enhanced
sensibility. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as meaningful as the external milieu of the
LSD experience, if not even more important, is the mental
condition of the experimenters, their current state of mind,
their attitude to the drug experience, and their expectations
associated with it. Even unconscious feelings of happiness or
fear can have an effect. LSD tends to intensify the actual
psychic state. A feeling of happiness can be heightened to bliss,
a depression can deepen to despair. LSD is thus the most
inappropriate means imaginable for curing a depressive state. It
is dangerous to take LSD in a disturbed, unhappy frame of mind,
or in a state of fear. The probability that the experiment will
end in a psychic breakdown is then quite high. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Among persons with unstable personality structures,
tending to psychotic reactions, LSD experimentation ought to be
completely avoided. Here an LSD shock, by releasing a latent
psychosis, can produce a lasting mental injury. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psyche of very young persons should also be
considered as unstable, in the sense of not yet having matured.
In any case, the shock of such a powerful stream of new and
strange perceptions and feelings, such as is engendered by LSD,
endangers the sensitive, still-developing psycho-organism. Even
the medicinal use of LSD in youths under eighteen years of age,
in the scope of psychoanalytic or psychotherapeutic treatment, is
discouraged in professional circles, correctly so in my opinion.
Juveniles for the most part still lack a secure, solid
relationship to reality. Such a relationship is needed before the
dramatic experience of new dimensions of reality can be
meaningfully integrated into the world view. Instead of leading
to a broadening and deepening of reality consciousness, such an
experience in adolescents will lead to insecurity and a feeling
of being lost. Because of the freshness of sensory perception in
youth and the still-unlimited capacity for experience,
spontaneous visionary experiences occur much more frequently than
in later life. For this reason as well, psychostimulating agents
should not be used by juveniles. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even in healthy, adult persons, even with adherence
to all of the preparatory and protective measures discussed, an
LSD experiment can fail, causing psychotic reactions. Medical
supervision is therefore earnestly to be recommended, even for
nonmedicinal LSD experiments. This should include an examination
of the state of health before the experiment. The doctor need not
be present at the session; however, medical help should at all
times be readily available. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Acute LSD psychoses can be cut short and brought
under control quickly and reliably by injection of chlorpromazine
or another sedative of this type. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The presence of a familiar person, who can request
medical help in the event of an emergency, is also an
indispensable psychological assurance. Although the LSD
inebriation is characterized mostly by an immersion in the
individual inner world, a deep need for human contact sometimes
arises, especially in depressive phases.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>LSD from the Black Market </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nonmedicinal LSD consumption can bring dangers
of an entirely different type than hitherto discussed: for most
of the LSD offered in the drug scene is of unknown origin. LSD
preparations from the black market are unreliable when it comes
to both quality and dosage. They rarely contain the declared
quantity, but mostly have less LSD, often none at all, and
sometimes even too much. In many cases other drugs or even
poisonous substances are sold as LSD. These observations were
made in our laboratory upon analysis of a great number of LSD
samples from the black market. They coincide with the experiences
of national drug control departments. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The unreliability in the strength of LSD
preparations on the illicit drug market can lead to dangerous
overdosage. Overdoses have often proved to be the cause of failed
LSD experiments that led to severe psychic and physical
breakdowns. Reports of alleged fatal LSD poisoning, however, have
yet to be confirmed. Close scrutiny of such cases invariably
established other causative factors. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The following case, which took place in 1970, is
cited as an example of the possible dangers of black market LSD.
We received for investigation from the police a drug powder
distributed as LSD. It came from a young man who was admitted to
the hospital in critical condition and whose friend had also
ingested this preparation and died as a result. Analysis showed
that the powder contained no LSD, but rather the very poisonous
alkaloid strychnine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If most black market LSD preparations contained
less than the stated quantity and often no LSD at all, the reason
is either deliberate falsification or the great instability of
this substance. LSD is very sensitive to air and light. It is
oxidatively destroyed by the oxygen in the air and is transformed
into an inactive substance under the influence of light. This
must be taken into account during the synthesis and especially
during the production of stable, storable forms of LSD. Claims
that LSD may easily be prepared, or that every chemistry student
in a half-decent laboratory is capable of producing it, are
untrue. Procedures for synthesis of LSD have indeed been
published and are accessible to everyone. With these detailed
procedures in hand, chemists would be able to carry out the
synthesis, provided they had pure lysergic acid at their
disposal; its possession today, however, is subject to the same
strict regulations as LSD. In order to isolate LSD in pure
crystalline form from the reaction solution and in order to
produce stable preparations, however, special equipment and not
easily acquired specific experience are required, owing (as
stated previously) to the great instability of this substance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Only in completely oxygen-free ampules protected
from light is LSD absolutely stable. Such ampules, containing 100
µg (= 0.1 mg) LSD-tartrate (tartaric acid salt of LSD) in 1 cc
of aqueous solution, were produced for biological research and
medicinal use by the Sandoz firm. LSD in tablets prepared with
additives that inhibit oxidation, while not absolutely stable, at
least keeps for a longer time. But LSD preparations often found
on the black market&#151;LSD that has been applied in solution
onto sugar cubes or blotting paper&#151;decompose in the course
of weeks or a few months. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With such a highly potent substance as LSD, the
correct dosage is of paramount importance. Here the tenet of
Paracelsus holds good: the dose determines whether a substance
acts as a remedy or as a poison. A controlled dosage, however, is
not possible with preparations from the black market, whose
active strength is in no way guaranteed. One of the greatest
dangers of non-medicinal LSD experiments lies, therefore, in the
use of such preparations of unknown provenience.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>The Case of Dr. Leary </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Timothy Leary, who has become known
worldwide in his role of drug apostle, had an extraordinarily
strong influence on the diffusion of illegal LSD consumption in
the United States. On the occasion of a vacation in Mexico in the
year 1960, Leary had eaten the legendary &quot;sacred
mushrooms,&quot; which he had purchased from a shaman. During the
mushroom inebriation he entered into a state of mystico-religious
ecstasy, which he described as the deepest religious experience
of his life. From then on, Dr. Leary, who at the time was a
lecturer in psychology at Harvard University in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, dedicated himself totally to research on the
effects and possibilities of the use of psychedelic drugs.
Together with his colleague Dr. Richard Alpert, he started
various research projects at the university, in which LSD and
psilocybin, isolated by us in the meantime, were employed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reintegration of convicts into society, the
production of mystico-religious experiences in theologians and
members of the clergy, and the furtherance of creativity in
artists and writers with the help of LSD and psilocybin were
tested with scientific methodology. Even persons like Aldous
Huxley, Arthur Koestler, and Allen Ginsberg participated in these
investigations. Particular consideration was given to the
question, to what degree mental preparation and expectation of
the subjects, along with the external milieu of the experiment,
are able to influence the course and character of states of
psychedelic inebriation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In January 1963, Dr. Leary sent me a detailed
report of these studies, in which he enthusiastically imparted
the positive results obtained and gave expression to his beliefs
in the advantages and very promising possibilities of such use of
these active compounds. At the same time, the Sandoz firm
received an inquiry about the supply of 100g LSD and 25 kg
psilocybin, signed by Dr. Timothy Leary, from the Harvard
University Department of Social Relations. The requirement for
such an enormous quantity (the stated amounts correspond to 1
million doses of LSD and 2.5 million doses of psilocybin) was
based on the planned extension of investigations to tissue,
organ, and animal studies. We made the supply of these substances
contingent upon the production of an import license on behalf of
the U.S. health authorities. Immediately we received the order
for the stated quantities of LSD and psilocybin, along with a
check for $10,000 as deposit but without the required import
license. Dr. Leary signed for this order, but no longer as
lecturer at Harvard University, rather as president of an
organization he had recently founded, the International
Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF). Because, in addition, our
inquiry to the appropriate dean of Harvard University had shown
that the university authorities did not approve of the
continuation of the research project by Leary and Alpert, we
canceled our offer upon return of the deposit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Leary and Alpert were
discharged from the teaching staff of Harvard- University because
the investigations, at first conducted in an academic milieu, had
lost their scientific character. The experiments had turned into
LSD parties. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The LSD trip&#151;LSD as a ticket to an adventurous
journey into new worlds of mental and physical
experience&#151;became the latest exciting fashion among academic
youth, spreading rapidly from Harvard to other universities.
Leary's doctrine&#151;that LSD not only served to find the divine
and to discover the self, but indeed was the most potent
aphrodisiac yet discovered&#151;surely contributed quite
decisively to the rapid propagation of LSD consumption among the
younger generation. Later, in an interview with the monthly
magazine Playboy, Leary said that the intensification of sexual
experience and the potentiation of sexual ecstasy by LSD was one
of the chief reasons for the LSD boom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After his expulsion from Harvard University, Leary
was completely transformed from a psychology lecturer pursuing
research, into the messiah of the psychedelic movement. He and
his friends of the IFIF founded a psychedelic research center in
lovely, scenic surroundings in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. I received a
personal invitation from Dr. Leary to participate in a top-level
planning session on psychedelic drugs, scheduled to take place
there in August 1963. I would gladly have accepted this grand
invitation, in which I was offered reimbursement for travel
expenses and free lodging, in order to learn from personal
observation the methods, operation, and the entire atmosphere of
such a psychedelic research center, about which contradictory, to
some extent very remarkable, reports were then circulating.
Unfortunately, professional obligations kept me at that moment
from flying to Mexico to get a picture at first hand of the
controversial enterprise. The Zihuatanejo Research Center did not
last long. Leary and his adherents were expelled from the country
by the Mexican government. Leary, however, who had now become not
only the messiah but also the martyr of the psychedelic movement,
soon received help from the young New York millionaire William
Hitchcock, who made a manorial house on his large estate in
Millbrook, New York, available to Leary as new home and
headquarters. Millbrook was also the home of another foundation
for the psychedelic, transcendental way of life, the Castalia
Foundation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On a trip to India in 1965 Leary was converted to
Hinduism. In the following year he founded a religious community,
the League for Spiritual Discovery, whose initials give the
abbreviation &quot;LSD.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary's proclamation to youth, condensed in his
famous slogan &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out !&quot;, became a
central dogma of the hippie movement. Leary is one of the
founding fathers of the hippie cult. The last of these three
precepts, &quot;drop out,&quot; was the challenge to escape from
bourgeois life, to turn one's back on society, to give up school,
studies, and employment, and to dedicate oneself wholly to the
true inner universe, the study of one's own nervous system, after
one has turned on with LSD. This challenge above all went beyond
the psychological and religious domain to assume social and
political significance. It is therefore understandable that Leary
not only became the <i>enfant terrible </i>of the university and
among his academic colleagues in psychology and psychiatry, but
also earned the wrath of the political authorities. He was,
therefore, placed under surveillance, followed, and ultimately
locked in prison. The high sentences&#151;ten years' imprisonment
each for convictions in Texas and California concerning
possession of LSD and marijuana, and conviction (later
overturned) with a sentence of thirty years' imprisonment for
marijuana smuggling&#151;show that the punishment of these
offenses was only a pretext: the real aim was to put under lock
and key the seducer and instigator of youth, who could not
otherwise be prosecuted. On the night of 13-14 September 1970,
Leary managed to escape from the California prison in San Luis
Obispo. On a detour from Algeria, where he made contact with
Eldridge Cleaver, a leader of the Black Panther movement living
there in exile, Leary came to Switzerland and there petitioned
for political asylum.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Meeting with Timothy Leary </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Leary lived with his wife, Rosemary, in the
resort town Villars-sur-Ollon in western Switzerland. Through the
intercession of Dr. Mastronardi, Dr. Leary's lawyer, contact was
established between us. On 3 September 1971, I met Dr. Leary in
the railway station snack bar in Lausanne. The greeting was
cordial, a symbol of our fateful relationship through LSD. Leary
was medium-sized, slender, resiliently active, his brown face
surrounded with slightly curly hair mixed with gray, youthful,
with bright, laughing eyes. This gave Leary somewhat the mark of
a tennis champion rather than that of a former Harvard lecturer.
We traveled by automobile to Buchillons, where in the arbor of
the restaurant A la Grande Forêt, over a meal of fish and a
glass of white wine, the dialogue between the father and the
apostle of LSD finally began. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I voiced my regret that the investigations with LSD
and psilocybin at Harvard University, which had begun
promisingly, had degenerated to such an extent that their
continuance in an academic milieu became impossible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My most serious remonstrance to Leary, however,
concerned the propagation of LSD use among juveniles. Leary did
not attempt to refute my opinions about the particular dangers of
LSD for youth. He maintained, however, that I was unjustified in
reproaching him for the seduction of immature persons to drug
consumption, because teenagers in the United States, with regard
to information and life experience, were comparable to adult
Europeans. Maturity, with satiation and intellectual stagnation,
would be reached very early in the United States. For that
reason, he deemed the LSD experience significant, useful, and
enriching, even for people still very young in years. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this conversation, I further objected to the
great publicity that Leary sought for his LSD and psilocybin
investigations, since he had invited reporters from daily papers
and magazines to his experiments and had mobilized radio and
television. Emphasis was thereby placed on publicity rather than
on objective information. Leary defended this publicity program
because he felt it had been his fateful historic role to make LSD
known worldwide. The overwhelmingly positive effects of such
dissemination, above all among America's younger generation,
would make any trifling injuries, any regrettable accidents as a
result of improper use of LSD, unimportant in comparison, a small
price to pay. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During this conversation, I ascertained that one
did Leary an injustice by indiscriminately describing him as a
drug apostle. He made a sharp distinction between psychedelic
drugs&#151;LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, hashish&#151;of whose
salutary effects he was persuaded, and the addicting narcotics
morphine, heroin, etc., against whose use he repeatedly
cautioned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My impression of Dr. Leary in this personal meeting
was that of a charming personage, convinced of his mission, who
defended his opinions with humor yet uncompromisingly; a man who
truly soared high in the clouds pervaded by beliefs in the
wondrous effects of psychedelic drugs and the optimism resulting
therefrom, and thus a man who tended to underrate or completely
overlook practical difficulties, unpleasant facts, and dangers.
Leary also showed carelessness regarding charges and dangers that
concerned his own person, as his further path in life
emphatically showed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During his Swiss sojourn, I met Leary by chance
once more, in February 1972, in Basel, on the occasion of a visit
by Michael Horowitz, curator of the Fitz Hugh Ludlow Memorial
Library in San Francisco, a library specializing in drug
literature. We traveled together to my house in the country near
Burg, where we resumed our conversation of the previous
September. Leary appeared fidgety and detached, probably owing to
a momentary indisposition, so that our discussions were less
productive this time. That was my last meeting with Dr. Leary. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He left Switzerland at the end of the year, having
separated from his wife, Rosemary, now accompanied by his new
friend Joanna Harcourt-Smith. After a short stay in Austria,
where he assisted in a documentary film about heroin, Leary and
friend traveled to Afghanistan. At the airport in Kabul he was
apprehended by agents of the American secret service and brought
back to the San Luis Obispo prison in California. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After nothing had been heard from Leary for a long
time, his name again appeared in the daily papers in summer 1975
with the announcement of a parole and early release from prison.
But he was not set free until early in 1976. I learned from his
friends that he was now occupied with psychological problems of
space travel and with the exploration of cosmic relationships
between the human nervous system and interstellar space&#151;that
is, with problems whose study would bring him no further
difficulties on the part of governmental authorities.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Travels in the Universe of the Soul </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the Islamic scholar Dr. Rudolf Gelpke
entitled his accounts of self-experiments with LSD and
psilocybin, which appeared in the publication <i>Antaios</i>, for
January 1962, and this title could also be used for the following
descriptions of LSD experiments. LSD trips and the space flights
of the astronauts are comparable in many respects. Both
enterprises require very careful preparations, as far as measures
for safety as well as objectives are concerned, in order to
minimize dangers and to derive the most valuable results
possible. The astronauts cannot remain in space nor the LSD
experimenters in transcendental spheres, they have to return to
earth and everyday reality, where the newly acquired experiences
must be evaluated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The following reports were selected in order to
demonstrate how varied the experiences of LSD inebriation can be.
The particular motivation for undertaking the experiments was
also decisive in their selection. Without exception, this
selection involves only reports by persons who have tried LSD not
simply out of curiosity or as a sophisticated pleasure drug, but
who rather experimented with it in the quest for expanded
possibilities of experience of the inner and outer world; who
attempted, with the help of this drug key, to unlock new
&quot;doors of perception&quot; (William Blake); or, to continue
with the comparison chosen by Rudolf Gelpke, who employed LSD to
surmount the force of gravity of space and time in the accustomed
world view, in order to arrive thereby at new outlooks and
understandings in the &quot;universe of the soul.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first two of the following research records are
taken from the previously cited report by Rudolf Gelpke in
Antaios.</p>

<h4>Dance of the Spirits in the Wind </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (0.075 mg LSD on 23 June 1961, 13:00 hours)<i> </i>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>After I had ingested this dose, which could be considered
    average, I conversed very animatedly with a professional
    colleague until approximately 14:00 hours. Following this, I
    proceeded alone to the Werthmüller bookstore where the drug
    now began to act most unmistakably. I discerned, above all,
    that the subjects of the books in which I rummaged peacefully
    in the back of the shop were indifferent to me, whereas
    random details of my surroundings suddenly stood out
    strongly, and somehow appeared to be &quot;meaningful.&quot;
    . . . Then, after some ten minutes, I was discovered by a
    married couple known to me, and had to let myself become
    involved in a conversation with them that, I admit, was by no
    means pleasant to me, though not really painful either. I
    listened to the conversation (even to myself) &quot; as from
    far away. &quot; The things that were discussed (the
    conversation dealt with Persian stories that I had
    translated) &quot;belonged to another world&quot;: a world
    about which I could indeed express myself (I had, after all,
    recently still inhabited it myself and remembered the
    &quot;rules of the game&quot;!), but to which I no longer
    possessed any emotional connection. My interest in it was
    obliterated&#151;only I did not dare to let myself observe
    that. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; After I managed to dismiss myself, I strolled
    farther through the city to the marketplace. I had no
    &quot;visions,&quot; saw and heard everything as usual, and
    yet everything was also altered in an indescribable way;
    &quot;imperceptible glassy walls&quot; everywhere. With every
    step that I took, I became more and more like an automaton.
    It especially struck me that I seemed to lose control over my
    facial musculature&#151;I was convinced that my face was
    grown stiff, completely expressionless, empty, slack and
    mask-like. The only reason I could still walk and put myself
    in motion, was because I remembered that, and how I had
    &quot;earlier&quot; gone and moved myself. But the farther
    back the recollection went, the more uncertain I became. I
    remember that my own hands somehow were in my way: I put them
    in my pockets, let them dangle, entwined them behind my back
    . . . as some burdensome objects, which must be dragged
    around with us and which no one knows quite how to stow away.
    I had the same reaction concerning my whole body. I no longer
    knew why it was there, and where I should go with it. All
    sense for decisions of that kind had been lost . They could
    only be reconstructed laboriously, taking a detour through
    memories from the past. It took a struggle of this kind to
    enable me to cover the short distance from the marketplace to
    my home, which I reached at about 15:10. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In no way had I had the feeling of being
    inebriated. What I experienced was rather a gradual mental
    extinction. It was not at all frightening; but I can imagine
    that in the transition to certain mental disturbances -
    naturally dispersed over a greater interval&#151;a very
    similar process happens: as long as the recollection of the
    former individual existence in the human world is still
    present, the patient who has become unconnected can still (to
    some extent) find his way about in the world: later, however,
    when the memories fade and ultimately die out, he completely
    loses this ability. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly after I had entered my room, the
    &quot;glassy stupor&quot; gave way. I sat down, with a view
    out of a window, and was at once enraptured: the window was
    opened wide, the diaphanous gossamer curtains, on the other
    hand, were drawn, and now a mild wind from the outside played
    with these veils and with the silhouettes of potted plants
    and leafy tendrils on the sill behind, which the sunlight
    delineated on the curtains breathing in the breeze. This
    spectacle captivated me completely. I &quot;sank&quot; into
    it, saw only this gentle and incessant waving and rocking of
    the plant shadows in the sun and the wind. I knew what
    &quot;it&quot; was, but I sought after the name for it, after
    the formula, after the &quot;magic word&quot; that I knew and
    already I had it: Totentanz, the dance of the dead.... This
    was what the wind and the light were showing me on the screen
    of gossamer. Was it frightening? Was I afraid?
    Perhaps&#151;at first. But then a great cheerfulness
    infiltrated me, and I heard the music of silence, and even my
    soul danced with the redeemed shadows to the whistle of the
    wind. Yes, I understood: this is the curtain, and this
    curtain itself IS the secret, the &quot;ultimate&quot; that
    it concealed. Why, therefore, tear it up? He who does that
    only tears up himself. Because &quot;there behind,&quot;
    behind the curtain, is &quot;nothing.&quot;. . . </p>

<h4>Polyp from the Deep </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (0.150 mg LSD on 15 April 1961, 9:15 hours)<i> </i>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Beginning of the effect already after about 30 minutes
    with strong inner agitation, trembling hands, skin chills,
    taste of metal on the palate. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:00: The environment of the room transforms
    itself into phosphorescent waves, running hither from the
    feet even through my body. The skin&#151;and above all the
    toes&#151;is as electrically charged; a still constantly
    growing excitement hinders all clear thoughts.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:20: I lack the words to describe my current
    condition. It is as if an &quot;other&quot; complete stranger
    were seizing possession of me bit by bit. Have greatest
    trouble writing (&quot;inhibited&quot; or
    &quot;uninhibited&quot;?&#151;I don't know!). <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This sinister process of an advancing
    self-estrangement aroused in me the feeling of powerlessness,
    of being helplessly delivered up. Around 10:30, through
    closed eyes I saw innumerable, self-intertwining threads on a
    red background. A sky as heavy as lead appeared to press down
    on everything; I felt my ego compressed in itself, and I felt
    like a withered dwarf.... Shortly before 13:00 I escaped the
    more and more oppressing atmosphere of the company in the
    studio, in which we only hindered one another reciprocally
    from unfolding completely into the inebriation. I sat down in
    a small, empty room, on the floor, with my back to the wall,
    and saw through the only window on the narrow frontage
    opposite me a bit of gray- white cloudy sky. This, like the
    whole environment in general, appeared to be hopelessly
    normal at this moment. I was dejected, and my self seemed so
    repulsive and hateful to me that I had not dared (and on this
    day even had actually repeatedly desperately avoided) to look
    in a mirror or in the face of another person. I very much
    wished this inebriation were finally finished, but it still
    had my body totally in its possession. I imagined that I
    perceived, deep within its stubborn oppressive weight, how it
    held my limbs surrounded with a hundred polyp arms&#151;yes,
    I actually experienced this in a mysterious rhythm;
    electrified contacts, as of a real, indeed imperceptible, but
    sinister omnipresent being, which I addressed with a loud
    voice, reviled, bid, and challenged to open combat. &quot;It
    is only the projection of evil in your self,&quot; another
    voice assured me. &quot;It is your soul monster!&quot; This
    perception was like a flashing sword. It passed through me
    with redeeming sharpness. The polyp arms fell away from
    me&#151;as if cut through&#151;and simultaneously the
    hitherto dull and gloomy gray-white of the sky behind the
    open window suddenly scintillated like sunlit water. As I
    stared at it so enchanted, it changed (for me!) to real
    water: a subterranean spring overran me, which had ruptured
    there all at once and now boiled up toward me, wanted to
    become a storm, a lake, an ocean, with millions and millions
    of drops&#151;and on all of these drops, on every single one
    of them, the light danced.... As the room, window, and sky
    came back into my consciousness (it was 13:25 hours), the
    inebriation was certainly not at an end&#151;not yet&#151;but
    its rearguard, which passed by me during the ensuing two
    hours, very much resembled the rainbow that follows the
    storm. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both the estrangement from the environment and the
estrangement from the individual body, experienced in both of the
preceding experiments described by Gelpke&#151;as well as the
feeling of an alien being, a demon, seizing possession of
oneself&#151;are features of LSD inebriation that, in spite of
all the other diversity and variability of the experience, are
cited in most research reports. I have already described the
possession by the LSD demon as an uncanny experience in my first
planned self-experiment. Anxiety and terror then affected me
especially strongly, because at that time I had no way of knowing
that the demon would again release his victim. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The adventures described in the following report,
by a painter, belong to a completely different type of LSD
experience. This artist visited me in order to obtain my opinion
about how the experience under LSD should be understood and
interpreted. He feared that the profound transformation of his
personal life, which had resulted from his experiment with LSD,
could rest on a mere delusion. My explanation&#151;that LSD, as a
biochemical agent, only triggered his visions but had not created
them and that these visions rather originated from his own
soul&#151;gave him confidence in the meaning of his
transformation.</p>

<h4>LSD Experience of a Painter </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . Therefore I traveled with Eva to a solitary mountain
    valley. Up there in nature, I thought it would be
    particularly beautiful with Eva. Eva was young and
    attractive. Twenty years older than she, I was already in the
    middle of life. Despite the sorrowful consequences that I had
    experienced previously, as a result of erotic escapades,
    despite the pain and the disappointments that I inflicted on
    those who loved me and had believed in me, I was drawn again
    with irresistible power to this adventure, to Eva, to her
    youth. I was under the spell of this girl. Our affair indeed
    was only beginning, but I felt this seductive power more
    strongly than ever before. I knew that I could no longer
    resist. For the second time in my life I was again ready to
    desert my family, to give up my position, to break all
    bridges. I wanted to hurl myself uninhibitedly into this
    lustful inebriation with Eva. She was life, youth. Over again
    it cried out in me, again and again to drain the cup of lust
    and life until the last drop, until death and perdition. Let
    the Devil fetch me later on! I had indeed long ago done away
    with God and the Devil. They were for me only human
    inventions, which came to be utilized by a skeptical,
    unscrupulous minority, in order to suppress and exploit a
    believing, naive majority. I wanted to have nothing to do
    with this mendacious social moral. To enjoy, at all costs, I
    wished to enjoy et <i>après nous le deluge.</i> &quot;What
    is wife to me, what is child to me&#151;let them go begging,
    if they are hungry.&quot; I also perceived the institution of
    marriage as a social lie. The marriage of my parents and
    marriages of my acquaintances seemed to confirm that
    sufficiently for me. Couples remained together because it was
    more convenient; they were accustomed to it, and &quot;yes,
    if it weren't for the children . . .&quot; Under the pretense
    of a good marriage, each tormented the other emotionally, to
    the point of rashes and stomach ulcers, or each went his own
    way. Everything in me rebelled against the thought of having
    to love only one and the same woman a life long. I frankly
    perceived that as repugnant and unnatural. Thus stood my
    inner disposition on that portentous summer evening at the
    mountain lake. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; At seven o'clock in the evening both of us took
    a moderately strong dose of LSD, some 0.1 milligrams. Then we
    strolled along about the lake and then sat on the bank. We
    threw stones in the water and watched the forming wave
    circles. We felt a slight inner restlessness. Around eight
    o'clock we entered the hotel lounge and ordered tea and
    sandwiches. Some guests still sat there, telling jokes and
    laughing loudly. They winked at us. Their eyes sparkled
    strangely. We felt strange and distant and had the feeling
    that they would notice something in us. Outside it slowly
    became dark. We decided only reluctantly to go to our hotel
    room. A street without lights led along the black lake to the
    distant guest house. As I switched on the light, the granite
    staircase, leading from the shore road to the house, appeared
    to flame up from step to step. Eva quivered all at once,
    frightened. &quot;Hellish&quot; went through my mind, and all
    of a sudden horror passed through my limbs, and I knew: now
    it's going to turn out badly. From afar, from the village, a
    clock struck nine. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Scarcely were we in our room, when Eva threw
    herself on the bed and looked at me with wide eyes. It was
    not in the least possible to think of love. I sat down on the
    edge of the bed and held both of Eva's hands. Then came the
    terror. We sank into a deep, indescribable horror, which
    neither of us understood. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Look in my eyes, look at me,&quot; I
    implored Eva, yet again and again her gaze was averted from
    me, and then she cried out loud in terror and trembled all
    over her body. There was no way out. Outside was only gloomy
    night and the deep, black lake. In the public house all the
    lights were extinguished; the people had probably gone to
    sleep. What would they have said if they could see us now?
    Possibly they would summon the police, and then everything
    would become still much worse. A drug
    scandal&#151;intolerable agonizing thoughts. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We could no longer move from the spot. We sat
    there surrounded by four wooden walls whose board joints
    shone infernally. It became more unbearable all the time.
    Suddenly the door was opened and &quot;something
    dreadful&quot; entered. Eva cried out wildly and hid herself
    under the bed covers. Once again a cry. The horror under the
    covers was yet worse. &quot;Look straight in my eyes!&quot; I
    called to her, but she rolled her eyes back and forth as
    though out of her mind. She is becoming insane, I realized.
    In desperation I seized her by the hair so that she could no
    longer turn her face away from me. I saw dreadful fear in her
    eyes. Everything around us was hostile and threatening, as if
    everything wanted to attack us in the next moment. You must
    protect Eva, you must bring her through until morning, then
    the effects will discontinue, I said to myself. Then again,
    however, I plunged into nameless horror. There was no more
    time or reason; it seemed as if this condition would never
    end. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The objects in the room were animated to
    caricatures; everything on all sides sneered scornfully. I
    saw Eva's yellow-black striped shoes, which I had found so
    stimulating, appearing as two large, evil wasps crawling on
    the floor. The water piping above the washbasin changed to a
    dragon head, whose eyes, the two water taps, observed me
    malevolently. My first name, George, came into my mind, and
    all at once I felt like Knight George, who must fight for
    Eva. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Eva's cries tore me from these thoughts. Bathed
    in perspiration and trembling, she fastened herself to me.
    &quot;I am thirsty,&quot; she moaned. With great effort,
    without releasing Eva's hand, I succeeded in getting a glass
    of water for her. But the water seemed slimy and viscous, was
    poisonous, and we could not quench our thirst with it. The
    two night-table lamps glowed with a strange brightness, in an
    infernal light. The clock struck twelve. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This is hell, I thought. There is indeed no
    Devil and no demons, and yet they were perceptible in us,
    filled up the room, and tormented us with unimaginable
    terror. Imagination, or not? Hallucinations,
    projections?&#151;insignificant questions when confronted
    with the reality of fear that was fixed in our bodies and
    shook us: the fear alone, it existed. Some passages from
    Huxley's book <i>The Doors of Perception</i> came to me and
    brought me brief comfort. I looked at Eva, at this
    whimpering, horrified being in her torment, and felt great
    remorse and pity. She had become strange to me; I scarcely
    recognized her any longer. She wore a fine golden chain
    around her neck with the medallion of the Virgin Mary. It was
    a gift from her younger brother. I noticed how a benevolent,
    comforting radiation, which was connected with pure love,
    emanated from this necklace. But then the terror broke loose
    again, as if to our final destruction. I needed my whole
    strength to constrain Eva. Loudly I heard the electrical
    meter ticking weirdly outside of the door, as if it wanted to
    make a most important, evil, devastating announcement to me
    in the next moment. Disdain, derision, and malignity again
    whispered out of all nooks and crevices. There, in the midst
    of this agony, I perceived the ringing of cowbells from afar
    as a wonderful, promising music. Yet soon it became silent
    again, and renewed fear and dread once again set in. As a
    drowning man hopes for a rescuing plank, so I wished that the
    cows would yet again want to draw near the house. But
    everything remained quiet, and only the threatening tick and
    hum of the current meter buzzed round us like an invisible,
    malevolent insect. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Morning finally dawned. With great relief I
    noticed how the chinks in the window shutters lit up. Now I
    could leave Eva to herself; she had quieted down. Exhausted,
    she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Shocked and deeply sad,
    I still sat on the edge of the bed. Gone was my pride and
    self- assurance; all that remained of me was a small heap of
    misery. I examined myself in the mirror and started: I had
    become ten years older in the course of the night. Downcast,
    I stared at the light of the night-table lamp with the
    hideous shade of intertwined plastic cords. All at once the
    light seemed to become brighter, and in the plastic cords it
    began to sparkle and to twinkle; it glowed like diamonds and
    gems of all colors, and an overwhelming feeling of happiness
    welled up in me. All at once, lamp, room, and Eva
    disappeared, and I found myself in a wonderful, fantastic
    landscape. It was comparable to the interior of an immense
    Gothic church nave, with infinitely many columns and Gothic
    arches. These consisted, however, not of stone, but rather of
    crystal. Bluish, yellowish, milky, and clearly transparent
    crystal columns surrounded me like trees in an open forest.
    Their points and arches became lost in dizzying heights. A
    bright light appeared before my inner eye, and a wonderful,
    gentle voice spoke to me out of the light. I did not hear it
    with my external ear, but rather perceived it, as if it were
    clear thoughts that arise in one. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I realized that in the horror of the passing
    night I had experienced my own individual condition:
    selfishness. My egotism had kept me separated from mankind
    and had led me to inner isolation. I had loved only myself,
    not my neighbor; loved only the gratification that the other
    offered me. The world had existed only for the satisfaction
    of my greed. I had become tough, cold, and cynical. Hell,
    therefore, had signified that: egotism and lovelessness.
    Therefore everything had seemed strange and unconnected to
    me, so scornful and threatening. Amid flowing tears, I was
    enlightened with the knowledge that true love means surrender
    of selfishness and that it is not desires but rather selfless
    love that forms the bridge to the heart of our fellow man.
    Waves of ineffable happiness flowed through my body. I had
    experienced the grace of God. But how could it be possible
    that it was radiating toward me, particularly out of this
    cheap lampshade? Then the inner voice answered: God is in
    everything. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The experience at the mountain lake has given
    me the certainty that beyond the ephemeral, material world
    there also exists an imperishable, spiritual reality, which
    is our true home. I am now on my way home. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; For Eva everything remained just a bad dream.
    We broke up a short time thereafter. </p>

<h4>A Joyous Song of Being <i> </i></h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>My first experience with LSD came at the home of a close
    friend who served as my guide. The surroundings were
    comfortably familiar and relaxing. I took two ampuls (200
    micrograms) of LSD mixed in half a glass of distilled water.
    The experience lasted for close to eleven hours, from 8
    o'clock on a Saturday evening until very nearly 7 o'clock the
    next morning. I have no firm point of comparison, but I am
    positive that no saint ever saw more glorious or joyously
    beautiful visions or experienced a more blissful state of
    transcendence. My powers to convey the miracles are shabby
    and far too inadequate to the task at hand. A sketch, and an
    artless one at that, must suffice where only the hand of a
    great master working from a complete palette could do justice
    to the subject. I must apologize for my own limitations in
    this feeble attempt to reduce the most remarkable experience
    of my life to mere words. My superior smile at the fumbling,
    halting attempts of others in their attempts to explain the
    heavenly visions to me has been transformed into a knowing
    smile of a conspirator&#151;the common experience requires no
    words. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; My first thought after drinking the LSD was
    that it was having absolutely no effect. They had told me
    thirty minutes would produce the first sensation, a tingling
    of the skin. There was no tingling. I commented on this and
    was told to relax and wait. For the lack of anything else to
    do I stared at the dial light of the table radio, nodding my
    head to a jazz piece I did not recognize. I think it was
    several minutes before I realized that the light was changing
    color kaleidoscopically with the different pitch of the
    musical sounds, bright reds and yellows in the high register,
    deep purple in the low. I laughed. I had no idea when it had
    started. I simply knew it had. I closed my eyes, but the
    colored notes were still there. I was overcome by the
    remarkable brilliance of the colors. I tried to talk, to
    explain what I was seeing, the vibrant and luminous colors.
    Somehow it didn't seem important. With my eyes open, the
    radiant colors flooded the room, folding over on top of one
    another in rhythm with the music. Suddenly I was aware that
    the colors were the music. The discovery did not seem
    startling. Values, so cherished and guarded, were becoming
    unimportant. I wanted to talk about the colored music, but I
    couldn't. I was reduced to uttering one-syllable words while
    polysyllabic impressions tumbled through my mind with the
    speed of light. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The dimensions of the room were changing, now
    sliding into a fluttering diamond shape, then straining into
    an oval shape as if someone were pumping air into the room,
    expanding it to the bursting point. I was having trouble
    focusing on objects. They would melt into fuzzy masses of
    nothing or sail off into space, self-propelled, slow-motion
    trips that were of acute interest to me. I tried to check the
    time on my watch, but I was unable to focus on the hands. I
    thought of asking for the time, but the thought passed. I was
    too busy seeing and listening. The sounds were exhilarating,
    the sights remarkable. I was completely entranced. I have no
    idea how long this lasted. I do know the egg came next. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The egg, large, pulsating, and a luminous
    green, was there before I actually saw it. I sensed it was
    there. It hung suspended about halfway between where I sat
    and the far wall. I was intrigued by the beauty of the egg.
    At the same time I was afraid it would drop to the floor and
    break. I didn't want the egg to break. It seemed most
    important that the egg should not break. But even as I
    thought of this, the egg slowly dissolved and revealed a
    great multihued flower that was like no flower I have ever
    seen. Its incredibly exquisite petals opened on the room,
    spraying indescribable colors in every direction. I felt the
    colors and heard them as they played across my body, cool and
    warm, reedlike and tinkling. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The first tinge of apprehension came later when
    I saw the center of the flower slowly eating away at the
    petals, a black, shiny center that appeared to be formed by
    the backs of a thousand ants. It ate away the petals at an
    agonizingly slow pace. I wanted to scream for it to stop or
    to hurry up. I was pained by the gradual disappearance of the
    beautiful petals as if being swallowed by an insidious
    disease. Then in a flash of insight I realized to my horror
    that the black thing was actually devouring me. I was the
    flower and this foreign, creeping thing was eating me! <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I shouted or screamed, I really don't remember.
    I was too full of fear and loathing. I heard my guide say:
    &quot;Easy now. Just go with it. Don't fight it. Go with
    it.&quot; I tried, but the hideous blackness caused such
    repulsion that I screamed: &quot;I can't! For God's sake help
    me! Help me!&quot; The voice was soothing, reassuring:
    &quot;Let it come. Everything is all right. Don't worry. Go
    with it. Don't fight.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I felt myself dissolving into the terrifying
    apparition, my body melting in waves into the core of
    blackness, my mind stripped of ego and life and, yes even
    death. In one great crystal instant I realized that I was
    immortal. I asked the question: &quot;Am I dead?&quot; But
    the question had no meaning. Meaning was meaningless.
    Suddenly there was white light and the shimmering beauty of
    unity. There was light everywhere, white light with a clarity
    beyond description. I was dead and I was born and the
    exultation was pure and holy. My lungs were bursting with the
    joyful song of being. There was unity and life and the
    exquisite love that filled my being was unbounded. My
    awareness was acute and complete. I saw God and the devil and
    all the saints and I knew the truth. I felt myself flowing
    into the cosmos, levitated beyond all restraint, liberated to
    swim in the blissful radiance of the heavenly visions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted to shout and sing of miraculous new
    life and sense and form, of the joyous beauty and the whole
    mad ecstasy of loveliness. I knew and understood all there is
    to know and understand. I was immortal, wise beyond wisdom,
    and capable of love, of all loves. Every atom of my body and
    soul had seen and felt God. The world was warmth and
    goodness. There was no time, no place, no me. There was only
    cosmic harmony. It was all there in the white light. With
    every fiber of my being I knew it was so. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I embraced the enlightenment with complete
    abandonment. As the experience receded I longed to hold onto
    it and tenaciously fought against the encroachment of the
    realities of time and place. For me, the realities of our
    limited existence were no longer valid. I had seen the
    ultimate realities and there would be no others. As I was
    slowly transported back to the tyranny of clocks and
    schedules and petty hatreds, I tried to talk of my trip, my
    enlightenment, the horrors, the beauty, all of it. I must
    have been babbling like an idiot. My thoughts swirled at a
    fantastic rate, but the words couldn't keep pace. My guide
    smiled and told me he understood. </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The preceding collection of reports on
&quot;travels in the universe of the soul,&quot; even though they
encompass such dissimilar experiences, are still not able to
establish a complete picture of the broad spectrum of all
possible reactions to LSD, which extends from the most sublime
spiritual, religious, and mystical experiences, down to gross
psychosomatic disturbances. Cases of LSD sessions have been
described in which the stimulation of fantasy and of visionary
experience, as expressed in the LSD reports assembled here, is
completely absent, and the experimenter was for the whole time in
a state of ghastly physical and mental discomfort, or even felt
severely ill. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reports about the modification of sexual experience
under the influence of LSD are also contradictory. Since
stimulation of all sensory perception is an essential feature of
LSD effects, the sensual orgy of sexual intercourse can undergo
unimaginable enhancements. Cases have also been described,
however, in which LSD led not to the anticipated erotic paradise,
but rather to a purgatory or even to the hell of frightful
extinction of every perception and to a lifeless vacuum. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such a variety and contradiction of reactions to a
drug is found only in LSD and the related hallucinogens. The
explanation for this lies in the complexity and variability of
the conscious and subconscious minds of people, which LSD is able
to penetrate and to bring to life as experienced reality. </p>

<h3>6. The Mexican Relatives of LSD </h3>

<h4>The Sacred Mushroom <i>Teonanácatl</i> </h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Late in 1956 a notice in the daily paper caught my
interest. Among some Indians in southern Mexico, American
researchers had discovered mushrooms that were eaten in religious
ceremonies and that produced an inebriated condition accompanied
by hallucinations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since, outside of the mescaline cactus found also
in Mexico, no other drug was known at the time that, like LSD,
produced hallucinations, I would have liked to establish contact
with these researchers, in order to learn details about these
hallucinogenic mushrooms. But there were no names and addresses
in the short newspaper article, so that it was impossible to get
further information. Nevertheless, the mysterious mushrooms,
whose chemical investigation would be a tempting problem, stayed
in my thoughts from then on. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As it later turned out, LSD was the reason that
these mushrooms found their way into my laboratory, with out my
assistance, at the beginning of the following year. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the mediation of Dr. Yves Dunant, at the
time director of the Paris branch of Sandoz, an inquiry came to
the pharmaceutical research management in Basel from Professor
Roger Heim, director of the Laboratoire de Cryptogamie of the
Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, asking whether we
were interested in carrying out the chemical investigation of the
Mexican hallucinogenic mushrooms. With great joy I declared
myself ready to begin this work in my department, in the
laboratories for natural product research. That was to be my link
to the exciting investigations of the Mexican sacred mushrooms,
which were already broadly advanced in the ethnomycological and
botanical aspects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For a long time the existence of these magic
mushrooms had remained an enigma. The history of their
rediscovery is presented at first hand in the magnificent
two-volume standard work of ethnomycology, <i>Mushrooms, Russia
and History</i> (Pantheon Books, New York, 1957), for the
authors, the American researchers Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and
her husband, R. Gordon Wasson, played a decisive role in this
rediscovery. The following descriptions of the fascinating
history of these mushrooms are taken from the Wassons' book. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first written evidence of the use of
inebriating mushrooms on festival occasions, or in the course of
religious ceremonies and magically oriented healing practices, is
found among the Spanish chroniclers and naturalists of the
sixteenth century, who entered the country soon after the
conquest of Mexico by Hernando Cortés. The most important of
these witnesses is the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun,
who mentions the magic mushrooms and describes their effects and
their use in several passages of his famous historical work, <i>Historia
General de tas Cosas de Nueva Espana</i>, written between the
years 1529 and 1590. Thus he describes, for example, how
merchants celebrated the return home from a successful business
trip with a mushroom party: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Coming at the very first, at the time of feasting, they
    ate mushrooms when, as they said, it was the hour of the
    blowing of the flutes. Not yet did they partake of food; they
    drank only chocolate during the night. And they ate mushrooms
    with honey. When already the mushrooms were taking effect,
    there was dancing, there was weeping.... Some saw in a vision
    that they would die in war. Some saw in a vision that they
    would be devoured by wild beasts.... Some saw in a vision
    that they would become rich, wealthy. Some saw in a vision
    that they would buy slaves, would become slave owners. Some
    saw in a vision that they would commit adultery [and so]
    would have their heads bashed in, would be stoned to
    death.... Some saw in a vision that they would perish in the
    water. Some saw in a vision that they would pass to
    tranquillity in death. Some saw in a vision that they would
    fall from the housetop, tumble to their death. . . . All such
    things they saw.... And when [the effects of] the mushroom
    ceased, they conversed with one another, spoke of what they
    had seen in the vision. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a publication from the same period, Diego Duran,
a Dominican friar, reported that inebriating mushrooms were eaten
at the great festivity on the occasion of the accession to the
throne of Moctezuma II, the famed emperor of the Aztecs, in the
year 1502. A passage in the seventeenth-century chronicle of Don
Jacinto de la Serna refers to the use of these mushrooms in a
religious framework: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>And what happened was that there had come to [the village]
    an Indian . . . and his name was Juan Chichiton . . . and he
    had brought the red-colored mushrooms that are gathered in
    the uplands, and with them he had committed a great
    idolatry.... In the house where everyone had gathered on the
    occasion of a saint's feast . . . the <i>teponastli</i> [an
    Aztec percussion instrument] was playing and singing was
    going on the whole night through. After most of the night had
    passed, Juan Chichiton, who was the priest for that solumn
    rite, to all of those present at the fiesta gave the
    mushrooms to eat, after the manner of Communion, and gave
    them <i>pulque</i> to drink. . . so that they all went out of
    their heads, a shame it was to see. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, these
    mushrooms were described as <i>teo-nancatl</i>, which can be
    translated as &quot;sacred mushroom.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There are indications that ceremonial use of such
mushrooms reaches far back into pre-Columbian times. So-called
mushroom stones have been found in El Salvador, Guatemala, and
the contiguous mountainous districts of Mexico. These are stone
sculptures in the form of pileate mushroom, on whose stem the
face or the form of a god or an animal-like demon is carved. Most
are about 30 cm high. The oldest examples, according to
archaeologists, date back to before 500 B.C. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; R. G. Wasson argues, quite convincingly, that there
is a connection between these mushroom stones and <i>teonanácatl</i>.
If true, this means that the mushroom cult, the magico-medicinal
and religious-ceremonial use of the magic mushrooms, is more than
two thousand years old. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the Christian missionaries, the inebriating,
vision- and hallucination-producing effects of these mushrooms
seemed to be Devil's work. They therefore tried, with all the
means in their power, to extirpate their use. But they succeeded
only partially, for the Indians have continued secretly down to
our time to utilize the mushroom <i>teonanácatl</i>, which was
sacred to them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strange to say, the reports in the old chronicles
about the use of magic mushrooms remained unnoticed during the
following centuries, probably because they were considered
products of the imagination of a superstitious age. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All traces of the existence of &quot;sacred
mushrooms&quot; were in danger of becoming obliterated once and
for all, when, in 1915, an American botanist of repute, Dr. W. E.
Safford, in an address before the Botanical Society in Washington
and in a scientific publication, advanced the thesis that no such
thing as magic mushrooms had ever existed at all: the Spanish
chroniclers had taken the mescaline cactus for a mushroom! Even
if false, this proposition of Safford's served nevertheless to
direct the attention of the scientific world to the riddle of the
mysterious mushrooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the Mexican physician Dr. Blas Pablo Reko
who first openly disagreed with Safford's interpretation and who
found evidence that mushrooms were still employed in
medicinal-religious ceremonies even in our time, in remote
districts of the southern mountains of Mexico. But not until the
years 19338 did the anthropologist Robert J. Weitlaner and Dr.
Richard Evans Schultes, a botanist from Harvard University, find
actual mushrooms in that region, which were used there for this
ceremonial purpose; and only in 1938 could a group of young
American anthropologists, under the direction of Jean Bassett
Johnson, attend a secret nocturnal mushroom ceremony for the
first time. This was in Huautla de Jiménez, the capital of the
Mazatec country, in the State of Oaxaca. But these researchers
were only spectators, they were not permitted to partake of the
mushrooms. Johnson reported on the experience in a Swedish
journal (<i>Ethnological Studies</i> 9, 1939). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then exploration of the magic mushrooms was
interrupted. World War II broke out. Schultes, at the behest of
the American government, had to occupy himself with rubber
production in the Amazon territory, and Johnson was killed after
the Allied landing in North Africa. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the American researchers, the married couple
Dr. Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and her husband, R. Gordon Wasson,
who again took up the problem from the ethnographic aspect. R. G.
Wasson was a banker, vice-president of the J. P. Morgan Co. in
New York. His wife, who died in 1958, was a pediatrician. The
Wassons began their work in 1953, in the Mazatec village Huautla
de Jiménez, where fifteen years earlier J. B. Johnson and others
had established the continued existence of the ancient Indian
mushroom cult. They received especially valuable information from
an American missionary who had been active there for many years,
Eunice V. Pike, member of the Wycliffe Bible Translators. Thanks
to her knowledge of the native language and her ministerial
association with the inhabitants, Pike had information about the
significance of the magic mushrooms that nobody else possessed.
During several lengthy sojourns in Huautla and environs, the
Wassons were able to study the present use of the mushrooms in
detail and compare it with the descriptions in the old
chronicles. This showed that the belief in the &quot;sacred
mushrooms&quot; was still prevalent in that region. However, the
Indians kept their beliefs a secret from strangers. It took great
tact and skill, therefore, to gain the confidence of the
indigenous population and to receive insight into this secret
domain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the modern form of the mushroom cult, the old
religious ideas and customs are mingled with Christian ideas and
Christian terminology. Thus the mushrooms are often spoken of as
the blood of Christ, because they will grow only where a drop of
Christ's blood has fallen on the earth. According to another
notion, the mushrooms sprout where a drop of saliva from Christ's
mouth has moistened the ground, and it is therefore Jesus Christ
himself who speaks through the mushrooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mushroom ceremony follows the form of a
consultation. The seeker of advice or a sick person or his or her
family questions a &quot;wise man&quot; or a &quot;wise
woman,&quot; a <i>sabio</i> or <i>sabia,</i> also named <i>curandero</i>
or <i>curandera,</i> in return for a modest payment. <i>Curandero</i>
can best be translated into English as &quot;healing
priest,&quot; for his function is that of a physician as well as
that of a priest, both being found only rarely in these remote
regions. In the Mazatec language the healing priest is called <i>co-ta-ci-ne</i>,
which means &quot;one who knows.&quot; He eats the mushroom in
the framework of a ceremony that always takes place at night. The
other persons present at the ceremony may sometimes receive
mushrooms as well, yet a much greater dose always goes to the <i>curandero</i>.
The performance is executed with the accompaniment of prayers and
entreaties, while the mushrooms are incensed briefly over a
basin, in which <i>copal</i> (an incense-like resin) is burned.
In complete darkness, at times by candlelight, while the others
present lie quietly on their straw mats, the curandero, kneeling
or sitting, prays and sings before a type of altar bearing a
crucifix, an image of a saint, or some other object of worship.
Under the influence of the sacred mushrooms, the <i>curandero</i>
counsels in a visionary state, in which even the inactive
observers more or less participate. In the monotonous song of the
<i>curandero,</i> the mushroom <i>teonanácatl </i>gives its
answers to the questions posed. It says whether the diseased
person will live or die, which herbs will effect the cure; it
reveals who has killed a specific person, or who has stolen the
horse; or it makes known how a distant relative fares, and so
forth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mushroom ceremony not only has the function of
a consulation of the type described, for the Indians it also has
a meaning in many respects similar to the Holy Communion for the
believing Christian. From many utterances of the natives it could
be inferred that they believe that God has given the Indians the
sacred mushroom because they are poor and possess no doctors and
medicines; and also, because they cannot read, in particular the
Bible, God can therefore speak directly to them through the
mushroom. The missionary Eunice V. Pike even alluded to the
difficulties that result from explaining the Christian message,
the written word, to a people who believe they possess a
means&#151;the sacred mushrooms of course - to make God's will
known to them in a direct, clear manner: yes, the mushrooms
permit them to see into heaven and to establish communication
with God himself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Indians' reverence for the sacred mushrooms is
also evident in their belief that they can be eaten only by a
&quot;clean&quot; person. &quot;Clean&quot; here means
ceremonially clean, and that term among other things includes
sexual abstinence at least four days before and after ingestion
of the mushrooms. Certain rules must also be observed in
gathering the mushrooms. With non-observance of these
commandments, the mushrooms can make the person who eats it
insane, or can even kill. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Wassons had undertaken their first expedition
to the Mazatec country in 1953, but not until 1955 did they
succeed in overcoming the shyness and reserve of the Mazatec
friends they had managed to make, to the point of being admitted
as active participants in a mushroom ceremony. R. Gordon Wasson
and his companion, the photographer Allan Richardson, were given
sacred mushrooms to eat at the end of June 1955, on the occasion
of a nocturnal mushroom ceremony. They thereby became in all
likelihood the first outsiders, the first whites, ever permitted
to take <i>teonanácatl</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the second volume of <i>Mushrooms, Russia and
History,</i> in enraptured words, Wasson describes how the
mushroom seized possession of him completely, although he had
tried to struggle against its effects, in order to be able to
remain an objective observer. First he saw geometric, colored
patterns, which then took on architectural characteristics. Next
followed visions of splendid colonnades, palaces of supernatural
harmony and magnificence embellished with precious gems,
triumphal cars drawn by fabulous creatures as they are known only
from mythology, and landscapes of fabulous luster. Detached from
the body, the spirit soared timelessly in a realm of fantasy
among images of a higher reality and deeper meaning than those of
the ordinary, everyday world. The essence of life, the ineffable,
seemed to be on the verge of being unlocked, but the ultimate
door failed to open. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This experience was the final proof, for Wasson,
that the magical powers attributed to the mushrooms actually
existed and were not merely superstition. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to introduce the mushrooms to scientific
research, Wasson had earlier established an association with
mycologist Professor Roger Heim of Paris. Accompanying the
Wassons on further expeditions into the Mazatec country, Heim
conducted the botanical identification of the sacred mushrooms.
He showed that they were gilled mushrooms from the family <i>Strophariaceae,</i>
about a dozen different species not previously described
scientifically, the greatest part belonging to the genus <i>Psilocybe.</i>
Professor Heim also succeeded in cultivating some of the species
in the laboratory. The mushroom <i>Psilocybe mexicana</i> turned
out to be especially suitable for artificial cultivation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chemical investigations ran parallel with these
botanical studies on the magic mushrooms, with the goal of
extracting the hallucinogenically active principle from the
mushroom material and preparing it in chemically pure form. Such
investigations were carried out at Professor Heim's instigation
in the chemical laboratory of the Museum National d'Histoire
Naturelle in Paris, and work teams were occupied with this
problem in the United States in the research laboratories of two
large pharmaceutical companies: Merck, and Smith, Kline and
French. The American laboratories had obtained some of the
mushrooms from R. G. Wasson and had gathered others themselves in
the Sierra Mazateca. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the chemical investigations in Paris and in the
United States turned out to be ineffectual, Professor Heim
addressed this matter to our firm, as mentioned at the beginning
of this chapter, because he felt that our experimental experience
with LSD, related to the magic mushrooms by similar activity,
could be of use in the isolation attempts. Thus it was LSD that
showed <i>teonanácatl</i> the way into our laboratory. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As director of the department of natural products
of the Sandoz pharmaceutical-chemical research laboratories at
that time, I wanted to assign-the investigation of the magic
mushrooms to one of my coworkers. However, nobody showed much
eagerness to take on this problem because it was known that LSD
and everything connected with it were scarcely popular subjects
to the top management. Because the enthusiasm necessary for
successful endeavors cannot be commanded, and because the
enthusiasm was already present in me as far as this problem was
concerned, I decided to conduct the investigation myself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some 100 g of dried mushrooms of the species <i>Psilocybe
mexicana, </i>cultivated by Professor Heim in the laboratory,
were available for the beginning of the chemical analysis. My
laboratory assistant, Hans Tscherter, who during our decade-long
collaboration, had developed into a very capable helper,
completely familiar with my manner of work, aided me in the
extraction and isolation attempts. Since there were no clues at
all concerning the chemical properties of the active principle we
sought, the isolation attempts had to be conducted on the basis
of the effects of the extract fractions. But none of the various
extracts showed an unequivocal effect, either in the mouse or the
dog, which could have pointed to the presence of hallucinogenic
principles. It therefore became doubtful whether the mushrooms
cultivated and dried in Paris were still active at all. That
could only be determined by experimenting with this mushroom
material on a human being. As in the case of LSD, I made this
fundamental experiment myself, since it is not appropriate for
researchers to ask anyone else to perform self-experiments that
they require for their own investigations, especially if they
entail, as in this case, a certain risk. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this experiment I ate 32 dried specimens of <i>Psilocybe
mexicana,</i> which together weighed 2.4 g. This amount
corresponded to an average dose, according to the reports of
Wasson and Heim, as it is used by the <i>curanderos</i>. The
mushrooms displayed a strong psychic effect, as the following
extract from the report on that experiment shows: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Thirty minutes after my taking the mushrooms, the exterior
    world began to undergo a strange transformation. Everything
    assumed a Mexican character. As I was perfectly well aware
    that my knowledge of the Mexican origin of the mushroom would
    lead me to imagine only Mexican scenery, I tried deliberately
    to look on my environment as I knew it normally. But all
    voluntary efforts to look at things in their customary forms
    and colors proved ineffective. Whether my eyes were closed or
    open, I saw only Mexican motifs and colors. When the doctor
    supervising the experiment bent over me to check my blood
    pressure, he was transformed into an Aztec priest and I would
    not have been astonished if he had drawn an obsidian knife.
    In spite of the seriousness of the situation, it amused me to
    see how the Germanic face of my colleague had acquired a
    purely Indian expression. At the peak of the intoxication,
    about 1 1/2 hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, the rush
    of interior pictures, mostly abstract motifs rapidly changing
    in shape and color, reached such an alarming degree that I
    feared that I would be torn into this whirlpool of form and
    color and would dissolve. After about six hours the dream
    came to an end. Subjectively, I had no idea how long this
    condition had lasted. I felt my return to everyday reality to
    be a happy return from a strange, fantastic but quite real
    world to an old and familiar home. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This self-experiment showed once again that human
beings react much more sensitively than animals to psychoactive
substances. We had already reached the same conclusion in
experimenting with LSD on animals, as described in an earlier
chapter of this book. It was not inactivity of the mushroom
material, but rather the deficient reaction capability of the
research animals vis-à-vis such a type of active principle, that
explained why our extracts had appeared inactive in the mouse and
dog. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the assay on human subjects was the only
test at our disposal for the detection of the active extract
fractions, we had no other choice than to perform the testing on
ourselves if we wanted to carry on the work and bring it to a
successful conclusion. In the self-experiment just described, a
strong reaction lasting several hours was produced by 2.4 g dried
mushrooms. Therefore, in the sequel we used samples corresponding
to only one-third of this amount, namely 0.8 g dried mushrooms.
If these samples contained the active principle, they would only
provoke a mild effect that impaired the ability to work for a
short time, but this effect would still be so distinct that the
inactive fractions and those containing the active principle
could unequivocally be differentiated from one another. Several
coworkers and colleagues volunteered as guinea pigs for this
series of tests.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Psilocybin and Psilocin </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With the help of this reliable test on human
subjects, the active principle could be isolated, concentrated,
and transformed into a chemically pure state by means of the
newest separation methods. Two new substances, which I named
psilocybin and psilocin, were thereby obtained in the form of
colorless crystals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These results were published in March 1958 in the
journal <i>Experientia</i>, in collaboration with Professor Heim
and with my colleagues Dr. A. Brack and Dr. H. Kobel, who had
provided greater quantities of mushroom material for these
investigations after they had essentially improved the laboratory
cultivation of the mushrooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of my coworkers at the time&#151;Drs. A. J.
Frey, H. Ott, T. Petrzilka, and F. Troxler&#151;then participated
in the next steps of these investigations, the determination of
the chemical structure of psilocybin and psilocin and the
subsequent synthesis of these compounds, the results of which
were published in the November 1958 issue of <i>Experientia</i>.
The chemical structures of these mushroom factors deserve special
attention in several respects. Psilocybin and psilocin belong,
like LSD, to the indole compounds, the biologically important
class of substances found in the plant and animal kingdoms.
Particular chemical features common to both the mushroom
substances and LSD show that psilocybin and psilocin are closely
related to LSD, not only with regard to psychic effects but also
to their chemical structures. Psilocybin is the phosphoric acid
ester of psilocin and, as such, is the first and hitherto only
phosphoric-acid-containing indole compound discovered in nature.
The phosphoric acid residue does not contribute to the activity,
for the phosphoric-acid-free psilocin is just as active as
psilocybin, but it makes the molecule more stable. While psilocin
is readily decomposed by the oxygen in air, psilocybin is a
stable substance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Psilocybin and psilocin possess a chemical
structure very similar to the brain factor serotonin. As was
already mentioned in the chapter on animal experiments and
biological research, serotonin plays an important role in the
chemistry of brain functions. The two mushroom factors, like LSD,
block the effects of serotonin in pharmacological experiments on
different organs. Other pharmacological properties of psilocybin
and psilocin are also similar to those of LSD. The main
difference consists in the quantitative activity, in animal as
well as human experimentation. The average active dose of
psilocybin or psilocin in human beings amounts to 10 mg (0.01 g);
accordingly, these two substances are more than 100 times less
active than LSD, of which 0.1 mg constitutes a strong dose.
Moreover, the effects of the mushroom factors last only four to
six hours, much shorter than the effects of LSD (eight to twelve
hours). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The total synthesis of psilocybin and psilocin,
without the aid of the mushrooms, could be developed into a
technical process, which would allow these substances to be
produced on a large scale. Synthetic production is more rational
and cheaper than extraction from the mushrooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus with the isolation and synthesis of the active
principles, the demystification of the magic mushrooms was
accomplished. The compounds whose wondrous effects led the
Indians to believe for millennia that a god was residing in the
mushrooms had their chemical structures elucidated and could be
produced synthetically in flasks. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just what progress in scientific knowledge was
accomplished by natural products research in this case?
Essentially, when all is said and done, we can only say that the
mystery of the wondrous effects of <i>teonanácatl </i>was
reduced to the mystery of the effects of two crystalline
substances&#151;since these effects cannot be explained by
science either, but can only be describe.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>A Voyage into the Universe of the Soul with Psilocybin </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The relationship between the psychic effects of
psilocybin and those of LSD, their visionaryhallucinatory
character, is evident in the following report from <i>Antaios,</i>
of a psilocybin experiment by Dr. Rudolf Gelpke. He has
characterized his experiences with LSD and psilocybin, as already
mentioned in a previous chapter, as &quot;travels in the universe
of the soul.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Where Time Stands Still </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (10 mg psilocybin, 6 April 1961, 10:20) </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>After ca. 20 minutes, beginning effects: serenity,
    speechlessness, mild but pleasant dizzy sensation, and
    &quot;pleasureful deep breathing.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:50 Strong! dizziness, can no longer
    concentrate . <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:55 Excited, intensity of colors: everything
    pink to red. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 11:05 The world concentrates itself there on
    the center of the table. Colors very intense. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 11:10 A divided being, unprecedented&#151;how
    can I describe this sensation of life? Waves, different
    selves, must control me. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately after this note I went outdoors,
    leaving the breakfast table, where I had eaten with Dr. H.
    and our wives, and lay down on the lawn. The inebriation
    pushed rapidly to its climax. Although I had firmly resolved
    to make constant notes, it now seemed to me a complete waste
    of time, the motion of writing infinitely slow, the
    possibilities of verbal expression unspeakably paltry -
    measured by the flood of inner experience that inundated me
    and threatened to burst me. It seemed to me that 100 years
    would not be sufficient to describe the fullness of
    experience of a single minute. At the beginning, optical
    impressions predominated: I saw with delight the boundless
    succession of rows of trees in the nearby forest. Then the
    tattered clouds in the sunny sky rapidly piled up with silent
    and breathtaking majesty to a superimposition of thousands of
    layers&#151;heaven on heaven&#151;and I waited then expecting
    that up there in the next moment something completely
    powerful, unheard of, not yet existing, would appear or
    happen - would I behold a god? But only the expectation
    remained, the presentiment, this hovering, &quot;on the
    threshold of the ultimate feeling.&quot; . . . Then I moved
    farther away (the proximity of others disturbed me) and lay
    down in a nook of the garden on a sun-warmed wood
    pile&#151;my fingers stroked this wood with overflowing,
    animal-like sensual affection. At the same time I was
    submerged within myself; it was an absolute climax: a
    sensation of bliss pervaded me, a contented happiness&#151;I
    found myself behind my closed eyes in a cavity full of
    brick-red ornaments, and at the same time in the &quot;center
    of the universe of consummate calm.&quot; I knew everything
    was good&#151;the cause and origins of everything was good.
    But at the same moment I also understood the suffering and
    the loathing, the depression and misunderstanding of ordinary
    life: there one is never &quot;total,&quot; but instead
    divided, cut in pieces, and split up into the tiny fragments
    of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years: there one
    is a slave of Moloch time, which devoured one piecemeal; one
    is condemned to stammering, bungling, and patchwork; one must
    drag about with oneself the perfection and absolute, the
    togetherness of all things; the eternal moment of the golden
    age, this original ground of being&#151;that indeed
    nevertheless has always endured and will endure
    forever&#151;there in the weekday of human existence, as a
    tormenting thorn buried deeply in the soul, as a memorial of
    a claim never fulfilled, as a fata morgana of a lost and
    promised paradise; through this feverish dream
    &quot;present&quot; to a condemned &quot;past&quot; in a
    clouded &quot;future.&quot; I understood. This inebriation
    was a spaceflight, not of the outer but rather of the inner
    man, and for a moment I experienced reality from a location
    that lies somewhere beyond the force of gravity of time. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; As I began again to feel this force of gravity,
    I was childish enough to want to postpone the return by
    taking a new dose of 6 mg psilocybin at 11:45, and once again
    4 mg at 14:30. The effect was trifling, and in any case not
    worth mentioning. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs. Li Gelpke, an artist, also participated in
this series of investigations, taking three self-experiments with
LSD and psilocybin. The artist wrote of the drawing she made
during the experiment: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Nothing on this page is consciously fashioned. While I
    worked on it, the memory (of the experience under psilocybin)
    was again reality, and led me at every stroke. For that
    reason the picture is as many-layered as this memory, and the
    figure at the lower right is really the captive of its
    dream.... When books about Mexican art came into my hands
    three weeks later, I again found the motifs of my visions
    there with a sudden start.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have also mentioned the occurrence of Mexican
motifs in psilocybin inebriation during my first self-experiment
with dried Psilocybe mexicana mushrooms, as was described in the
section on the chemical investigation of these mushrooms. The
same phenomenon has also struck R. Gordon Wasson. Proceeding from
such observations, he has advanced the conjecture that ancient
Mexican art could have been influenced by visionary images, as
they appear in mushroom inebriation.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>The &quot;Magic Morning Glory&quot; <i>Ololiuhqui</i> </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After we had managed to solve the riddle of the
sacred mushroom <i>teonanácatl</i> in a relatively short time, I
also became interested in the problem of another Mexican magic
drug not yet chemically elucidated, <i>ololiuhqui</i>. <i>Ololiuhqui</i>
is the Aztec name for the seeds of certain climbing plants <i>(Convolvulaceae)</i>
that, like the mescaline cactus <i>peyotl </i>and the <i>teonanácatl</i>
mushrooms, were used in pre-Columbian times by the Aztecs and
neighboring people in religious ceremonies and magical healing
practices. <i>Ololiuhqui </i>is still used even today by certain
Indian tribes like the Zapotec, Chinantec, Mazatec, and Mixtec,
who until a short time ago still led a genuinely isolated
existence, little influenced by Christianity, in the remote
mountains of southern Mexico. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An excellent study of the historical, ethnological,
and botanical aspects of <i>ololiuhqui</i> was published in 1941
by Richard Evans Schultes, director of the Harvard Botanical
Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is entitled &quot;A
Contribution to Our Knowledge of <i>Rivea corymbosa,</i> the
Narcotic <i>Ololiuqui</i> of the Aztecs.&quot; The following
statements about the history of <i>ololiuhqui </i>derive chiefly
from Schultes's monograph. [Translator's note: As R. Gordon
Wasson has pointed out, &quot;<i>ololiuhqui</i>&quot; is a more
precise orthography than the more popular spelling used by
Schultes. See <i>Botanical Museum Leaflets Harvard University</i>
20: 161-212, 1963.] <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The earliest records about this drug were written
by Spanish chroniclers of the sixteenth century, who also
mentioned <i>peyotl</i> and <i>teonanácatl.</i> Thus the
Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun, in his already cited
famous chronicle <i>Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva
Espana,</i> writes about the wondrous effects of <i>ololiuhqui:</i>
&quot;There is an herb, called <i>coatl xoxouhqui</i> (green
snake), which produces seeds that are called <i>ololiuhqui.</i>
These seeds stupefy and deprive one of reason: they are taken as
a potion.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We obtain further information about these seeds
from the physician Francisco Hernandez, whom Philip II sent to
Mexico from Spain, from 1570 to 1575, in order to study the
medicaments of the natives. In the chapter &quot;On <i>Ololiuhqui</i>&quot;
of his monumental work entitled <i>Rerum Medicarum Novae
Hispaniae Thesaurus seu Plantarum, Animalium Mineralium
Mexicanorum Historia,</i> published in Rome in 1651, he gives a
detailed description and the first illustration of <i>ololiuhqui</i>.
An extract from the Latin text accompanying the illustration
reads in translation: &quot;<i>Ololiuhqui,</i> which others call <i>coaxihuitl</i>
or snake plant, is a climber with thin, green, heart-shaped
leaves.... The flowers are white, fairly large.... The seeds are
roundish. . . . When the priests of the Indians wanted to visit
with the gods and obtain information from them, they ate of this
plant in order to become inebriated. Thousands of fantastic
images and demons then appeared to them....&quot; Despite this
comparatively good description, the botanical identification of <i>ololiuhqui</i>
as seeds of <i>Rivea corymbosa</i> (L.) Hall. f. occasioned many
discussions in specialist circles. Recently preference has been
given to the synonym <i>Turbina corymbosa</i> (L.) Raf. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I decided in 1959 to attempt the isolation o
the active principles of <i>ololiuhqui,</i> only a single report
on chemical work with the seeds of <i>Turbina corymbosa</i> was
available. It was the work of the pharmacologist C. G. Santesson
of Stockholm, from the year 1937. Santesson, however, was not
successful in isolating an active substance in pure form. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Contradictory findings had been published about the
activity of the <i>ololiuhqui</i> seeds. The psychiatrist H.
Osmond conducted a self-experiment with the seeds of <i>Turbina
corymbosa </i>in 1955. After the ingestion of 60 to 100 seeds, he
entered into a state of apathy and emptiness, accompanied by
enhanced visual sensitivity. After four hours, there followed a
period of relaxation and well-being, lasting for a longer time.
The results of V. J. Kinross-Wright, published in England in
1958, in which eight voluntary research subjects, who had taken
up to 125 seeds, perceived no effects at all, contradicted this
report. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the mediation of R. Gordon Wasson, I
obtained two samples of <i>ololiuhqui</i> seeds. In his
accompanying letter of 6 August 1959 from Mexico City, he wrote
of them: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . The parcels that I am sending you are the following:
    . . . <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A small parcel of seeds that I take to be <i>Rivea
    corymbosa,</i> otherwise known as ololiuqui well-known
    narcotic of the Aztecs, called in Huautla &quot;la semilla de
    la Virgen.&quot; This parcel, you will find, consists of two
    little bottles, which represent two deliveries of seeds made
    to us in Huautla, and a larger batch of seeds delivered to us
    by Francisco Ortega &quot;Chico,&quot; the Zapotec guide, who
    himself gathered the seeds from the plants at the Zapotec
    town of San Bartolo Yautepec.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first-named, round, light brown seeds from
Huautla proved in the botanical determination to have been
correctly identified as <i>Rivea (Turbina) corymbosa,</i> while
the black, angular seeds from San Bartolo Yautepec were
identified as <i>Ipomoea violacea</i> L. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While <i>Turbina corymbosa</i> thrives only in
tropical or subtropical climates, one also finds <i>Ipomoea
violacea</i> as an ornamental plant dispersed over the whole
earth in the temperate zones. It is the morning glory that
delights the eye in our gardens in diverse varieties with blue or
blue-red striped calyxes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Zapotec, besides the original <i>ololiuhqui</i>
(that is, the seeds of <i>Turbina corymbosa</i>, which they call <i>badoh</i>),
also utilize <i>badoh negro,</i> the seeds of <i>Ipomoea violacea</i>.
T. MacDougall, who furnished us with a second larger consignment
of the last-named seeds, made this observation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My capable laboratory assistant Hans Tscherter,
with whom I had already carried out the isolation of the active
principles of the mushrooms, participated in the chemical
investigation of the <i>ololiuhqui</i> drug. We advanced the
working hypothesis that the active principles of the <i>ololiuhqui</i>
seeds could be representatives of the same class of chemical
substances, the indole compounds, to which LSD, psilocybin, and
psilocin belong. Considering the very great number of other
groups of substances that, like the indoles, were under
consideration as active principles of <i>ololiuhqui</i>, it was
indeed extremely improbable that this assumption would prove
true. It could, however, very easily be tested. The presence of
indole compounds, of course, may simply and rapidly be determined
by colorimetric reactions. Thus even traces of indole substances,
with a certain reagent, give an intense blue-colored solution. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had luck with our hypothesis. Extracts of <i>ololiuhqui</i>
seeds with the appropriate reagent gave the blue coloration
characteristic of indole compounds. With the help of this
colorimetric test, we succeeded in a short time in isolating the
indole substances from the seeds and in obtaining them in
chemically pure form. Their identification led to an astonishing
result. What we found appeared at first scarcely believable. Only
after repetition and the most careful scrutiny of the operations
was our suspicion concerning the peculiar findings eliminated:
the active principles from the ancient Mexican magic drug <i>ololiuhqui</i>
proved to be identical with substances that were already present
in my laboratory. They were identical with alkaloids that had
been obtained in the course of the decades-long investigations of
ergot; partly isolated as such from ergot, partly obtained
through chemical modification of ergot substances. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lysergic acid amide, lysergic acid
hydroxyethylamide, and alkaloids closely related to them
chemically were established as the main active principles of <i>ololiuhqui</i>.
(See formulae in the appendix.) Also present was the alkaloid
ergobasine, whose synthesis had constituted the starting point of
my investigations on ergot alkaloids. Lysergic acid amide and
lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, active principles of <i>ololiuhqui</i>,
are chemically very closely related to lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD), which even for the non-chemist follows from the names. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lysergic acid amide was described for the first
time by the English chemists S. Smith and G. M. Timmis as a
cleavage product of ergot alkaloids, and I had also produced this
substance synthetically in the course of the investigations in
which LSD originated. Certainly, nobody at the time could have
suspected that this compound synthesized in the flask would be
discovered twenty years later as a naturally occurring active
principle of an ancient Mexican magic drug. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the discovery of the psychic effects of LSD,
I had also tested lysergic acid amide in a self-experiment and
established that it likewise evoked a dreamlike condition, but
only with about a tenfold to twenty-fold greater dose than LSD.
This effect was characterized by a sensation of mental emptiness
and the unreality and meaninglessness of the outer world, by
enhanced sensitivity of hearing, and by a not unpleasant physical
lassitude, which ultimately led to sleep. This picture of the
effects of LA-111, as lysergic acid amide was called as a
research preparation, was confirmed in a systematic investigation
by the psychiatrist Dr. H. Solms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I presented the findings of our investigations
on <i>ololiuhqui</i> at the Natural Products Congress of the
International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in
Sydney, Australia, in the fall of 1960, my colleagues received my
talk with skepticism. In the discussions following my lecture,
some persons voiced the suspicion that the <i>ololiuhqui</i>
extracts could well have been contaminated with traces of
lysergic acid derivatives, with which so much work had been done
in my laboratory. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was another reason for the doubt in
specialist circles concerning our findings. The occurrence in
higher plants (i.e., in the morning glory family) of ergot
alkaloids that hitherto had been known only as constituents of
lower fungi, contradicted the experience that certain substances
are typical of and restricted to respective plant families. It is
indeed a very rare exception to find a characteristic group of
substances, in this case the ergot alkaloids, occurring in two
divisions of the plant kingdom broadly separated in evolutionary
history. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our results were confirmed, however, when different
laboratories in the United States, Germany, and Holland
subsequently verified our investigations on the <i>ololiuhqui</i>
seeds. Nevertheless, the skepticism went so far that some persons
even considered the possibility that the seeds could have been
infected with alkaloid-producing fungi. That suspicion, however,
was ruled out experimentally. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These studies on the active principles of <i>ololiuhqui</i>
seeds, although they were published only in professional
journals, had an unexpected sequel. We were apprised by two Dutch
wholesale seed companies that their sale of seeds of <i>Ipomoea
violacea</i>, the ornamental blue morning glory, had reached
unusual proportions in recent times. They had heard that the
great demand was connected with investigations of these seeds in
our laboratory, about which they were eager to learn the details.
It turned out that the new demand derived from hippie circles and
other groups interested in hallucinogenic drugs. They believed
they had found in the <i>ololiuhqui</i> seeds a substitute for
LSD, which was becoming less and less accessible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The morning glory seed boom, however, lasted only a
comparatively short time, evidently because of the undesirable
experiences that those in the drug world had with this
&quot;new&quot; ancient inebriant. The <i>ololiuhqui</i> seeds,
which are taken crushed with water or another mild beverage,
taste very bad and are difficult for the stomach to digest.
Moreover, the psychic effects of <i>ololiuhqui</i>, in fact,
differ from those of LSD in that the euphoric and the
hallucinogenic components are less pronounced, while a sensation
of mental emptiness, often anxiety and depression, predominates.
Furthermore, weariness and lassitude are hardly desirable effects
as traits in an inebriant. These could all be reasons why the
drug culture's interest in the morning glory seeds has
diminished. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Only a few investigations have considered the
question whether the active principles of <i>ololiuhqui</i> could
find a useful application in medicine. In my opinion, it would be
worthwhile to clarify above all whether the strong narcotic,
sedative effect of certain <i>ololiuhqui</i> constituents, or of
chemical modifications of these, is medicinally useful. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My studies in the field of hallucinogenic drugs
reached a kind of logical conclusion with the investigations of <i>ololiuhqui</i>.
They now formed a circle, one could almost say a magic circle:
the starting point had been the synthesis of lysergic acid
amides, among them the naturally occurring ergot alkaloid
ergobasin. This led to the synthesis of lysergic acid
diethylamide, LSD. The hallucinogenic properties of LSD were the
reason why the hallucinogenic magic mushroom <i>teonanácatl</i>
found its way into my laboratory. The work with <i>teonanácatl</i>,
from which psilocybin and psilocin were isolated, proceeded to
the investigation of another Mexican magic drug, <i>ololiuhqui</i>,
in which hallucinogenic principles in the form of lysergic acid
amides were again encountered, including ergobasin&#151;with
which the magic circle closed.</p>

<h4>In Search of the Magic Plant &quot;Ska María Pastora&quot;
in the Mazatec Country </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; R. Gordon Wasson, with whom I had maintained
friendly relations since the investigations of the Mexican magic
mushrooms, invited my wife and me to take part in an expedition
to Mexico in the fall of 1962. The purpose of the journey was to
search for another Mexican magic plant. Wasson had learned on his
travels in the mountains of southern Mexico that the expressed
juice of the leaves of a plant, which were called <i>hojas de la
Pastora </i>or <i>hojas de </i>María<i> Pastora,</i> in Mazatec <i>ska
Pastora</i> or <i>ska </i>María<i> Pastora </i>(leaves of the
shepherdess or leaves of Mary the shepherdess), were used among
the Mazatec in medico-religious practices, like the <i>teonanácatl</i>
mushrooms and the <i>ololiuhqui</i> seeds. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The question now was to ascertain from what sort of
plant the &quot;leaves of Mary the shepherdess&quot; derived, and
then to identify this plant botanically. We also hoped, if at all
possible, to gather sufficient plant material to conduct a
chemical investigation on the hallucinogenic principles it
contained.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Ride through the Sierra Mazateca </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On 26 September 1962, my wife and I accordingly
flew to Mexico City, where we met Gordon Wasson. He had made all
the necessary preparations for the expedition, so that in two
days we had already set out on the next leg of the journey to the
south. Mrs. Irmgard Weitlaner Johnson, (widow of Jean B. Johnson,
a pioneer of the ethnographic study of the Mexican magic
mushrooms, killed in the Allied landing in North Africa) had
joined us. Her father, Robert J. Weitlaner, had emigrated to
Mexico from Austria and had likewise contributed toward the
rediscovery of the mushroom cult. Mrs. Johnson worked at the
National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, as an expert on
Indian textiles. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a two-day journey in a spacious Land Rover,
which took us over the plateau, along the snow-capped
Popocatépetl, passing Puebla, down into the Valley of Orizaba
with its magnificent tropical vegetation, then by ferry across
the Popoloapan (Butterfly River), on through the former Aztec
garrison Tuxtepec, we arrived at the starting point of our
expedition, the Mazatec village of Jalapa de Diaz, lying on a
hillside. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There we were in the midst of the environment and
among the people that we would come to know in the succeeding 2
1/2 weeks. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was an uproar upon our arrival in the
marketplace, center of this village widely dispersed in the
jungle. Old and young men, who had been squatting and standing
around in the half-opened bars and shops, pressed suspiciously
yet curiously about our Land Rover; they were mostly barefoot but
all wore a <i>sombrero.</i> Women and girls were nowhere to be
seen. One of the men gave us to understand that we should follow.
him. He led us to the local president, a fat <i>mestizo</i> who
had his office in a one-story house with a corrugated iron roof.
Gordon showed him our credentials from the civil authorities and
from the military governor of Oaxaca, which explained that we had
come here to carry out scientific investigations. The president,
who probably could not read at all, was visibly impressed by the
large-sized documents equipped with official seals. He had
lodgings assigned to us in a spacious shed, in which we could
place our air mattresses and sleeping bags. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I looked around the region somewhat. The ruins of a
large church from colonial times, which must have once been very
beautiful, rose almost ghostlike in the direction of an ascending
slope at the side of the village square. Now I could also see
women looking out of their huts, venturing to examine the
strangers. In their long, white dresses, adorned with red
borders, and with their long braids of blue-black hair, they
offered a picturesque sight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We were fed by an old Mazatec woman, who directed a
young cook and two helpers. She lived in one of the typical
Mazatec huts. These are simply rectangular structures with
thatched gabled roofs and walls of wooden poles joined together,
windowless, the chinks between the wooden poles offering
sufficient opportunity to look out. In the middle of the hut, on
the stamped clay floor, was an elevated, open fireplace, built up
out of dried clay or made of stones. The smoke escaped through
large openings in the walls under the two ends of the roof. Bast
mats that lay in a corner or along the walls served as beds. The
huts were shared with the domestic animals, as well as black
swine, turkeys, and chickens. There was roasted chicken to eat,
black beans, and also, in place of bread, <i>tortillas</i>, a
type of cornmeal pancake that is baked on the hot stone slab of
the hearth. Beer and tequila, an <i>Agave</i> liquor, were
served. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next morning our troop formed for the ride through
the Sierra Mazateca. Mules and guides were engaged from the
horsekeeper of the village. Guadelupe, the Mazatec familiar with
the route, took charge of guiding the lead animal. Gordon,
Irmgard, my wife, and I were stationed on our mules in the
middle. Teodosio and Pedro, called Chico, two young fellows who
trotted along barefoot beside the two mules laden with our
baggage, brought up the rear. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It took some time to get accustomed to the hard
wooden saddles. Then, however, this mode of locomotion proved to
be the most ideal type of travel that I know of. The mules
followed the leader, single file, at a steady pace. They required
no direction at all by the rider. With surprising dexterity, they
sought out the best spots along the almost impassable, partly
rocky, partly marshy paths, which led through thickets and
streams or onto precipitous slopes. Relieved of all travel cares,
we could devote all our attention to the beauty of the landscape
and the tropical vegetation. There were tropical forests with
gigantic trees overgrown with twining plants, then again
clearings with banana groves or coffee plantations, between light
stands of trees, flowers at the edge of the path, over which
wondrous butterflies bustled about.... We made our way upstream
along the broad riverbed of Rio Santo Domingo, with brooding heat
and steamy air, now steeply ascending, then again falling. During
a short, violent tropical downpour, the long broad ponchos of
oilcloth, with which Gordon had equipped us, proved quite useful.
Our Indian guides had protected themselves from the cloudburst
with gigantic, heart-shaped leaves that they nimbly chopped off
at the edge of the path. Teodosio and Chico gave the impression
of great, green hay cricks as they ran, covered with these
leaves, beside their mules. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly before nightfall we arrived at the first
settlement, La Providencia ranch. The patron, Don Joaquin Garcia,
the head of a large family, welcomed us hospitably and full of
dignity. It was impossible to determine how many children, in
addition to the grown-ups and the domestic animals, were present
in the large living room, feebly illuminated by the hearth fire
alone. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gordon and I placed our sleeping bags outdoors
under the projecting roof. I awoke in the morning to find a pig
grunting over my face. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After another day's journey on the backs of our
worthy mules, we arrived at Ayautla, a Mazatec settlement spread
across a hillside. En route, among the shrubbery, I had delighted
in the blue calyxes of the magic morning glory <i>Ipomoea
violacea</i>, the mother plant of the <i>ololiuhqui</i> seeds. It
grew wild there, whereas among us it is only found in the Garden
as an ornamental plant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We remained in Ayautla for several days. We had
lodging in the house of Doña Donata Sosa de García. Doña
Donata was in charge of a large family, which included her ailing
husband. In addition, she presided over the coffee cultivation of
the region. The collection center for the freshly picked coffee
beans was in an adjacent building. It was a lovely picture, the
young Indian woman and girls returning home from the harvest
toward evening, in their bright garments adorned with colored
borders, the coffee sacks carried on their backs by headbands.
Doña Donata also managed a type of grocery store, in which her
husband, Don Eduardo, stood behind the counter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the evening by candlelight, Doña Donata, who
besides Mazatec also spoke Spanish, told us about life in the
village; one tragedy or another had already struck nearly every
one of the seemingly peaceful huts that lay surrounded by this
paradisiacal scenery. A man who had murdered his wife, and who
now sits in prison for life, had lived in the house next door,
which now stood empty. The husband of a daughter of Doña Donata,
after an affair with another woman, was murdered out of jealousy.
The president of Ayautla, a young bull of a mestizo, to whom we
had made our formal visit in the afternoon, never made the short
walk from his hut to his &quot;office&quot; in the village hall
(with the corrugated iron roof) unless accompanied by two heavily
armed men. Because he exacted illegal taxes, he was afraid of
being shot to death. Since no higher authority sees to justice in
this remote region, people have recourse to self-defense of this
type. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks to Doña Donata's good connections, we
received the first sample of the sought-after plant, some leaves
of <i>hojas de la Pastora,</i> from an old woman. Since the
flowers and roots were missing, however, this plant material was
not suitable for botanical identification. Our efforts to obtain
more precise information about the habitat of the plant and its
use were also fruitless. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The continuation of our journey from Ayautla was
delayed, as we had to wait until our boys could again bring back
the mules that they had taken to pasture on the other side of Rio
Santo Domingo, over the river swollen by intense downpours. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a two-day ride, on which we had passed the
night in the high mountain village of San Miguel-Huautla, we
arrived at Rio Santiago. Here we were joined by Doña Herlinda
Martinez Cid, a teacher from Huautla de Jiménez. She had ridden
over on the invitation of Gordon Wasson, who had known her since
his mushroom expeditions, and was to serve as our Mazatec and
Spanish-speaking interpreter. Moreover, she could help us,
through her numerous relatives scattered in the region, to pave
the way to contacts with <i>curanderos</i> and <i>curandera</i>s
who used the <i>hojas de la Pastora</i> in their practice.
Because of our delayed arrival in Rio Santiago, Doña Herlinda,
who was acquainted with the dangers of the region, had been
apprehensive about us, fearing we might have plunged down a rocky
path or been attacked by robbers. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop was in San José Tenango, a
settlement lying deep in a valley, in the midst of tropical
vegetation with orange and lemon trees and banana plantations.
Here again was the typical village picture: in the center, a
marketplace with a half-ruined church from the colonial period,
with two or three stands, a general store, and shelters for
horses and mules. We found lodging in a corrugated iron barracks,
with the special luxury of a cement floor, on which we could
spread out our sleeping bags. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the thick jungle on the mountainside we
discovered a spring, whose magnificent fresh water in a natural
rocky basin invited us to bathe. That was an unforgettable
pleasure after days without opportunities to wash properly. In
this grotto I saw a hummingbird for the first time in nature, a
blue-green, metallic, iridescent gem, which whirred over great
liana blossoms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The desired contact with persons skilled in
medicine came about thanks to the kindred connections of Doña
Herlinda, beginning with the curandero Don Sabino. But he
refused, for some reason, to receive us in a consultation and to
question the leaves. From an old <i>curandera</i>, a venerable
woman in a strikingly magnificent Mazatec garment, with the
lovely name Natividad Rosa, we received a whole bundle of
flowering specimens of the sought-after plant, but even she could
not be prevailed upon to perform a ceremony with the leaves for
us. Her excuse was that she was too old for the hardship of the
magical trip; she could never cover the long distance to certain
places: a spring where the wise women gather their powers, a lake
on which the sparrows sing, and where objects get their names.
Nor would Natividad Rosa tell us where she had gathered the
leaves. They grew in a very, very distant forest valley. Wherever
she dug up a plant, she put a coffee bean in the earth as thanks
to the gods. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We now possessed ample plants with flowers and
roots, which were suitable for botanical identification. It was
apparently a representative of the genus Salvia, a relative of
the well-known meadow sage. The plants had blue flowers crowned
with a white dome, which are arranged on a panicle 20 to 30 cm
long, whose stem leaked blue. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Several days later, Natividad Rosa brought us a
whole basket of leaves, for which she was paid fifty pesos. The
business seemed to have been discussed, for two other women
brought us further quantities of leaves. As it was known that the
expressed juice of the leaves is drunk in the ceremony, and this
must therefore contain the active principle, the fresh leaves
were crushed on a stone plate, squeezed out in a cloth, the juice
diluted with alcohol as a preservative, and decanted into flasks
in order to be studied later in the laboratory in Basel. I was
assisted in this work by an Indian girl, who was accustomed to
dealing with the stone plate, the <i>metate</i>, on which the
Indians since ancient times have ground their corn by hand. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the day before the journey was to continue,
having given up all hope of being able to attend a ceremony, we
suddenly made another contact with a <i>curandera</i>, one who
was ready &quot; to serve us .&quot; A confidante of Herlinda's,
who had produced this contact, led us after nightfall along a
secret path to the hut of the <i>curandera</i>, lying solitary on
the mountainside above the settlement. No one from the village
was to see us or discover that we were received there. It was
obviously considered a betrayal of sacred customs, worthy of
punishment, to allow strangers, whites, to take part in this.
That indeed had also been the real reason why the other healers
whom we asked had refused to admit us to a leaf ceremony. Strange
birdcalls from the darkness accompanied us on the ascent, and the
barking of dogs was heard on all sides. The dogs had detected the
strangers. The <i>curandera</i> Consuela García, a woman of some
forty years, barefoot like all Indian women in this region,
timidly admitted us to her hut and immediately closed up the
doorway with a heavy bar. She bid us lie down on the bast mats on
the stamped mud floor. As Consuela spoke only Mazatec, Herlinda
translated her instructions into Spanish for us. The <i>curandera</i>
lit a candle on a table covered with some images of saints, along
with a variety of rubbish. Then she began to bustle about busily,
but in silence. All at once we heard peculiar noises and a
rummaging in the room-did the hut harbor some hidden person whose
shape and proportions could not be made out in the candlelight?
Visibly disturbed, Consuela searched the room with the burning
candle. It appeared to be merely rats, however, who were working
their mischief. In a bowl the <i>curandera</i> now kindled <i>copal</i>,
an incense-like resin, which soon filled the whole hut with its
aroma. Then the magic potion was ceremoniously prepared. Consuela
inquired which of us wished to drink of it with her. Gordon
announced himself. Since I was suffering from a severe stomach
upset at the time, I could not join in. My wife substituted for
me. The <i>curandera</i> laid out six pairs of leaves for
herself. She apportioned the same number to Gordon. Anita
received three pairs. Like the mushrooms, the leaves are always
dosed in pairs, a practice that, of course, has a magical
significance. The leaves were crushed with the <i>metate</i>,
then squeezed out through a fine sieve into a cup, and the <i>metate</i>
and the contents of the sieve were rinsed with water. Finally,
the filled cups were incensed over the <i>copal</i> vessel with
much ceremony. Consuela asked Anita and Gordon, before she handed
them their cups, whether they believed in the truth and the
holiness of the ceremony. After they answered in the affirmative
and the very bitter-tasting potion was solemnly imbibed, the
candles were extinguished and, lying in darkness on the bast
masts, we awaited the effects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After some twenty minutes Anita whispered to me
that she saw striking, brightly bordered images. Gordon also
perceived the effect of the drug. The voice of the <i>curandera</i>
sounded from the darkness, half speaking, half singing. Herlinda
translated: Did we believe in Christ's blood and the holiness of
the rites? After our &quot;creemos&quot; (&quot;We
believe&quot;), the ceremonial performance continued. The <i>curandera</i>
lit the candles, moved them from the &quot;altar table&quot; onto
the floor, sang and spoke prayers or magic formulas, placed the
candles again under the images of the saints-then again silence
and darkness. Thereupon the true consultation began. Consuela
asked for our request. Gordon inquired after the health of his
daughter, who immediately before his departure from New York had
to be admitted prematurely to the hospital in expectation of a
baby. He received the comforting information that mother and
child were well. Then again came singing and prayer and
manipulations with the candles on the &quot;altar table&quot; and
on the floor, over the smoking basin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When the ceremony was at an end, the <i>curandera</i>
asked us to rest yet a while longer in prayer on our bast mats.
Suddenly a thunderstorm burst out. Through the cracks of the beam
walls, lightning flashed into the darkness of the hut,
accompanied by violent thunderbolts, while a tropical downpour
raged, beating on the roof. Consuela voiced apprehension that we
would not be able to leave her house unseen in the darkness. But
the thunderstorm let up before daybreak, and we went down the
mountainside to our corrugated iron barracks, as noiselessly as
possible by the light of flashlights, unnoticed by the villagers,
but dogs again barked from all sides. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Participation in this ceremony was the climax of
our expedition. It brought confirmation that the <i>hojas de la
Pastora</i> were used by the Indians for the same purpose and in
the same ceremonial milieu as <i>teonanácatl</i>, the sacred
mushrooms. Now we also had authentic plant material, not only
sufficient for botanical identification, but also for the planned
chemical analysis. The inebriated state that Gordon Wasson and my
wife had experienced with the <i>hojas</i> had been shallow and
only of short duration, yet it had exhibited a distinctly
hallucinogenic character. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the morning after this eventful night we took
leave of San José Tenango. The guide, Guadelupe, and the two
fellows Teodosio and Pedro appeared before our barracks with the
mules at the appointed time. Soon packed up and mounted, our
little troop then moved uphill again, through the fertile
landscape glittering in the sunlight from the night's
thunderstorm. Returning by way of Santiago, toward evening we
reached our last stop in Mazatec country, the capital Huautla de
Jiménez. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From here on, the return trip to Mexico City was
made by automobile. With a final supper in the Posada Rosaura, at
the time the only inn in Huautla, we took leave of our Indian
guides and of the worthy mules that had carried us so
surefootedly and in such a pleasant way through the Sierra
Mazatec. The Indians were paid of, and Teodosio, who also
accepted payment for his chief in Jalapa de Diaz (where the
animals were to be returned afterward), gave a receipt with his
thumbprint colored by a ballpoint pen. We took up quarters in
Dona Herlinda's house. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A day later we made our formal visit to the <i>curandera</i>
María Sabina, a woman made famous by the Wassons' publications.
It had been in her hut that Gordon Wasson became the first white
man to taste of the sacred mushrooms, in the course of a
nocturnal ceremony in the summer of 1955. Gordon and María
Sabina greeted each other cordially, as old friends. The <i>curandera</i>
lived out of the way, on the mountainside above Huautla. The
house in which the historic session with Gordon Wasson had taken
place had been burned, presumably by angered residents or an
envious colleague, because she had divulged the secret of <i>teonanácatl</i>
to strangers. In the new hut in which we found ourselves, an
incredible disorder prevailed, as had probably also prevailed in
the old hut, in which half-naked children, hens, and pigs bustled
about. The old <i>curandera</i> had an intelligent face,
exceptionally changeable in expression. She was obviously
impressed when it was explained that we had managed to confine
the spirit of the mushrooms in pills, and she at once declared
herself ready to &quot; serve us&quot; with these, that is, to
grant us a consultation. It was agreed that this should take
place the coming night in the house of Doña Herlinda. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of the day I took a stroll through
Huautla de Jiménez, which led along a main street on the
mountainside. Then I accompanied Gordon on his visit to the
Instituto Nacional Indigenista. This governmental organization
had the duty of studying and helping to solve the problems of the
indigenous population, that is, the Indians. Its leader told us
of the difficulties that the &quot;coffee policy&quot; had caused
in the area at that time. The president of Huautla, in
collaboration with the Instituto Nacional Indigenista had tried
to eliminate middlemen in order to shape the coffee prices
favorably for the producing Indians. His body was found,
mutilated, the previous June. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our stroll also took us past the cathedral, from
which Gregorian chants resounded. Old Father Aragon, whom Gordon
knew well from his earlier stays, invited us into the vestry for
a glass of tequila.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>A Mushroom Ceremony </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As we returned home to Herlinda's house toward
evening, María Sabina had already arrived there with a large
company, her two lovely daughters, Apolonia and Aurora (two
prospective <i>curandera</i>s), and a niece, all of whom brought
children along with them. Whenever her child began to cry,
Apolonia would offer her breast to it. The old curandero Don
Aurelio also appeared, a mighty man, one-eyed, in a
black-and-white patterned serape (cloak). Cacao and sweet pastry
were served on the veranda. I was reminded of the report from an
ancient chronicle which described how <i>chocolatl</i> was drunk
before the ingestion of <i>teonanácatl</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the fall of darkness, we all proceeded into
the room in which the ceremony would take place. It was then
locked up-that is, the door was obstructed with the only bed
available. Only an emergency exit into the back garden remained
unlatched for absolute necessity. It was nearly midnight when the
ceremony began. Until that time the whole party lay, in darkness
sleeping or awaiting the night's events, on the bast mats spread
on the floor. María Sabina threw a piece of <i>copal</i> on the
embers of a brazier from time to time, whereby the stuffy air in
the crowded room became somewhat bearable. I had explained to the
<i>curandera</i> through Herlinda, who was again with the party
as interpreter, that one pill contained the spirit of two pairs
of mushrooms. (The pills contained 5.0 mg synthetic psilocybin
apiece.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When all was ready, María Sabina apportioned the
pills in pairs among the grown-ups present. After solemn smoking,
she herself took two pairs (corresponding to 20 mg psilocybin).
She gave the same dose to Don Aurelio and her daughter Apolonia,
who would also serve as <i>curandera</i>. Aurora received one
pair, as did Gordon, while my wife and Irmgard got only one pill
each. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the children, a girl of about ten, under the
guidance of María Sabina, had prepared for me the juice of five
pairs of fresh leaves of <i>hojas de la Pastora</i>. I wanted to
experience this drug that I had been unable to try in San José
Tenango. The potion was said to be especially active when
prepared by an innocent child. The cup with the expressed juice
was likewise incensed and conjured by María Sabina and Don
Aurelio, before it was delivered to me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All of these preparations and the following
ceremony progressed in much the same way as the consultation with
the <i>curandera</i> Consuela Garcia in San José Tenango. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the drug was apportioned and the candle on
the &quot;altar&quot; was extinguished, we awaited the effects in
the darkness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before a half hour had elapsed, the <i>curandera</i>
murmured something; her daughter and Don Aurelio also became
restless. Herlinda translated and explained to us what was wrong.
María Sabina had said that the pills lacked the spirit of the
mushrooms. I discussed the situation with Gordon, who lay beside
me. For us it was clear that absorption of the active principle
from the pills, which must first dissolve in the stomach, occurs
more slowly than from the mushrooms, in which some of the active
principle already becomes absorbed through the mucous membranes
during chewing. But how could we give a scientific explanation
under such conditions? Rather than try to explain, we decided to
act. We distributed more pills. Both <i>curandera</i>s and the
curandero each received another pair. They had now each taken a
total dosage of 30 mg psilocybin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After about another quarter of an hour, the spirit
of the pills did begin to yield its effects, which lasted until
the crack of dawn. The daughters, and Don Aurelio with his deep
bass voice, fervently answered the prayers and singing of the <i>curandera</i>.
Blissful, yearning moans of Apolonia and Aurora, between singing
and prayer, gave the impression that the religious experience of
the young women in the drug inebriation was combined with
sensual-sexual feelings. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the middle of the ceremony María Sabina asked
for our request. Gordon inquired again after the health of his
daughter and grandchild. He received the same good information as
from the <i>curandera</i> Consuela. Mother and child were in fact
well when he returned home to New York. Obviously, however, this
still represents no proof of the prophetic abilities of both <i>curandera</i>s.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Evidently as an effect of the <i>hojas</i>, I found
myself for some time in a state of mental sensitivity and intense
experience, which, however, was not accompanied by
hallucinations. Anita, Irmgard, and Gordon experienced a euphoric
condition of inebriation that was influenced by the strange,
mystical atmosphere. My wife was impressed by the vision of very
distinct strange line patterns. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was astonished and perplexed, later, on
discovering precisely the same images in the rich ornamentation
over the altar in an old church near Puebla. That was on the
return trip to Mexico City, when we visited churches from
colonial times. These admirable churches offer great cultural and
historical interest because the Indian artists and workmen who
assisted in their construction smuggled in elements of Indian
style. Klaus Thomas, in his book <i>Die kunstlich gesteuerte
Seele</i> [The artificially steered mind] (Ferdinand Enke Verlag,
Stuttgart, 1970), writes about the possible influence of visions
from psilocybin inebriation on Meso-American Indian art:
&quot;Surely a cultural-historical comparison of the old and new
creations of Indian art . . . must convince the unbiased
spectator of the harmony with the images, forms and colors of a
psilocybin inebriation.&quot; The Mexican character of the
visions seen in my first experience with dried Psilocybe mexicana
mushrooms and the drawing of Li Gelpke after a psilocybin
inebriation could also point to such an association. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As we took leave of María Sabina and her clan at
the crack of dawn, the <i>curandera</i> said that the pills had
the same power as the mushrooms, that there was no difference.
This was a confirmation from the most competent authority, that
the synthetic psilocybin is identical with the natural product.
As a parting gift I let María Sabina have a vial of psilocybin
pills. She radiantly explained to our interpreter Herlinda that
she could now give consultations even in the season when no
mushrooms grow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How should we judge the conduct of María Sabina,
the fact that she allowed strangers, white people, access to the
secret ceremony, and let them try the sacred mushroom? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To her credit it can be said that she had thereby
opened the door to the exploration of the Mexican mushroom cult
in its present form, and to the scientific, botanical, and
chemical investigation of the sacred mushrooms. Valuable active
substances, psilocybin and psilocin, resulted. Without this
assistance, the ancient knowledge and experience that was
concealed in these secret practices would possibly, even
probably, have disappeared without a trace, without having borne
fruit, in the advancement of Western civilization. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From another standpoint, the conduct of this <i>curandera</i>
can be regarded as a profanation of a sacred custom-even as a
betrayal. Some of her countrymen were of this opinion, which was
expressed in acts of revenge, including the burning of her house.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The profanation of the mushroom cult did not stop
with the scientific investigations. The publication about the
magic mushrooms unleashed an invasion of hippies and drug seekers
into the Mazatec country, many of whom behaved badly, some even
criminally. Another undesirable consequence was the beginning of
true tourism in Huautla de Jiménez, whereby the originality of
the place was eradicated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such statements and considerations are, for the
most part, the concern of ethnographical research. Wherever
researchers and scientists trace and elucidate the remains of
ancient customs that are becoming rarer, their primitiveness is
lost. This loss is only more or less counterbalanced when the
outcome of the research represents a lasting cultural gain. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From Huautla de Jiménez we proceeded first to
Teotitlán, in a breakneck truck ride along a half-paved road,
and from there went on a comfortable car trip back to Mexico
City, the starting point of our expedition. I had lost several
kilograms in body weight, but was overwhelmingly compensated in
enchanting experiences. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The herbarium samples of <i>hojas de la Pastora</i>,
which we had brought with us, were subjected to botanical
identification by Carl Epling and Carlos D. Jativa at the
Botanical Institute of Harvard University in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. They found that this plant was a hitherto
undescribed species of <i>Salvia</i>, which was named <i>Salvia</i>
<i>divinorum</i> by these authors. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The chemical investigation of the juice of the
magic sage in the laboratory in Basel was unsuccessful. The
psychoactive principle of this drug seems to be a rather unstable
substance, since the juice prepared in Mexico and preserved with
alcohol proved in self-experiments to be no longer active. Where
the chemical nature of the active principle is concerned, the
problem of the magic plant <i>ska María Pastora</i> still awaits
solution.</p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So far in this book I have mainly described my
scientific work and matters relating to my professional activity.
But this work, by its very nature, had repercussions on my own
life and personality, not least because it brought me into
contact with interesting and important contemporaries. I have
already mentioned some of them&#151;Timothy Leary, Rudolf Gelpke,
Gordon Wasson. Now, in the pages that follow, I would like to
emerge from the natural scientist's reserve, in order to portray
encounters which were personally meaningful to me and which
helped me solve questions posed by the substances I had
discovered. </p>

<h3>7. Radiance from Ernst Jünger </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Radiance</i> is the perfect term to express the
influence that Ernst Jünger's literary work and personality have
had on me. In the light of his perspective, which
stereoscopically comprises the surfaces and depths of things, the
world I knew took on a new, translucent splendor. That happened a
long time before the discovery of LSD and before I came into
personal contact with this author in connection with
hallucinogenic drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My enchantment with Ernst Jünger began with his
book <i>Das Abenteuerliche Herz </i>[The adventurous heart].
Again and again in the last forty years I have taken up this
book. Here more than ever, in themes that weigh more lightly and
lie closer to me than war and a new type of human being (subjects
of Jünger's earlier books), the beauty and magic of Jünger's
prose was opened to me-descriptions of flowers, of dreams, of
solitary walks; thoughts about chance, the future, colors, and
about other themes that have direct relation to our personal
lives. Everywhere in his prose the miracle of creation became
evident, in the precise description of the surfaces and, in
translucence, of the depths; and the uniqueness and the
imperishable in every human being was touched upon. No other
writer has thus opened my eyes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drugs were also mentioned in <i>Das</i> <i>Abenteuerliche
Herz. </i>Many years passed, however, before I myself began to be
especially interested in this subject, after the discovery of the
psychic effects of LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My first correspondence with Ernst Jünger had
nothing to do with the context of drugs; rather I once wrote to
him on his birthday, as a thankful reader. </p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Bottmingen, 29 March 1947 <br>
    Dear Mr. Jünger, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; As one richly endowed by you for years, I
    wished to send a jar of honey to you for your birthday. But I
    did not have this pleasure, because my export license has
    been refused in Bern. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The gift was intended less as a greeting from a
    country in which milk and honey still flow, than as a
    reminiscence of the enchanting sentences in your book <i>Auf
    den Marmorklippen </i>(On the Marble Cliffs), where you speak
    of the &quot;golden bees.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The book mentioned here had appeared in 1939,
just shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Auf den
Marmorklippen is not only a masterpiece of German prose, but also
a work of great significance because in this book the
characteristics of tyrants and the horror of war and nocturnal
bombardment are described prophetically, in poetic vision. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of our correspondence, Ernst Jünger
also inquired about my LSD studies, of which he had learned
through a friend. Thereupon I sent him the pertinent
publications, which he acknowledged with the following comments: </p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Kirchhorst, 3/3/1948 <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; . . . together with both enclosures concerning
    your new phantasticum. It seems indeed that you have entered
    a field that contains so many tempting mysteries. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Your consignment came together with the <i>Confessions
    of an English Opium Eater, </i>that has just been published
    in a new translation. The translator writes me that his
    reading of <i>Das Abenteuerliche Herz </i>stimulated him to
    do his work. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as I am concerned, my practical studies
    in this field are far behind me. These are experiments in
    which one sooner or later embarks on truly dangerous paths,
    and may be considered lucky to escape with only a black eye. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; What interested me above all was the
    relationship of these substances to productivity. It has been
    my experience, however, that creative achievement requires an
    alert consciousness, and that it diminishes under the spell
    of drugs. On the other hand, conceptualization is important,
    and one gains insights under the influence of drugs that
    indeed are not possible otherwise. I consider the beautiful
    essay that Maupassant has written about ether to be such an
    insight. Moreover, I had the impression that in fever one
    also discovers new landscapes, new archipelagos, and a new
    music, that becomes completely distinct when the
    &quot;customs station&quot; [&quot;An der Zollstation&quot;
    [At the custom station], the title heading of a section in <i>Das
    Abenteuerliche Herz </i>(2d ed.) that concerns the transition
    from life to death.] appears. For geographic description, on
    the other hand, one must be fully conscious. What
    productivity means to the artist, healing means to the
    physician. Accordingly, it also may suffice for him that he
    sometimes enters the regions through the tapestries that our
    senses have woven. Moreover, I seem to perceive in our time
    less of a taste for the phantastica than for the
    energetica&#151;amphetamine, which has even been furnished to
    fliers and other soldiers by the armies, belongs to this
    group. Tea is in my opinion a phantasticum, coffee an
    energeticum&#151;tea therefore possesses a disproportionately
    higher artistic rank. I notice that coffee disrupts the
    delicate lattice of light and shadows, the fruitful doubts
    that emerge during the writing of a sentence. One exceeds his
    inhibitions. With tea, on the other hand, the thoughts climb
    genuinely upward. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; So far as my &quot;studies&quot; are concerned,
    I had a manuscript on that topic, but have since burned it.
    My excursions terminated with hashish, that led to very
    pleasant, but also to manic states, to oriental tyranny....</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon afterward, in a letter from Ernst Jünger I
learned that he had inserted a discourse about drugs in the novel
<i>Heliopolis</i>, on which he was then working. He wrote to me
about the drug researcher who figures in the novel: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Among the trips in the geographical and metaphysical
    worlds, which I am attempting to describe there, are those of
    a purely sedentary man, who explores the archipelagos beyond
    the navigable seas, for which he uses drugs as a vehicle. I
    give extracts from his log book. Certainly, I cannot allow
    this Columbus of the inner globe to end well-he dies of a
    poisoning. <i>Avis au lecteur.</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The book that appeared the following year bore the
subtitle <i>Ruckblick auf eine Stadt</i> [Retrospective on a
city], a retrospective on a city of the future, in which
technical apparatus and the weapons of the present time were
developed still further in magic, and in which power struggles
between a demonic technocracy and a conservative force took
place. In the figure of Antonio Peri, Jünger depicted the
mentioned drug researcher, who resided in the ancient city of <i>Heliopolis</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>He captured dreams, just like others appear to chase after
    butterflies with nets. He did not travel to the islands on
    Sundays and holidays and did not frequent the taverns on
    Pagos beach. He locked himself up in his studio for trips
    into the dreamy regions. He said that all countries and
    unknown islands were woven into the tapestry. The drugs
    served him as keys to entry into the chambers and caves of
    this world. In the course of the years he had gained great
    knowledge, and he kept a log book of his excursions. A small
    library adjoined this studio, consisting partly of herbals
    and medicinal reports, partly of works by poets and
    magicians. Antonio tended to read there while the effect of
    the drug itself developed. . . . He went on voyages of
    discovery in the universe of his brain.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the center of this library, which was pillaged
by mercenaries of the provincial governor during the arrest of
Antonio Peri, stood </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The great inspirers of the nineteenth century: De Quincey,
    E.T.A. Hoffmann, Poe, and Baudelaire. Yet there were also
    books from the ancient past: herbals, necromancy texts, and
    demonology of the middle-aged world. They included the names
    Albertus Magnus, Raimundus Lullus, and Agrippa of
    Nettesheym.... Moreover, there was the great folio <i>De
    Praestigiis Daemonum</i> by Wierus, and the very unique
    compilations of Medicus Weckerus, published in Basel in
    1582.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In another part of his collection, Antonio Peri
seemed to have cast his attention principally &quot;on ancient
pharmacology books, formularies and pharmacopoeias, and to have
hunted for reprints of journals and annals. Among others was
found a heavy old volume by the Heidelberg psychologists on the
extract of mescal buttons, and a paper on the phantastica of
ergot by Hofmann-Bottmingen....&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the same year in which <i>Heliopolis</i> came
out, I made the personal acquaintance of the author. I went to
meet Ernst Jünger in Ravensburg, for a Swiss sojourn. On a
wonderful fall journey in southern Switzerland, together with
mutual friends, I experienced the radiant power of his
personality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two years later, at the beginning of February 1951,
came the great adventure, an LSD trip with Ernst Jünger. Since,
up until that moment, there were only reports of LSD experiments
in connection with psychiatric inquiries, this experiment
especially interested me, because this was an opportunity to
observe the effects of LSD on the artistic person, in a
nonmedical milieu. That was still somewhat before Aldous Huxley,
from the same perspective, began to experiment with mescaline,
about which he then reported in his two books <i>The Doors of
Perception</i> and <i>Heaven and Hell.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to have medical aid on hand if necessary,
I invited my friend, the physician and pharmacologist Professor
Heribert Konzett, to participate. The trip took place at 10:00 in
the morning, in the living room of our house in Bottmingen. Since
the reaction of such a highly sensitive man as Ernst Jünger was
not foreseeable, a low dose was chosen for this first experiment
as a precaution, only 0.05 mg. The experiment then, did not lead
into great depths. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The beginning phase was characterized by the
intensification of aesthetic experience. Red-violet roses were of
unknown luminosity and radiated in portentous brightness. The
concerto for flute and harp by Mozart was perceived in its
celestial beauty as heavenly music. In mutual astonishment we
contemplated the haze of smoke that ascended with the ease of
thought from a Japanese incense stick. As the inebriation became
deeper and the conversation ended, we came to fantastic reveries
while we lay in our easy chairs with closed eyes. Ernst Jünger
enjoyed the color display of oriental images: I was on a trip
among Berber tribes in North Africa, saw colored caravans and
lush oases. Heribert Konzett, whose features seemed to me to be
transfigured, Buddha-like, experienced a breath of timelessness,
liberation from the past and the future, blessedness through
being completely here and now. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The return from the altered state of consciousness
was associated with strong sensitivity to cold. Like freezing
travelers, we enveloped ourselves in covers for the landing. The
return to everyday reality was celebrated with a good dinner, in
which Burgundy flowed copiously. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This trip was characterized by the mutuality and
parallelism of our experiences, which were perceived as
profoundly joyful. All three of us had drawn near the gate to an
experience of mystical being; however, it did not open. The dose
we had chosen was too low. In misunderstanding this reason, Ernst
Jünger, who had earlier been thrust into deeper realms by a high
dose of mescaline, remarked: &quot;Compared with the tiger
mescaline, your LSD, is, after all, only a house cat.&quot; After
later experiments with higher doses of LSD, he revised this
estimation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jünger has assimilated the mentioned spectacle of
the incense stick into literature, in his story <i>Besuch auf
Gotenhotm </i>[Visit to Godenholm], in which deeper experiences
of drug inebriation also play a part: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Schwarzenberg burned an incense stick, as he sometimes
    did, to clear the air. A blue plume ascended from the tip of
    the stick. Moltner looked at it first with astonishment, then
    with delight, as if a new power of the eyes had come to him.
    It revealed itself in the play of this fragrant smoke, which
    ascended from the slender stick and then branched out into a
    delicate crown. It was as if his imagination had created it-a
    pallid web of sea lilies in the depths, that scarcely
    trembled from the beat of the surf. Time was active in this
    creation-it had circled it, whirled about it, wreathed it, as
    if imaginary coins rapidly piled up one on top of another.
    The abundance of space revealed itself in the fiber work, the
    nerves, which stretched and unfolded in the height, in a vast
    number of filaments. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now a breath of air affected the vision, and
    softly twisted it about the shaft like a dancer. Moltner
    uttered a shout of surprise. The beams and lattices of the
    wondrous flower wheeled around in new planes, in new fields.
    Myriads of molecules observed the harmony. Here the laws no
    longer acted under the veil of appearance; matter was so
    delicate and weightless that it clearly reflected them. How
    simple and cogent everything was. The numbers, masses and
    weights stood out from matter. They cast off the raiments. No
    goddess could inform the initiates more boldly and freely.
    The pyramids with their weight did not reach up to this
    revelation. That was Pythagorean luster. No spectacle had
    ever affected him with such a magic spell. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This deepened experience in the aesthetic sphere,
as it is described here in the example of contemplation of a haze
of blue smoke, is typical of the beginning phase of LSD
inebriation, before deeper alterations of conscious begin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I visited Ernst Jünger occasionally in the
following years, in Wilfingen, Germany, where he had moved from
Ravensburg; or we met in Switzerland, at my place in Bottmingen,
or in Bundnerland in southeastern Switzerland. Through the shared
LSD experience our relations had deepened. Drugs and problems
connected with them constituted a major subject of our
conversation and correspondence, without our having made further
practical experiments in the meantime. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We exchanged literature about drugs. Ernst Jünger
thus let me have for my drug library the rare, valuable monograph
of Dr. Ernst Freiherrn von Bibra, <i>Die Narkotischen
Genussmittel und der Mensch </i>[Narcotic pleasure drugs and man]
printed in Nuremburg in 1855. This book is a pioneering, standard
work of drug literature, a source of the first order, above all
as relates to the history of drugs. What von Bibra embraces under
the designation &quot;Narkotischen Genussmittel&quot; are not
only substances like opium and thorn apple, but also coffee,
tobacco, kat, which do not fall under the present conception of
narcotics, any more than do drugs such as coca, fly agaric, and
hashish, which he also described. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Noteworthy, and today still as topical as at the
time, are the general opinions about drugs that von Bibra
contrived more than a century ago: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The individual who has taken too much hashish, and then
    runs frantically about in the streets and attacks everyone
    who confronts him, sinks into insignificance beside the
    numbers of those who after mealtime pass calm and happy hours
    with a moderate dose; and the number of those who are able to
    overcome the heaviest exertions through coca, yes, who were
    possibly rescued from death by starvation through coca, by
    far exceed the few <i>coqueros</i> who have undermined their
    health by immoderate use. In the same manner, only a
    misplaced hypocrisy can condemn the vinous cup of old father
    Noah, because individual drunkards do not know how to observe
    limit and moderation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From time to time I advised Ernst Jünger about
actual and entertaining events in the field of inebriating drugs,
as in my letter of September 1955: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . Last week the first 200 grams of a new drug arrived,
    whose investigation I wish to take up. It involves the seeds
    of a mimosa (<i>Piptadenia peregrina </i>Benth,) that is used
    as a stimulating intoxicant by the Indians of the Orinoco.
    The seeds are ground, fermented, and then mixed with the
    powder of burned snail shells. This powder is sniffed by the
    Indians with the help of a hollow, forked bird bone, as
    already reported by Alexander von Humboldt in <i>Reise nach
    den Aequinoctiat-Gegenden des Neuen Kontinents </i>[Voyage to
    the equinoctial regions of the new continent] (Book 8,
    Chapter 24). The warlike tribe, the Otomaco, especially use
    this drug, called <i>niopo, yupa, nopo</i> or <i>cojoba</i>,
    to an extensive degree, even today. It is reported in the
    monograph by P. J. Gumilla, S. J. <i>(El Orinoco Ilustrado, </i>1741):
    &quot;The Otomacos sniffed the powder before they went to
    battle with the Caribes, for in earlier times there existed
    savage wars between these tribes.... This drug robs them
    completely of reason, and they frantically seize their
    weapons. And if the women were not so adept at holding them
    back and binding them fast, they would daily cause horrible
    devastation. It is a terrible vice.... Other benign and
    docile tribes that also sniff the <i>yupa</i>, do not get
    into such a fury as the Otomacos, who through self-injury
    with this agent made themselves completely cruel before
    combat, and marched into battle with savage fury.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I am curious how <i>niopo</i> would act on
    people like us. Should a <i>niopo</i> session one day come to
    pass, then we should on no account send our wives away, as on
    that early spring reverie [The LSD trip of February 1951 is
    meant here.], that they may bind us fast if necessary.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chemical analysis of this drug led to isolation of
active principles that, like the ergot alkaloids and psilocybin,
belong to the group of indole alkaloids, but which were already
described in the technical literature, and were therefore not
investigated further in the Sandoz laboratories. [Translator's
note: The active principles of <i>niopo</i> are DMT
(N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and its congeners. DMT was first
prepared in 1931 by Manske.] The fantastic effects described
above appeared to occur only with the particular manner of use as
snuff powder, and also seemed to be related, in all probability,
to the psychic structure of the Indian tribes concerned.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Ambivalence of Drug Use </h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fundamental questions of drug problems were dealt
with in the following correspondence. <br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Bottmingen, 16 December 1961 <br>
    Dear Mr. Jünger, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; On the one hand, I would have the great desire,
    besides the natural-scientific, chemical-pharmacological
    investigation of hallucinogenic substances, also to research
    their use as magic drugs in other regions.... On the other
    hand, I must admit that the fundamental question very much
    occupies me, whether the use of these types of drugs, namely
    of substances that so deeply affect our minds, could not
    indeed represent a forbidden transgression of limits. As long
    as any means or methods are used, which provide only an
    additional, newer aspect of reality, surely there is nothing
    to object to in such means; on the contrary, the experience
    and the knowledge of further facets of <i>the </i>reality
    only makes this reality ever more real to us. The question
    exists, however, whether the deeply affecting drugs under
    discussion here will in fact only open an additional window
    for our senses and perceptions, or whether the spectator
    himself, the core of his being, undergoes alterations. The
    latter would signify that something is altered that in my
    opinion should always remain intact. My concern is addressed
    to the question, whether the innermost core of our being is
    actually unimpeachable, and cannot become damaged by whatever
    happens in its material, physical-chemical, biological and
    psychic shells-or whether matter in the form of these drugs
    displays a potency that has the ability to attack the
    spiritual center of the personality, the self. The latter
    would have to be explained by the fact that the effect of
    magic drugs happens at the borderline where mind and matter
    merge-that these magic substances are themselves cracks in
    the infinite realm of matter, in which the depth of matter,
    its relationship with the mind, becomes particularly obvious.
    This could be expressed by a modification of the familiar
    words of Goethe: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Were the eye not sunny, <br>
        It could never behold the sun; <br>
        If the power of the mind were not in matter, <br>
        How could matter disturb the mind.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This would correspond to cracks which the
    radioactive substances constitute in the periodic system of
    the elements, where the transition of matter into energy
    becomes manifest. Indeed, one must ask whether the production
    of atomic energy likewise represents a transgression of
    forbidden limits. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A further disquieting thought, which follows
    from the possibility of influencing the highest intellectual
    functions by traces of a substance, concerns free will. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The highly active psychotropic substances like
    LSD and psilocybin possess in their chemical structure a very
    close relationship with substances inherent in the body,
    which are found in the central nervous system and play an
    important role in the regulation of its functions. It is
    therefore conceivable that through some disturbance in the
    metabolism of the normal neurotransmitters, a compound like
    LSD or psilocybin is formed, which can determine and alter
    the character of the individual, his world view and his
    behavior. A trace of a substance, whose production or
    nonproduction we cannot control with our wills, has the power
    to shape our destiny. Such biochemical considerations could
    have led to the sentence that Gottfried Benn quoted in his
    essay &quot;Provoziertes Leben&quot; [Provoked life]:
    &quot;God is a substance, a drug!&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, it is well known that
    substances like adrenaline, for example, are formed or set
    free in our organism by thoughts and emotions, which for
    their part determine the functions of the nervous system. One
    may therefore suppose that our material organism is
    susceptible to and shaped by our mind, in the same way that
    our intellectual essence is shaped by our biochemistry. Which
    came first can indeed no better be determined than the
    question, whether the chicken came before the egg. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In spite of my uncertainty with regard to the
    fundamental dangers that could lie in the use of
    hallucinogenic substances, I have continued investigations on
    the active principles of the Mexican magic morning glories,
    of which I wrote you briefly once before. In the seeds of
    this morning glory, that were called <i>ololiuhqui </i>by the
    ancient Aztecs, we found as active principles lysergic acid
    derivatives chemically very closely related to LSD. That was
    an almost unbelievable finding. I have all along had a
    particular love for the morning glories. They were the first
    flowers that I grew myself in my little child's garden. Their
    blue and red cups belong to the first memories of my
    childhood. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I recently read in a book by D. T. Suzuki, <i>Zen
    and Japanese Culture,</i> that the morning glory plays a
    great role in Japan, among the flower lovers, in literature,
    and in graphic arts. Its fleeting splendor has given the
    Japanese imagination rich stimulus. Among others, Suzuki
    quotes a three- line poem of the poetess Chiyo (1702-75), who
    one morning went to fetch water from a neighbor's house,
    because . . . </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;My trough is captivated <br>
        by a morning glory blossom, <br>
        So I ask after water.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The morning glory thus shows both possible ways
    of influencing the mind-body-essence of man: in Mexico it
    exerts its effects in a chemical way as a magic drug, while
    in Japan it acts from the spiritual side, through the beauty
    of its flower cups. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Wilflingen, 17 December 1961<br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann,<br>
    I give you my thanks for your detailed letter of 16 December.
    I have reflected on your central question, and may probably
    become occupied with it on the occasion of the revision of <i>An
    der Zeitmauer</i> [At the wall of time]. There I intimated
    that, in the field of physics as well as in the field of
    biology, we are beginning to develop procedures that are no
    longer to be understood as advances in the established sense,
    but that rather intervene in evolution and lead forth in the
    development of the species. Certainly I turn the glove inside
    out, for I suppose that it is a new world age, which begins
    to act evolutionarily on the prototypes. Our science with its
    theories and discoveries is therefore not the cause, rather
    one of the consequences of evolution, among others. Animals,
    plants, the atmosphere and the surfaces of planets will be
    concerned simultaneously. We do not progress from point to
    point, rather we cross over a line. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The risk that you indicated is well to be
    considered. However, it exists in every aspect of our
    existence. The common denominator appears now here, now
    there. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In mentioning radioactivity, you use the word <i>crack.</i>
    Cracks are not merely points of discovery, but also points of
    destruction. Compared to the effects of radiation, those of
    the magical drugs are more genuine and much less rough. In
    classical manner they lead us beyond the humane. Gurdjieff
    has already seen that to some extent. Wine has already
    changed much, has brought new gods and a new humanity with
    it. But wine is to the new substances as classical physics is
    to modern physics. These things should only be tried in small
    circles. I cannot agree with the thoughts of Huxley, that
    possibilities for transcendence could here be given to the
    masses. Indeed, this does not involve comforting fictions,
    but rather realities, if we take the matter earnestly. And
    few contacts will suffice here for the setting of courses and
    guidance. It also transcends theology and belongs in the
    chapter of theogony, as it necessarily entails entry into a
    new house, in the astrological sense. At first, one can be
    satisfied with this insight, and should above all be cautious
    with the designations. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Heartfelt thanks also for the beautiful picture
    of the blue morning glory. It appears to be the same that I
    cultivate year after year in my garden. I did not know that
    it possesses specific powers; however, that is probably the
    case with every plant. We do not know the key to most.
    Besides this, there must be a central viewpoint from which
    not only the chemistry, the structure, the color, but rather
    all attributes become significant....</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>An Experiment with Psilocybin </h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such theoretical discussions about the magic drugs
were supplemented by practical experiments. One such experiment,
which served as a comparison between LSD and psilocybin, took
place in the spring of 1962. The proper occasion for it presented
itself at the home of the Jüngers, in the former head forester's
house of Stauffenberg's Castle in Wilflingen. My friends, the
pharmacologist Professor Heribert Konzett and the Islamic scholar
Dr. Rudolf Gelpke, also took part in this mushroom symposium. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The old chronicles described how the Aztecs drank <i>chocolatl</i>
before they ate <i>teonanácatl</i>. Thus Mrs. Liselotte Jünger
likewise served us hot chocolate, to set the mood. Then she
abandoned the four men to their fate. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had gathered in a fashionable living room, with
a dark wooden ceiling, white tile stove, period furniture, old
French engravings on the walls, a gorgeous bouquet of tulips on
the table. Ernst Jünger wore a long, broad, dark blue striped
kaftan-like garment that he had brought from Egypt; Heribert
Konzett was resplendent in a brightly embroidered mandarin gown;
Rudolf Gelpke and I had put on housecoats. The everyday reality
should be laid aside, along with everyday clothing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly before sundown we took the drug, not the
mushrooms, but rather their active principle, 20 mg psilocybin
each. That corresponded to some two-thirds of the very strong
dose that was taken by the curandera Maria Sabina in the form of
Psilocybe mushrooms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After an hour I still noticed no effect, while my
companions were already very deeply into the trip. I had come
with the hope that in the mushroom inebriation I could manage to
allow certain images from euphoric moments of my childhood, which
remained in my memory as blissful experiences, to come alive: a
meadow covered with chrysanthemums lightly stirred by the early
summer wind; the rosebush in the evening light after a rain
storm; the blue irises hanging over the vineyard wall. Instead of
these bright images from my childhood home, strange scenery
emerged, when the mushroom factor finally began to act. Half
stupefied, I sank deeper, passed through totally deserted cities
with a Mexican type of exotic, yet dead splendor. Terrified, I
tried to detain myself on the surface, to concentrate alertly on
the outer world, on the surroundings. For a time I succeeded. I
then observed Ernst Jünger, colossal in the room, pacing back
and forth, a powerful, mighty magician. Heribert Konzett in the
silky lustrous housecoat seemed to be a dangerous, Chinese clown.
Even Rudolf Gelpke appeared sinister to me; long, thin,
mysterious. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the increasing depth of inebriation,
everything became yet stranger. I even felt strange to myself.
Weird, cold, foolish, deserted, in a dull light, were the places
I traversed when I closed my eyes. Emptied of all meaning, the
environment also seemed ghostlike to me whenever I opened my eyes
and tried to cling to the outer world. The total emptiness
threatened to drag me down into absolute nothingness. I remember
how I seized Rudolf Gelpke's arm as he passed by my chair, and
held myself to him, in order not to sink into dark nothingness.
Fear of death seized me, and illimitable longing to return to the
living creation, to the reality of the world of men. After
timeless fear I slowly returned to the room . I saw and heard the
great magician lecturing uninterruptedly with a clear, loud
voice, about Schopenhauer, Kant, Hegel, and speaking about the
old Gäa, the beloved little mother. Heribert Konzett and Rudolf
Gelpke were already completely on the earth again, while I could
only regain my footing with great effort. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me this entry into the mushroom world had been
a test, a confrontation with a dead world and with the void. The
experiment had developed differently from what I had expected.
Nevertheless, the encounter with the void can also be appraised
as a gain. Then the existence of the creation appears so much
more wondrous. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Midnight had passed, as we sat together at the
table that the mistress of the house had set in the upper story.
We celebrated the return with an exquisite repast and with
Mozart's music. The conversation, during which we exchanged our
experiences, lasted almost until morning. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ernst Jünger has described how he had experienced
this trip, in his book Annähenngen&#151;Drogen und Rausch
[Approaches-drugs and inebriation] (published by Ernst Klett
Verlag, Stuttgart, 1970), in the section &quot;Ein
Pilz-Symposium&quot; [A mushroom symposium]. The following is an
extract from the work: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As usual, a half hour or a little more passed in silence.
    Then came the first signs: the flowers on the table began to
    flare up and sent out flashes. It was time for leaving work;
    outside the streets were being cleaned, like on every
    weekend. The brush strokes invaded the silence painfully.
    This shuffling and brushing, now and again also a scraping,
    pounding, rumbling, and hammering, has random causes and is
    also symptomatic, like one of the signs that announces an
    illness. Again and again it also plays a role in the history
    of magic practices. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; By this time the mushroom began to act; the
    spring bouquet glowed darker. That was no natural light. The
    shadows stirred in the corners, as if they sought form. I
    became uneasy, even chilled, despite the heat that emanated
    from the tiles. I stretched myself on the sofa, drew the
    covers over my head. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Everything became skin and was touched, even
    the retina-there the contact was light. This light was
    multicolored; it arranged itself in strings, which gently
    swung back and forth; in strings of glass beads of oriental
    doorways. They formed doors, like those one passes through in
    a dream, curtains of lust and danger. The wind stirred them
    like a garment. They also fell down from the belts of
    dancers, opened and closed themselves with the swing of the
    hips, and from the beads a rippling of the most delicate
    sounds fluttered to the heightened senses. The chime of the
    silver rings on the ankles and wrists is already too loud. It
    smells of sweat, blood, tobacco, chopped horse hairs, cheap
    rose essence. Who knows what is going on in the stables? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It must be an immense palace, Mauritanian, not
    a good place. At this ballroom flights of adjoining rooms
    lead into the lower stratum. And everywhere the curtains with
    their glitter, their sparkling, radioactive glow. Moreover,
    the rippling of glassy instruments with their beckoning,
    their wooing solicitation: &quot; Will you go with me,
    beautiful boy?&quot; Now it ceased, now it repeated, more
    importunate, more intrusive, almost already assured of
    agreement. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now came forms-historical collages, the <i>vox
    humana,</i> the call of the cuckoo. Was it the whore of Santa
    Lucia, who stuck her breasts out of the window? Then the play
    was ruined. Salome danced; the amber necklace emitted sparks
    and made the nipples erect. What would one not do for one's
    Johannes? [Translator's note: &quot;Johannes&quot; here is
    slang for penis, as in English &quot;Dick&quot; or
    &quot;Peter.&quot;] -damned, that was a disgusting obscenity,
    which did not come from me, but was whispered through the
    curtain. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The snakes were dirty, scarcely alive, they
    wallowed sluggishly over the floor mats. They were garnished
    with brilliant shards. Others looked up from the floor with
    red and green eyes. It glistened and whispered, hissed and
    sparkled like diminutive sickles at the sacred harvest. Then
    it quieted, and came anew, more faintly, more forward. They
    had me in their hand. &quot;There we immediately understood
    ourselves.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Madam came through the curtain: she was busy,
    passed by me without noticing me. I saw the boots with the
    red heels. Garters constricted the thick thighs in the
    middle, the flesh bulged out there. The enormous breasts, the
    dark delta of the Amazon, parrots, piranhas, semiprecious
    stones everywhere. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now she went into the kitchen-or are there
    still cellars here? The sparkling and whispering, the hissing
    and twinkling could no longer be differentiated; it seemed to
    become concentrated, now proudly rejoicing, full of hope. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It became hot and intolerable; I threw the
    covers off. The room was faintly illuminated; the
    pharmacologist stood at the window in the white mandarin
    frock, which had served me shortly before in Rottweil at the
    carnival. The orientalist sat beside the tile stove; he
    moaned as if he had a nightmare. I understood; it had been a
    first round, and it would soon start again. The time was not
    yet up. I had already seen the beloved little mother under
    other circumstances. But even excrement is earth, belongs
    like gold to transformed matter. One must come to terms with
    it, without getting too close. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; These were the earthy mushrooms. More light was
    hidden in the dark grain that burst from the ear, more yet in
    the green juice of the succulents on the glowing slopes of
    Mexico. . . . [Translator's note: Jünger is referring to
    LSD, a derivative of ergot, and mescaline, derived from the
    Mexican peyotl cactus.] <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The trip had run awry&#151;possibly I should
    address the mushrooms once more. Yet indeed the whispering
    returned, the flashing and sparkling&#151;the bait pulled the
    fish close behind itself. Once the motif is given, then it
    engraves itself, like on a roller each new beginning, each
    new revolution repeats the melody. The game did not get
    beyond this kind of dreariness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know how often this was repeated, and
    prefer not to dwell upon it. Also, there are things which one
    would rather keep to oneself. In any case, midnight was
    past.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We went upstairs; the table was set. The senses
    were still heightened and the Doors of Perception were
    opened. The light undulated from the red wine in the carafe;
    a froth surged at the brim. We listened to a flute concerto.
    It had not turned out better for the others: How beautiful,
    to be back among men.&quot; Thus Albert Hofmann. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The orientalist on the other hand had been in
Samarkand, where Timur rests in a coffin of nephrite. He had
followed the victorious march through cities, whose dowry on
entry was a cauldron filled with eyes. There he had long stood
before one of the skull pyramids that terrible Timur had erected,
and in the multitude of severed heads had perceived even his own.
It was encrusted with stones. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A light dawned on the pharmacologist when he heard this:
    Now I know why you were sitting in the armchair without your
    head-I was astonished; I knew I wasn't dreaming. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder whether I should not strike out this
    detail since it borders on the area of ghost stories. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mushroom substance had carried all four of us
off, not into luminous heights, rather into deeper regions. It
seems that the psilocybin inebriation is more darkly colored in
the majority of cases than the inebriation produced by LSD. The
influence of these two active substances is sure to differ from
one individual to another. Personally, for me, there was more
light in the LSD experiments than in the experiments with the
earthy mushroom, just as Ernst Jünger remarks in the preceding
report.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Another LSD Session </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The next and last thrust into the inner universe
together with Ernst Jünger, this time again using LSD, led us
very far from everyday consciousness. We came close to the
ultimate door. Of course this door, according to Ernst Jünger,
will in fact only open for us in the great transition from life
into the hereafter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This last joint experiment occurred in February
1970, again at the head forester's house in Wilflingen. In this
case there were only the two of us. Ernst Jünger took 0.15 mg
LSD, I took 0.10 mg. Ernst Jünger has published without
commentary the log book, the notes he made during the experiment,
in <i>Approaches,</i> in the section &quot;Nochmals LSD&quot;
[LSD once again]. They are scanty and tell the reader little,
just like my own records. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The experiment lasted from morning just after
breakfast until darkness fell. At the beginning of the trip, we
again listened to the concerto for flute and harp by Mozart,
which always made me especially happy, but this time, strange to
say, seemed to me like the turning of porcelain figures. Then the
intoxication led quickly into wordless depths. When I wanted to
describe the perplexing alterations of consciousness to Ernst
Jünger, no more than two or three words came out, for they
sounded so false, so unable to express the experience; they
seemed to originate from an infinitely distant world that had
become strange; I abandoned the attempt, laughing hopelessly.
Obviously, Ernst Jünger had the same experience, yet we did not
need speech; a glance sufficed for the deepest understanding. I
could, however, put some scraps of sentences on paper, such as at
the beginning: &quot;Our boat tosses violently.&quot; Later, upon
regarding expensively bound books in the library: &quot;Like
red-gold pushed from within to without-exuding golden
luster.&quot; Outside it began to snow. Masked children marched
past and carts with carnival revelers passed by in the streets.
With a glance through the window into the garden, in which snow
patches lay, many-colored masks appeared over the high walls
bordering it, embedded in an infinitely joyful shade of blue:
&quot;A Breughel garden&#151;I live <i>with </i>and <i>in</i> the
objects.&quot; Later: &quot;At present&#151;no connection with
the everyday world.&quot; Toward the end, deep, comforting
insight expressed: &quot;Hitherto confirmed on my path.&quot;
This time LSD had led to a blessed approach. </p>

<h3>8. Meeting with Aldous Huxley </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the mid-1950s, two books by Aldous Huxley
appeared, <i>The Doors of Perception </i>and <i>Heaven and Hell, </i>dealing
with inebriated states produced by hallucinogenic drugs. The
alterations of sensory perceptions and consciousness, which the
author experienced in a self-experiment with mescaline, are
skillfully described in these books. The mescaline experiment was
a visionary experience for Huxley. He saw objects in a new light;
they disclosed their inherent, deep, timeless existence, which
remains hidden from everyday sight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These two books contained fundamental observations
on the essence of visionary experience and about the significance
of this manner of comprehending the world&#151;in cultural
history, in the creation of myths, in the origin of religions,
and in the creative process out of which works of art arise.
Huxley saw the value of hallucinogenic drugs in that they give
people who lack the gift of spontaneous visionary perception
belonging to mystics, saints, and great artists, the potential to
experience this extraordinary state of consciousness, and thereby
to attain insight into the spiritual world of these great
creators. Hallucinogens could lead to a deepened understanding of
religious and mystical content, and to a new and fresh experience
of the great works of art. For Huxley these drugs were keys
capable of opening new doors of perception; chemical keys, in
addition to other proven but laborious &quot; door openers&quot;
to the visionary world like meditation, isolation, and fasting,
or like certain yoga practices. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the time I already knew the earlier work of this
great writer and thinker, books that meant much to me, like <i>Point
Counter Point, Brave New World, After Many a Summer, Eyeless in
Gaza,</i> and a few others. In <i>The Doors of Perception </i>and
<i>Heaven and Hell,</i> Huxley's newly-published works, I found a
meaningful exposition of the experience induced by hallucinogenic
drugs, and I thereby gained a deepened insight into my own LSD
experiments. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was therefore delighted when I received a
telephone call from Aldous Huxley in the laboratory one morning
in August 1961. He was passing through Zurich with his wife. He
invited me and my wife to lunch in the Hotel Sonnenberg. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A gentleman with a yellow freesia in his
buttonhole, a tall and noble appearance, who exuded
kindness&#151;this is the image I retained from this first
meeting with Aldous Huxley. The table conversation revolved
mainly around the problem of magic drugs. Both Huxley and his
wife, Laura Archera Huxley, had also experimented with LSD and
psilocybin. Huxley would have preferred not to designate these
two substances and mescaline as &quot;drugs,&quot; because in
English usage, as also by the way with <i>Droge</i> in German,
that word has a pejorative connotation, and because it was
important to differentiate the hallucinogens from the other
drugs, even linguistically. He believed in the great importance
of agents producing visionary experience in the modern phase of
human evolution. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He considered experiments under laboratory
conditions to be insignificant, since in the extraordinarily
intensified susceptibility and sensitivity to external
impressions, the surroundings are of decisive importance. He
recommended to my wife, when we spoke of her native place in the
mountains, that she take LSD in an alpine meadow and then look
into the blue cup of a gentian flower, to behold the wonder of
creation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As we parted, Aldous Huxley gave me, as a
remembrance of this meeting, a tape recording of his lecture
&quot;Visionary Experience,&quot; which he had delivered the week
before at an international congress on applied psychology in
Copenhagen. In this lecture, Aldous Huxley spoke about the
meaning and essence of visionary experience and compared this
type of world view to the verbal and intellectual comprehension
of reality as its essential complement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the following year, the newest and last book by
Aldous Huxley appeared, the novel <i>Island.</i> This story, set
on the utopian island Pala, is an attempt to blend the
achievements of natural science and technical civilization with
the wisdom of Eastern thought, to achieve a new culture in which
rationalism and mysticism are fruitfully united. The <i>moksha </i>medicine,
a magical drug prepared from a mushroom, plays a significant role
in the life of the population of Pala (moksha is Sanskrit for
&quot;release,&quot; &quot;liberation&quot;). The drug could be
used only in critical periods of life. The young men on Pala
received it in initiation rites, it is dispensed to the
protagonist of the novel during a life crisis, in the scope of a
psychotherapeutic dialogue with a spiritual friend, and it helps
the dying to relinquish the mortal body, in the transition to
another existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In our conversation in Zurich, I had already
learned from Aldous Huxley that he would again treat the problem
of psychedelic drugs in his forthcoming novel. Now he sent me a
copy of <i>Island,</i> inscribed &quot;To Dr. Albert Hofmann, the
original discoverer of the <i>moksha </i>medicine, from Aldous
Huxley.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hopes that Aldous Huxley placed in psychedelic
drugs as a means of evoking visionary experience, and the uses of
these substances in everyday life, are subjects of a letter of 29
February 1962, in which he wrote me: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . I have good hopes that this and similar work will

&nbsp; &nbsp; Aldous Huxley and I were together often at the
annual convention of the World Academy of Arts and Sciences
(WAAS) in Stockholm during late summer 1963. His suggestions and
contributions to discussions at the sessions of the academy,
through their form and importance, had a great influence on the
proceedings. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; WAAS had been established in order to allow the
most competent specialists to consider world problems in a forum
free of ideological and religious restrictions and from an
international viewpoint encompassing the whole world. The
results: proposals, and thoughts in the form of appropriate
publications, were to be placed at the disposal of the
responsible governments and executive organizations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 1963 meeting of WAAS had dealt with the
population explosion and the raw material reserves and food
resources of the earth. The corresponding studies and proposals
were collected in Volume II of WAAS under the title <i>The
Population Crisis and the Use of World Resources.</i> A decade
before birth control, environmental protection, and the energy
crisis became catchwords, these world problems were examined
there from the most serious point of view, and proposals for
their solution were made to governments and responsible
organizations. The catastrophic events since that time in the
aforementioned fields makes evident the tragic discrepancy
between recognition, desire, and feasibility. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aldous Huxley made the proposal, as a continuation
and complement of the theme &quot;World Resources&quot; at the
Stockholm convention, to address the problem &quot;Human
Resources,&quot; the exploration and application of capabilities
hidden in humans yet unused. A human race with more highly
developed spiritual capacities, with expanded consciousness of
the depth and the incomprehensible wonder of being, would also
have greater understanding of and better consideration for the
biological and material foundations of life on this earth. Above
all, for Western people with their hypertrophied rationality, the
development and expansion of a direct, emotional experience of
reality, unobstructed by words and concepts, would be of
evolutionary significance. Huxley considered psychedelic drugs to
be one means to achieve education in this direction. The
psychiatrist Dr. Humphry Osmond, likewise participating in the
congress, who had created the term <i>psychedelic </i>(mind-expanding),
assisted him with a report about significant possibilities of the
use of hallucinogens. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The convention in Stockholm in 1963 was my last
meeting with Aldous Huxley. His physical appearance was already
marked by a severe illness; his intellectual personage, however,
still bore the undiminished signs of a comprehensive knowledge of
the heights and depths of the inner and outer world of man, which
he had displayed with so much genius, love, goodness, and humor
in his literary work. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aldous Huxley died on 22 November of the same year,
on the same day President Kennedy was assassinated. From Laura
Huxley I obtained a copy of her letter to Julian and Juliette
Huxley, in which she reported to her brother- and sister-in-law
about her husband's last day. The doctors had prepared her for a
dramatic end, because the terminal phase of cancer of the throat,
from which Aldous Huxley suffered, is usually accompanied by
convulsions and choking fits. He died serenely and peacefully,
however. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the morning, when he was already so weak that he
could no longer speak, he had written on a sheet of paper:
&quot;LSD&#151;try it&#151;intramuscular&#151;100 mmg.&quot; Mrs.
Huxley understood what was meant by this, and ignoring the
misgivings of the attending physician, she gave him, with her own
hand, the desired injection-she let him have the moksha medicine.

<h3>9. Correspondence with the Poet-Physician Walter Vogt </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My friendship with the physician, psychiatrist, and
writer Walter Vogt, M.D., is also among the personal contacts
that I owe to LSD. As the following extract from our
correspondence shows, it was less the medicinal aspects of LSD,
important to the physician, than the consciousness-altering
effects on the depth of the psyche, of interest to the writer,
that constituted the theme of our correspondence. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Muri/Bern, 22 November 1970 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Last night I dreamed that I was invited to tea
    in a cafe by a friendly family in Rome. This family also knew
    the pope, and so the pope sat at&#151;the same table to tea
    with us. He was all in white and also wore a white miter. He
    sat there so handsome and was silent. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And today I suddenly had the idea of sending
    you my <i>Vogel auf dem Tisch </i>[Bird on the table&#151;as
    a visiting card if you so wish&#151;a book that remained a
    little apocryphal, which upon reflection I do not regret,
    although the Italian translator is firmly convinced that is
    my best. (Ah yes, the pope is also an Italian. So it goes.
    &#133;) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Possibly this little work will interest you. It
    was written in 1966 by an author who at that time still had
    not had any shred of experience with psychedelic substances
    and who read the reports about medicinal experiments with
    these drugs devoid of understanding. However, little has
    changed since, except that now the misgiving comes from the
    other side. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose that your discovery has caused a
    hiatus (not directly a Saul-to-Paul conversion as Roland
    Fischer says&#133;) in my work (also a large word) - and
    indeed, that which I have written since has become rather
    realistic or at least less expressive. In any case I could
    not have brought off the cool realism of my TV piece
    &quot;Spiele der Macht&quot; [Games of power] without it. The
    different drafts attest it, in case they are still lying
    around somewhere. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Should you have interest and time for a
    meeting, it would delight me very much to visit you sometime
    for a conversation. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; W. V. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Burg, i.L. 28
    November 1970 <br>
    Dear Mr. Vogt, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; If the bird that alighted on my table was able
    to find its way to me, this is one more debt I owe to the
    magical effect of LSD. I could soon write a book about all of
    the results that derive from that experiment in 1943.... <br>

    Muri/Bern, 13 March 1971 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Enclosed is a critique of Jünger's <i>Annahenngen</i>
    [Approaches], from the daily paper, that will presumably
    interest you.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems to me that to hallucinate&#151;to
    dream&#151;to write, stands at all times in contrast to
    everyday consciousness, and their functions are
    complementary. Here I can naturally speak only for myself.
    This could be different with others&#151;it is also truly
    difficult to speak with others about such things, because
    people often speak altogether different languages.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; However, since you are now gathering
    autographs, and do me the honor of incorporating some of my
    letters in your collection, I enclose for you the manuscript
    of my &quot;testament&quot;&#151;in which your discovery
    plays a role as &quot;the only joyous invention of the
    twentieth century....&quot; <br>

    Muri/Bern, 5 September 1971 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the weekend at Murtensee [On that Sunday,
    I (A. H.) hovered over the Murtensee in the balloon of my
    friend E. I., who had taken me along as passenger.] I often
    thought of you&#151;a most radiant autumn day. Yesterday,
    Saturday, thanks to one tablet of aspirin (on account of a
    headache or mild flu), I experienced a very comical
    flashback, like with mescaline (of which I have had only a
    little, exactly once).... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I have read a delightful essay by Wasson about
    mushrooms; he divides mankind into mycophobes and
    mycophiles.... Lovely fly agarics must now be growing in the
    forest near you. Sometime shouldn't we sample some? <br>

    balloon: I finally wrote some notes about our visit in
    Villars-sur-Ollons (with Dr. Leary), then a hippie-bark went
    by on the lake, self-made like from a Fellini film, which I
    sketched, and over and above it I drew your balloon. <br>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Burg i.L., 19 May 1973 <br>
    Dear Mr. Vogt, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I have already read your lay sermon three
    times, the description and interpretation of your Sinai Trip.
    [Walter Vogt: <i>Mein Sinai Trip. Eine Laienpredigt</i> [My
    Sinai trip: A lay sermon] (Verlag der Arche, Zurich, 1972).
    This publication contains the text of a lay sermon that
    Walter Vogt gave on 14 November 1971 on the invitation of
    Parson Christoph Mohl, in the Protestant church of Vaduz
    (Lichtenstein), in the course of a series of sermons by
    writers, and in addition contains an afterword by the author
    and by the inviting parson. It involves the description and
    interpretation of an ecstatic-religious experience evoked by
    LSD, that the author is able to &quot;place in a distant, if
    you will superficial, analogy to the great Sinai Trip of
    Moses.&quot; It is not only the &quot;patriarchal
    atmosphere&quot; that is to be traced out of these
    descriptions, that constitutes this analogy; there are deeper
    references, which are more to be read between the lines of
    this text.] Was it really an LSD trip?&#133; It was a
    courageous deed, to choose such a notorious event as a drug
    experience as the theme of a sermon, even a lay sermon. But
    the questions raised by hallucinogenic drugs do actually
    belong in the church&#151;in a prominent place in the church,
    for they are sacred drugs (peyotl, teonanacatl, ololiuhqui,
    with which LSD is mostly closely related by chemical
    structure and activity). <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I can fully agree with what you say in your
    introduction about the modern ecclesiastical religiosity: the
    three sanctioned states of consciousness (the waking
    condition of uninterrupted work and performance of duty,
    alcoholic intoxication, and sleep), the distinction between
    two phases of psychedelic inebriation (the first phase, the
    peak of the trip, in which the cosmic relationship is
    experienced, or the submersion into one's own body, in which
    everything that is, is within; and the second phase,
    characterized as the phase of enhanced comprehension of
    symbols), and the allusion to the candor that hallucinogens
    bring about in consciousness states. These are all
    observations that are of fundamental importance in the
    judgment of hallucinogenic inebriation. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The most worthwhile spiritual benefit from LSD
    experiments was the experience of the inextricable
    intertwining of the physical and spiritual. &quot;Christ in
    matter&quot; (Teilhard de Chardin). Did the insight first
    come to you also through your drug experiences, that we must
    descend &quot;into the flesh, which we are,&quot; in order to
    get new prophesies? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A criticism of your sermon: you allow the
    &quot;deepest experience that there is&quot;&#151;&quot;The
    kingdom of heaven is within you&quot;&#151;to be uttered by
    Timothy Leary. This sentence, quoted without the indication
    of its true source, could be interpreted as ignorance of one,
    or rather <i>the</i> principal truth of Christian belief. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; One of your statements deserves universal
    recognition: &quot;There is no non-ecstatic religious
    experience.&quot;&#133; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Next Monday evening I shall be interviewed on
    Swiss television (about LSD and the Mexican magic drugs, on
    the program &quot;At First Hand&quot;). I am curious about
    the sort of questions that will be asked&#133; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A. H. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Muri/Bern, 24 May 1973 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course it was LSD&#151;only I did not want
    to write about it explicitly, I really do not know just why
    myself.... The great emphasis I placed on the good Leary, who
    now seems to me to be somewhat flipped out, as the prime
    witness, can indeed only be explained by the special context
    of the talk or sermon. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I must admit that the perception that we must
    descend &quot;into the flesh, which we are&quot; actually
    first came to me with LSD. I still ruminate on it, possibly
    it even came &quot;too late&quot; for me in fact, although
    more and more I advocate your opinion that LSD should be
    taboo for youth (taboo, not forbidden, that is the
    difference&#133;). <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The sentence that you like, &quot;there is no
    nonecstatic religious experience,&quot; was apparently not
    liked so much by others&#151;for example, by my (almost only)
    literary friend and minister-lyric poet Kurt Marti.&#133; But
    in any case, we are practically never of the same opinion
    about anything, and notwithstanding, we constitute when we
    occasionally communicate by phone and arrange little
    activities together, the smallest minimafia of Switzerland. <br>

<h3>10. Various Visitors </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The diverse aspects, the multi-faceted emanations
of LSD are also expressed in the variety of cultural circles with
which this substance has brought me into contact. On the
scientific plane, this has involved colleagues-chemists,
pharmacologists, physicians, and mycologists&#151;whom I met at
universities, congresses, lectures, or with whom I came into
association through publication. In the literary-philosophical
field there were contacts with writers. In the preceding chapters
I have reported on the relationships of this type that were most
significant for me. LSD also provided me with a variegated series
of personal acquaintances from the drug scene and from hippie
circles, which will briefly be described here. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of these visitors came from the United States
and were young people, often in transit to the Far East in search
of Eastern wisdom or of a guru; or else hoping to come by drugs
more easily there. Prague also was sometimes the goal, because
LSD of good quality could at the time easily be acquired there.
[Translator's Note: When Sandoz's patents on LSD expired in 1963,
the Czech pharmaceutical firm Spofa began to manufacture the
drug.] Once arrived in Europe, they wanted to take advantage of
the opportunity to see the father of LSD, &quot;the man who made
the famous LSD bicycle trip.&quot; But more serious concerns
sometimes motivated a visit. There was the desire to report on
personal LSD experiences and to debate the purport of their
meaning, at the source, so to speak. Only rarely did a visit
prove to be inspired by the desire to obtain LSD when a visitor
hinted that he or she wished once to experiment with most
assuredly pure material, with original LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Visitors of various types and with diverse desires
also came from Switzerland and other European countries. Such
encounters have become rarer in recent times, which may be
related to the fact that LSD has become less important in the
drug scene. Whenever possible, I have welcomed such visitors or
agreed to meet somewhere. This I considered to be an obligation
connected with my role in the history of LSD, and I have tried to
help by instructing and advising. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes no true conversation occurred, for
example with the inhibited young man who arrived on a motorbike.
I was not clear about the objective of his visit. He stared at
me, as if asking himself: can the man who has made something so
weird as LSD really look so completely ordinary? With him, as
with other similar visitors, I had the feeling that he hoped, in
my presence, the LSD riddle would somehow solve itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Other meetings were completely different, like the
one with the young man from Toronto. He invited me to lunch at an
exclusive restaurant&#151;impressive appearance, tall, slender, a
businessman, proprietor of an important industrial firm in
Canada, brilliant intellect. He thanked me for the creation of
LSD, which had given his life another direction. He had been 100
percent a businessman, with a purely materialistic world view.
LSD had opened his eyes to the spiritual aspect of life. Now he
possessed a sense for art, literature, and philosophy and was
deeply concerned with religious and metaphysical questions. He
now desired to make the LSD experience accessible in a suitable
milieu to his young wife, and hoped for a similarly fortunate
transformation in her. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not as profound, yet still liberating and
rewarding, were the results of LSD experiments which a young Dane
described to me with much humor and fantasy. He came from
California, where he had been a houseboy for Henry Miller in Big
Sur. He moved on to France with the plan of acquiring a
dilapidated farm there, which he, a skilled carpenter, then
wanted to restore himself. I asked him to obtain an autograph of
his former employer for my collection, and after some time I
actually received an original piece of writing from Henry
Miller's hand. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A young woman sought me out to report on LSD
experiences that had been of great significance to her inner
development. As a superficial teenager who pursued all sorts of
entertainments, and quite neglected by her parents, she had begun
to take LSD out of curiosity and love of adventure. For three
years she took frequent LSD trips. They led to an astonishing
intensification of her inner life. She began to seek after the
deeper meaning of her existence, which eventually revealed itself
to her. Then, recognizing that LSD had no further power to help
her, without difficulty or exertion of will she was able to
abandon the drug. Thereafter she was in a position to develop
herself further without artificial means. She was now a happy
intrinsically secure person&#151;thus she concluded her report.
This young woman had decided to tell me her history, because she
supposed that I was often attacked by narrow-minded persons who
saw only the damage that LSD sometimes caused among youths. The
immediate motive of her testimony was a conversation that she had
accidentally overheard on a railway journey. A man complained
about me, finding it disgraceful that I had spoken on the LSD
problem in an interview published in the newspaper. In his
opinion, I ought to denounce LSD as primarily the devil's work
and should publicly admit my guilt in the matter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Persons in LSD delirium, whose condition could have
given rise to such indignant condemnation, have never personally
come into my sight. Such cases, attributable to LSD consumption
under irresponsible circumstances, to overdosage, or to psychotic
predisposition, always landed in the hospital or at the police
station. Great publicity always came their way. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A visit by one youn American girl stands out in my
memory as an example of the tragic effects of LSD. It was during
the lunch hour, which I normally spent in my office under strict
confinement&#151;no visitors, secretary's office closed up.
Knocking came at the door, discretely but firmly repeated, until
eventually I went to open.it. I scarcely believed my eyes: before
me stood a very beautiful young woman, blond, with large blue
eyes, wearing a long hippie dress, headband, and sandals. &quot;I
am Joan, I come from New York&#151;you are Dr. Hofmann?&quot;
Before I inquired what brought her to me, I asked her how she had
got through the two checkpoints, at the main entrance to the
factory area and at the door of the laboratory building, for
visitors were admitted only after telephone query, and this
flower child must have been especially noticeable. &quot;I am an
angel, I can pass everywhere,&quot; she replied. Then she
explained that she came on a great mission. She had to rescue her
country, the United States; above all she had to direct the
president (at the time L. B. Johnson) onto the correct path. This
could be accomplished only by having him take LSD. Then he would
receive the good ideas that would enable him to lead the country
out of war and internal difficulties. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Joan had come to me hoping that I would help her
fulfill her mission, namely to give LSD to the president. Her
name would indicate she was the Joan of Arc of the USA. I don't
know whether my arguments, advanced with all consideration of her
holy zeal, were able to convince her that her plan had no
prospects of success on psychological, technical, internal, and
external grounds. Disappointed and sad she went away. Next day I
received a telephone call from Joan. She again asked me to help
her, since her financial resources were exhausted. I took her to
a friend in Zurich who provided her with work, and with whom she
could live. Joan was a teacher by profession, and also a
nightclub pianist and singer. For a while she played and sang in
a fashionable Zurich restaurant. The good bourgeois clients of
course had no idea what sort of angel sat at the grand piano in a
black evening dress and entertained them with sensitive playing
and a soft and sensuous voice. Few paid attention to the words of
her songs; they were for the most part hippie songs, many of them
containing veiled praise of drugs. The Zurich performance did not
last long; within a few weeks I learned from my friend that Joan
had suddenly disappeared. He received a greeting card from her
three months later, from Israel. She had been committed to a
psychiatric hospital there. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the conclusion of my assortment of LSD
visitors, I wish to report about a meeting in which LSD figured
only indirectly. Miss H. S., head secretary in a hospital, wrote
to ask me for a personal interview. She came to tea. She
explained her visit thus: in a report about an LSD experience,
she had read the description of a condition she herself had
experienced as a young girl, which still disturbed her today;
possibly I could help her to understand this experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had gone on a business trip as a commercial
apprentice. They spent the night in a mountain hotel. H. S. awoke
very early and left the house alone in order to watch the
sunrise. As the mountains began to light up in a sea of rays, she
was perfused by an unprecedented feeling of happiness, which
persisted even after she joined the other participants of the
trip at morning service in the chapel. During the Mass everything
appeared to her in a supernatural luster, and the feeling of
happiness intensified to such an extent that she had to cry
loudly. She was brought back to the hotel and treated as someone
with a mental disorder. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This experience largely determined her later
personal life. H.S. feared she was not completely normal. On the
one hand, she feared this experience, which had been explained to
her as a nervous breakdown; on the other hand, she longed for
arepetitionof the condition. Internally split, she had led an
unstable life. In repeated vocational changes and in varying
personal relationships, consciously or unconsciously she again
sought this ecstatic outlook, which once made her so deeply
happy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was able to reassure my visitor. It was no
psychopathological event, no nervous breakdown that she had
experienced at the time. What many people seek to attain with the
help of LSD, the visionary experience of a deeper reality, had
come to her as spontaneous grace. I recommended a book by Aldous
Huxley to her, <i>The Perennial Philosophy</i> (Harper, New York
&amp; London, 1945) a collection of reports of spontaneous
blessed visions from all times and cultures. Huxley wrote that
not only mystics and saints, but also many more ordinary people
than one generally supposes, experience such blessed moments, but
that most do not recognize their importance and, instead of
regarding them as promising rays of hope, repress them, because
they do not fit into everyday rationality. </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am often asked what has made the deepest
impression upon me in my LSD experiments, and whether I have
arrived at new understandings through these experiences.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Valious Realities </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of greatest significance to me has been the
insight that I attained as a fundamental understanding from all
of my LSD experiments: what one commonly takes as &quot;the
reality,&quot; including the reality of one's own individual
person, by no means signifies something fixed, but rather
something that is ambiguous&#151;that there is not only one, but
that there are many realities, each comprising also a different
consciousness of the ego. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One can also arrive at this insight through
scientific reflections. The problem of reality is and has been
from time immemorial a central concern of philosophy. It is,
however, a fundamental distinction, whether one approaches the
problem of reality rationally, with the logical methods of
philosophy, or if one obtrudes upon this problem emotionally,
through an existential experience. The first planned LSD
experiment was therefore so deeply moving and alarming, because
everyday reality and the ego experiencing it, which I had until
then considered to be the only reality, dissolved, and an
unfamiliar ego experienced another, unfamiliar reality. The
problem concerning the innermost self also appeared, which,
itself unmoved, was able to record these external and internal
transformations. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reality is inconceivable without an experiencing
subject, without an ego. It is the product of the exterior world,
of the sender and of a receiver, an ego in whose deepest self the
emanations of the exterior world, registered by the antennae of
the sense organs, become conscious. If one of the two is lacking,
no reality happens, no radio music plays, the picture screen
remains blank. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If one continues with the conception of reality as
a product of sender and receiver, then the entry of another
reality under the influence of LSD may be explained by the fact
that the brain, the seat of the receiver, becomes biochemically
altered. The receiver is thereby tuned into another wavelength
than that corresponding to normal, everyday reality. Since the
endless variety and diversity of the universe correspond to
infinitely many different wavelengths, depending on the
adjustment of the receiver, many different realities, including
the respective ego, can become conscious. These different
realities, more correctly designated as different aspects of <i>the
</i>reality, are not mutually exclusive but are complementary,
and form together a portion of the all-encompassing, timeless,
transcendental reality, in which even the unimpeachable core of
self-consciousness, which has the power to record the different
egos, is located. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The true importance of LSD and related
hallucinogens lies in their capacity to shift the wavelength
setting of the receiving &quot;self,&quot; and thereby to evoke
alterations in reality consciousness. This ability to allow
different, new pictures of reality to arise, this truly
cosmogonic power, makes the cultish worship of hallucinogenic
plants as sacred drugs understandable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What constitutes the essential, characteristic
difference between everyday reality and the world picture
experienced in LSD inebriation? Ego and the outer world are
separated in the normal condition of consciousness, in everyday
reality; one stands face-to-face with the outer world; it has
become an object. In the LSD state the boundaries between the
experiencing self and the outer world more or less disappear,
depending on the depth of the inebriation. Feedback between
receiver and sender takes place. A portion of the self overflows
into the outer world, into objects, which begin to live, to have
another, a deeper meaning. This can be perceived as a blessed, or
as a demonic transformation imbued with terror, proceeding to a
loss of the trusted ego. In an auspicious case, the new ego feels
blissfully united with the objects of the outer world and
consequently also with its fellow beings. This experience of deep
oneness with the exterior world can even intensify to a feeling
of the self being one with the universe. This condition of cosmic
consciousness, which under favorable conditions can be evoked by
LSD or by another hallucinogen from the group of Mexican sacred
drugs, is analogous to spontaneous religious enlightenment, with
the unio mystica. In both conditions, which often last only for a
timeless moment, a reality is experienced that exposes a gleam of
the transcendental reality, in vihich universe and self, sender
and receiver, are one. [The relationship of spontaneous to
drug-induced enlightenment has been most extensively investigated
by R. C. Zaehner, <i>Mysticism Sacred and Profane </i>(The
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1957).] <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gottfried Benn, in his essay &quot;Provoziertes
Leben&quot; [Provoked life] (in <i>Ausdnckswelt,</i> Limes
Verlag, Wiesbaden, 1949), characterized the reality in which self
and world are separated, as &quot;the schizoid catastrophe, the
Western entelechy neurosis.&quot; He further writes: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . In the southern part of our continent this concept
    of reality began to be formed. The Hellenistic-European
    agonistic principle of victory through effort, cunning,
    malice, talent, force, and later, European Darwinism and
    &quot;superman,&quot; was instrumental in its formation. The
    ego emerged, dominated, fought; for this it needed
    instruments, material, power. It had a different relationship
    to matter, more removed sensually, but closer formally. It
    analyzed matter, tested, sorted: weapons, object of exchange,
    ransom money. It clarified matter through isolation, reduced
    it to formulas, took pieces out of it, divided it up. [Matter
    became] a concept which hung like a disaster over the West,
    with which the West fought, without grasping it, to which it
    sacrified enormous quantities of blood and happiness; a
    concept whose inner tension and fragmentations it was
    impossible to dissolve through a natural viewing or
    methodical insight into the inherent unity and peace of
    prelogical forms of being . . . instead the cataclysmic
    character of this idea became clearer and clearer . . . a
    state, a social organization, a public morality, for which
    life is economically usable life and which does not recognize
    the world of provoked life, cannot stop its destructive
    force. A society, whose hygiene and race cultivation as a
    modern ritual is founded solely on hollow biological
    statistics, can only represent the external viewpoint of the
    mass; for this point of view it can wage war, incessantly,
    for reality is simply raw material, but its metaphysical
    background remains forever obscured. [This excerpt from
    Benn's essay was taken from Ralph Metzner's translation
    &quot;Provoked Life: An Essay on the Anthropology of the
    Ego,&quot; which was published in <i>Psychedelic Review</i> <b>1</b>
    (1): 47-54, 1963. Minor corrections in Metzner's text have
    been made by A. H.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Gottfried Benn formulates it in these sentences,
a concept of reality that separates self and the world has
decisively determined the evolutionary course of European
intellectual history. Experience of the world as matter, as
object, to which man stands opposed, has produced modern natural
science and technology&#151;creations of the Western mind that
have changed the world. With their help human beings have subdued
the world. Its wealth has been exploited in a manner that may be
characterized as plundering, and the sublime accomplishment of
technological civilization, the comfort of Western industrial
society, stands face-to-face with a catastrophic destruction of
the environment. Even to the heart of matter, to the nucleus of
the atom and its splitting, this objective intellect has
progressed and has unleashed energies that threaten all life on
our planet. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A misuse of knowledge and understanding, the
products of searching intelligence, could not have emerged from a
consciousness of reality in which human beings are not separated
from the environment but rather exist as part of living nature
and the universe. All attempts today to make amends for the
damage through environmentally protective measures must remain
only hopeless, superficial patchwork, if no curing of the
&quot;Western entelechy neurosis&quot; ensues, as Benn has
characterized the objective reality conception. Healing would
mean existential experience of a deeper, self-encompassing
reality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The experience of such a comprehensive reality is
impeded in an environment rendered dead by human hands, such as
is present in our great cities and industrial districts. Here the
contrast between self and outer world becomes especially evident.
Sensations of alienation, of loneliness, and of menace arise. It
is these sensations that impress themselves on everyday
consciousness in Western industrial society; they also take the
upper hand everywhere that technological civilization extends
itself, and they largely determine the production of modern art
and literature. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is less danger of a cleft reality experience
arising in a natural environment. In field and forest, and in the
animal world sheltered therein, indeed in every garden, a reality
is perceptible that is infinitely more real, older, deeper, and
more wondrous than everything made by people, and that will yet
endure, when the inanimate, mechanical, and concrete world again
vanishes, becomes rusted and fallen into ruin. In the sprouting,
growth, blooming, fruiting, death, and regermination of plants,
in their relationship with the sun, whose light they are able to
convert into chemically bound energy in the form of organic
compounds, out of which all that lives on our earth is built; in
the being of plants the same mysterious, inexhaustible, eternal
life energy is evident that has also brought us forth and takes
us back again into its womb, and in which we are sheltered and
united with all living things. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We are not leading up to a sentimental enthusiasm
for nature, to &quot;back to nature&quot; in Rousseau's sense.
That romantic movement, which sought the idyll in nature, can
also be explained by a feeling of humankind's separation from
nature. What is needed today is a fundamental reexperience of the
oneness of all living things, a comprehensive reality
consciousness that ever more infrequently develops spontaneously,
the more the primordial flora and fauna of our mother earth must
yield to a dead technological environment.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Mystery and Myth </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The notion of reality as the self juxtaposed to
the world, in confrontation with the outer world, began to form
itself, as reported in the citation from Benn, in the southern
portion of the European continent in Greek antiquity. No doubt
people at that time knew the suffering that was connected with
such a cleft reality consciousness. The Greek genius tried the
cure, by supplementing the multiformed and richly colored,
sensual as well as deeply sorrowful Apollonian world view created
by the subject/object cleavage, with the Dionysian world of
experience, in which this cleavage is abolished in ecstatic
inebriation. Nietzsche writes in <i>The Birth of Tragedy:</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is either through the influence of narcotic potions, of
    which all primitive peoples and races speak in hymns, or
    through the powerful approach of spring, penetrating with joy
    all of nature, that those Dionysian stirrings arise, which in
    their intensification lead the individual to forget himself
    completely.... Not only does the bond between man and man
    come to be forged once again by the magic of the Dionysian
    rite, but alienated, hostile, or subjugated nature again
    celebrates her reconciliation with her prodigal son, man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Mysteries of Eleusis, which were celebrated
annually in the fall, over an interval of approximately 2,000
years, from about 1500 B.C. until the fourth century A.D., were
intimately connected with the ceremonies and festivals in honor
of the god Dionysus. These Mysteries were established by the
goddess of agriculture, Demeter, as thanks for the recovery of
her daughter Persephone, whom Hades, the god of the underworld,
had abducted. A further thank offering was the ear of grain,
which was presented by the two goddesses to Triptolemus, the
first high priest of Eleusis. They taught him the cultivation of
grain, which Triptolemus then disseminated over the whole globe.
Persephone, however, was not always allowed to remain with her
mother, because she had taken nourishment from Hades, contrary to
the order of the highest gods. As punishment she had to return to
the underworld for a part of the year. During this time, it was
winter on the earth, the plants died and were withdrawn into the
ground, to awaken to new life early in the year with Persephone's
journey to earth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The myth of Demeter, Persephone, Hades, and the
other gods, which was enacted as a drama, formed, however, only
the external framework of events. The climax of the yearly
ceremonies, which began with a procession from Athens to Eleusis
lasting several days, was the concluding ceremony with the
initiation, which took place in the night. The initiates were
forbidden by penalty of death to divulge what they had learned,
beheld, in the innermost, holiest chamber of the temple, the <i>telesterion</i>
(goal). Not one of the multitude that were initiated into the
secret of Eleusis has ever done this. Pausanias, Plato, many
Roman emperors like Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, and many other
known personages of antiquity were party to this initiation. It
must have been an illumination, a visionary glimpse of a deeper
reality, an insight into the true basis of the universe. That can
be concluded from the statements of initiates about the value,
about the importance of the vision. Thus it is reported in a
Homeric Hymn: &quot;Blissful is he among men on Earth, who has
beheld that! He who has not been initiated into the holy
Mysteries, who has had no part therein, remains a corpse in
gloomy darkness.&quot; Pindar speaks of the Eleusinian
benediction with the following words: &quot;Blissful is he, who
after having beheld this enters on the way beneath the Earth. He
knows the end of life as well as its divinely granted
beginning.&quot; Cicero, also a famous initiate, likewise put in
first position the splendor that fell upon his life from Eleusis,
when he said: &quot; Not only have we received the reason there,
that we may live in joy, but also, besides, that we may die with
better hope.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How could the mythological representation of such
an obvious occurrence, which runs its course annually before our
eyes&#151;the seed grain that is dropped into the earth, dies
there, in order to allow a new plant, new life, to ascend into
the light&#151;prove to be such a deep, comforting experience as
that attested by the cited reports? It is traditional knowledge
that the initiates were furnished with a potion, the <i>kykeon,</i>
for the final ceremony. It is also known that barley extract and
mint were ingredients of the <i>kykeon.</i> Religious scholars
and scholars of mythology, like Karl Kerenyi, from whose book on
the Eleusinian Mysteries (Rhein-Verlag, Zurich, 1962) the
preceding statements were taken, and with whom I was associated
in relation to the research on this mysterious potion [In the
English publication of Kerenyi's book <i>Eleusis</i> (Schocken
Books, New York, 1977) a reference is made to this
collaboration.], are of the opinion that the <i>kykeon </i>was
mixed with an hallucinogenic drug. [In <i>The Road to Eleusis</i>
by R. Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann, and Carl A. P. Ruck
(Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York, 1978) the possibility is
discussed that the <i>kykeon</i> could have acted through an
LSD-like preparation of ergot.] That would make understandable
the ecstatic-visionary experience of the DemeterPersephone myth,
as a symbol of the cycle of life and death in both a
comprehensive and timeless reality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When the Gothic king Alarich, coming from the
north, invaded Greece in 396 A.D. and destroyed the sanctuary of
Eleusis, it was not only the end of a religious center, but it
also signified the decisive downfall of the ancient world. With
the monks that accompanied Alarich, Christianity penetrated into
the country that must be regarded as the cradle of European
culture. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cultural-historical meaning of the Eleusinian
Mysteries, their influence on European intellectual history, can
scarcely be overestimated. Here suffering humankind found a cure
for its rational, objective, cleft intellect, in a mystical
totality experience, that let it believe in immortality, in an
everlasting existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This belief had survived in early Christianity,
although with other symbols. It is found as a promise, even in
particular passages of the Gospels, most clearly in the Gospel
according to John, as in Chapter 14: 120. Jesus speaks to his
disciples, as he takes leave of them: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
    Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>Even the Spirit of truth;</i> whom the world cannot
    receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but
    ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. Yet
    a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
    me: because I live, ye shall live also. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>At that day ye shatl know that I am in my Father, and
    ye in me, and I in you.</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This promise constitutes the heart of my Christian
beliefs and my call to natural-scientific research: we will
attain to knowledge of the universe through the spirit of truth,
and thereby to understanding of our being one with the deepest,
most comprehensive reality, God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ecclesiastical Christianity, determined by the
duality of creator and creation, has, however, with its
nature-alienated religiosity largely obliterated the
Eleusinian-Dionysian legacy of antiquity. In the Christian sphere
of belief, only special blessed men have attested to a timeless,
comforting reality, experienced in a spontaneous vision, an
experience to which in antiquity the elite of innumerable
generations had access through the initiation at Eleusis. The <i>unio
mystica</i> of Catholic saints and the visions that the
representatives of Christian mysticism&#151;Jakob Boehme, Meister
Eckhart, Angelus Silesius, Thomas Traherne, William Blake, and
others&#151;describe in their writings, are obviously essentially
related to the enlightenment that the initiates to the Eleusinian
Mysteries experienced. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fundamental importance of a mystical
experience, for the recovery of people in Western industrial
societies who are sickened by a one-sided, rational,
materialistic world view, is today given primary emphasis, not
only by adherents to Eastern religious movements like Zen
Buddhism, but also by leading representatives of academic
psychiatry. Of the appropriate literature, we will here refer
only to the books of Balthasar Staehelin, the Basel psychiatrist
working in Zurich. [<i>Haben und Sein </i>(1969), <i>Die Welt als
Du </i>(1970), <i>Urvertrauen und zweite Wirklichkeit </i>(1973),
and <i>Der flnale Mensch</i> (1976); all published by
Theologischer Verlag, Zurich.] They make reference to numerous
other authors who deal with the same problem. Today a type of
&quot;metamedicine,&quot; &quot;metapsychology,&quot; and
&quot;metapsychiatry&quot; is beginning to call upon the
metaphysical element in people, which manifests itself as an
experience of a deeper, duality-surmounting reality, and to make
this element a basic healing principle in therapeutic practice. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, it is most significant that not only
medicine but also wider circles of our society consider the
overcoming of the dualistic, cleft world view to be a
prerequisite and basis for the recovery and spiritual renewal of
occidental civilization and culture. This renewal could lead to
the renunciation of the materialistic philosophy of life and the
development of a new reality consciousness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a path to the perception of a deeper,
comprehensive reality, in which the experiencing individual is
also sheltered, meditation, in its different forms, occupies a
prominent place today. The essential difference between
meditation and prayer in the usual sense, which is based upon the
duality of creatorcreation, is that meditation aspires to the
abolishment of the I-you-barrier by a fusing of object and
subject, of sender and receiver, of objective reality and self. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Objective reality, the world view produced by the
spirit of scientific inquiry, is the myth of our time. It has
replaced the ecclesiastical-Christian and mythical-Apollonian
world view. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this ever broadening factual knowledge, which
constitutes objective reality, need not be a desecration. On the
contrary, if it only advances deep enough, it inevitably leads to
the inexplicable, primal ground of the universe: the wonder, the
mystery of the divine&#151;in the microcosm of the atom, in the
macrocosm of the spiral nebula; in the seeds of plants, in the
body and soul of people. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meditation begins at the limits of objective
reality, at the farthest point yet reached by rational knowledge
and perception. Meditation thus does not mean rejection of
objective reality; on the contrary, it consists of a penetration
to deeper dimensions of reality. It is not escape into an
imaginary dream world; rather it seeks after the comprehensive
truth of objective reality, by simultaneous, stereoscopic
contemplation of its surfaces and depths. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It could become of fundamental importance, and be
not merely a transient fashion of the present, if more and more
people today would make a daily habit of devoting an hour, or at
least a few minutes, to meditation. As a result of the meditative
penetration and broadening of the natural-scientific world view,
a new, deepened reality consciousness would have to evolve, which
would increasingly become the property of all humankind. This
could become the basis of a new religiosity, which would not be
based on belief in the dogmas of various religions, but rather on
perception through the &quot;spirit of truth.&quot; What is meant
here is a perception, a reading and understanding of the text at
first hand, &quot;out of the book that God's finger has
written&quot; (Paracelsus), out of the creation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The transformation of the objective world view into
a deepened and thereby religious reality consciousness can be
accomplished gradually, by continuing practice of meditation. It
can also come about, however, as a sudden enlightenment; a
visionary experience. It is then particularly profound, blessed,
and meaningful. Such a mystical experience may nevertheless
&quot;not be induced even by decade-long meditation,&quot; as
Balthasar Staehelin writes. Also, it does not happen to everyone,
although the capacity for mystical experience belongs to the
essence of human spirituality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, at Eleusis, the mystical vision, the
healing, comforting experience, could be arranged in the
prescribed place at the appointed time, for all of the multitudes
who were initiated into the holy Mysteries. This could be
accounted for by the fact that an hallucinogenic drug came into
use; this, as already mentioned, is something that religious
scholars believe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The characteristic property of hallucinogens, to
suspend the boundaries between the experiencing self and the
outer world in an ecstatic, emotional experience, makes it
possible with their help, and after suitable internal and
external preparation, as it was accomplished in a perfect way at
Eleusis, to evoke a mystical experience according to plan, so to
speak. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meditation is a preparation for the same goal that
was aspired to and was attained in the Eleusinian Mysteries.
Accordingly it seems feasible that in the future, with the help
of LSD, the mystical vision, crowning meditation, could be made
accessible to an increasing number of practitioners of meditation
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>I see the true importance of LSD in the
possibitity ofproviding material aid to meditation aimed at the
mystical experience of a deeper, comprehensive reality. Such a
use accords entirely with the essence and working character of
LSD as a sacred drug.</b> </p>

<title>The Joyous Cosmology - Foreword</title>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<hr>

<p> The Joyous Cosmology is a brilliant arrangement of words
describing experiences for which our language has no vocabulary.
To understand this wonderful but difficult book it is useful to
make the artificial distinction between the external and the
internal. This is, of course, exactly the distinction which Alan
Watts wants us to transcend. But Mr. Watts is playing the verbal
game in a Western language, and his reader can be excused for
following along with conventional dichotomous models. </p>

<p> External and internal. Behavior and consciousness. Changing
the external world has been the genius and the obsession of our
civilization. In the last two centuries the Western monotheistic
cultures have faced outward and moved objects about with
astonishing efficiency. In more recent years, however, our
culture has become aware of a disturbing imbalance. We have
become aware of the undiscovered universe within, of the
uncharted regions of consciousness. </p>

<p> This dialectic trend is not new. The cycle has occurred in
the lives of many cultures and individuals. External material
success is followed by disillusion and the basic &quot;why&quot;
questions, and then by the discovery of the world within---a
world infinitely more complex and rich than the artifactual
structures of the outer world, which after all are, in origin,
projections of human imagination. Eventually, the logical
conceptual mind turns on itself, recognizes the foolish
inadequacy of the flimsy systems it imposes on the world,
suspends its own rigid control, and overthrows the domination of
cognitive experience. </p>

<p> We speak here (and Alan Watts speaks in this book) about the
politics of the nervous system---certainly as complicated and
certainly as important as external politics. The politics of the
nervous system involves the mind against the brain, the
tyrannical verbal brain disassociating itself from the organism
and world of which it is a part, censoring, alerting, evaluating.
</p>

<p> Thus appears the fifth freedom---freedom from the learned,
cultural mind. The freedom to expand one's consciousness beyond
artifactual cultural knowledge. The freedom to move from constant
preoccupation with the verbal games---the social games, the game
of self---to the joyous unity of what exists beyond. </p>

<p> We are dealing here with an issue that is not new, an issue
that has been considered for centuries by mystics, by
philosophers of the religious experience, by those rare and truly
great scientists who have been able to move in and then out
beyond the limits of the science game. It was seen and described
clearly by the great American psychologist William James: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . our normal waking consciousness, rational
    consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of
    consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the
    filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of
    consciousness entirely different.. We may go through life
    without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite
    stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their
    completeness, definite types of mentality which probably
    somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No
    account of the universe in its totality can be final which
    leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.
    How to regard them is the question,-for they are so
    discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may
    determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and
    open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate,
    they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality.
    Looking back on my own experiences, they all converge toward
    a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some
    metaphysical significance. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> But what are the stimuli necessary and sufficient to
overthrow the domination of the conceptual and to open up the
&quot;potential forms of consciousness&quot;? There are many.
Indian philosophers have described hundreds of methods. So have
the Japanese Buddhists. The monastics of our Western religions
provide more examples. Mexican healers and religious leaders from
South and North American Indian groups have for centuries
utilized sacred plants to trigger off the expansion of
consciousness. Recently our Western science has provided, in the
form of chemicals, the most direct techniques for opening new
realms of awareness. </p>

<p> William James used nitrous oxide and ether to &quot;stimulate
the mystical consciousness in an extraordinary degree.&quot;
Today the attention of psychologists, philosophers, and
theologians is centering on the effects of three synthetic
substances---mescaline, lysergic acid, and psilocybin. </p>

<p> What are these substances? Medicines or drugs or sacramental
foods? It is easier to say what they are not. They are not
narcotics, nor intoxicants, nor energizers, nor anaesthetics, nor
tranquilizers. They are, rather, biochemical keys which unlock
experiences shatteringly new to most Westerners. </p>

<p> For the last two years, staff members of the Center for
Research in Personality at Harvard University have engaged in
systematic experiments with these substances. Our first inquiry
into the biochemical expansion of consciousness has been a study
of the reactions of Americans in a supportive, comfortable
naturalistic setting. We have had the opportunity of
participating in over one thousand individual administrations.
From our observations, from interviews and reports, from analysis
of questionnaire data, and from pre- and postexperimental
differences in personality test results, certain conclusions have
emerged. (I) These substances do alter consciousness. There is no
dispute on this score. (2) It is meaningless to talk more
specifically about the &quot;effect of the drug.&quot; Set and
setting, expectation, and atmosphere account for all specificity
of reaction. There is no &quot;drug reaction&quot; but always
setting-plus-drug. (3) In talking about potentialities it is
useful to consider not just the setting-plus-drug but rather the
potentialities of the human cortex to create images and
experiences far beyond the narrow limitations of words and
concepts. Those of us on this research project spend a good share
of our working hours listening to people talk about the effect
and use of consciousness-altering drugs. If we substitute the
words human cortex for drug we can then agree with any statement
made about the potentialities---for good or evil, for helping or
hurting, for loving or fearing. Potentialities of the cortex, not
of the drug. The drug is just an instrument. </p>

<p> In analyzing and interpreting the results of our studies we
looked first to the conventional models of modern
psychology---psychoanalytic, behaviorist---and found these
concepts quite inadequate to map the richness and breadth of
expanded consciousness. To understand our findings we have
finally been forced back on a language and point of view quite
alien to us who are trained in the traditions of mechanistic
objective psychology. We have had to return again and again to
the nondualistic conceptions of Eastern philosophy, a theory of
mind made more explicit and familiar in our Western world by
Bergson, Aldous Huxley, and Alan Watts. In the first part of this
book Mr. Watts presents with beautiful clarity this theory of
consciousness, which we have seen confirmed in the accounts of
our research subjects--- philosophers, unlettered convicts,
housewives, intellectuals, alcoholics. The leap across entangling
thickets of the verbal, to identify with the totality of the
experienced, is a phenomenon reported over and over by these
persons. </p>

<p> Alan Watts spells out in eloquent detail his drug-induced
visionary moments. He is, of course, attempting the
impossible---to describe in words (which always lie) that which
is beyond words. But how well he can do it! </p>

<p> Alan Watts is one of the great reporters of our times. He has
an intuitive sensitivity for news, for the crucial issues and
events of the century. And he has along with this the verbal
equipment of a poetic philosopher to teach and inform. Here he
has given us perhaps the best statement on the subject of
space-age mysticism, more daring than the two classic works of
Aldous Huxley because Watts follows Mr. Huxley's lead and pushes
beyond. The recognition of the love aspects of the mystical
experience and the implications for new forms of social
communication are especially important. </p>

<p> You are holding in your hand a great human document. But
unless you are one of the few Westerners who have (accidentally
or through chemical good fortune) experienced a mystical minute
of expanded awareness, you will probably not understand what the
author is saying. Too bad, but still not a cause for surprise.
The history of ideas reminds us that new concepts and new visions
have always been non-understood. We cannot understand that for
which we have no words. But Alan Watts is playing the book game,
the word game, and the reader is his contracted partner. </p>

<p> But listen. Be prepared. There are scores of great lines in
this book. Dozens of great ideas. Too many. Too compressed. They
glide by too quickly. Watch for them. </p>

<p> If you catch even n few of these ideas, you will find
yourself asking the questions which we ask ourselves as we look
over our research data: Where do we go from here? What is the
application of these new wonder medicines? Can they do more than
provide memorable moments and memorable books? </p>

<p> The answer will come from two directions. We must provide
more and more people with these experiences and have them tell
us, as Alan Watts does here, what they experienced. (There will
hardly be a lack of volunteers for this ecstatic voyage.
Ninety-one percent of our subjects are eager to repeat and to
share the experience with their family and friends). We must also
encourage systematic objective research by scientists who have
taken the drug themselves and have come to know the difference
between inner and outer, between consciousness and behavior. Such
research should explore the application of these experiences to
the problems of modern living---in education, religion, creative
industry, creative arts. </p>

<p> There are many who believe that we stand at an important
turning point in man's power to control and expand his awareness.
Our research provides tentative grounds for such optimism. The
Joyous Cosmology is solid testimony for the same happy
expectations. </p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<hr>

<p> In The Doors of Perception Aldous Huxley has given us a
superbly written account of the effects of mescaline upon a
highly sensitive person. It was a record of his first experience
of this remarkable transformation of consciousness, and by now,
through subsequent experiments, he knows that it can lead to far
deeper insights than his book described. While I cannot hope to
surpass Aldous Huxley as a master of English prose, I feel that
the time is ripe for an account of some of the deeper, or higher,
levels of insight that can be reached through these
consciousness-changing &quot;drugs&quot; when accompanied with
sustained philosophical reflection by a person who is in search,
not of kicks, but of understanding. I should perhaps add that,
for me, philosophical reflection is barren when divorced from
poetic imagination, for we proceed to understanding of the world
upon two legs, not one. </p>

<p> It is now a commonplace that there is a serious lack of
communication between scientists and laymen on the theoretical
level, for the layman does not understand the mathematical
language in which the scientist thinks. For example, the concept
of curved space cannot be represented in any image that is
intelligible to the senses. But I am still more concerned with
the gap between theoretical description and direct experience
among scientists themselves. Western science is now delineating a
new concept of man, not as a solitary ego within a wall of flesh,
but as an organism which is what it is by virtue of its
inseparability from the rest of the world. But with the rarest
exceptions even scientists do not <i>feel</i> themselves to exist
in this way. They, and almost all of us, retain a sense of
personality which is independent, isolated, insular, and
estranged from the cosmos that surrounds it. Somehow this gap
must be closed, and among the varied means whereby the closure
may be initiated or achieved are medicines which science itself
has discovered, and which may prove to be the sacraments of its
religion. </p>

<p> For a long time we have been accustomed to the
compartmentalization of religion and science as if they were two
quite different and basically unrelated ways of seeing the world.
I do not believe that this state of doublethink can last. It must
eventually be replaced by a view of the world which is neither
religious nor scientific but simply our view of the world. More
exactly, it must become a view of the world in which the reports
of science and religion are as concordant as those of the eyes
and the ears. </p>

<p> But the traditional roads to spiritual experience seldom
appeal to persons of scientific or skeptical temperament, for the
vehicles that ply them are rickety and piled with excess baggage.
There is thus little opportunity for the alert and critical
thinker to share at first hand in the modes of consciousness that
seers and mystics are trying to express-often in archaic and
awkward symbolism. If the pharmacologist can be of help in
exploring this unknown world, he may be doing us the
extraordinary service of rescuing religious experience from the
obscurantists. </p>

<p> To make this book as complete an expression as possible of
the quality of consciousness which these drugs induce, I have
included a number of photographs which, in their vivid reflection
of the patterns of nature, give some suggestion of the rhythmic
beauty of detail which the drugs reveal in common things. For
without losing their normal breadth of vision the eyes seem to
become a microscope through which the mind delves deeper and
deeper into the intricately dancing texture of our world. </p>

<h2>Prologue</h2>

<hr>

<p> SLOWLY it becomes clear that one of the greatest of all
superstitions is the separation of the mind from the body. This
does not mean that we are being forced to admit that we are <i>only</i>
bodies; it means that we are forming an altogether new idea of
the body. For the body considered as separate from the mind is
one thing---an animated corpse. But the body considered as
inseparable from the mind is another, and as yet we have no
proper word for a reality which is simultaneously mental and
physical. To call it mental-physical will not do at all, for this
is the very unsatisfactory joining of two concepts which have
both been impoverished by long separation and opposition. But we
are at least within sight of being able to discard altogether
ideas of a stuff which is mental and a stuff which is material.
&quot;Stuff&quot; is a word which describes the formless mush
that we perceive when sense is not keen enough to make out its
pattern. The notion of material or mental stuff is based on the
false analogy that trees are made of wood, mountains of stone,
and minds of spirit in the same way that pots are made of clay.
&quot;Inert&quot; matter seems to require an external and
intelligent energy to give it form. But now we know that matter
is not inert. Whether it is organic or inorganic, we are learning
to see matter as patterns of energy---not <i>of</i> energy as if
energy were a stuff, but as energetic pattern, moving order,
active intelligence. </p>

<p> The realization that mind and body, form and matter, are one
is blocked, however, by ages of semantic confusion and
psychological prejudice. For it is common sense that every
pattern, shape, or structure is a form <i>of</i> something as
pots are forms of clay. It is hard to see that this
&quot;something&quot; is as dispensable as the ether in which
light was once supposed to travel, or as the fabulous tortoise
upon which the earth was once thought to be supported. Anyone who
can really grasp this point will experience a curiously
exhilarating liberation, for the burden of stuff will drop from
him and he will walk less heavily. </p>

<p> The dualism of mind and body arose, perhaps, as a clumsy way
of describing the power of an intelligent organism to control
itself. It seemed reasonable to think of the part controlled as
one thing and the part controlling as another. In this way the
conscious will was opposed to the involuntary appetites and
reason to instinct. In due course we learned to center our
identity, our selfhood, in the controlling part---the mind--- and
increasingly to disown as a mere vehicle the part controlled. It
thus escaped our attention that the organism as a whole, largely
unconscious, was using consciousness and reason to inform and
control itself. We thought of our conscious intelligence as
descending from a higher realm to take possession of a physical
vehicle. We therefore failed to see it as an operation of the
same formative process as the structure of nerves, muscles,
veins, and bones---a structure so subtly ordered (that is,
intelligent) that conscious thought is as yet far from being able
to describe it. </p>

<p> This radical separation of the part controlling from the part
controlled changed man from a self-controlling to a self-
frustrating organism, to the embodied conflict and
self-contradiction that he has been throughout his known history.
Once the split occurred conscious intelligence began to serve its
own ends instead of those of the organism that produced it. More
exactly, it became the <i>intention</i> of the conscious
intelligence to work for its own, dissociated, purposes. But, as
we shall see, just as the separation of mind from body is an
illusion, so also is the subjection of the body to the
independent schemes of the mind. Meanwhile, however, the illusion
is as real as the hallucinations of hypnosis, and the organism of
man is indeed frustrating itself by patterns of behavior which
move in the most complex vicious circles. The culmination is a
culture which ever more serves the ends of mechanical order as
distinct from those of organic enjoyment, and which is bent on
self-destruction against the instinct of every one of its
members. </p>

<p> We believe, then, that the mind controls the body, not that
the body controls itself through the mind. Hence the ingrained
prejudice that the mind should be independent of all physical
aids to its working---despite microscopes, telescopes, cameras,
scales, computers, books, works of art, alphabets, and all those
physical tools apart from which it is doubtful whether there
would be any mental life at all. At the same time there has
always been at least an obscure awareness that in feeling oneself
to be a separate mind, soul, or ego there is something wrong.
Naturally, for a person who finds his identity in something other
than his full organism is less than half a man. He is cut off
from complete participation in nature. Instead of being a body he
&quot;has&quot; a body. Instead of living and loving he
&quot;has&quot; instincts for survival and copulation. Disowned,
they drive him as if they were blind furies or demons that
possessed him. </p>

<p> The feeling that there is something wrong in all this
revolves around a contradiction characteristic of all
civilizations. This is the simultaneous compulsion to preserve
oneself and to forget oneself. Here is the vicious circle: if you
feel separate from your organic life, you feel driven to survive;
survival---going on living---thus becomes a duty and also a drag
because you are not fully with it; because it does not quite come
up to expectations, you continue to hope that it will, to crave
for more time, to feel driven all the more to go on. What we call
self-consciousness is thus the sensation of the organism
obstructing itself, of not being with itself, of driving, so to
say, with accelerator and brake on at once. Naturally, this is a
highly unpleasant sensation, which most people want to forget. </p>

<p> The lowbrow way of forgetting oneself is to get drunk, to be
diverted with entertainments, or to exploit such natural means of
self-transcendence as sexual intercourse. The highbrow way is to
throw oneself into the pursuit of the arts, of social service, or
of religious mysticism. These measures are rarely successful
because they do not disclose the basic error of the split self.
The highbrow ways even aggravate the error to the extent that
those who follow them take pride in forgetting themselves by
purely mental means---even though the artist uses paints or
sounds, the social idealist distributes material wealth, and the
religionist uses sacraments and rituals, or such other physical
means as fasting, yoga breathing, or dervish dancing. And there
is a sound instinct in the use of these physical aids, as in the
repeated insistence of mystics that to know about God is not
enough: transformation of the self is only through realizing or
feeling God. The hidden point is that man cannot function
properly through changing anything so superficial as the order of
his thoughts, of his dissociated mind. What has to change is the
behavior of his organism; it has to become self-controlling
instead of self-frustrating. </p>

<p> How is this to be brought about? Clearly, nothing can be done
by the mind, by the conscious will, so long as this is felt to be
something apart from the total organism. But if it were felt
otherwise, nothing would need to be done! A very small number of
Eastern <i>gurus</i>, or masters of wisdom, and Western
psychotherapists have found---rather laborious---ways of tricking
or coaxing the organism into integrating itself---mostly by a
kind of <i>judo</i>, or &quot;gentle way,&quot; which overthrows
the process of self-frustration by carrying it to logical and
absurd extremes. This is pre-eminently the way of Zen, and
occasionally that of psychoanalysis. When these ways work it is
quite obvious that something more has happened to the student or
patient than a change in his way of thinking; he is also
emotionally and physically different; his whole being is
operating in a new way. </p>

<p> For a long time it has been clear to me that certain forms of
Eastern &quot;mysticism&quot;---in particular Taoism and Zen
Buddhism---do not presuppose a universe divided into the
spiritual and the material, and do not culminate in a state of
consciousness where the physical world vanishes into some
undifferentiated and bodiless luminescence. Taoism and Zen are
alike founded upon a philosophy of relativity, but this
philosophy is not merely speculative. It is a discipline in
awareness as a result of which the mutual interrelation of all
things and all events becomes a constant sensation. This
sensation underlies and supports our normal awareness of the
world as a collection of separate and different things---an
awareness which, by itself, is called avidya (ignorance) in
Buddhist philosophy because, in paying exclusive attention to
differences, it ignores relationships. It does not see, for
example, that mind and form or shape and space are as inseparable
as front and back, nor that the individual is so interwoven with
the universe that he and it are one body. </p>

<p> This is a point of view which, unlike some other forms of
mysticism, does not deny physical distinctions but sees them as
the plain expression of unity. As one sees so clearly in Chinese
painting, the individual tree or rock is not <i>on</i> but <i>with</i>
the space that forms its background. The paper untouched by the
brush is an integral part of the picture and never mere backing.
It is for this reason that when a Zen master is asked about the
universal or the ultimate, he replies with the immediate and
particular--- &quot;The cypress tree in the yard!&quot; Here,
then, we have what Robert Linssen has called a spiritual
materialism---a standpoint far closer to relativity and field
theory in modern science than to any religious supernaturalism.
But whereas the scientific comprehension of the relative universe
is as yet largely theoretical, these Eastern disciplines have
made it a direct experience. Potentially, then, they would seem
to offer a marvelous parallel to Western science, but on the
level of our immediate awareness of the world. </p>

<p> For science pursues the common-sense assumption that the
natural world is a multiplicity of individual things and events
by attempting to describe these units as accurately and minutely
as possible. Because science is above all analytic in its way of
describing things, it seems at first to disconnect them more than
ever. Its experiments are the study of carefully isolated
situations, designed to exclude influences that cannot be
measured and controlled---as when one studies falling bodies in a
vacuum to cut out the friction of air. But for this reason the
scientist understands better than anyone else just how
inseparable things are. The more he tries to cut out external
influences upon an experimental situation, the more he discovers
new ones, hitherto unsuspected. The more carefully he describes,
say, the motion of a given particle, the more he finds himself
describing also the space in which it moves. The realization that
all things are inseparably related is in proportion to one's
effort to make them clearly distinct. Science therefore surpasses
the common-sense point of view from which it begins, coming to
speak of things and events as properties of the
&quot;fields&quot; in which they occur. But this is simply a
theoretical description of a state of affairs which, in these
forms of Eastern Mysticism,&quot; is directly sensed. As soon as
this is clear, we have a sound basis for a meeting of minds
between East and West which could be remarkably fruitful. </p>

<p> The practical difficulty is that Taoism and Zen are so
involved with the forms of Far Eastern culture that it is a major
problem to adapt them to Western needs. For example, Eastern
teachers work on the esoteric and aristocratic principle that the
student must learn the hard way and find out almost everything
for himself. Aside from occasional hints, the teacher merely
accepts or rejects the student's attainments. But Western
teachers work on the exoteric and democratic principle that
everything possible must be done to inform and assist the student
so as to make his mastery of the subject as easy as possible.
Does the latter approach, as purists insist, merely vulgarize the
discipline? The answer is that it depends upon the type of
discipline. If everyone learns enough mathematics to master
quadratic equations, the attainment will seem small in comparison
with the much rarer comprehension of the theory of numbers. But
the transformation of consciousness undertaken in Taoism and Zen
is more like the correction of faulty perception or the curing of
a disease. It is not an acquisitive process of learning more and
more facts or greater and greater skills, but rather an
unlearning of wrong habits and opinions. As Lao-tzu said,
&quot;The scholar gains every day, but the Taoist loses every
day.&quot; </p>

<p> The practice of Taoism or Zen in the Far East is therefore an
undertaking in which the Westerner will find himself confronted
with many barriers erected quite deliberately to discourage idle
curiosity or to nullify wrong views by inciting the student to
proceed systematically and consistently upon false assumptions to
the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. My own main interest in the
study of comparative mysticism has been to cut through these
tangles and to identify the essential psychological processes
underlying those alterations of perception which enable us to see
ourselves and the world in their basic unity. I have perhaps had
some small measure of success in trying, Western fashion, to make
this type of experience more accessible. I am therefore at once
gratified and embarrassed by a development in Western science
which could possibly put this unitive vision of the world, by
almost shockingly easy means, within the reach of many who have
thus far sought it in vain by traditional methods. </p>

<p> Part of the genius of Western science is that it finds
simpler and more rational ways of doing things that were formerly
chancy or laborious. Like any inventive process, it does not
always make these discoveries systematically; often it just
stumbles upon them, but then goes on to work them into an
intelligible order. In medicine, for example, science isolates
the essential drug from the former witch-doctor's brew of
salamanders, mugwort, powdered skulls, and dried blood. The
purified drug cures more surely, <i>but</i>---it does not
perpetuate health. The patient still has to change habits of life
or diet which made him prone to the disease. </p>

<p> Is it possible, then, that Western science could provide a
medicine which would at least give the human organism a start in
releasing itself from its chronic self-contradiction? The
medicine might indeed have to be supported by other
procedures---psychotherapy, &quot;spiritual&quot; disciplines,
and basic changes in one's pattern of life---but every diseased
person seems to need some kind of initial lift to set him on the
way to health. The question is by no means absurd if it is true
that what afflicts us is a sickness not just of the mind but of
the organism, of the very functioning of the nervous system and
the brain. Is there, in short, a medicine which can give us
temporarily the sensation of being integrated, of being fully one
with ourselves and with nature as the biologist knows us,
theoretically, to be? If so, the experience might offer clues to
whatever else must be done to bring about full and continuous
integration. It might be at least the tip of an Ariadne's thread
to lead us out of the maze in which all of us are lost from our
infancy. </p>

<p> Relatively recent research suggests that there are at least
three such medicines, though none is an infallible
&quot;specific.&quot; They work with some people, and much
depends upon the social and psychological context in which they
are given. Occasionally their effects may be harmful, but such
limitations do not deter us from using penicillin---often a far
more dangerous chemical than any of these three. I am speaking,
of course, of mescaline (the active ingredient of the peyote
cactus), lysergic acid diethylamide (a modified ergot alkaloid),
and psilocybin (a derivative of the mushroom <i>Psilocybe
mexicana</i>). </p>

<p> The peyote cactus has long been used by the Indians of the
Southwest and Mexico as a means of communion with the divine
world, and today the eating of the dried buttons of the plant is
the principal sacrament of an Indian church known as the Native
American Church of the United States ---by all accounts a most
respectable and Christian organization. At the end of the
nineteenth century its effects were first described by Weir
Mitchell and Havelock Ellis, and some years later its active
ingredient was identified as mescaline, a chemical of the amine
group which is quite easily synthesized. </p>

<p> Lysergic acid diethylamide was first discovered in 1938 by
the Swiss pharmacologist A. Hofmann in the course of studying the
properties of the ergot fungus. Quite by accident he absorbed a
small amount of this acid while making certain changes in its
molecular structure, and noticed its peculiar psychological
effects. Further research proved that he had hit upon the most
powerful consciousness-changing drug now known, for LSD-25 (as it
is called for short) will produce its characteristic results in
so minute a dosage as 20 micrograms, 1/700,000,000 of an average
man's weight. </p>

<p> Psilocybin is derived from another of the sacred plants of
the Mexican Indians---a type of mushroom known to them as <i>teonanacatl,</i>
&quot;the flesh of God.&quot; Following Robert Weitlaner's
discovery in 1936 that the cult of &quot;the sacred
mushroom&quot; was still prevalent in Oaxaca, a number of
mycologists, as specialists in mushrooms are known, began to make
studies of the mushrooms of this region. Three varieties were
found to be in use. In addition to <i>Psilocybe mexicana</i>
there were also <i>Psilocybe aztecorum</i> Heim and <i>Psilocybe
wassonii</i>, named respectively after the mycologists Roger Heim
and Gordon and Valentina Wasson, who took part in the ceremonies
of the cult. </p>

<p> Despite a very considerable amount of research and
speculation, little is known of the exact physiological effect of
these chemicals upon the nervous system. The subjective effects
of all three tend to be rather similar, though LSD-25, perhaps
because of the minute dosage required, seldom produces the
nauseous reactions so often associated with the other two. All
the scientific papers I have read seem to add up to the vague
impression that in some way these drugs suspend certain
inhibitory or selective processes in the nervous system so as to
render our sensory apparatus more open to impressions than is
usual. Our ignorance of the precise effect of these drugs is, of
course, linked to the still rather fumbling state of our
knowledge of the brain. Such ignorance obviously suggests great
caution in their use, but thus far there is no evidence that, in
normal dosage, there is any likelihood of physiological damage.<a
name="back1"></a><a href="#foot1">*</a> </p>

<p> In a very wide sense of the word, each of these substances is
a drug, but one must avoid the serious semantic error of
confusing them with drugs which induce physical craving for
repeated use or which dull the senses like alcohol or the
sedatives. They are classed, officially, as hallucinogens---an
astonishingly inaccurate term, since they cause one neither to
hear voices nor to see visions such as might be confused with
physical reality. While they do indeed produce the most complex
and very obviously &quot;hallucinatory&quot; patterns before
closed eyes, their general effect is to sharpen the senses to a
supernormal degree of awareness. The standard dosage of each
substance maintains its effects for from five to eight hours, and
the experience is often so deeply revealing and moving that one
hesitates to approach it again until it has been thoroughly
&quot;digested,&quot; and this may be a matter of months. </p>

<p> The reaction of most cultured people to the idea of gaining
any deep psychological or philosophical insight through a drug is
that it is much too simple, too artificial, and even too banal to
be seriously considered. A wisdom which can be &quot;turned
on&quot; like the switch of a lamp seems to insult human dignity
and degrade us to chemical automata. One calls to mind pictures
of a brave new world in which there is a class of synthesized
Buddhas, of people who have been &quot;fixed&quot; like the
lobotomized, the sterilized, or the hypnotized, only in another
direction---people who have somehow lost their humanity and with
whom, as with drunkards, one cannot really communicate. This is,
however, a somewhat ghoulish fantasy which has no relation to the
facts or to the experience itself. It belongs to the same kind of
superstitious dread which one feels for the unfamiliar, confusing
it with the unnatural---the way some people feel about Jews
because they are circumcised or even about Negroes because of
their &quot;alien&quot; features and color. </p>

<p> Despite the widespread and undiscriminating prejudice against
drugs as such, and despite the claims of certain religious
disciplines to be the sole means to genuine mystical insight, I
can find no essential difference between the experiences induced,
under favorable conditions, by these chemicals and the states of
&quot;cosmic consciousness&quot; recorded by R. M. Bucke, William
James, Evelyn Underhill, Raynor Johnson, and other investigators
of mysticism. &quot;Favorable conditions&quot; means a setting
which is socially and physically congenial; ideally this would be
some sort of retreat house (not a hospital or sanitarium)
supervised by religiously oriented psychiatrists or
psychologists. The atmosphere should be homelike rather than
clinical, and it is of the utmost importance that the
supervisor's attitude be supportive and sympathetic. Under
insecure, bizarre, or unfriendly circumstances the experience can
easily degenerate into a highly unpleasant paranoia. Two days
should be set aside---one for the experience itself, which lasts
for six or eight hours, and one for evaluation in the calm and
relaxed frame of mind that normally follows. </p>

<p> This is simply to say that the use of such powerful medicines
is not to be taken lightly, as one smokes a cigarette or tosses
down a cocktail. They should be approached as one approaches a
sacrament, though not with the peculiar inhibition of gaiety and
humor that has become customary in our religious rituals. It is a
sound general rule that there should always be present some
qualified supervisor to provide a point of contact with
&quot;reality&quot; as it is socially defined. Ideally the
&quot;qualified supervisor&quot; should be a psychiatrist or
clinical psychologist who has himself experienced the effects of
the drug, though I have observed that many who are technically
qualified have a frightened awe of unusual states of
consciousness which is apt to communicate itself, to the
detriment of the experience, to those under their care. The most
essential qualification of the supervisor is, therefore,
confidence in the situation---which is likewise &quot;picked
up&quot; by people in the state of acute sensitivity that the
drugs induce. </p>

<p> The drugs in question are not aphrodisiacs, and when they are
taken in common by a small group the atmosphere is not in the
least suggestive of a drunken brawl nor of the communal torpor of
an opium den. Members of the group usually become open to each
other with a high degree of friendly affection, for in the
mystical phase of the experience the underlying unity or
&quot;belongingness&quot; of the members can have all the clarity
of a physical sensation. Indeed the social situation may become
what religious bodies aim at, but all too rarely achieve, in
their rites of communion---a relationship of the most vivid
understanding, forgiveness, and love. Of course, this does not
automatically become a permanent feeling, but neither does the
sense of fellowship sometimes evoked in strictly religious
gatherings. The experience corresponds almost exactly to the
theological concept of a sacrament or means of grace---an
unmerited gift of spiritual power whose lasting effects depend
upon the use made of it in subsequent action. Catholic theology
also recognizes those so-called &quot;extraordinary&quot; graces,
often of mystical insight, which descend spontaneously outside
the ordinary or regular means that the Church provides through
the sacraments and the disciplines of prayer. It seems to me that
only special pleading can maintain that the graces mediated
through mushrooms, cactus plants, and scientists are artificial
and spurious in contrast with those which come through religious
discipline. Claims for the exclusive virtue of one's own brand
is, alas, as common in organized religion as in commerce, coupled
in the former instance with the puritan's sense of guilt in
enjoying anything for which he has not suffered. </p>

<p> When I wrote this book, I was well aware that LSD in
particular might become a public scandal, especially in the
United States where we had the precedents of Prohibition and of
fantastically punitive laws against the use of marijuana---laws
passed with hardly a pretense of scientific investigation of the
drug, and amazingly foisted upon many other nations. That was
nine years ago ( 1961 ) and since then all that I feared would
happen has happened. I ask myself whether I should ever have
written this book, whether I was profaning the mysteries and
casting pearls before swine. I reasoned, however, that since
Huxley and others had already let the secret out, it was up to me
to encourage a positive, above-board, fearless, and intelligent
approach to what are now known as psychedelic chemicals. </p>

<p> But in vain. Thousands of young people, fed up with
standard-brand religions which provided nothing but talk,
admonition, and (usually) bad ritual, rushed immediately to LSD
and other psychedelics in search of some key to genuine religious
experience. As might be expected, there were accidents. A few
potential psychotics were pushed over the brink, usually because
they took LSD in uncontrolled circumstances, in excessive dosage,
or in the arid and threatening atmosphere of hospital research
run by psychiatrists who imagined that they were investigating
artificially induced schizophrenia. Because most news is bad
news, these accidents received full coverage in the press, to the
relative exclusion of reports on the overwhelming majority of
such splendid and memorable experiences as I describe further on.
A divorce is news; a happy marriage isn't. There were even
deliberately falsified stories in the newspapers, as that several
young men taking LSD stared at the sun for so long that they
became blind. Phychiatrists raised alarms about &quot;brain
damage,&quot; for which no solid evidence was ever produced, and
warnings were issued about its destructive effect on the genes,
which was later shown to be insignificant and more or less the
same as the effects of coffee and aspirin. </p>

<p> In view of this public hysteria the Sandoz Company, which
held a patent on LSD, withdrew it from the market. At the same
time the United States government, having learned absolutely
nothing from the disaster of Prohibition, simply banned LSD (
allowing its use only in some few research projects sponsored by
the National Institute of Mental Health and by the Army, in its
investigations of chemical warfare) and turned over its control
to the police. </p>

<p> Now a law against LSD is simply unenforceable because the
substance is tasteless and colorless, because effective dosages
can be confined, in vast amounts, to minute spaces, and because
it can be disguised as almost anything drinkable or eatable from
gin to blotting paper. Thus as soon as the reliable Sandoz
material was withdrawn, amateur chemists began to produce
black-market LSD in immense quantities---LSD of uncertain quality
and dosage, often mixed with such other ingredients as
methedrine, belladonna, and heroin. Consequently the number of
psychotic episodes resulting from its use began to increase,
aggravated by the fact that, in improperly controlled situations
and under threat from the police, the LSD taker is an easy victim
of extreme paranoia. At the same time, some of these amateurs,
mainly graduate students in chemistry with a mission to
&quot;turn people on,&quot; produced some tolerably good LSD.
Thus there were still so many more positive experiences than
negative that fascination with this alchemy continued and
expanded, and though the general public associates its use with
hippies and college students, it has been very widely used by
mature adults ---doctors, lawyers, clergymen, artists,
businessmen, professors, and levelheaded housewives. </p>

<p> The blanket suppression of LSD and other psychedelics has
been a complete disaster in that ( 1 ) it has seriously hindered
proper research on these drugs; (2) it has created a profitable
black market by raising the price; (3) it has embarrassed the
police with an impossible assignment; (4) it has created the
false fascination with fruit that is forbidden; (5) it has
seriously impeded the normal work of courts of justice, and
herded thousands of non-criminal types of people into already
overcrowded prisons, which, as everyone knows, are schools for
sodomy and for crime as a profession; ( 6 ) it has made users of
psychedelics more susceptible to paranoia than ever. <a
name="back2"></a><a href="#foot2">**</a> </p>

<p> What, then, are the true dangers of real LSD? Principally
that it may trigger a short- or long-term psychosis in anyone
susceptible, and, despite all our techniques for psychological
and neurological testing, we can never detect a potential
psychotic with certainty. Anyone contemplating the use of a
psychedelic chemical should weigh this risk carefully: there is a
slight chance of becoming, at least temporarily, insane. The risk
is probably much greater than in traveling by a commercial
airline, but considerably less than in traveling by road. Every
household contains things of potential danger: electricity,
matches, gas, kitchen knives, carbon tetrachloride (cleaning
fluid), ammonia, aerosol sprayers, alcohol, slippery bathtubs,
sliding rugs, rifles, lawn mowers, axes, plate-glass doors, and
swimming pools. There are no laws against the sale and possession
of such things, nor is one prevented from cultivating <i>Amanita
pantherina</i> (the most deceptive and poisonous mushroom),
deadly nightshade, laburnum, morning-glory, wood rose, Scotch
broom, and many other poisonous or psychedelic plants. </p>

<p> One of the most sensible tenets of Jewish and ( at least
theoretically) of Christian theology is that no substance or
creature is, in itself, evil. Evil arises only in its abuse---in
killing someone with a knife, committing arson with matches, or
running down a pedestrian while driving alcoholized. (But note
that a highly depressed, anxious, or angry driver is just as
dangerous, for his attention is not on the road. ) It seems to me
a sound legal principle that people should be prosecuted only for
overt and clearly specifiable deeds, damaging or clearly intended
to damage life, limb, and property. Laws which proscribe the mere
sale, purchase, or possession of substances ( aside from machine
guns and bombs ) which might be used in some harmful way invite
the worst abuses of police power for political ends or for the
harassment of unpopular individuals. (How easy to plant some
marijuana on an unwanted competitor in business!) All such
sumptuary laws (regulating private morals and creating crimes
without unwilling victims ) are attempts to make personal freedom
foolproof and without risk, and thus to deprive the individual of
responsibility for his own life and of taking calculated risk for
the achievement of political, social, athletic, scientific, or
religious objectives which he feels well worth the dangers. </p>

<p> Adventurous and creative people have always been willing, and
have usually been encouraged, to take the most serious risks in
the exploration of the outer world and in the development of
scientific and technological skill. Many young people now feel
that the time has come to explore the inner world, and are
willing to take the unfamiliar risks which it involves. They,
too, should be encouraged and also assisted with all the care and
wisdom at our disposal. Why permit the purely athletic <i>tour de
force</i> of climbing Everest (using oxygen) and forbid the
spiritual adventure of ascending Mount Sumeru, Mount Zion, or
Mount Analogue (using psychedelics)? </p>

<p> Superficially, the public and official fear of psychedelic
drugs is based on uninformed association with such addictive
poisons as heroin, amphetamines, and barbiturates. But drinking
coffee or whisky is also &quot;using drugs,&quot; and this is
allowed even though the effects may be harmful and the creative
results negligible. Psychedelic drugs are feared, basically, for
the same reason that mystical experience has been feared,
discouraged, and even condemned in the Catholic, Protestant, and
Islamic orthodoxies. It leads to disenchantment and apathy toward
the approved social rewards of status and success, to chuckles at
pretentiousness and pomposity, and, worse, to disbelief in the
Church-and-State dogma that we are all God's adopted orphans or
fluky little germs in a mechanical and mindless universe. No
authoritarian government, whether ecclesiastical or secular, can
tolerate the apprehension that each one of us is God in disguise,
and that our real inmost, outmost, and utmost Self cannot be
killed. That's why they had to do away with Jesus. </p>

<p> Thus the possibility that even a preliminary glimpse of this
apprehension is available through taking a pill or chewing a
plant threatens mystical experience for the millions---that is,
masses of people who will be difficult to rule by force of
&quot;authority.&quot; It is even now being recognized in the
United States that the real danger of psychedelics is not so much
neurological as political---that &quot;turned-on&quot; people are
not interested in serving the power games of the present rulers.
Looking at the successful men, they see completely boring lives. </p>

<p> In the Epilogue I shall make it clear that psychedelic
experience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight, but a
glimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways of
meditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. When
you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are
simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones.
The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the
microscope; he goes away and works on what he has seen. </p>

<p> Furthermore, speaking quite strictly, mystical insight is no
more in the chemical itself than biological knowledge is in the
microscope. There is no difference in principle between
sharpening perception with an external instrument, such as a
microscope, and sharpening it with an internal instrument, such
as one of these three drugs. If they are an affront to the
dignity of the mind, the microscope is an affront to the dignity
of the eye and the telephone to the dignity of the ear. Strictly
speaking, these drugs do not impart wisdom at all, any more than
the microscope alone gives knowledge. They provide the raw
materials of wisdom, and are useful to the extent that the
individual can integrate what they reveal into the whole pattern
of his behavior and the whole system of his knowledge. As an
escape, an isolated and dissociated ecstasy, they may have the
same sort of value as a rest cure or a good entertainment. But
this is like using a giant computer to play tick-tack-toe, and
the hours of heightened perception are wasted unless occupied
with sustained reflection or meditation upon whatever themes may
be suggested. </p>

<p> The nearest thing I know in literature to the reflective use
of one of these drugs is the so-called Bead Game in Hermann
Hesse's <i>Magister Ludi (Das Glasperlenspiel)</i>. Hesse writes
of a distant future in which an order of scholar-mystics have
discovered an ideographic language which can relate all the
branches of science and art, philosophy and religion. The game
consists in playing with the relationships between configurations
in these various fields in the same way that the musician plays
with harmonic and contrapuntal relationships. From such elements
as the design of a Chinese house, a Scarlatti sonata, a
topological formula, and a verse from the <i>Upanishads,</i> the
players will elucidate a common theme and develop its application
in numerous directions. No two games are the same, for not only
do the elements differ, but also there is no thought of
attempting to force a static and uniform order upon the world.
The universal language facilitates the perception of
relationships but does not fix them, and is founded upon a
&quot;musical&quot; conception of the world in which order is as
dynamic and changing as the patterns of sound in a fugue. </p>

<p> Similarly, in my investigations of LSD or psilocybin, I
usually started with some such theme as polarity, transformation
(as of food into organism), competition for survival, the
relation of the abstract to the concrete, or of Logos to Eros,
and then allowed my heightened perception to elucidate the theme
in terms of certain works of art or music, of some natural object
as a fern, a flower, or a sea shell, of a religious or
mythological archetype (it might be the Mass), and even of
personal relationships with those who happened to be with me at
the time. Or I would concentrate upon one of the senses and try,
as it were, to turn it back upon itself so as to see the process
of seeing, and from this move on to trying to know knowing, so
approaching the problem of my own identity. </p>

<p> From these reflections there arise intuitive insights of
astonishing clarity, and because there is little difficulty in
remembering them after the effects of the drug have ceased
(especially if they are recorded or written down at the time),
the days or weeks following may be used for testing them by the
normal standards of logical, aesthetic, philosophical, or
scientific criticism. As might be expected, some prove to be
valid and others not. It is the same with the sudden hunches that
come to the artist or inventor in the ordinary way; they are not
always as true or as applicable as they seem to be in the
movement of illumination. The drugs appear to give an enormous
impetus to the creative intuition, and thus to be of more value
for constructive invention and research than for psychotherapy in
the ordinary sense of &quot;adjusting&quot; the disturbed
personality. Their best sphere of use is not the mental hospital
but the studio and the laboratory, or the institute of advanced
studies. </p>

<p> The following pages make no attempt to be a scientific report
on the effects of these chemicals, with the usual details of
dosage, time and place, physical symptoms, and the like. Such
documents exist by the thousand, and, in view of our very
rudimentary knowledge of the brain, seem to me to have a rather
limited value. As well try to understand a book by dissolving it
in solution and popping it into a centrifuge. My object is rather
to give some impression of the new world of consciousness which
these substances reveal. I do not believe that this world is
either a hallucination or an unimpeachable revelation of truth.
It is probably the way things appear when certain inhibitory
processes of the brain and senses are suspended, but this is a
world in some ways so unfamiliar that it is liable to
misinterpretation. Our first impressions may be as wide of the
mark as those of the traveler in an unfamiliar country or of
astronomers taking their first look at the galaxies beyond our
own. </p>

<p> I have written this account as if the whole experience had
happened on one day in a single place, but it is in fact a
composite of several occasions. Except where I am describing
visions before closed eyes, and this is always specified, none of
these experiences are hallucinations. They are simply changed
ways of seeing, interpreting, and reacting to actual persons and
events in the world of &quot;public reality,&quot; which, for
purposes of this description, is a country estate on the West
Coast of America with garden. orchard, barns, and surrounding
mountains---all just as described, including the rattletrap car
loaded with junk. Consciousness-changing drugs are popularly
associated with the evocation of bizarre and fantastic images,
but in my own experience this happens only with closed eyes.
Otherwise, it is simply that the natural world is endowed with a
richness of grace, color, significance, and, sometimes, humor,
for which our normal adjectives are insufficient. The speed of
thought and association is increased so astonishingly that it is
hard for words to keep pace with the flood of ideas that come to
mind. Passages that may strike the reader as ordinary
philosophical reflection are reports of what, at the time, appear
to be the most tangible certainties. So, too, images that appear
before closed eyes are not just figments of imagination, but
patterns and scenes so intense and autonomous that they seem to
be physically present. The latter have, however, proved of less
interest to me than one's transformed impression of the natural
world and the heightened speed of associative thought, and it is
thus with these that the following account is chiefly concerned.</p>

<h2>The Joyous Cosmology</h2>

<hr>

<p> T0 BEGIN WITH, this world has a different kind of time. It is
the time of biological rhythm, not of the clock and all that goes
with the clock. There is no hurry. Our sense of time is
notoriously subjective and thus dependent upon the quality of our
attention, whether of interest or boredom, and upon the alignment
of our behavior in terms of routines, goals, and deadlines. Here
the present is self-sufficient, but it is not a static present.
It is a dancing present---the unfolding of a pattern which has no
specific destination in the future but is simply its own point.
It leaves and arrives simultaneously, and the seed is as much the
goal as the flower. There is therefore time to perceive every
detail of the movement with infinitely greater richness of
articulation. Normally we do not so much look at things as
overlook them. The eye sees types and classes---flower, leaf,
rock, bird, fire---mental pictures of things rather than things,
rough outlines filled with flat color, always a little dusty and
dim. </p>

<p> But here the depth of light and structure in a bursting bud
go on forever. There is time to see them, time for the whole
intricacy of veins and capillaries to develop in consciousness,
time to see down and down into the shape of greenness, which is
not green at all, but a whole spectrum generalizing itself as
green---purple, gold, the sunlit turquoise of the ocean, the
intense luminescence of the emerald. I cannot decide where shape
ends and color begins. The bud has opened and the fresh leaves
fan out and curve back with a gesture which is unmistakably
communicative but does not say anything except, &quot;Thus!&quot;
And somehow that is quite satisfactory, even startlingly clear.
The meaning is transparent in the same way that the color and the
texture are transparent, with light which does not seem to fall
upon surfaces from above but to be right inside the structure and
color. Which is of course where it is, for light is an
inseparable trinity of sun, object, and eye, and the chemistry of
the leaf is its color, its light. </p>

<p> But at the same time color and light are the gift of the eye
to the leaf and the sun. Transparency is the property of the
eyeball, projected outward as luminous space, interpreting quanta
of energy in terms of the gelatinous fibers in the head. I begin
to feel that the world is at once inside my head and outside it,
and the two, inside and outside, begin to include or
&quot;cap&quot; one another like an infinite series of concentric
spheres. I am unusually aware that everything I am sensing is
also my body---that light, color, shape, sound, and texture are
terms and properties of the brain conferred upon the outside
world. I am not looking at the world, not confronting it; I am
knowing it by a continuous process of transforming it into
myself, so that everything around me, the whole globe of space,
no longer feels away from me but in the middle. </p>

<p> This is at first confusing. I am not quite sure of the
direction from which sounds come. The visual space seems to
reverberate with them as if it were a drum. The surrounding hills
rumble with the sound of a truck, and the rumble and the
color-shape of the hills become one and the same gesture. I use
that word deliberately and shall use it again. The hills are
moving into their stillness. They mean something because they are
being transformed into my brain, and my brain is an organ of
meaning. The forests of redwood trees upon them look like green
fire, and the copper gold of the sun-dried grass heaves immensely
into the sky. Time is so slow as to be a kind of eternity, and
the flavor of eternity transfers itself to the hills---burnished
mountains which I seem to remember from an immeasurably distant
past, at once so unfamiliar as to be exotic and yet as familiar
as my own hand. Thus transformed into consciousness, into the
electric, interior luminosity of the nerves, the world seems
vaguely insubstantial--- developed upon a color film, resounding
upon the skin of a drum, pressing, not with weight, but with
vibrations interpreted as weight. Solidity is a neurological
invention, and, I wonder, can the nerves be solid to themselves?
Where do we begin? Does the order of the brain create the order
of the world, or the order of the world the brain? The two seem
like egg and hen, or like back and front. </p>

<p> The physical world is vibration, quanta, but vibrations of
what? To the eye, form and color; to the ear, sound; to the nose,
scent; to the fingers, touch. But these are all different
languages for the same thing, different qualities of sensitivity,
different dimensions of consciousness. The question, &quot;Of
what are they differing forms?&quot; seems to have no meaning.
What is light to the eye is sound to the ear. I have the image of
the senses being terms, forms, or dimensions not of one thing
common to all, but of each other, locked in a circle of
mutuality. Closely examined, shape becomes color, which becomes
vibration, which becomes sound, which becomes smell, which
becomes taste, and then touch, and then again shape. (One can
see, for example, that the shape of a leaf is its color. There is
no outline around the leaf; the outline is the limit where one
colored surface becomes another.) I see all these sensory
dimensions as a round dance, gesticulations of one pattern being
transformed into gesticulations of another. And these
gesticulations are flowing through a space that has still other
dimensions, which I want to describe as tones of emotional color,
of light or sound being joyous or fearful, gold elated or lead
depressed. These, too, form a circle of reciprocity, a round
spectrum so polarized that we can only describe each in terms of
the others. </p>

<p> Sometimes the image of the physical world is not so much a
dance of gestures as a woven texture. Light, sound, touch, taste,
and smell become a continuous warp, with the feeling that the
whole dimension of sensation is a single continuum or field.
Crossing the warp is a woof representing the dimension of
meaning---moral and aesthetic values, personal or individual
uniqueness, logical significance, and expressive form---and the
two dimensions interpenetrate so as to make distinguishable
shapes seem like ripples in the water of sensation. The warp and
the woof stream together, for the weaving is neither flat nor
static but a many-directioned cross-flow of impulses filling the
whole volume of space. I feel that the world is on something in
somewhat the same way that a color photograph is on a film,
underlying and connecting the patches of color, though the film
here is a dense rain of energy. I see that what it is on is my
brain---&quot;that enchanted loom,&quot; as Sherrington called
it. Brain and world, warp of sense and woof of meaning, seem to
interpenetrate inseparably. They hold their boundaries or limits
in common in such a way as to define one another and to be
impossible without each other.</p>

<hr>

<p> I am listening to the music of an organ. As leaves seemed to
gesture, the organ seems quite literally to speak. There is no
use of the <i>vox humana</i> stop, but every sound seems to issue
from a vast human throat, moist with saliva. As, with the base
pedals, the player moves slowly down the scale, the sounds seem
to blow forth in immense, gooey spludges. As I listen more
carefully, the spludges acquire texture---expanding circles of
vibration finely and evenly toothed like combs, no longer moist
and liquidinous like the living throat, but mechanically
discontinuous. The sound disintegrates into the innumerable
individual <i>drrrits</i> of vibration. Listening on, the gaps
close, or perhaps each individual <i>drrrit</i> becomes in its
turn a spludge. The liquid and the hard, the continuous and the
discontinuous, the gooey and the prickly, seem to be
transformations of each other, or to be different levels of
magnification upon the same thing. </p>

<p> This theme recurs in a hundred different ways---the
inseparable polarity of opposites, or the mutuality and
reciprocity of all the possible contents of consciousness. It is
easy to see theoretically that all perception is of
contrasts---figure and ground, light and shadow, clear and vague,
firm and weak. But normal attention seems to have difficulty in
taking in both at once. Both sensuously and conceptually we seem
to move serially from one to the other; we do not seem to be able
to attend to the figure without relative unconsciousness of the
ground. But in this new world the mutuality of things is quite
clear at every level. The human face, for example, becomes clear
in all its aspects---the total form together with each single
hair and wrinkle. Faces become all ages at once, for
characteristics that suggest age also suggest youth by
implication; the bony structure suggesting the skull evokes
instantly the newborn infant. The associative couplings of the
brain seem to fire simultaneously instead of one at a time,
projecting a view of life which may be terrifying in its
ambiguity or joyous in its integrity. </p>

<p> Decision can be completely paralyzed by the sudden
realization that there is no way of having good without evil, or
that it is impossible to act upon reliable authority without
choosing, from your own inexperience, to do so. If sanity implies
madness and faith doubt, am I basically a psychotic pretending to
be sane, a blithering terrified idiot who manages, temporarily,
to put on an act of being self-possessed? I begin to see my whole
life as a masterpiece of duplicity---the confused, helpless,
hungry, and hideously sensitive little embryo at the root of me
having learned, step by step, to comply, placate, bully, wheedle,
flatter, bluff, and cheat my way into being taken for a person of
competence and reliability. For when it really comes down to it,
what do any of us know?</p>

<hr>

<p> I am listening to a priest chanting the Mass and a choir of
nuns responding. His mature, cultivated voice rings with the
serene authority of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic
Church, of the Faith once and for all delivered to the saints,
and the nuns respond, naively it seems, with childlike, utterly
innocent devotion. But, listening again, I can hear the priest
&quot;putting on&quot; his voice, hear the inflated, pompous
balloon, the studiedly unctuous tones of a master deceptionist
who has the poor little nuns, kneeling in their stalls,
completely cowed. Listen deeper. The nuns are not cowed at all.
They are playing possum. With just a little stiffening, the limp
gesture of bowing turns into the gesture of the closing claw.
With too few men to go around, the nuns know what is good for
them: how to bend and survive. </p>

<p> But this profoundly cynical view of things is only an
intermediate stage. I begin to congratulate the priest on his
gamesmanship, on the sheer courage of being able to put up such a
performance of authority when he knows precisely nothing. Perhaps
there is no other knowing than the mere competence of the act.
If, at the heart of one's being, there is no real self to which
one ought to be true, sincerity is simply nerve; it lies in the
unabashed vigor of the pretense. </p>

<p> But pretense is only pretense when it is assumed that the act
is not true to the agent. Find the agent. In the priest's voice I
hear down at the root the primordial howl of the beast in the
jungle, but it has been inflected, complicated, refined, and
textured with centuries of culture. Every new twist, every
additional subtlety, was a fresh gambit in the game of making the
original howl more effective. At first, crude and unconcealed,
the cry for food or mate, or just noise for the fun of it, making
the rocks echo. Then rhythm to enchant. then changes of tone to
plead or threaten. Then words to specify the need, to promise and
bargain. And then, much later, the gambits of indirection. The
feminine stratagem of stooping to conquer, the claim to superior
worth in renouncing the world for the spirit, the cunning of
weakness proving stronger than the might of muscle---and the meek
inheriting the earth. </p>

<p> As I listen, then, I can hear in that one voice the
simultaneous presence of all the levels of man's history, as of
all the stages of life before man. Every step in the game becomes
as clear as the rings in a severed tree. But this is an ascending
hierarchy of maneuvers, of stratagems capping stratagems, all
symbolized in the overlays of refinement beneath which the
original howl is still sounding. Sometimes the howl shifts from
the mating call of the adult animal to the helpless crying of the
baby, and I feel all man's music---its pomp and circumstance, its
gaiety, its awe, its confident solemnity---as just so much
complication and concealment of baby wailing for mother. And as I
want to cry with pity, I know I am sorry for myself. I, as an
adult, am also back there alone in the dark, just as the
primordial howl is still present beneath the sublime modulations
of the chant. </p>

<p> You poor baby! And yet---you selfish little bastard! As I try
to find the agent behind the act, the motivating force at the
bottom of the whole thing, I seem to see only an endless
ambivalence. Behind the mask of love I find my innate
selfishness. What a predicament I am in if someone asks, &quot;Do
you really love me?&quot; I can't say yes without saying no, for
the only answer that will really satisfy is, &quot;Yes, I love
you so much I could eat you! My love for you is identical with my
love for myself. I love you with the purest selfishness.&quot; No
one wants to be loved out of a sense of duty. </p>

<p> So I will be very frank. &quot;Yes, I am pure, selfish desire
and I love you because you make me feel wonderful---at any rate
for the time being.&quot; But then I begin to wonder whether
there isn't something a bit cunning in this frankness. It is big
of me to be so sincere, to make a play for her by not pretending
to be more than I am---unlike the other guys who say they love
her for herself. I see that there is always something insincere
about trying to be sincere, as if I were to say openly, &quot;The
statement that I am now making is a lie.&quot; There seems to be
something phony about every attempt to define myself, to be
totally honest. The trouble is that I can't see the back, much
less the inside, of my head. I can't be honest because I don't
fully know what I am. Consciousness peers out from a center which
it cannot see---and <i>that</i> is the root of the matter. </p>

<p> Life seems to resolve itself down to a tiny germ or nipple of
sensitivity. I call it the Eenie-Weenie---a squiggling little
nucleus that is trying to make love to itself and can never quite
get there. The whole fabulous complexity of vegetable and animal
life, as of human civilization, is just a colossal elaboration of
the Eenie-Weenie trying to make the Eenie-Weenie. I am in love
with myself, but cannot seek myself without hiding myself. As I
pursue my own tail, it runs away from me. Does the amoeba split
itself in two in an attempt to solve this problem? </p>

<p> I try to go deeper, sinking thought and feeling down and down
to their ultimate beginnings. What do I mean by loving myself? In
what form do I know myself? Always, it seems, in the form of
something other, something strange. The landscape I am watching
is also a state of myself, of the neurons in my head. I feel the
rock in my hand in terms of my own fingers. And nothing is
stranger than my own body---the sensation of the pulse, the eye
seen through a magnifying glass in the mirror, the shock of
realizing that oneself is something in the external world. At
root, there is simply no way of separating self from other,
self-love from other-love. All knowledge of self is knowledge of
other, and all knowledge of other knowledge of self. I begin to
see that self and other, the familiar and the strange, the
internal and the external, the predictable and the unpredictable <i>imply</i>
each other. One is seek and the other is hide, and the more I
become aware of their implying each other, the more I feel them
to be one with each other. I become curiously affectionate and
intimate with all that seemed alien. In the features of
everything foreign, threatening, terrifying, incomprehensible,
and remote I begin to recognize myself. Yet this is a
&quot;myself&quot; which I seem to be remembering from long, long
ago---not at all my empirical ego of yesterday, not my specious
personality. </p>

<p> The &quot;myself&quot; which I am beginning to recognize,
which I had forgotten but actually know better than anything
else, goes far back beyond my childhood, beyond the time when
adults confused me and tried to tell me that I was someone else;
when, because they were bigger and stronger, they could terrify
me with their imaginary fears and bewilder and outface me in the
complicated game that I had not yet learned. (The sadism of the
teacher explaining the game and yet having to prove his
superiority in it.) Long before all that, long before I was an
embryo in my mother's womb, there looms the ever-so-familiar
stranger, the everything not me, which I recognize, with a joy
immeasurably more intense than a meeting of lovers separated by
centuries, to be my original self. The good old sonofabitch who
got me involved in this whole game. </p>

<p> At the same time everyone and everything around me takes on
the feeling of having been there always, and then forgotten, and
then remembered again. We are sitting in a garden surrounded in
every direction by uncultivated hills, a garden of fuchsias and
hummingbirds in a valley that leads down to the westernmost
ocean, and where the gulls take refuge in storms. At some time in
the middle of the twentieth century, upon an afternoon in the
summer, we are sitting around a table on the terrace, eating dark
homemade bread and drinking white wine. And yet we seem to have
been there forever, for the people with me are no longer the
humdrum and harassed little personalities with names, addresses,
and social security numbers, the specifically dated mortals we
are all pretending to be. They appear rather as immortal
archetypes of themselves without, however, losing their humanity.
It is just that their differing characters seem, like the
priest's voice, to contain all history; they are at once unique
and eternal, men and women but also gods and goddesses. For now
that we have time to look at each other we become timeless. The
human form becomes immeasurably precious and, as if to symbolize
this, the eyes become intelligent jewels, the hair spun gold, and
the flesh translucent ivory. Between those who enter this world
together there is also a love which is distinctly eucharistic, an
acceptance of each other's natures from the heights to the
depths. </p>

<p> Ella, who planted the garden, is a beneficent
Circe---sorceress, daughter of the moon, familiar of cats and
snakes, herbalist and healer---with the youngest old face one has
ever seen, exquisitely wrinkled, silver-black hair rippled like
flames. Robert is a manifestation of Pan, but a Pan of bulls
instead of the Pan of goats, with frizzled short hair tufted into
blunt horns ---a man all sweating muscle and body, incarnation of
exuberant glee. Beryl, his wife, is a nymph who has stepped out
of the forest, a mermaid of the land with swinging hair and a
dancing body that seems to be naked even when clothed. It is her
bread that we are eating, and it tastes like the Original Bread
of which mother's own bread was a bungled imitation. And then
there is Mary, beloved in the usual, dusty world, but in this
world an embodiment of light and gold, daughter of the sun, with
eyes formed from the evening sky---a creature of all ages, baby,
moppet, maid, matron, crone, and corpse, evoking love of all
ages. </p>

<p> I try to find words that will suggest the numinous,
mythological quality of these people. Yet at the same time they
are as familiar as if I had known them for centuries, or rather,
as if I were recognizing them again as lost friends whom I knew
at the beginning of time, from a country begotten before all
worlds. This is of course bound up with the recognition of my own
most ancient identity, older by far than the blind squiggling of
the Eenie-Weenie, as if the highest form that consciousness could
take had somehow been present at the very beginning of things.
All of us look at each other knowingly, for the feeling that we
knew each other in that most distant past conceals something
else---tacit, awesome, almost unmentionable ---the realization
that at the deep center of a time perpendicular to ordinary time
we are, and always have been, one. We acknowledge the marvelously
hidden plot, the master illusion, whereby we appear to be
different. </p>

<p> The shock of recognition. In the form of everything most
other, alien, and remote---the ever-receding galaxies, the
mystery of death, the terrors of disease and madness, the
foreign- feeling, gooseflesh world of sea monsters and spiders,
the queasy labyrinth of my own insides---in all these forms I
have crept up on myself and yelled &quot;Boo!&quot; I scare
myself out of my wits, and, while out of my wits, cannot remember
just how it happened. Ordinarily I am lost in a maze. I don't
know how I got here, for I have lost the thread and forgotten the
intricately convoluted system of passages through which the game
of hide-and-seek was pursued. (Was it the path I followed in
growing the circuits of my brain?) But now the principle of the
maze is clear. It is the device of something turning back upon
itself so as to seem to be other, and the turns have been so many
and so dizzyingly complex that I am quite bewildered. The
principle is that all dualities and opposites are not disjoined
but polar; they do not encounter and confront one another from
afar; they exfoliate from a common center. Ordinary thinking
conceals polarity and relativity because it employs <i>terms</i>,
the terminals or ends, the poles, neglecting what lies between
them. The difference of front and back, to be and not to be,
hides their unity and mutuality. </p>

<p> Now consciousness, sense perception, is always a sensation of
contrasts. It is a specialization in differences, in noticing,
and nothing is definable, classifiable, or noticeable except by
contrast with something else. But man does not live by
consciousness alone, for the linear, step-by-step,
contrast-by-contrast procedure of attention is quite inadequate
for organizing anything so complex as a living body. The body
itself has an &quot;omniscience&quot; which is unconscious, or
superconscious, just because it deals with relation instead of
contrast, with harmonies rather than discords. It
&quot;thinks&quot; or organizes as a plant grows, not as a
botanist describes its growth. This is why Shiva has ten arms,
for he represents the dance of life, the omnipotence of being
able to do innumerably many things at once. </p>

<p> In the type of experience I am describing, it seems that the
superconscious method of thinking becomes conscious. We see the
world as the whole body sees it, and for this very reason there
is the greatest difficulty in attempting to translate this mode
of vision into a form of language that is based on contrast and
classification. To the extent, then, that man has become a being
centered in consciousness, he has become centered in clash,
conflict, and discord. He ignores, as beneath notice, the
astounding perfection of his organism as a whole, and this is
why, in most people, there is such a deplorable disparity between
the intelligent and marvelous order of their bodies and the
trivial preoccupations of their consciousness. But in this other
world the situation is reversed. Ordinary people look like gods
because the values of the organism are uppermost, and the
concerns of consciousness fall back into the subordinate position
which they should properly hold. Love, unity, harmony, and
relationship therefore take precedence over war and division. </p>

<p> For what consciousness overlooks is the fact that all
boundaries and divisions are held in common by their opposite
sides and areas, so that when a boundary changes its shape both
sides move together. It is like the <i>yang-yin</i> symbol of the
Chinese---the black and white fishes divided by an S-curve
inscribed within a circle. The bulging head of one is the
narrowing tail of the other. But how much more difficult it is to
see that my skin and its movements belong both to me and to the
external world, or that the spheres of influence of different
human beings have common walls like so many rooms in a house, so
that the movement of my wall is also the movement of yours. You
can do what you like in your room just so long as I can do what I
like in mine. But each man's room is himself in his fullest
extension, so that my expansion is your contraction and vice
versa.</p>

<hr>

<p> I am looking at what I would ordinarily call a confusion of
bushes---a tangle of plants and weeds with branches and leaves
going every which way. But now that the organizing, relational
mind is uppermost I see that what is confusing is not the bushes
but my clumsy method of thinking. Every twig is in its proper
place, and the tangle has become an arabesque more delicately
ordered than the fabulous doodles in the margins of Celtic
manuscripts. In this same state of consciousness I have seen a
woodland at fall, with the whole multitude of almost bare
branches and twigs in silhouette against the sky, not as a
confusion, but as the lacework or tracery of an enchanted
jeweler. A rotten log bearing rows of fungus and patches of moss
became as precious as any work of Cellini---an inwardly luminous
construct of jet, amber, jade, and ivory, all the porous and
spongy disintegrations of the wood seeming to have been carved
out with infinite patience and skill. I do not know whether this
mode of vision organizes the world in the same way that it
organizes the body, or whether it is just that the natural world
is organized in that way. </p>

<p> A journey into this new mode of consciousness gives one a
marvelously enhanced appreciation of patterning in nature, a
fascination deeper than ever with the structure of ferns, the
formation of crystals, the markings upon sea shells, the
incredible jewelry of such unicellular creatures of the ocean as
the radiolaria, the fairy architecture of seeds and pods, the
engineering of bones and skeletons, the aerodynamics of feathers,
and the astonishing profusion of eye-forms upon the wings of
butterflies and birds. All this involved delicacy of organization
may, from one point of view, be strictly functional for the
purposes of reproduction and survival. But when you come down to
it, the survival of these creatures is the same as their very
existence---and what is that for? </p>

<p> More and more it seems that the ordering of nature is an art
akin to music---fugues in shell and cartilage, counterpoint in
fibers and capillaries, throbbing rhythm in waves of sound,
light, and nerve. And oneself is connected with it quite
inextricably---a node, a ganglion, an electronic interweaving of
paths, circuits, and impulses that stretch and hum through the
whole of time and space. The entire pattern swirls in its
complexity like smoke in sunbeams or the rippling networks of
sunlight in shallow water. Transforming itself endlessly into
itself, the pattern alone remains. The crosspoints, nodes, nets,
and curlicues vanish perpetually into each other. &quot;The
baseless fabric of this vision.&quot; It is its own base. When
the ground dissolves beneath me I float. </p>

<p> Closed-eye fantasies in this world seem sometimes to be
revelations of the secret workings of the brain, of the
associative and patterning processes, the ordering systems which
carry out all our sensing and thinking. Unlike the one I have
just described, they are for the most part ever more complex
variations upon a theme---ferns sprouting ferns sprouting ferns
in multidimensional spaces, vast kaleidoscopic domes of stained
glass or mosaic, or patterns like the models of highly intricate
molecules---systems of colored balls, each one of which turns out
to be a multitude of smaller balls, forever and ever. Is this,
perhaps, an inner view of the organizing process which, when the
eyes are open, makes sense of the world even at points where it
appears to be supremely messy? </p>

<p> Later that same afternoon, Robert takes us over to his barn
from which he has been cleaning out junk and piling it into a big
and battered Buick convertible, with all the stuffing coming out
of the upholstery. The sight of trash poses two of the great
questions of human life, &quot;Where are we going to put
it?&quot; and &quot;Who's going to clean up?&quot; From one point
of view living creatures are simply tubes, putting things in at
one end and pushing them out at the other---until the tube wears
out. The problem is always where to put what is pushed out at the
other end, especially when it begins to pile so high that the
tubes are in danger of being crowded off the earth by their own
refuse. And the questions have metaphysical overtones.
&quot;Where are we going to put it?&quot; asks for the foundation
upon which things ultimately rest ---the First Cause, the Divine
Ground, the bases of morality, the origin of action. &quot;Who's
going to clean up?&quot; is asking where responsibility
ultimately lies, or how to solve our ever-multiplying problems
other than by passing the buck to the next generation. </p>

<p> I contemplate the mystery of trash in its immediate
manifestation: Robert's car piled high, with only the driver's
seat left unoccupied by broken door-frames, rusty stoves, tangles
of chicken-wire, squashed cans, insides of ancient harmoniums,
nameless enormities of cracked plastic, headless dolls, bicycles
without wheels, torn cushions vomiting kapok, non-returnable
bottles, busted dressmakers' dummies, rhomboid picture-frames,
shattered bird-cages, and inconceivable messes of string,
electric wiring, orange peels, eggshells, potato skins, and light
bulbs---all garnished with some ghastly-white chemical powder
that we call &quot;angel shit.&quot; Tomorrow we shall escort
this in a joyous convoy to the local dump. And then what? Can any
melting and burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising
mountains of ruin---especially when the things we make and build
are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they
are thrown away? The only answer seems to be that of the present
group. The sight of Robert's car has everyone helpless with
hysterics. </p>

<p> The Divine Comedy. All things dissolve in laughter. And for
Robert this huge heap of marvelously incongruous uselessness is a
veritable creation, a masterpiece of nonsense. He slams it
together and ropes it securely to the bulbous, low-slung wreck of
the supposedly chic convertible, and then stands back to admire
it as if it were a float for a carnival. Theme: the American way
of life. But our laughter is without malice, for in this state of
consciousness everything is the doing of gods. The culmination of
civilization in monumental heaps of junk is seen, not as
thoughtless ugliness, but as self-caricature---as the creation of
phenomenally absurd collages and abstract sculptures in
deliberate but kindly mockery of our own pretensions. For in this
world nothing is wrong, nothing is even stupid. The sense of
wrong is simply failure to see where something fits into a
pattern, to be confused as to the hierarchical level upon which
an event belongs---a play which seems quite improper at level 28
may be exactly right at level 96. I am speaking of levels or
stages in the labyrinth of twists and turns, gambits and
counter-gambits, in which life is involving and evolving itself
---the cosmological one-upmanship which the <i>yang</i> and the <i>yin</i>,
the light and the dark principles, are forever playing, the game
which at some early level in its development <i>seems</i> to be
the serious battle between good and evil. If the square may be
defined as one who takes the game seriously, one must admire him
for the very depth of his involvement, for the courage to be so
far-out that he doesn't know where he started. </p>

<p> The more prosaic, the more dreadfully ordinary anyone or
anything seems to be, the more I am moved to marvel at the
ingenuity with which divinity hides in order to seek itself, at
the lengths to which this cosmic <i>joie de vivre</i> will go in
elaborating its dance. I think of a corner gas station on a hot
afternoon. Dust and exhaust fumes, the regular Standard guy all
baseball and sports cars, the billboards halfheartedly gaudy, the
flatness so reassuring---nothing around here but just us folks! I
can see people just pretending not to see that they are avatars
of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, that the cells of their bodies
aren't millions of gods, that the dust isn't a haze of jewels.
How solemnly they would go through the act of not understanding
me if I were to step up and say, &quot;Well, who do you think
you're kidding? Come off it, Shiva, you old rascal! It's a great
act, but it doesn't fool me.&quot; But the conscious ego doesn't
know that it is something which that divine organ, the body, is
only pretending to be.<a href="#footnote">*</a> When people go<a
name="back"></a> to a <i>guru</i>, a master of wisdom, seeking a
way out of darkness, all he really does is to humor them in their
pretense until they are outfaced into dropping it. He tells
nothing, but the twinkle in his eye speaks to the
unconscious---&quot;You know....<i>You</i> know!&quot; </p>

<p> In the contrast world of ordinary consciousness man feels
himself, as will, to be something in nature but not of it. He
likes it or dislikes it. He accepts it or resists it. He moves it
or it moves him. But in the basic superconsciousness of the whole
organism this division does not exist. The organism and its
surrounding world are a single, integrated pattern of action in
which there is neither subject nor object, doer nor done to. At
this level there is not one thing called pain and another thing
called myself, which dislikes pain. Pain and the
&quot;response&quot; to pain are the same thing. When this
becomes conscious it feels as if everything that happens is my
own will. But this is a preliminary and clumsy way of feeling
that what happens outside the body is one process with what
happens inside it. This is that &quot;original identity&quot;
which ordinary language and our conventional definitions of man
so completely conceal. </p>

<p> The active and the passive are two phases of the same act. A
seed, floating in its white sunburst of down, drifts across the
sky, sighing with the sound of a jet plane invisible above. I
catch it by one hair between thumb and index finger, and am
astonished to watch this little creature actually wiggling and
pulling as if it were struggling to get away. Common sense tells
me that this tugging is the action of the wind, not of the
thistledown. But then I recognize that it is the
&quot;intelligence&quot; of the seed to have just such delicate
antennae of silk that, in an environment of wind, it can move.
Having such extensions, it moves itself with the wind. When it
comes to it, is there any basic difference between putting up a
sail and pulling an oar? If anything, the former is a more
intelligent use of effort than the latter. True, the seed does
not intend to move itself with the wind, but neither did I intend
to have arms and legs. </p>

<p> It is this vivid realization of the reciprocity of will and
world, active and passive, inside and outside, self and not-self,
which evokes the aspect of these experiences that is most
puzzling from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness: the
strange and seemingly unholy conviction that &quot;I&quot; am
God. In Western culture this sensation is seen as the very
signature of insanity But in India it is simply a matter of
course that the deepest center of man, <i>atman</i>, is the
deepest center of the universe, <i>Brahman</i>. Why not? Surely a
continuous view of the world is more whole, more holy, more
healthy, than one in which there is a yawning emptiness between
the Cause and its effects. Obviously, the &quot;I&quot; which is
God is not the ego, the consciousness of self which is
simultaneously an unconsciousness of the fact that its outer
limits are held in common with the inner limits of the rest of
the world. But in this wider, less ignore-ant consciousness I am
forced to see that everything I claim to will and intend has a
common boundary with all I pretend to disown. The limits of what
I will, the form and shape of all those actions which I claim as
mine, are identical and coterminous with the limits of all those
events which I have been taught to define as alien and external. </p>

<p> The feeling of self is no longer confined to the inside of
the skin. Instead, my individual being seems to grow out from the
rest of the universe like a hair from a head or a limb from a
body, so that my center is also the center of the whole. I find
that in ordinary consciousness I am habitually trying to ring
myself off from this totality, that I am perpetually on the
defensive. But what am I trying to protect? Only very
occasionally are my defensive attitudes directly concerned with
warding off physical damage or deprivation. For the most part I
am defending my defenses: rings around rings around rings around
nothing. Guards inside a fortress inside entrenchments inside a
radar curtain. The military war is the outward parody of the war
of ego versus world: only the guards are safe. In the next war
only the air force will outlive the women and children. </p>

<p> I trace myself back through the labyrinth of my brain,
through the innumerable turns by which I have ringed myself off
and, by perpetual circling, obliterated the original trail
whereby I entered this forest. Back through the tunnels---through
the devious status-and-survival strategy of adult life, through
the interminable passages which we remember in dreams ---all the
streets we have ever traveled, the corridors of schools, the
winding pathways between the legs of tables and chairs where one
crawled as a child, the tight and bloody exit from the womb, the
fountainous surge through the channel of the penis, the timeless
wanderings through ducts and spongy caverns. Down and back
through ever-narrowing tubes to the point where the passage
itself is the traveler---a thin string of molecules going through
the trial and error of getting itself into the right order to be
a unit of organic life. Relentlessly back and back through
endless and whirling dances in the astronomically proportioned
spaces which surround the original nuclei of the world, the
centers of centers, as remotely distant on the inside as the
nebulae beyond our galaxy on the outside. </p>

<p> Down and at last out---out of the cosmic maze to recognize in
and as myself, the bewildered traveler, the forgotten yet
familiar sensation of the original impulse of all things, supreme
identity, inmost light, ultimate center, self more me than
myself. Standing in the midst of Ella's garden I feel, with a
peace so deep that it sings to be shared with all the world, that
at last I belong, that I have returned to the home behind home,
that I have come into the inheritance unknowingly bequeathed from
all my ancestors since the beginning. Plucked like the strings of
a harp, the warp and woof of the world reverberate with memories
of triumphant hymns. The sure foundation upon which I had sought
to stand has turned out to be the center from which I seek. The
elusive substance beneath all the forms of the universe is
discovered as the immediate gesture of my hand. But how did I
ever get lost? And why have I traveled so far through these
intertwined tunnels that I seem to be the quaking vortex of
defended defensiveness which is my conventional self?</p>

<hr>

<p> Going indoors I find that all the household furniture is
alive. Everything gestures. Tables are tabling, pots are potting,
walls are walling, fixtures are fixturing---a world of events
instead of things. Robert turns on the phonograph, without
telling me what is being played. Looking intently at the pictures
picturing, I only gradually become conscious of the music, and at
first cannot decide whether I am hearing an instrument or a human
voice simply falling. A single stream of sound, curving,
rippling, and jiggling with a soft snarl that at last reveals it
to be a reed instrument---some sort of oboe. Later, human voices
join it. But they are not singing words, nothing but a kind of
&quot;<i>buoh---buah---bueeh</i>&quot; which seems to be
exploring all the liquidinous inflections of which the voice is
capable. What has Robert got here? I imagine it must be some of
his far-out friends in a great session of nonsense-chanting. The
singing intensifies into the most refined, exuberant, and
delightful warbling, burbling. honking. hooting. and
howling---which quite obviously means nothing whatsoever. and is
being done out of pure glee. There is a pause. A voice says. <i>&quot;Dit!&quot;</i>
Another seems to reply, <i>&quot;Da!&quot;</i> Then, <i>&quot;Dit-da!
Di-dittty-da!&quot;</i> And getting gradually faster. <i>&quot;Da-di-ditty-di-ditty-da!
Di-da-di-ditty-ditty-da-di-da-di-ditty-da-da!&quot;</i> And so
on, until the players are quite out of their minds. The record
cover which Robert now shows me, says &quot;Classical Music of
India,&quot; and informs me that this is a series edited by Alain
Danielou, who happens to be the most serious, esoteric, and
learned scholar of Hindu music, and an exponent. in the line of
Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy, of the most formal,
traditional, and difficult interpretation of Yoga and Vedanta.
Somehow I cannot quite reconcile Danielou, the pandit of pandits,
with this delirious outpouring of human bird-song. I feel my leg
is being pulled. Or perhaps Danielou's leg. </p>

<p> But then, maybe not. Oh, indeed not ! For quite suddenly I
feel my understanding dawning into a colossal clarity, as if
everything were opening up down to the roots of my being and of
time and space themselves. The sense of the world becomes totally
obvious. I am struck with amazement that I or anyone could have
thought life a problem or being a mystery. I call to everyone to
gather round. </p>

<p> &quot;Listen, there's something I <i>must</i> tell. I've
never, never seen it so clearly. But it doesn't matter a bit if
you don't understand, because each one of you is quite perfect as
you are, even if you don't know it. Life is basically a gesture,
but no one, no thing, is <i>making</i> it. There is no necessity
for it to happen, and none for it to go on happening. For it
isn't being driven by anything; it just happens freely of itself.
It's a gesture of motion, of sound, of color, and just as no one
is making it, it isn't <i>happening</i> to anyone. There is
simply no problem of life; it is completely purposeless
play---exuberance which is its own end. Basically there is the
gesture. Time, space, and multiplicity are complications of it.
There is no reason whatever to explain it, for explanations are
just another form of complexity, a new manifestation of life on
top of life, of gestures gesturing. Pain and suffering are simply
extreme forms of play, and there isn't anything in the whole
universe to be afraid of because it doesn't happen to anyone!
There isn't any substantial ego at all. The ego is a kind of
flip, a knowing of knowing, a fearing of fearing. It's a
curlicue, an extra jazz to experience, a sort of double-take or
reverberation, a dithering of consciousness which is the same as
anxiety.&quot; </p>

<p> Of course, to say that life is <i>just</i> a gesture, an
action without agent, recipient, or purpose, sounds much more
empty and futile than joyous. But to me it seems that an ego, a
substantial entity to which experience happens, is more of a
minus than a plus. It is an estrangement from experience, a lack
of participation. And in this moment I feel absolutely <i>with</i>
the world, free of that chronic resistance to experience which
blocks the free flowing of life and makes us move like
muscle-bound dancers. But I don't have to overcome resistance. I
see that resistance, ego, is just an extra vortex in the stream--
part of it---and that in fact there is no actual resistance at
all. There is no point from which to confront life, or stand
against it.</p>

<hr>

<p> I go into the garden again. The hummingbirds are soaring up
and falling in their mating dance, as if there were someone
behind the bushes playing ball with them. Fruit and more wine
have been put out on the table. Oranges ---transformations of the
sun into its own image, as if the tree were acknowledging
gratitude for warmth. Leaves, green with the pale, yellow-fresh
green that I remember from the springtimes of my childhood in
Kentish spinneys, where breaking buds were spotted all over the
hazel branches in a floating mist. Within them, trunks, boughs,
and twigs moist black behind the sunlit green. Fuchsia bushes,
tangled traceries of stalks, intermingled with thousands of
magenta ballerinas with purple petticoats. And, behind all,
towering into the near-twilight sky, the grove of giant
eucalyptus trees with their waving clusters of distinctly
individual, bamboo-like leaves. Everything here is the visual
form of the lilting nonsense and abandoned vocal dexterity of
those Hindu musicians. </p>

<p> I recall the words of an ancient Tantric scripture: &quot;As
waves come with water and flames with fire, so the universal
waves with us.&quot; Gestures of the gesture, waves of the
wave---leaves flowing into caterpillars, grass into cows, milk
into babies, bodies into worms, earth into flowers, seeds into
birds, quanta of energy into the iridescent or reverberating
labyrinths of the brain. Within and swept up into this endless,
exulting, cosmological dance are the base and grinding undertones
of the pain which transformation involves: chewed nerve endings,
sudden electric-striking snakes in the meadow grass, swoop of the
lazily circling hawks, sore muscles piling logs, sleepless nights
trying to keep track of the unrelenting bookkeeping which
civilized survival demands. </p>

<p> How unfamiliarly natural it is to see pain as no longer a
problem. For problematic pain arises with the tendency of
self-consciousness to short-circuit the brain and fill its
passages with dithering echoes---revulsions to revulsions, fears
of fear, cringing from cringing, guilt about guilt---twisting
thought to trap itself in endless oscillations. In his ordinary
consciousness man lives like someone trying to speak in an
excessively sensitive echo-chamber; he can proceed only by
doggedly ignoring the interminably gibbering reflections of his
voice. For in the brain there are echoes and reflected images in
every dimension of sense, thought, and feeling, chattering on and
on in the tunnels of memory. The difficulty is that we confuse
this storing of information with an intelligent commentary on
what we are doing at the moment, mistaking for intelligence the
raw materials of the data with which it works. Like too much
alcohol, self-consciousness makes us see ourselves double, and we
mistake the double image for two selves---mental and material,
controlling and controlled, reflective and spontaneous. Thus
instead of suffering we suffer about suffering, and suffer about
suffering about suffering. </p>

<p> As has always been said, clarity comes with the giving up of
self. But what this means is that we cease to attribute selfhood
to these echoes and mirror images. Otherwise we stand in a hall
of mirrors, dancing hesitantly and irresolutely because we are
making the images take the lead. We move in circles because we
are following what we have already done. We have lost touch with
our original identity, which is not the system of images but the
great self-moving gesture of this as yet unremembered moment. The
gift of remembering and binding time creates the illusion that
the past stands to the present as agent to act, mover to moved.
Living thus from the past, with echoes taking the lead, we are
not truly here, and are always a little late for the feast. Yet
could anything be more obvious than that the past follows from
the present like the wake of a ship, and that if we are to be
alive at all, <i>here</i> is the place to be? </p>

<p> Evening at last closes a day that seemed to have been going
on since the world began. At the high end of the garden, above a
clearing, there stands against the mountain wall a semicircle of
trees, immensely tall and dense with foliage, suggesting the
entrance grove to some ancient temple. It is from here that the
deep blue-green transparency of twilight comes down, silencing
the birds and hushing our own conversation. We have been watching
the sunset, sitting in a row upon the ridgepole of the great barn
whose roof of redwood tiles, warped and cracked, sweeps clear to
the ground. Below, to the west, lies an open sward where two
white goats are munching the grass, and beyond this is Robert's
house where lights in the kitchen show that Beryl is preparing
dinner. Time to go in, and leave the garden to the awakening
stars. </p>

<p> Again music---harpsichords and a string orchestra, and Bach
in his most exultant mood. I lie down to listen, and close my
eyes. All day, in wave after wave and from all directions of the
mind's compass, there has repeatedly come upon me the sense of my
original identity as one with the very fountain of the universe.
I have seen, too, that the fountain is its own source and motive,
and that its spirit is an unbounded playfulness which is the
many-dimensioned dance of life. There is no problem left, but who
will believe it? Will I believe it myself when I return to normal
consciousness? Yet I can see at the moment that this does not
matter. The play is hide- and-seek or lost-and-found, and it is
all part of the play that one can get very lost indeed. How far,
then, can one go in getting found? </p>

<p> As if in answer to my question there appears before my closed
eyes a vision in symbolic form of what Eliot has called &quot;the
still point of the turning world.&quot; I find myself looking
down at the floor of a vast courtyard, as if from a window high
upon the wall, and the floor and the walls are entirely surfaced
with ceramic tiles displaying densely involved arabesques in
gold, purple, and blue. The scene might be the inner court of
some Persian palace, were it not of such immense proportions and
its colors of such preternatural transparency. In the center of
the floor there is a great sunken arena, shaped like a
combination of star and rose, and bordered with a strip of tiles
that suggest the finest inlay work in vermilion, gold, and
obsidian. </p>

<p> Within this arena some kind of ritual is being performed in
time with the music. At first its mood is stately and royal, as
if there were officers and courtiers in rich armor and many-
colored cloaks dancing before their king. As I watch, the mood
changes. The courtiers become angels with wings of golden fire,
and in the center of the arena there appears a pool of dazzling
flame. Looking into the pool I see, just for a moment, a face
which reminds me of the Christos Pantocrator of Byzantine
mosaics, and I feel that the angels are drawing back with wings
over their faces in a motion of reverent dread. But the face
dissolves. The pool of flame grows brighter and brighter, and I
notice that the winged beings are drawing back with a gesture,
not of dread, but of tenderness---for the flame knows no anger.
Its warmth and radiance---&quot;tongues of flame
infolded&quot;---are an efflorescence of love so endearing that I
feel I have seen the heart of all hearts.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<hr>

<p> THIS IS, as I have said, a record not of one experiment with
consciousness-changing drugs, but of several, compressed for
reasons of poetic unity into a single day. At the same time I
have more or less kept to the basic form which every individual
experiment seems to take---a sort of cycle in which one's
personality is taken apart and then put together again, in what
one hopes is a more intelligent fashion. For example, one's true
identity is first of all felt as something extremely ancient,
familiarly distant ---with overtones of the magical,
mythological, and archaic. But in the end it revolves back to
what one is in the immediate present, for the moment of the
world's creation is seen to lie, not in some unthinkably remote
past, but in the eternal now. Similarly, the play of life is at
first apprehended rather cynically as an extremely intricate
contest in one-upmanship, expressing itself deviously even in the
most altruistic of human endeavors. Later, one begins to feel a
&quot;good old rascal&quot; attitude toward the system; humor
gets the better of cynicism. But finally, rapacious and
all-embracing cosmic selfishness turns out to be a disguise for
the unmotivated play of love. </p>

<p> But I do not mean to generalize. I am speaking only of what I
have experienced for myself, and I wish to repeat that drugs of
this kind are in no sense bottled and predigested wisdom. I feel
that had I no skill as a writer or philosopher, drugs which
dissolve some of the barriers between ordinary, pedestrian
consciousness and the multidimensional superconsciousness of the
organism would bring little but delightful, or sometimes
terrifying, confusion. I am not saying that only intellectuals
can benefit from them, but that there must be sufficient
discipline or insight to relate this expanded consciousness to
our normal, everyday life. </p>

<p> Such aids to perception are medicines, not diets, and as the
use of a medicine should lead on to a more healthful mode of
living, so the experiences which I have described suggest
measures we might take to maintain a sounder form of sanity. Of
these, the most important is the practice of what I would like to
call meditation---were it not that this word often connotes
spiritual or mental gymnastics. But by meditation I do not mean a
practice or exercise undertaken as a preparation for something,
as a means to some future end, or as a discipline in which one is
concerned with progress. A better word may be
&quot;contemplation&quot; or even &quot;centering,&quot; for what
I mean is a slowing down of time, of mental hurry, and an
allowing of one's attention to rest in the present---so coming to
the unseeking observation, not of what should be, but of what is.
It is quite possible, even easy, to do this without the aid of
any drug, though these chemicals have the advantage of
&quot;doing it for you&quot; in a peculiarly deep and prolonged
fashion. </p>

<p> But those of us who live in this driven and over-purposeful
civilization need, more than anyone else, to lay aside some span
of clock time for ignoring time, and for allowing the contents of
consciousness to happen without interference. Within such
timeless spaces, perception has an opportunity to develop and
deepen in much the same way that I have described. Because one
stops forcing experience with the conscious will and looking at
things as if one were confronting them, or standing aside from
them to manage them, it is possible for one's fundamental and
unitive apprehension of the world to rise to the surface. But it
is of no use to make this a goal or to try to work oneself into
that way of seeing things. Every effort to change what is being
felt or seen presupposes and confirms the illusion of the
independent knower or ego, and to try to get rid of what isn't
there is only to prolong confusion. On the whole, it is better to
try to be aware of one's ego than to get rid of it. We can then
discover that the &quot;knower&quot; is no different from the
sensation of the &quot;known,&quot; whether the known be
&quot;external&quot; objects or &quot;internal&quot; thoughts and
memories. </p>

<p> In this way it begins to appear that instead of knowers and
knowns there are simply knowings, and instead of doers and deeds
simply doings. Divided matter and form becomes unified
pattern-in-process. Thus when Buddhists say that reality is
&quot;void&quot; they mean simply that life, the
pattern-in-process, does not proceed from or fall upon some
substantial basis. At first, this may seem rather disconcerting,
but in principle the idea is no more difficult to abandon than
that of the crystalline spheres which were once supposed to
support and move the planets. </p>

<p> Eventually this unified and timeless mode of perception
&quot;caps&quot; our ordinary way of thinking and acting in the
practical world: it includes it without destroying it. But it
also modifies it by making it clear that the function of
practical action is to serve the abiding present rather than the
ever-receding future, and the living organism rather than the
mechanical system of the state or the social order. </p>

<p> In addition to this quiet and contemplative mode of
meditation there seems to me to be an important place for
another, somewhat akin to the spiritual exercises of the
dervishes. No one is more dangerously insane than one who is sane
all the time: he is like a steel bridge without flexibility, and
the order of his life is rigid and brittle. The manners and mores
of Western civilization force this perpetual sanity upon us to an
extreme degree, for there is no accepted corner in our lives for
the art of pure nonsense. Our play is never real play because it
is almost invariably rationalized; we do it on the pretext that
it is good for us, enabling us to go back to work refreshed.
There is no protected situation in which we can really let
ourselves go. Day in and day out we must tick obediently like
clocks, and &quot;strange thoughts&quot; frighten us so much that
we rush to the nearest head-doctor. Our difficulty is that we
have perverted the Sabbath into a day for laying on rationality
and listening to sermons instead of letting off steam. </p>

<p> If our sanity is to be strong and flexible, there must be
occasional periods for the expression of completely spontaneous
movement---for dancing, singing, howling, babbling, jumping,
groaning, wailing---in short, for following any motion to which
the organism as a whole seems to be inclined. It is by no means
impossible to set up physical and moral boundaries within which
this freedom of action is expressible---sensible contexts in
which nonsense may have its way. Those who provide for this
essential irrationality will never become stuffy or dull, and,
what is far more important, they will be opening up the channels
through which the formative and intelligent spontaneity of the
organism can at last flow into consciousness. This is why free
association is such a valuable technique in psychotherapy; its
limitation is that it is purely verbal. The function of such
intervals for nonsense is not merely to be an outlet for pent-up
emotion or unused psychic energy, but to set in motion a mode of
spontaneous action which, though at first appearing as nonsense,
can eventually express itself in intelligible forms. </p>

<p> Disciplined action is generally mistaken for forced action,
done in the dualistic spirit of compelling oneself, as if the
will were quite other than the rest of the organism. But a
unified and integrated concept of human nature requires a new
concept of discipline---the control, not of forced action, but of
spontaneous action. It is necessary to see discipline as a
technique which the organism uses, as a carpenter uses tools, and
not as a system to which the organism must be conformed.
Otherwise the purely mechanical and organizational ends of the
system assume greater importance than those of the organism. We
find ourselves in the situation where man is made for the
Sabbath, instead of the Sabbath for man. But before spontaneous
action can be expressed in controlled patterns, its current must
be set in motion. That is to say, we must acquire a far greater
sensitivity to what the organism itself wants to do, and learn
responsiveness to its inner motions. </p>

<p> Our language almost compels us to express this point in the
wrong way ---as if the &quot;we&quot; that must be sensitive to
the organism and respond to it were something apart.
Unfortunately our forms of speech follow the design of the social
fiction which separates the conscious will from the rest of the
organism, making it the independent agent which causes and
regulates our actions. It is thus that we fail to recognize what
the ego, the agent, or the conscious will is. We do not see that
it is a social convention, like the intervals of clock time, as
distinct from a biological or even psychological entity. For the
conscious will, working against the grain of instinct, is the
interiorization, the inner echo, of social demands upon the
individual coupled with the picture of his role or identity which
he acquires from parents, teachers, and early associates. It is
an imaginary, socially fabricated self working against the
organism, the self that is biologically grown. By means of this
fiction the child is taught to control himself and conform
himself to the requirements of social life. </p>

<p> At first sight this seems to be an ingenious and highly
necessary device for maintaining an orderly society based upon
individual responsibility. In fact it is a penny-wise,
pound-foolish blunder which is creating many more problems than
it solves. To the degree that society teaches the individual to
identify himself with a controlling will separate from his total
organism, it merely intensifies his feeling of separateness, from
himself and from others. In the long run it aggravates the
problem that it is designed to solve, because it creates a style
of personality in which an acute sense of responsibility is
coupled with an acute sense of alienation. </p>

<p> The mystical experience, whether induced by chemicals or
other means, enables the individual to be so peculiarly open and
sensitive to organic reality that the ego begins to be seen for
the transparent abstraction that it is. In its place there arises
(especially in the latter phases of the drug experience) a strong
sensation of oneness with others, presumably akin to the
sensitivity which enables a flock of birds to twist and turn as
one body. A sensation of this kind would seem to provide a far
better basis for social love and order than the fiction of the
separate will. </p>

<p> The general effect of the drugs seems to be that they
diminish defensive attitudes without blurring perception, as in
the case of alcohol. We become aware of things against which we
normally protect ourselves, and this accounts, I feel, for the
high susceptibility to anxiety in the early phases of the
experience. But when defenses are down we begin to see, not
hallucinations, but customarily ignored aspects of
reality---including a sense of social unity which civilized man
has long since lost. To regain this sense we do not need to
abandon culture and return to some precivilized level, for
neither in the drug experience nor in more general forms of
mystical experience does one lose the skills or the knowledge
which civilization has produced. </p>

<p> I have suggested that in these experiences we acquire clues
and insights which should be followed up through certain forms of
meditation. Are there not also ways in which we can, even without
using the drugs, come back to this sense of unity with other
people? The cultured Westerner has a very healthy distaste for
crowds and for the loss of personal identity in &quot;herd-
consciousness.&quot; But there is an enormous difference between
a formless crowd and an organic social group. The latter is a
relatively small association in which every member is in
communication with every other member. The former is a relatively
large association in which the members are in communication only
with a leader, and because of this crude structure a crowd is not
really an organism. To think of people as &quot;the masses&quot;
is to think of them by analogy with a subhuman style of order. </p>

<p> The corporate worship of churches might have been the natural
answer to this need, were it not that church services follow the
crowd pattern instead of the group pattern. Participants sit in
rows looking at the backs of each other's necks, and are in
communication only with the leader ---whether preacher, priest,
or some symbol of an autocratic God. Many churches try to make up
for this lack of communion by &quot;socials&quot; and dances
outside the regular services. But these events have a secular
connotation, and the type of communion involved is always
somewhat distant and demure. There are, indeed, discussion groups
in which the leader or &quot;resource person&quot; encourages
every member to have his say, but, again, the communion so
achieved is merely verbal and ideational. </p>

<p> The difficulty is that the defended defensiveness of the ego
recoils from the very thing that would allay it---from
associations with others based on physical gestures of affection,
from rites, dances, or forms of play which clearly symbolize
mutual love between the members of the group. Sometimes a play of
this kind will occur naturally and unexpectedly between close
friends, but how embarrassing it might be to be involved in the
deliberate organization of such a relationship with total
strangers ! Nevertheless, there are countless associations of
people who, claiming to be firm friends, still lack the nerve to
represent their affection for each other by physical and erotic
contact which might raise friendship to the level of love. Our
trouble is that we have ignored and thus feel insecure in the
enormous spectrum of love which lies between rather formal
friendship and genital sexuality, and thus are always afraid that
once we overstep the bounds of formal friendship we must slide
inevitably to the extreme of sexual promiscuity, or worse, to
homosexuality. </p>

<p> This unoccupied gulf between spiritual or brotherly love and
sexual love corresponds to the cleft between spirit and matter,
mind and body, so divided that our affections or our activities
are assigned either to one or to the other. There is no continuum
between the two, and the lack of any connection, any intervening
spectrum, makes spiritual love insipid and sexual love brutal. To
overstep the limits of brotherly love cannot, therefore, be
understood as anything but an immediate swing to its opposite
pole. Thus the subtle and wonderful gradations that lie between
the two are almost entirely lost. In other words, the greater
part of love is a relationship that we hardly allow, for love
experienced only in its extreme forms is like buying a loaf of
bread and being given only the two heels. </p>

<p> I have no idea what can be done to correct this in a culture
where personal identity seems to depend on being physically
aloof, and where many people shrink even from holding the hand of
someone with whom they have no formally sexual or familial tie.
To force or make propaganda for more affectionate contacts with
others would bring little more than embarrassment. One can but
hope that in the years to come our defenses will crack
spontaneously, like eggshells when the birds are ready to hatch.
This hope may gain some encouragement from all those trends in
philosophy and psychology, religion and science, from which we
are beginning to evolve a new image of man, not as a spirit
imprisoned in incompatible flesh, but as an organism inseparable
from his social and natural environment. </p>

<p> This is certainly the view of man disclosed by these
remarkable medicines which temporarily dissolve our defenses and
permit us to see what separative consciousness normally
ignores---the world as an interrelated whole. This vision is
assuredly far beyond any drug-induced hallucination or
superstitious fantasy. It wears a striking resemblance to the
unfamiliar universe that physicists and biologists are trying to
describe here and now. For the clear direction of their thought
is toward the revelation of a unified cosmology, no longer
sundered by the ancient irreconcilables of mind and matter,
substance and attribute, thing and event, agent and act, stuff
and energy. And if this should come to be a universe in which man
is neither thought nor felt to be a lonely subject confronted by
alien and threatening objects, we shall have a cosmology not only
unified but also joyous. </p>

<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<hr>

<p> SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN about the Eleusinian Mysteries and
for so long a time that a word is needed to justify this
presentation of three papers dealing with them. For close to
2,000 years the Mystery was performed every year (except one) for
carefully screened initiates in our month of September. Everyone
speaking the Greek language was free to present himself, except
only those who had the unexpiated blood of a murdered man on
their hands. The initiates lived through the night in the
telesterion of Eleusis, under the leadership of the two
hierophantic families, the Eumolpids and the Kerykes, and they
would come away all wonder-struck by what they had lived through:
according to some, they were never the same as before. The
testimony about that night of awe-inspiring experience is
unanimous and Sophocles speaks for the initiates when he says: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Thrice happy are those of mortals, who having seen those
    rites depart for Hades; for to them alone is granted to have
    a true life there. For the rest, all there is evil. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Yet up to now no one has known what justifies utterances such
as this, and there are many like it. Here lies for us the mystery
of the Eleusinian Mysteries. To this mystery we three have
applied ourselves and believe we have found the solution, close
to 2,000 years after the last performance of the rite and some
4,000 years since the first. </p>

<p> The first three chapters of this book were read by the
respective authors as papers before the Second International
Conference on Hallucinogenic Mushrooms held on the Olympic
Peninsula, Washington, on Friday, 28 October 1977. </p>

<h6>CHAPTER ONE</h6>

<h3>THE WASSON ROAD TO ELEUSIS</h3>

<hr>

<p> With this little book we begin a new chapter in the history
of the fifty-year-old discipline of ethnomycology, a chapter that
for the first time takes within its purview, and in a big way,
our own cultural past, our legacy from ancient Greece.
Ethnomycology is simply the study of the role of mushrooms, in
the broadest sense, in the past of the human race; and it is a
branch of ethnobotany. </p>

<p> The English language lacks a word to designate the higher
fungi. &quot;Toadstool&quot; is an epithet, a pejorative
designation embracing all those fungal growths that the user
distrusts, whether rightly or wrongly. &quot;Mushroom&quot; is
ambiguous, covering different areas of the fungal world for
different persons. In this little book we will use
&quot;mushroom&quot; for all the higher fungi. Now that at long
last the world is coming to know these fungal growths in all
their myriad shapes and colors and smells and textures, perhaps
this novel usage will answer to a need and come to be generally
accepted. </p>

<p> We are three who have enlisted for this presentation. Dr.
A1bert Hofmann is the Swiss chemist renowned for his discovery in
1943 of LSD, but his familiarity with the plant alkaloids is
encyclopaedic and he will draw our attention to attributes of
some of them relevant to the Eleusinian Mysteries. </p>

<p> As we are dealing with a central theme of Greek civilization
in antiquity, it was obvious that we needed the cooperation of a
Greek scholar. At the appropriate moment I learned of Professor
Carl A. P. Ruck, of Boston University, who for some years has
been making notable discoveries in the recalcitrant area of Greek
ethnobotany. For many months we three have been studying the
proposal that we are making and his paper will be the third and
concluding one. The <i>Homeric Hymn to</i> <i>Demeter</i> is the
source for the myth that underlies Eleusis and we offer a new
English rendering of it by Danny Staples. </p>

<p> It will be my function, in this first of three papers, to
stress certain attributes of the cult of inebriating mushrooms in
Mexico. </p>

<p> Early Man in Greece, in the second millennium before Christ,
founded the Mysteries of Eleusis and they held spellbound the
initiates who each year attended the rite. Silence as to what
took place there was obligatory: the laws of Athens were extreme
in the penalties that were imposed on any who infringed the
secret, but throughout the Greek world, far beyond the reach of
Athens' laws, the secret was kept spontaneously throughout
Antiquity, and since the suspension of the Mysteries in the 4th
century A. D. that Secret has become a built-in element in the
lore of Ancient Greece. I would not be surprised if some
classical scholars would even feel that we are guilty of a
sacrilegious outrage at now prying open the secret. On 15
November 1956 I read a brief paper before the American
Philosophical Society describing the Mexican mushroom cult and in
the ensuing oral discussion I intimated that this cult might lead
us to the solution of the Eleusinian Mysteries. A famous English
archaeologist specializing in the archaeology of Greece, with
whom I had had the friendliest relations for about thirty-five
years, wrote me in a letter a little later the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I do not think that Mycenae had anything to do with the
    divine mushroom or the Eleusinian mysteries either. May I add
    a word of warning? Stick to your Mexican mushroom cult and
    beware of seeing mushrooms everywhere. We much enjoyed your
    Philadelphia paper and would recommend you keep as close to
    that as you can. Forgive the frankness of an old friend. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> I am sorry that he has now joined the shades in Hades, or
perhaps I should be happy that he will not be pained by my
brashness in disregarding his well-meant advice.</p>

<hr>

<p> My late wife Valentina Pavlovna and I were the first to use
the term ethnomycology and we have been closely identified with
the progress in this discipline over the past fifty years. That
the reader may sense the drama of this our latest discovery I
will begin by retelling the story of our mushroomic adventure. It
covers precisely the last fifty years. It constitutes in large
measure the autobiography of the Wasson family, and it has now
led us directly to Eleusis. </p>

<p> Late in August 1927 my bride, as she then was, and I took our
delayed honeymoon in the chalet lent to us by the publisher Adam
Dingwall at Big Indian in the Catskills. She was a Russian born
in Moscow of a family of the intelligentsia. Tina had fled from
Russia with her family in the summer of 1918, she being then 17
years old. She qualified as a physician at the University of
London and had been working hard to establish her pediatric
practice in New York. I was a newspaper man in the financial
department of the <i>Herald Tribune.</i> On that first beautiful
afternoon of our holiday in the Catskills, we went sauntering
down the path for a walk, hand in hand, happy as larks, both of
us abounding in the joy of life. There was a clearing on the
right, a mountain forest on our left. </p>

<p> Suddenly Tina threw down my hand and darted up into the
forest. She had seen mushrooms, a host of mushrooms, mushrooms of
many kinds that peopled the forest floor. She cried out in
delight at their beauty. She addressed each kind with an
affectionate Russian name. Such a display she had not seen since
she left her family's <i>dacha</i> near Moscow, almost a decade
before. She knelt before those toadstools in poses of adoration
like the Virgin hearkening to the Angel of the Annunciation. She
began gathering some of the fungi in her apron. I called to her:
&quot;Come back, come back to me! They are poisonous, putrid.
They are toadstools. Come back to me!&quot; She only laughed the
more: her merry laughter will ring forever in my ears. That
evening she seasoned the soup with the fungi, she garnished the
meat with other fungi. Yet others she threaded together and
strung up to dry, for winter use as she said. My discomfiture was
complete. That night I ate nothing with mushrooms in it. Frantic
and deeply hurt, I was led to wild ideas: I told her that I would
wake up a widower. </p>

<p> She proved right and I wrong. </p>

<p> The particular circumstances of this episode seem to have
shaped the course of our lives. We began checking with our
compatriots, she with Russians and I with Anglo-Saxons. We
quickly found that our individual attitudes characterized our
respective peoples. Then we began gathering information, at first
slowly, haphazardly, intermittently. We assembled our respective
vocabularies for mushrooms: the Russian was endless, never to
this day exhausted; the English, essentially confined to three
words, two of them ill-defined --- toadstool, mushroom, fungus.
The Russian poets and novelists filled their writings with
mushrooms, always in a loving context. It would seem to a
stranger that every Russian poet composes verses on
mushroom-gathering almost as a rite of passage to qualify for
mature rating! In English the silence of many writers about
mushrooms is deafening: Chaucer and Milton never mention them,
the others seldom. For Shakespeare, Spenser, William Penn,
Laurence Sterne (extensively), Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, for
Edgar Allan Poe and D. H. Lawrence and Emily Dickinson,
&quot;mushroom&quot; and &quot;toadstool&quot; are unpleasant,
even disgusting epithets. Our poets when they do mention them
link them to decay and death. We began to cast our net wider and
to study all the peoples of Europe, not only the German and
French and Italians, but more especially the peripheral cultures,
out of the main stream, where archaic forms and beliefs survive
longest --- the Albanian, Frisian, Lappish, Basque, Catalonian
and Sardinian, Icelandic and Faroese, and of course the Hungarian
and the Finnish. In all our inquiries and travels we looked, not
to the erudite, but to the humble and illiterate peasants as our
most cherished informants. We explored their knowledge of
mushrooms and the uses to which they put them. We were careful
also to take the flavor of the scabrous and erotic vocabularies
often neglected by lexicographers. We examined the common names
for mushrooms in all these cultures, seeking the fossil metaphors
hiding in their etymologies, to discover what those metaphors
expressed, whether a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward our
earthy creatures. </p>

<p> A little thing, some of you may say, this difference in
emotional attitude toward wild mushrooms. But my wife and I did
not think so, and we devoted most of our leisure hours for
decades to dissecting it, defining it, and tracing it to its
origin. Such discoveries as we have made, including the
rediscovery of the religious role for the hallucinogenic
mushrooms of Mexico, can be laid to our preoccupation with that
cultural rift between my wife and me, between our respective
peoples, between the mycophilia and mycophobia (words that we
devised for our two attitudes) that divide the Indo-European
peoples into two camps. If this hypothesis of ours be wrong, then
it must have been a singular false hypothesis to have borne the
fruit that it has. But it is not wrong. Thanks to the immense
strides made in the study of the human psyche in this century, we
are all now aware that deep-seated emotional attitudes acquired
in early life are of profound importance. I suggest that when
such traits betoken the attitudes of whole tribes or peoples,
when those traits have remained unaltered throughout recorded
history, and especially when they differ from one people to
another neighboring people, then you are face to face with a
phenomenon of deepest cultural implications, whose primal cause
is to be discovered only in the well-springs of cultural history.
</p>

<p> Our card files and correspondence kept expanding and in the
end, sometime in the early 1940's, we sat down, Tina and I, and
asked ourselves what we were going to do with all our data. We
decided to write a book, but there were so many lacunae in our
evidence that it would be years before we could put words to
paper. In our conversations at that time we found that we had
been thinking along the same lines, afraid to express our
thoughts even to each other: they were too fantastic. We had both
come to discern a period long long ago, long before our ancestors
knew how to write, when those ancestors must have regarded a
mushroom as a divinity or quasi-divinity. We knew not which
mushroom(s) nor why. In the days of Early Man his whole world was
shot through with religious feeling and the unseen powers held
him in thrall. Our sacred &quot;mushroom&quot; must have been
wondrous indeed, evoking awe and adoration, fear, yes, even
terror. When that early cult gave way to new religions and to
novel ways emerging with a literate culture, the emotions aroused
by the old cult would survive, truncated from their roots. In one
area the fear and terror would live on, either of a particular
mushroom (as in the case of <i>A. muscaria</i>); or else, as the
emotional focus through tabu became vague, of
&quot;toadstools&quot; in general; and in another area, for a
reason that we cannot now tell, it was the spirit of love and
adoration that survived. Here would lie the explanation of the
mycophobia vs. mycophilia that we had discovered.
(&quot;Toadstool&quot;, incidentally, was originally the specific
name of <i>A. muscaria</i>, the divine mushroom, of a beauty
befitting its divinity. Through tabu, &quot;toadstool&quot; lost
its focus and came to hover over the whole of the mushroom tribe
that the mycophobe shuns.)</p>

<hr>

<p> It was in Mexico that our pursuit of a hypothetical sacred
mushroom first achieved its goal. On 19 September 1952 we
received in the post two letters from Europe: one from Robert
Graves enclosing a cutting from a pharmaceutical journal in which
there were quotations from Richard Evans Schultes, who in turn
cited a number of with century Spanish friars telling of a
strange mushroom cult among the Indians of Mesoamerica; the
second from Giovanni Mardersteig, our printer in Verona, sending
us his sketch of a curious archaeological artifact from
Mesoamerica. It was exhibited in the Rietberg Museum of Zurich.
The artifact was of stone, about a foot high, obviously a
mushroom, with a radiant being carved on the stem or what
mycologists call the stipe. Here was perhaps the very cult we
were seeking, well within our reach. Earlier we had resolved that
we would avoid the New World and Africa in our inquiries: the
world was too large and our hands were full with Eurasia. But in
a trice we changed our minds and the course of our studies, and
we concentrated on Mexico and Guatemala. We had been postulating
a wild mushroom as a focus of religious devotion, a fantastic
surmise. Now here it was on our doorstep. All that winter we went
racing through the texts of the 16th century Spanish friars, and
what extraordinary narratives they give us! We flew down to
Mexico in that summer of 1953 and for many rainy seasons
thereafter. With wonderful cooperation from everyone in that
country, on the night of 29-30 June 1955 we finally made our
breakthrough: my photographer and friend Allan Richardson and I
participated with our Indian friends in a midnight <i>agape</i>
conducted by a shaman of extraordinary quality. This was the
first time on record that anyone of the alien race had shared in
such a communion. It was a soul-shattering experience. The wild
surmise that we had dared to postulate in a whisper to each other
years before was at last vindicated. And now, nearly a quarter of
a century later, we are prepared to offer another mushroom, <i>Claviceps
purpurea,</i> as holding the secret to the Eleusinian Mysteries. </p>

<p> That there might be a common denominator between the Mexican
mushroom Mystery and the Mystery of Eleusis had struck me at
once. They both aroused an overwhelming sense of awe, of wonder.
I will leave to Professor Ruck the discussion of Eleusis but will
quote one ancient author, Aristides the Rhetor, who in the 2nd
century A. D. pulled aside the curtain for an instant when he
said that what the initiate experienced was &quot;new,
astonishing, inaccessible to rational cognition&quot;, and he
went on: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Eleusis is a shrine common to the whole earth, and of all
    the divine things that exist among men, it is both the most
    awesome and the most luminous. At what place in the world
    have more miraculous tidings been sung, and where have the
    dromena called forth greater emotion, <i>where has there been
    greater rivalry between seeing and</i> <i>hearing?</i>
    [Italics mine.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p> And he goes on to speak of the &quot;ineffable visions&quot;
that it had been the privilege of many generations of fortunate
men and women to behold. </p>

<p> This description point by point tallies with the effect on
the initiate of the Mesoamerican mushroom rite, even to the
&quot;rivalry&quot; between seeing and hearing. For the sights
that one sees assume rhythmical contours, and the singing of the
shaman seems to take on visible and colorful shapes. </p>

<p> There seems to have been a saying among the Greeks that
mushrooms were the &quot;food of the Gods&quot;, <i>broma theon</i>,
and Porphyrius is quoted as having called them &quot;nurslings of
the Gods&quot;, <i>theotrophos</i>. The Greeks of the classic
period were mycophobes. Was this not because their ancestors had
felt that the whole fungal tribe was infected &quot;by
attraction&quot; with the holiness of the sacred mushroom, and
that mushrooms were therefore to be avoided by mortal men? Are we
not dealing with what was in origin a religious tabu? </p>

<p> I would not be understood as contending that only these
alkaloids (wherever found in nature) bring about visions and
ecstasy. Clearly some poets and prophets and many mystics and
ascetics seem to have enjoyed ecstatic visions that answer the
requirements of the ancient Mysteries and that duplicate the
mushroom agape of Mexico. I do not suggest that St. John of
Patmos ate mushrooms in order to write the Book of the
Revelation. Yet the succession of images in his Vision, so
clearly seen but such a phantasmagoria, means for me that he was
in the same state as one bemushroomed. Nor do I suggest for a
moment that William Blake knew the mushroom when he wrote this
telling account of the clarity of &quot;vision&quot;: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Prophets describe what they saw in Vision as real and
    existing men, whom they saw with their imaginative and
    immortal organs; the Apostles the same; the clearer the organ
    the more distinct the object. <i>A Spirit and a Vision are
    not, as the modern philosophy supposes, a cloudy vapour, or a
    nothing: they are organized and minutely articulated beyond
    all that the mortal and perishing nature can produce. He who
    does not imagine in stronger and better lineaments, and in
    stronger and better light than his perishing eye can see,

    of William Blake, ed. by Geoffrey Keynes, vol. III, p. I08] </p>
</blockquote>

<p> This must sound cryptic to one who does not share Blake's
vision or who has not taken the mushroom. The advantage of the
mushroom is that it puts many, if not everyone, within reach of
this state without having to suffer the mortifications of Blake
and St. John. It permits you to see, more clearly than our
perishing mortal eye can see, vistas beyond the horizons of this
life, to travel backwards and forwards in time, to enter other
planes of existence, even (as the Indians say) to know God. It is
hardly surprising that your emotions are profoundly affected, and
you feel that an indissoluble bond unites you with the others who
have shared with you in the sacred agape. All that you see during
this night has a pristine quality: the landscape, the edifices,
the carvings, the animals - they look as though they had come
straight from the Maker's workshop. This newness of everything
--- it is as though the world had just dawned --- overwhelms you
and melts you with its beauty. Not unnaturally, what is happening
to you seems to you freighted with significance, beside which the
humdrum events of everyday are trivial. All these things you see
with an immediacy of vision that leads you to say to yourself,
&quot;Now I am seeing for the first time, seeing direct, without
the intervention of mortal eyes.&quot; </p>

<p> Plato tells us that beyond this ephemeral and imperfect
existence here below, there is another Ideal world of Archetypes,
where the original, the true, the beautiful Pattern of things
exists for evermore. Poets and philosophers for millennia have
pondered and discussed his conception. It is clear to me where
Plato found his &quot;Ideas&quot;; it was clear to those who were
initiated into the Mysteries among his contemporaries too. Plato
had drunk of the potion in the Temple of Eleusis and had spent
the night seeing the great Vision. </p>

<p> And all the time that you are seeing these things, the
priestess in Mexico sings, not loud, but with authority. The
Indians are notoriously not given to displays of inner feelings
--- except on these occasions. The singing is good, but under the
influence of the mushroom you think it is infinitely tender and
sweet. It is as though you were hearing it with your mind's ear,
purged of all dross. You are lying on a <i>petate </i>or mat;
perhaps, if you have been wise, on an air mattress and in a
sleeping bag. It is dark, for all lights have been extinguished
save a few embers among the stones on the floor and the incense
in a sherd. It is still, for the thatched hut is apt to be some
distance away from the village. In the darkness and stillness,
that voice hovers through the hut, coming now from beyond your
feet, now at your very ear, now distant, now actually underneath
you, with strange ventriloquistic effect. The mushrooms produce
this illusion also. Everyone experiences it, just as do the
tribesmen of Siberia who have eaten of <i>Amanita muscaria</i>
and lie under the spell of their shamans, displaying as these do
their astonishing dexterity with ventriloquistic drum beats.
Likewise, in Mexico, I have heard a shaman engage in a most
complicated percussive beat: with her hands she hits her chest,
her thighs, her forehead, her arms, each giving a different
resonance, keeping a complicated rhythm and modulating, even
syncopating, the strokes. Your body lies in the darkness, heavy
as lead, but your spirit seems to soar and leave the hut, and
with the speed of thought to travel where it listeth, in time and
space, accompanied by the shaman's singing and by the
ejaculations of her percussive chant. What you are seeing and
what you are hearing appear as one: the music assumes harmonious
shapes, giving visual form to its harmonies, and what you are
seeing takes on the modalities of music --- the music of the
spheres. &quot;Where has there been greater rivalry between
seeing and hearing?&quot; How apposite to the Mexican experience
was the ancient Greek's rhetorical question! All your senses are
similarly affected: the cigarette with which you occasionally
break the tension of the night smells as no cigarette before had
ever smelled; the glass of simple water is infinitely better than
champagne. Elsewhere I once wrote that the bemushroomed person is
poised in space, a disembodied eye, invisible, incorporeal,
seeing but not seen. In truth, he is the five senses disembodied,
all of them keyed to the height of sensitivity and awareness, all
of them blending into one another most strangely, until the
person, utterly passive, becomes a pure receptor, infinitely
delicate, of sensations. </p>

<p> As your body lies there in its sleeping bag, your soul is
free, loses all sense of time, alert as it never was before,
living an eternity in a night, seeing infinity in a grain of
sand. What you have seen and heard is cut as with a burin in your
memory, never to be effaced. At last you know what the ineffable
is, and what ecstasy means. Ecstasy ! The mind harks back to the
origin of that word. For the Greeks ekstasis meant the flight of
the soul from the body. I am certain that this word came into
being to describe the effect of the Mystery of Eleusis. Can you
find a better word than that to describe the bemushroomed state?
In common parlance, among the many who have not experienced
ecstasy, ecstasy is fun, and I am frequently asked why I do not
reach for mushrooms every night. But ecstasy is not fun. Your
very soul is seized and shaken until it tingles. After all, who
will choose to feel undiluted awe, or to float through that door
yonder into the Divine Presence? The unknowing vulgar abuse the
word, and we must recapture its full and terrifying sense.... A
few hours later, the next morning, you are fit to go to work. But
how unimportant work seems to you, by comparison with the
portentous happenings of that night! If you can, you prefer to
stay close to the house, and, with those who lived through that
night, compare notes, and utter ejaculations of amazement. </p>

<p> I will convey to you the overwhelming impression of awe that
the sacred mushrooms arouse in the native population of the
Mexican highlands. In the Mazatec tribe where I ingested them for
the first time these particular mushrooms are not
&quot;mushrooms&quot;: they stand apart. One word --- <i>thain3</i>
--- embraces the whole fungal tribe, edible, innocuous but
inedible, and toxic, --- the whole fungal world except the sacred
species. The sacred species are known by a name that in itself is
a euphemism for some other name now lost: they are <i>7nti1xi3tho3</i>.
(In Mazatec each syllable must be pronounced in one of four tones
or in slides from one tone to another, 1 being the highest. The
initial <i>7</i> is a glottal stop.) The first element, <i>7nti1</i>,
is a diminutive of affection and respect. The second element, <i>xi3tho3,</i>
means &quot;that which leaps forth&quot;. The whole word is thus:
&quot;the dear little things that leap forth&quot;. But this word
is holy: you do not hear it uttered in the market place or where
numbers of people are assembled. It is best to bring up the
subject at night, by the light of a fire or a <i>vela</i> (votive
candle), when you are alone with your hosts. Then they will
dilate endlessly on the wonders of these wondrous mushrooms. For
this euphemistic name they will probably use yet others, a
further degree of euphemism, the <i>santitos,</i> the
&quot;little saints&quot;, or again the &quot;little things&quot;
in Mazatec. When we were leaving the Mazatec mountains on
horseback after our first visit there, we asked our muleteer
Victor Hernandez how it came about that the sacred mushrooms were
called &quot;the dear little ones that leap forth&quot;. He had
traveled the mountain trails all his life and spoke Spanish
although he could neither read nor write nor even tell time by
the clock's face. His answer, breathtaking in sincerity and
feeling, breathed the poetry of religion and I quote it word for
word as he uttered it and as I put it down in my notebook at the
time: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>El honguillo viene por si mismo, no se sabe de donde, como
    el viento que viene sin saber de donde ni porque. The little
    mushroom comes of itself, no one knows whence, like the wind
    that comes we know not whence nor why. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> Victor was referring to the genesis of the sacred mushrooms:
they leap forth seedless and rootless, a mystery from the
beginning. Aurelio Carreras, town slaughterer in Huautla, when we
asked him where the mushrooms take you, said simply: <i>Le llevan</i>
<i>alli donde dios esta,</i> &quot;They carry you there where God
is&quot;. According to Ricardo Garcia Gonzalez of Rio Santiago,
&quot;To eat the mushrooms you must be clean: they are the blood
of our Lord the Eternal Father.&quot; <i>Hay que ser may limpio,
es la sangre de Nuestro Senor Padre Eterno.</i> These are
Spanish-speaking villagers picked at random. They express
religion in its purest essence, without intellectual content.
Aristotle said of the Eleusinian Mysteries precisely the same:
the initiates were to suffer, to feel, to experience certain
impressions and moods. They were not to learn anything. </p>

<p> As man emerged from his brutish past, thousands of years ago,
there was a stage in the evolution of his awareness when the
discovery of a mushroom (or was it a higher plant?) with
miraculous properties was a revelation to him, a veritable
detonator to his soul, arousing in him sentiments of awe and
reverence, and gentleness and love, to the highest pitch of which
mankind is capable, all those sentiments and virtues that mankind
has ever since regarded as the highest attribute of his kind. It
made him see what this perishing mortal eye cannot see. How right
the Greeks were to hedge about this Mystery, this imbibing of the
potion, with secrecy and surveillance! What today is resolved
into a mere drug, a tryptamine or lysergic acid derivative, was
for him a prodigious miracle, inspiring in him poetry and
philosophy and religion. Perhaps with all our modern knowledge we
do not need the divine mushrooms any more. Or do we need them
more than ever? Some are shocked that the key even to religion
might be reduced to a mere drug. On the other hand, the drug is
as mysterious as it ever was: &quot;like the wind that comes we
know not whence nor why.&quot; Out of a mere drug comes the
ineffable, comes ecstasy. It is not the only instance in the
history of humankind where the lowly has given birth to the
divine. Altering a sacred text, we would say that this paradox is
a hard saying, yet one worthy of all men to be believed. </p>

<p> If our classical scholars were given the opportunity to
attend the rite at Eleusis, to talk with the priestess, what
would they not exchange for that chance? They would approach the
precincts, enter the hallowed chamber, with the reverence born of
the texts venerated by scholars for millennia. How propitious
would their frame of mind be, if they were invited to partake of
the potion! Well, those rites take place now, unbeknownst to the
classical scholars, in scattered dwellings, humble, thatched,
without windows, far from the beaten track, high in the mountains
of Mexico, in the stillness of the night, broken only by the
distant barking of a dog or the braying of an ass. Or, since we
are in the rainy season, perhaps the Mystery is accompanied by
torrential rains and punctuated by terrifying thunderbolts. Then,
indeed, as you lie there bemushroomed, listening to the music and
seeing the visions, you know a soul-shattering experience,
recalling as you do the belief of some early peoples that
mushrooms, the sacred mushrooms, are divinely engendered by
Parjanya, the Aryan God of the Lightning-bolt, in the Soft Mother
Earth. </p>

<p> Someone has called mycology the step-child of the sciences.
Is it not now acquiring a wholly new and unexpected dimension?
Religion has always been at the core of man's highest faculties
and cultural achievements, and therefore I ask you now to
contemplate our lowly mushroom --- what patents of ancient
lineage and nobility are coming its way! </p>

<h6>CHAPTER TWO </h6>

<h3>A CHALLENGING QUESTION AND MY ANSWER</h3>

<hr>

<p> In July 1975 I was visiting my friend Gordon Wasson in his
home in Danbury when he suddenly asked me this question: whether
Early Man in ancient Greece could have hit on a method to isolate
an hallucinogen from ergot that would have given him an
experience comparable to LSD or psilocybin. I replied that this
might well have been the case and I promised to send him, after
further reflection, an exposition of our present knowledge on the
subject, which I already suspected would support my tentative
position. Two years have passed, and here now is my answer. </p>

<p> Ergot is the English name for a fungal growth, the
&quot;sclerotium&quot; of a mushroom known to mycologists as <i>Claviceps
purpurea</i> (Fr.) Tul. It is a parasite on rye and other cereals
such as barley or wheat, and also on certain wild grasses. Other
species of the genus Claviceps, viz <i>C. paspali</i> Stev. and
Hall, <i>C. nigricans</i> Tul., and <i>C. glabra</i> Langdon,
etc., are parasitical to many species and varieties of grasses.
Ergot itself is not of uniform chemical composition: it occurs in
&quot;biological&quot; or &quot;chemical&quot; races, differing
from each other mainly by the composition of their alkaloidal
constituents. (Chemists define &quot;alkaloids&quot; as
nitrogen-containing alkaline substances that represent the
pharmacologically active principles of many plants.) Thus in
Switzerland there exist three varieties of ergot of rye: (a) in
the Midlands a race containing mainly the alkaloid ergotamine,
(b) in the Valais one with alkaloids of the ergotoxine group, and
(c) in the Grisons a variety with no alkaloids at all.
Furthermore in other kinds of ergot --- growing on wheat, on
barley, on millet, on lolium, etc. --- there are wide variations
in alkaloidal makeup, sometimes depending on geographical
location. </p>

<p> By far the most important of all kinds of ergot is ergot of
rye, purple-brown protrusions from the ears of rye. Ergot of rye
(in scientific nomenclature: <i>Secale cornutum</i>) has been
called in England &quot;horned rye&quot;, &quot;spiked rye&quot;,
&quot;spurred rye&quot;, but most commonly &quot;ergot of
rye&quot;, a translation of the French <i>ergot de seigle</i>.
The word ergot is defined in the Petit Larousse as <i>&quot;petit
ongle pointu derriere le pied du coq&quot;</i>, &quot;small
pointed talon behind the cock's foot&quot;, but the derivation of
the French word <i>ergot</i> is uncertain. Other French names are
<i>blé cornu, seigle ergoté, seigle ivre</i>. In German there
seem to be more variants than in other languages: <i>Mutterkorn,
Rockenmutter, Afterkorn, Todtenkorn, Tollkorn,</i> and many
others. In German folklore there was a belief that, when the corn
waved in the wind, the corn mother (a demon) was passing through
the field; her children were the rye wolves (ergot). In our
context we observe that of these names, two, <i>seigle ivre</i>
(&quot;drunken rye&quot;) and <i>Tollkorn</i> (&quot;mad
grain&quot;), point to a knowledge of the psychotropic effects of
ergot. This folk awareness of the mindchanging effects of ergot
shows an intimate knowledge of its properties, at least among
herbalists, deeply rooted in European traditions. </p>

<p> Ergot of rye has a storied past. Once a dreaded poison, it
has become a rich treasure chamber of valuable pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p> In the Middle Ages bizarre epidemics occurred in Europe
costing thousands of people their lives, occasioned by bread made
from rye contaminated with ergot. These epidemics took two forms,
<i>Ergotismus convulsivus</i>, characterized by nervous
convulsive and epileptiform symptoms, and <i>Ergotismus
gangraenosus</i>, in which gangrenous manifestations leading to
mummification of the extremities were a prominent feature.
Ergotism was also known as<i> ignis sacer</i> (&quot;holy
fire&quot;), or &quot;St. Anthony's fire&quot;, because St.
Anthony was the patron saint of a religious order founded to care
for the victims of ergotism. The cause of these epidemics ---
bread contaminated with ergot --- was not learned until the
seventeenth century, and since then there have been only sporadic
outbreaks of ergot poisoning. </p>

<p> Ergot was first mentioned as a remedy by the German physician
Adam Lonitzer in 1582. He said it was being used by midwives to
precipitate childbirth. The first scientific report on the use of
ergot as a uterotonic agent was presented by the American
physician John Stearns in 1808: &quot;Account of the <i>pulvis
parturiens</i>&quot;. But already in 1824 Dr. David Hosack, also
American, recognizing the dangers of using ergot for accelerating
childbirth, recommended that the drug be used only to control
postpartum haemorrhage. Since then ergot has been used in
obstetrics mainly for this purpose.(1) (This Dr. Hosack was a
distinguished man. He was a physician to many of the eminent New
Yorkers of his time, and he accompanied Alexander Hamilton to
Weehawken heights for his fatal duel with Aaron Burr. This I
learned from the admirable life of Hosack by Christine Robbins.) </p>

<p> The latest and most important chapter in the history of ergot
deals with it as a rich source of pharmacologically useful
alkaloids.(2) More than thirty alkaloids have been isolated from
ergot and it is unlikely that many new ones will be discovered.
Hundreds of chemical modifications of these natural alkaloids
have been prepared and investigated pharmacologically. Today all
these alkaloids are also available by total synthesis. </p>

<p> Medicinally the most useful alkaloids stem from ergot of rye.
The first ergot alkaloid that found widespread therapeutic use
was ergotamine, isolated by A. Stoll in 1918. It is the essential
component of pharmaceutical preparations such as
&quot;Cafergot&quot; and &quot;Bellergal&quot;, medicaments
against migraine and nervous disorders. Modern valuable ergot
preparations are &quot;Hydergine&quot; developed by A. Stoll and
A. Hofmann in the Sandoz laboratories in Basel, containing
hydrogenated ergotoxine alkaloids, used in </p>

<p> the treatment of geriatric disorders, and
&quot;Dihydergot&quot; with dihydroergotamine as active
component, for the therapy of circulatory disturbances. </p>

<p> Of special relevance to our problem here are the
investigations into the alkaloid ergonovine, which is the
specific uterotonic water-soluble principle of ergot. In 1932 H.
W. Dudley and C. Moir in England discovered that water-soluble
extracts of ergot, containing none of the water-insoluble
alkaloids of the ergotamine-ergotoxine-type, elicited strong
uterotonic activity. This observation led three years later to
the isolation of the alkaloid responsible for this action
simultaneously in four separate laboratories, which named it
&quot;ergometrine&quot;, &quot;ergobasin&quot;,
&quot;ergotocine,&quot; &quot;ergostetrine&quot;, respectively.
The International Pharmacopoeia Commission proposed a name to be
internationally accepted to replace these synonyms, viz.
&quot;ergonovine&quot;. </p>

<p> In 1937, starting with naturally occurring lysergic acid, I
prepared ergonovine, which by its chemical composition is
lysergic acid propanolamide. Lysergic acid is the nucleus common
to most ergot alkaloids. It is extracted from special cultures of
ergot and could also be prepared today by total synthesis if this
procedure were not too expensive. I used the method developed for
the synthesis of ergonovine for the preparation of many chemical
modifications of ergonovine. One of these partly synthetic
derivatives of ergonovine was lysergic acid butanolamide. This is
used today in obstetrics, replacing to a major extent ergonovine,
under the brand name &quot;Methergine&quot; to stop postpartum
haemorrhage. </p>

<p> Another lysergic acid derivative that I synthesized in this
context aiming to get an analeptic (that is, an agent with
circulation-and respiration-stimulating properties) was lysergic
acid diethylamide. Pharmacological examination revealed a fairly
strong uterotonic activity in this compound, nearly as strong as
ergonovine. In 1943 I discovered in self-experiments the specific
high hallucinogenic potency of lysergic acid diethylamide, which
became known world-wide under the laboratory code name LSD-25. </p>

<p> My interest in hallucinogenic agents, originating in 1943
from my work with LSD, brought me into personal contact with
Gordon Wasson, pioneer ethnomycologist and also pioneer in the
investigation of the ancient Mexican mushroom cult. From Roger
Heim, then head of the Laboratoire de Cryptogamie and Director of
the famous Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris, whom
Wasson invited to study and identify in the field his sacred
mushrooms, I received samples of them for chemical analysis. With
my laboratory assistant Hans Tscherter I succeeded in isolating
the hallucinogenic principles of the sacred Mexican mushrooms,
which I named psilocybin and psilocin. With my colleagues of the
Sandoz Research Laboratories, we succeeded in the elucidation of
the chemical structure and the synthesis of psilocybin and
psilocin. </p>

<p> Inspired by my talks with my friend Wasson and encouraged by
our success with the hallucinogenic mushrooms, I decided to
tackle also the problem of another psychotropic Mexican plant, <i>ololiuhqui</i>.
With Wasson's help I obtained a large quantity of authentic <i>ololiuhqui</i>
seeds of the two morning glories that the Mesoamerican Indians
were using, seeds of <i>Turbina corymbosa</i> (L.) Raf. and <i>Ipomoea
violacea</i> L. When we analyzed them we arrived at an unexpected
result: these ancient drugs that we are apt to call
&quot;magical&quot; and the Indians consider divine, contained as
their psychoactive principles some of our already familiar ergot
alkaloids. The main components were lysergic acid amide and
lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, both water-soluble alkaloids,
closely related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), as is
evident even to the non-chemist. Another constituent of the <i>ololiuhqui</i>
alkaloids was ergonovine, the uterotonic principle of ergot. </p>

<p> The psychoactive property of these simple lysergic acid
amides, closely related to LSD, is well established. The question
presented itself whether ergonovine, being not only an alkaloidal
component of ergot but also of <i>ololiuhqui</i>, possessed
hallucinogenic activity. In the light of its chemical structure
this did not seem unlikely: it does not differ much from LSD. But
one may ask why, if it is hallucinogenic, this astonishing fact
has not been announced, in the light of its use over recent
decades in obstetrics. Undoubtedly the answer lies in the
extremely low dosage of ergonovine used to stop postpartum
bleeding, viz 0.1 to 0.25 mg. The effective dose of lysergic acid
amide is 1 to 2 mg by oral application. I decided therefore to
test in a self-experiment a corresponding dose of ergonovine: </p>

<p> 1 April 1976 </p>

<p> 12.20 h: 2.0 mg ergonovine hydrogenmaleinate, containing 1.5
mg ergonovine base, ingested in a glass of water. </p>

<p> 13.00 h: slight nausea, same effect as I have experienced
always in my LSD or psilocybin experiments. Tired, need to lie
down. With eyes closed colored figures. </p>

<p> 13.30 h: the trees in the nearby forest seem to live, their
branches moving in a threatening way. </p>

<p> 14.30 h: strong desire to dream, unable to do systematic
work, with eyes closed or open afflicted by mollusk-like forms
and feelings. </p>

<p> 16.00 h: motives and colors have become clearer, but bearing
still some hidden dangers. </p>

<p> 17.00 h: after a short sleep I awoke by a kind of inner
explosion of all the senses. </p>

<p> 18.00 h: an unexpected visit forced me to become active, but
during the whole evening I lived more in an inner than in the
outer world. </p>

<p> 22.00 h: all effects worn off, normal feeling. </p>

<p> This was an experiment performed without attention to
&quot;set and setting&quot; but it proves that ergonovine
possesses a psychotropic, mood-changing, slightly hallucinogenic
activity when taken in the same amount as is an effective dose of
lysergic acid amide, the main constituent of <i>ololiuhqui</i>.
Its potency is about one-twentieth of the potency of LSD and
about five times that of psilocybin. </p>

<p> There is a further finding that may prove to be of utmost
importance in considering Wasson's question. The main
constituents of the Mexican morning-glory seeds are (a) lysergic
acid amide (= &quot;ergine&quot;), and (b) lysergic acid
hydroxyethylamide, and these are also the main alkaloids in ergot
growing on the wild grass <i>Paspalum distichum</i> L. This grass
grows commonly all around the Mediterranean basin and is often
infected with <i>Claviceps paspali</i>. F. Arcamone et al (3)
were the first to discover these alkaloids in ergot of P.
distichum, in 1960. </p>

<p> Within the kinds of ergot produced by the various species of
the genus <i>Claviceps</i> and its many hosts, cereals and wild
grasses, types of ergot do exist that contain hallucinogenic
alkaloids, the same alkaloids as in the Mexican hallucinogenic
morning-glories. These alkaloids, mainly lysergic acid amide,
lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, and ergonovine, are soluble in
water, in contrast to the non-hallucinogenic medicinally useful
alkaloids of the ergotamine and ergotoxine type. With the
techniques and equipment available in antiquity it was therefore
easy to prepare an hallucinogenic extract from suitable kinds of
ergot. </p>

<p> What suitable kinds of ergot were accessible to the ancient
Greeks? No rye grew there, but wheat and barley did and <i>Claviceps
purpurea</i> flourishes on both. We analyzed ergot of wheat and
ergot of barley in our laboratory and they were found to contain
basically the same alkaloids as ergot of rye, viz alkaloids of
the ergotamine and ergotoxine group, ergonovine, and sometimes
also traces of lysergic acid amide. As I said before, ergonovine
and lysergic acid amide, both psychoactive, are soluble in water
whereas the other alkaloids are not. As we all know, ergot
differs in its chemical constituents according to its host grass
and according to geography. We have no way to tell what the
chemistry was of the ergot of barley or wheat raised on the
Rarian plain in the 2nd millennium B. C. But it is certainly not
pulling a long bow to assume that the barley grown there was host
to an ergot containing, perhaps among others, the soluble
hallucinogenic alkaloids. The famous Rarian plain was adjacent to
Eleusis. Indeed this may well have led to the choice of Eleusis
for Demeter's temple, and for the growth of the cluster of
powerful myths surrounding them and Triptolemus that still exert
their spell on us today. </p>

<p> The separation of the hallucinogenic agents by simple water
solution from the non- soluble ergotamine and ergotoxine
alkaloids was well within the range of possibilities open to
Early Man in Greece. An easier method still would have been to
have recourse to some kind of ergot like that growing on the
grass <i>Paspalum distichum</i>, which contains only alkaloids
that are hallucinogenic and which could even have been used
directly in powder form. As I said before, <i>P. distichum</i>
grows everywhere around the Mediterranean basin. During the many
centuries when the Eleusinian Mysteries were thriving and holding
the antique Greek world enthralled, may not the hierophants of
Eleusis have been broadening their knowledge and improving their
skills? For the Greek world as for us, the Mysteries are linked
to Demeter and Kore, and they and Triptolemus are the famed
mythical progenitors of cultivated wheat and barley. But in the
course of time the hierophants could easily have discovered <i>Claviceps
paspali</i> growing on the grass <i>Paspalum distichum.</i> Here
they would be able to get their hallucinogen direct, straight and
pure. But I mention this only as a possibility or a likelihood,
and not because we need <i>P. distichum</i> to answer Wasson's
question. </p>

<p> Finally we must also discuss an ergot parasitical to a wild
grass called in scientific nomenclature <i>Lolium temulentum</i>
L. In English this is most widely known as darnel or cockle or
(in the Bible) tares, a weed that plagues grain crops. It is
sometimes called &quot;wild rye grass&quot;, an unfortunate name
because wild rye has nothing to do with rye: the rye of
&quot;wild rye grass&quot; is of utterly different etymology. In
classic Greek darnel was <i>aira</i> and in classic Latin was <i>lolium</i>.
Its name in French is <i>ivraie</i> and in German <i>Taumellolch,</i>
both names pointing to a belief in its psychotropic activity in
the folk knowledge of the traditional European herbalists. A
citation for ivraie in A. D. 1236 has been found, and it must go
back much further than that. </p>

<p> Analysis of <i>Lolium temulentum</i> in my laboratory and an
extended botanical, chemical, and pharmacological investigation
by I. Katz (4) showed that the plant itself contains no alkaloids
nor does it possess any pharmacological activity. But the Lolium
species (<i>L. temulentum</i> and <i>L. perenne</i>) are
notoriously prey to the Claviceps fungus. The psychotropic
reputation of darnel must therefore be attributed to its
parasitic infection by ergot. Samples of ergot grown on L.
temulentum and L.perenne collected in Germany, France, and
Switzerland showed large variation in their alkaloidal
composition. Some contained substantial amounts of ergonovine
together with alkaloids of the ergotamine and ergotoxine group.
(5) A species of ergot growing on darnel may have existed in
ancient Greece that contained mainly hallucinogenic alkaloids of
ergot such as we have found in ergot of Paspalum. </p>

<p> In conclusion I now answer Wasson's question. The answer is
yes, Early Man in ancient Greece could have arrived at an
hallucinogen from ergot. He might have done this from ergot
growing on wheat or barley. An easier way would have been to use
the ergot growing on the common wild grass Paspalum. This is
based on the assumption that the herbalists of ancient Greece
were as intelligent and resourceful as the herbalists of
pre-Conquest Mexico. </p>

<h6>CHAPTER THREE</h6>

<h3>SOLVING THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERY</h3>

<hr>

<p> We are told that there once was a young Athenian who was much
taken with the beauty of a courtesan in one of the brothels of
Corinth. His attempts to repay her favors in some special way
were continually frustrated by the madam, who insisted upon
confiscating all private gifts. To give the girl something that
would be hers alone, he hit upon the idea of offering her an
immaterial, and thereby inalienable, benefit: he would pay the
expenses for her introduction into the blessed community of those
who had witnessed the secret religious ceremony practiced at the
village of Eleusis. That sight was generally considered the
culminating experience of a lifetime. And so she was allowed to
travel to Athens, together with the madam and a younger girl from
the brothel. The lover lodged them all with a friend while they
prepared themselves by the preliminary rites. The full sequence
would require more than half a year's residence in Athens. Then
at last, amidst the throng of thousands who each autumn for the
first and only time made the pilgrimage, they too walked the
Sacred Road, crossing the narrow bridge that still today can be
seen, now submerged in the brackish waters of the swamp that once
divided Athens from the territory of its neighboring village,
some fourteen miles distant, a region sacred for its special
affinity with the realm of departed spirits, who were thought to
insure the fertility of the adjacent plain of grain. The
procession of pilgrims symbolically passed the frontier between
worlds, a momentous journey characterized by its difficulty, for
the bridge was expressly constructed too narrow for vehicular
traffic and ahead, just as they arrived at the village itself, it
was traditional that they would be obscenely insulted by masked
men, who lined the bridge across the final boundary of water. </p>

<p> Each year new candidates for initiation would walk that
Sacred Road, people of all classes, emperors and prostitutes,
slaves and freemen, an annual celebration that was to last for
upwards of a millennium and a half, until the pagan religion
finally succumbed to the intense hatred and rivalry of a newer
sect, the recently legitimized Christians in the fourth century
of our era. The only requirement, beyond a knowledge of the Greek
language, was the price of the sacrificial pig and the fees of
the various priests and guides, a little more than a month's
wages, plus the expense of the stay in Athens. </p>

<p> Every step of the way recalled some aspect of an ancient myth
that told how the Earth Mother, the goddess Demeter, had lost her
only daughter, the maiden Persephone, abducted as she gathered
flowers by her bridegroom, who was Hades or the lord of death.
The pilgrims called upon Iakchos as they walked. It was he who
was thought to lead them on their way: through him, they would
summon back the queen Persephone into the realm of the living.
When at last they arrived at Eleusis, they danced far into the
night beside the well where originally the mother had mourned for
her lost Persephone. As they danced in honor of those sacred two
goddesses and of their mysterious consort Dionysus, the god of
inebriants, the stars and the moon and the daughters of Ocean
would seem to join in their exultation. Then they passed through
the gates of the fortress walls, beyond which, shielded from
profane view, was enacted the great Mystery of Eleusis. </p>

<p> It was called a mystery because no one, under pain of death,
could reveal what happened within the sanctuary. My colleagues
and I, working from hints in numerous sources, have ventured to
go beyond that forbidden gate. </p>

<p> Ancient writers unanimously indicate that something was seen
in the great <i>telesterion</i> or initiation hall within the
sanctuary. To say so much was not prohibited. The experience was
a vision whereby the pilgrim became someone who saw, an <i>epoptes.</i>
The hall, however, as can now be reconstructed from
archaeological remains, was totally unsuited for theatrical
performances; nor do the epigraphically extant account books for
the sanctuary record any expenditures for actors or stage
apparatus. What was witnessed there was no play by actors, but <i>phasmata</i>,
ghostly apparitions, in particular, the spirit of Persephone
herself, returned from the dead with her new- born son, conceived
in the land of death. The Greeks were sophisticated about drama
and it is highly unlikely that they could have been duped by some
kind of theatrical trick, especially since it is people as
intelligent as the poet Pindar and the tragedian Sophocles who
have testified to the overwhelming value of what was seen at
Eleusis. </p>

<p> There were physical symptoms, moreover, that accompanied the
vision: fear and a trembling in the limbs, vertigo, nausea, and a
cold sweat. Then there came the vision, a sight amidst an aura of
brilliant light that suddenly flickered through the darkened
chamber. Eyes had never before seen the like, and apart from the
formal prohibition against telling of what had happened, the
experience itself was incommunicable, for there are no words
adequate to the task. Even a poet could only say that he had seen
the beginning and the end of life and known that they were one,
something given by god. The division between earth and sky melted
into a pillar of light. </p>

<p> These are the symptomatic reactions not to a drama or
ceremony, but to a mystical vision; and since the sight could be
offered to thousands of initiates each year dependably upon
schedule, it seems obvious that an hallucinogen must have induced
it. We are confirmed in this conclusion by two further
observations: a special potion, as we know, was drunk prior to
the visual experience; and secondly, a notorious scandal was
uncovered in the classical age, when it was discovered that
numerous aristocratic Athenians had begun celebrating the Mystery
at home with groups of drunken guests at dinner parties. </p>

<p> To identify the Eleusinian drug, we must first find the
pattern of meaning that underlies the Mystery. The sacred myth
that narrates the events involved in the founding of the Mystery
is recorded in the so-called Homeric hymn to Demeter, an
anonymous poem dating from the seventh century B. C., seven
centuries later than the probable date of the first performance
of the ceremony. In it we are told how the goddess Persephone was
abducted by her bridegroom Hades to the realm of the dead when
she picked a special hundred-headed <i>narkissos</i> while
gathering flowers with the daughters of Ocean in a place called
Nysa. All Greek words ending in <i>-issos</i> derive from the
language spoken by the agrarian cultures dwelling in the Greek
lands before the coming of the migrating Indo-European Greeks.
The Greeks themselves, however, thought that the <i>narkissos</i>
was so-named because of its narcotic properties, obviously
because that was the essential nature or symbolism of
Persephone's flower. The marital abduction or seizure of maidens
while gathering flowers is, moreover, a common theme in Greek
myths and Plato records a rationalized version of such stories in
which the companion of the seized maiden is named Pharmaceia or,
as the name means, the &quot;use of drugs&quot;. The particular
myth that Plato is rationalizing is in fact one that traced the
descent of the priesthood at Eleusis. There can be no doubt that
Persephone's abduction was a drug-induced seizure. </p>

<p> That fact has never been noticed by Classicists, despite its
absolute expectability in terms of what we know about the
religions of the agrarian peoples who preceded the Greeks. Those
religions centered upon the female's procreativity and the
cyclical rebirth and death of both plants and mankind. She was
the Great Mother and the entire world was her Child. The
essential event in those religions was the Sacred Marriage, in
which the priestess periodically communed with the realm of
spirits within the earth to renew the agricultural year and the
civilized life that grew upon the earth. Her male consort was a
vegetative spirit, both her son who grew from the earth and the
mate who would abduct her to the fecundating other realm as he
possessed her upon his death. When the roving Indo-Europeans
settled in the Greek lands, their immortal Father God of the sky,
who was Zeus, became assimilated to the pattern of the dying and
reborn vegetative consort of the Great Mother. There are
indications of this assimilation in the traditions about the Zeus
who was born and died in Crete. Furthermore, archaeological
remains from the Minoan-Mycenaean period of Greek culture
frequently depict visionary experience encountered by women
engaged in rituals involving flowers. The priestesses or
goddesses themselves occur as idols decorated with vegetative
motifs, accompanied by their serpent consort or crowned with a
diadem of opium capsules. Moreover, the myths that narrate the
founding of the various Mycenean citadels show, as we might
expect, recurrent variations upon the Sacred Marriage enacted
between the immigrant founder and the autochthonous female in
ecstatic contexts. Most interesting among these are the
traditions about Mykenai (Mycenae) itself, for it was said to
have been founded when the female of that place lost her head to
the male of the new dynasty, who had picked a mushroom. The
etymology of Mykenai, which was recognized in antiquity but has
been repeatedly rejected by modern scholars, is correctly derived
from Mykene, the bride of the <i>mykes</i> or mushroom. Fungoid
manifestations of the vegetative consort in the Sacred Marriage
can also be detected in the symbolism of the founding fathers at
other Mycenaean sites, perhaps because that particular wave of
immigrants brought knowledge of the wild and untameable mushroom
with them on their movement south into the Greek lands. At Athens
in the classical period, the ancient Sacred Marriage was still
celebrated annually by the wife of the sacral head of state: in
the month of February, she would unite with the god Dionysus. </p>

<p> It was as Dionysus that the Zeus who had been assimilated as
consort to the Mother Goddess survived into the classical period.
His name designates him as the Zeus of Nysa, for Dios is a form
of the word Zeus. Nysa was not only, as we have seen, the place
where Persephone was abducted, but also the name for wherever was
enacted that same nuptial encounter involving the passion of
Dionysus&quot; birth and death. When he possessed his women
devotees, the maenads or bacchants, he was synonymous with Hades,
the lord of death and bridegroom to the goddess Persephone. The
maenads, like Persephone, also gathered flowers. We know this
because their emblem was the <i>thyrsos</i>, a fennel stalk
stuffed with ivy leaves; such hollow stalks were customarily used
by herb gatherers as receptacles for their cuttings, and the ivy
that was stuffed into the maenads&quot; stalks was sacred to
Dionysus and reputed to be a psychotropic plant. </p>

<p> Dionysus, however, could possess his ecstatic brides through
the agency of other plants as well, for he was the vegetative
consort residing in all manner of inebriants, including
apparently certain of the fungi. The stipe, by analogy to the
maenads&quot; emblem, was also called a <i>thyrsos,</i> with the
mushroom's cap substituted for the psychotropic herbs. Dionysus
himself was born prematurely in the mystical seventh month during
a winter snowfall when his celestial father struck his earth
bride Semele at Thebes with a bolt of lightning; in the same
manner mushrooms were thought to be engendered wherever lightning
struck the earth. The father of Dionysus was another Dionysus, as
would be expected in a Sacred Marriage, for the child born at the
time of the earth's renewal is identical with the ingested
consort who will reunite his mother-bride with the awesome nether
realm from which life must forever be reborn. Thus not
surprisingly we are told that Semele also conceived Dionysus when
she drank a potion compounded of her own son's heart. So too was
Dionysus like his father also called the thunderer, for despite
the gentleness of his infancy and his sometimes effeminate
appearance, he could suddenly metamorphose into the virulence of
his full manhood, in which form he was a bull, rending the earth,
as at his birth, announced by a bellowing, the mykema that
signified the presence of the <i>mykes</i> or mushroom. His
symbol was the phallos itself, by a common metaphor also called
the <i>mykes.</i> </p>

<p> It was with the vine, however, and its fermented juice that
Dionysus was chiefly associated. Mushrooms themselves in fact
were considered a fermentation of the earth, a perfect symbol of
rebirth from the cold realm of putrefaction that was the mouldy
other world. A similar process was sensed in the frothing turmoil
whereby the fungal yeast converted grapes into wine. In wine the
god had found his greatest blessing for mankind; here his
untameable, wild nature had succumbed to domestication. He
himself was said to have first discovered the properties of this
plant that had grown from the spilled blood of the gods when he
noticed a serpent drinking its toxin from the fruit, for serpents
were thought to derive their poisons from the herbs they ate,
just as conversely it was said that serpents could transfer their
toxins to plants in their vicinity. Dionysus taught man the way
to calm this gift's violent nature by diluting it with water. And
customarily it was mixed with water that the Greeks drank their
wines. </p>

<p> This custom of diluting wine deserves our attention since the
Greeks did not know the art of distillation and hence the
alcoholic content of their wines could not have exceeded about
fourteen per cent, at which concentration the alcohol from
natural fermentation becomes fatal to the fungus that produced
it, thereby terminating the process. Simple evaporation without
distillation could not increase the alcoholic content since
alcohol, which has a lower boiling point than water, will merely
escape to the air, leaving the final product weaker instead of
more concentrated. Alcohol in fact was never isolated as the
toxin in wine and there is no word for it in ancient Greek. Hence
the dilution of wine, usually with at least three parts of water,
could be expected to produce a drink of slight inebriating
properties. </p>

<p> That, however, was not the case. The word for drunkenness in
Greek designates a state of raving madness. We hear of some wines
so strong that they could be diluted with twenty parts of water
and that required at least eight parts water to be drunk safely,
for, according to report, the drinking of certain wines straight
actually caused permanent brain damage and in some cases even
death. Just three small cups of diluted wine were enough in fact
to bring the drinker to the threshold of madness. Obviously the
alcohol could not have been the cause of these extreme reactions.
We can also document the fact that different wines were capable
of inducing different physical symptoms, ranging from slumber to
insomnia and hallucinations. </p>

<p> The solution to this apparent contradiction is simply that
ancient wine, like the wine of most early peoples, did not
contain alcohol as its sole inebriant but was ordinarily a
variable infusion of herbal toxins in a vinous liquid. Unguents,
spices, and herbs, all with recognized psychotropic properties,
could be added to the wine at the ceremony of its dilution with
water. A description of such a ceremony occurs in Homer's <i>Odyssey,</i>
where Helen prepares a special wine by adding the euphoric <i>nepenthes</i>
to the wine that she serves her husband and his guest. The fact
is that the Greeks had devised a spectrum of ingredients for
their drinks, each with is own properties. </p>

<p> Thus the wine of Dionysus was the principle medium whereby
the classical Greeks continued to partake of the ancient ecstasy
resident in all the vegetative forms that were the Earth's child.
In social situations, the drinking was regulated by a leader, who
determined the degree of inebriation that he would impose upon
the revelers as they ceremonially drank a measured sequence of
toasts. At sacral events, the wine would be more potent and the
express purpose of the drinking was to induce that deeper
drunkenness in which the presence of the deity could be felt. </p>

<p> The herbal inebriants that figured in these Dionysian rites
of drinking required magical procedures when the herbs were
gathered. As wild beings whose spirits were akin to their
particular guardian animals, the plants were the objects of a
hunt. And the ecstatic rapture they might induce in religious
contexts inevitably identified them as sexual forces. </p>

<p> Thus the female devotees of the god Dionysus appropriately
bore the <i>thyrsos</i> as their emblem as they roamed the winter
mountainsides in search of the so-called vine that grew suddenly
with earth-rending thunder and the bellowing of bulls amidst
their night-long dancing; that beloved child, the age-old serpent
consort, was the object of their hunt, who was suckled, then like
a beast torn to pieces and eaten raw; his own mothers, as was
often claimed, were guilty of cannibalism eating his flesh, for
like mothers the women would have brought the drug into being,
harvesting and compounding it with the help of the god's
so-called nurses, in whose loving care he would grow to manhood,
eventually to possess them as his brides. Such ceremonies enacted
the sacred nuptials of the city's women, who thereby entered the
awesome alliance with the nether lord, upon whose realm depended
the growth of all this world's fertility of plants and man. </p>

<p> Persephone's abduction at Nysa was prototypic of that first
nuptial between the realms, the primal experience of death. In
the hunting place called Agrai, in the month of February, which
was called the time of flowers, the candidates for the coming
initiation at Eleusis experienced in some way the death of
Persephone through the ritual mimeses of those Dionysian events.
That occurrence was termed the Lesser Mystery and it was
considered a preliminary for the vision of the Greater Mystery
that would take place at the time of the autumn sowing in
September. </p>

<p> The Greater Mystery was the complement of the Lesser, for it
centered upon redemption instead of death, the triumphant return
of Persephone from Hades with the infant son she had conceived
during her sojourn in communion with the spiritual realm. The
Homeric hymn, after its account of Persephone's fatal nuptial
encounter, goes on to tell how Demeter came to establish the
Greater Mystery. In grief for her lost daughter, she went to
Eleusis. Her journey there is a sympathetic imitation of
Persephone's entrance into the citadel of Hades, for Eleusis was
a simulacrum of the other word, where Demeter too would
experience the ominous chthonic phase of her womanhood, not as
sacred queen to the lord of death, but as witch and wet-nurse in
his house, for when Persephone progresses beyond maidenhood, her
mother must make way, relinquishing her former role and moving on
to the third stage, when a woman's aging womb brings her once
again into proximity with the powers of death. These chthonic or
earth-oriented phases of womanhood were symbolized in the goddess
Hecate, whose triform body expressed the female's totality as
bride, wife, and aged nurse in Hades&quot; realm. </p>

<p> At Eleusis, Demeter first attempts to assuage her grief by
negating the possibility of the world of death to which she has
lost her daughter. She does this by nourishing the royal prince
with immortality. His mother, however, objects, for she cannot
understand or accept a system that would inevitably alienate the
son from his own mother's realm as irredeemably as Persephone
from Demeter. </p>

<p> Demeter again attempts a solution, this time an eternity of
death, in which she and the maiden would stay forever in their
chthonic phase. She causes a plague of sterility so that no life
can emerge from the earth. This solution, however, leaves no role
for the immortal deities of the sky, whose delicate balance with
the forces of the earth is dependent upon the continuing worship
of mortal men, who share with them the fruits of life. </p>

<p> The final solution is to heal the universe into which death
has now intruded by admitting also the possibility of return into
life. Rebirth from death was the secret of Eleusis. In Hades,
Persephone, like the earth itself, takes seed into her body and
thereby eternally comes back to her ecstatic mother with her new
son, only to die as eternally in his fecundating embrace. The
sign of the redemption was an ear of barley, the risen grain,
that following the Mystery would be committed once again to the
cold earth in the sowing of the sacred plain adjacent to Eleusis.
</p>

<p> This was the final mediation that Demeter taught to a second
of the royal princes in the citadel of Eleusis. His name was
Triptolemus, the trifold warrior, and he becomes the apostle of
the new faith, traveling throughout the world on a serpent
chariot spreading the gospel of the cultivation of grain. His
exact identity was part of the secret of the Mystery, for the
various traditions about his parentage suggest that the initiates
learned that, like the grain that was his emblem, he was actually
the son of the trifold females who were the queens in the house
of the lord of death. He was, therefore, another form of
Dionysus, who in a similar fashion also was an apostle, traveling
in the same manner of cart on his journey teaching man the
cultivation of the vine. The pattern indicated in these
Eleusinian apostleships clearly signifies the transition from
wild botanic growth to the arts of cultivation upon which
civilized life must depend. </p>

<p> In the various Eleusinian mythical traditions, several other
male figures symbolize a similar transmutation of the wild horror
and loss that is death into the ravishingly handsome young man
who is born from Hades&quot; realm in pledge of the coming
redemption. In one such tradition, he is Iakchos (Iacchus), the
joyous Dionysian male who led the initiates toward their vision
of salvation; in another, Eubuleus, the serene personification of
the cosmological plan wherein the celestial immortals
collaborated with the forces of death to show humankind its
proper role; in a third, Zagreus, the enigmatic hunting companion
of his ecstatic brides. The fourth and most perfect of these
transmuted figures is Ploutos, the personification of the wealth
that stems from the fertility of man and field. The initiate
could expect that this beneficent representative of death would
thereafter become welcome in his house as his constant guest,
joined by ties of friendship. This Ploutos was originally the
vegetative son of Demeter in her more ancient days as Great
Mother on Crete, where she conceived him in a thrice plowed field
when she united with her intoxicating mate whose name was Iasion,
which means &quot;the man of the drug&quot;. </p>

<p> Triptolemus, however, was the paramount transmutation,
Demeter's special response to the problem of death. It was his
sacred barley, solemnly grown in the Rarian plain and threshed on
his floor, that was the principle ingredient in the potion drunk
by the initiates in preparation for the culminating vision. The
formula for that potion is recorded in the Homeric hymn. In
addition to the barley, it contained water and a fragrant mint
called blechon. The mint initially would seem the most likely
candidate for the psychoactive agent in the potion, except that
all our evidence about this particular mint indicates that it was
unsuitable, being neither sufficiently psychotropic to warrant
the danger of profane usage nor appropriately revered as the
secret drug. Rather, it was openly despised as a sign of the
illicit union of man and woman in lustful concubinage without the
sacrament of marriage. To just such an unsanctified abduction
Demeter had lost her daughter at Nysa and accordingly we are told
that the mother vented her displeasure by changing the prostitute
of Hades into mint, thereupon grinding and bruising her botanic
body. The final Eleusinian solution, on the other hand, will
reconcile the mother to the daughter's loss through
legitimatizing the nuptial abduction in the rite of matrimony,
whereby an heir can accede to the dynastic house. Barley and not
mint is the revelation at Eleusis, and it is to it that we must
look for the sacred drug. </p>

<p> With the cultivation of grain, man had left his wild, nomadic
ways and settled in cities, giving to the earth in order to
receive back its harvest. All civilized institutions derived from
this delicate accord struck with the dark, cold forces of death.
Grain itself was thought to be a hybrid, carefully evolved from
more primitive grasses. If not tended with proper care, it could
be expected to revert to its worthless, inedible avatar. That
primitive sibling to grain was thought to be the plant called <i>aira</i>
in Greek, <i>Lolium temulentum</i> in botanical nomenclature, or
commonly in English &quot;wild ryes, darned cockle, ivray, or
finally &quot;tares&quot; in the Bible. This weed is usually
infested with a fungoid growth, <i>Claviceps purpurea,</i> ergot
or rust, a reddening corruption to which barley was thought to be
particularly susceptible. <i>Aira,</i> therefore, doubly
endangered the cultivated staff of life, first as the renascent
primordial grass and secondly as the host for the encroaching
ergot infection. The revertive tendency of the infected grain,
furthermore, was all too obvious, for when the sclerotia fell to
the ground there grew from them not grain but tiny purple
mushrooms, the fruiting bodies of the ergot fungus, clearly a
return to the species of the unregenerate, wild Dionysian
abductor. </p>

<p> Unlike the seedless mushroom, however, ergot would have
seemed akin to the kernels of grain that were its host. As well
as grain, therefore, it too was Demeter's plant, for she could
wear its distinctive color as her robe or on her feet or be named
with its epithet, Erysibe. The hallucinogenic properties of
Claviceps were recognized in antiquity, and thus we may surmise
that the parallel apostleships of the barley and the vine would
have signified analogous transmutations wherein the chthonic
spirits submitted to cultivation. Wine, however, was
Dionysus&quot; realm, the liquid that gave sleep like death and
forgetfulness, whereas Demeter was the earth, dry with the
harvest upon which man fed to live. Grain was her sacrament. Upon
first coming to Eleusis, Demeter had refused the cup of wine and
the initiates thereafter imitated her abstention in deference to
the superior symbolism of the potion of barley. </p>

<p> Clearly ergot of barley is the likely psychotropic ingredient
in the Eleusinian potion. Its seeming symbiotic relationship to
the barley signified an appropriate expropriation and
transmutation of the Dionysian spirit to which the grain,
Demeter's daughter, was lost in the nuptial embrace with earth.
Grain and ergot together, moreover, were joined in a bisexual
union as siblings, bearing at the time of the maiden's loss
already the potential for her own return and for the birth of the
phalloid son that would grow from her body. A similar
hermaphroditism occurs in the mythical traditions about the
grotesquely fertile woman whose obscene jests were said to have
cheered Demeter from her grief just before she drank the potion. </p>

<p> This solution to the Mystery of Eleusis is made still more
probable by a papyrus fragment that was brought to my attention
by our translator of the Homeric hymn. The fragment preserves a
portion of the <i>Demes,</i> a comedy by Eupolis written shortly
after the scandal of the profanation of the Mystery in the fifth
century B. C. It confirms that the profanation did indeed entail
the drinking of the sacred <i>kykeon</i> and suggests that our
identification of the drug it contained is correct. In the
comedy, an informer explains to a judge how he had come upon
someone who had obviously been drinking the potion since he had
barley groats on his moustache. The accused had bribed the
informer to say that it was simply porridge and not the potion
that he had drunk. By a possible pun, the comedian may even
indicate that the incriminating &quot;crumbs of barley&quot; were
&quot;purples of barley&quot;. </p>

<p> Thus we may now venture past the forbidden gates and
reconstruct the scene within the great initiation hall at
Eleusis. The preparation of the potion was the central event.
With elaborate pageantry, the hierophant, the priest who traced
his descent back to the first performance of the Mystery, removed
the sclerotia of ergot from the free-standing room constructed
inside the <i>telesterion</i> over the remains of the original
temple that had stood there in Mycenaean times. As he performed
the service, he intoned ancient chants in a falsetto voice, for
his role in the Mystery was asexual, a male who had sacrificed
his gender to the Great Goddess. He conveyed the grain in
chalices to the priestesses, who then danced throughout the hall,
balancing the vessels and lamps upon their heads. The grain was
next mixed with mint and water in urns, from which the sacred
potion was then ladled into the special cups for the initiates to
drink their share. Finally, in acknowledgment of their readiness,
they all chanted that they had drunk the potion and had handled
the secret objects that had come with them on the Sacred Road in
sealed baskets. Then, seated on the tiers of steps that lined the
walls of the cavernous hall, in darkness they waited. From the
potion they gradually entered into ecstasy. You must remember
that this potion --- an hallucinogen --- under the right set and
setting, disturbs man's inner ear and trips astonishing
ventriloquistic effects. We can rest assured that the
hierophants, with generations of experience, knew all the secrets
of set and setting. I am sure that there was music, probably both
vocal and instrumental, not loud but with authority, coming from
hither and yon, now from the depths of the earth, now from
outside, now a mere whisper infiltrating the ear, flitting from
place to place unaccountably. The hierophants may well have known
the art of releasing into the air various perfumes in succession,
and they must have contrived the music for a crescendo of
expectation, until suddenly the inner chamber was flung open and
spirits of light entered the room, subdued lights I think, not
blinding, and among them the spirit of Persephone with her
new-born son just returned from Hades. She would arrive just as
the hierophant raised his voice in ancient measures reserved for
the Mystery: &quot;The Terrible Queen has given birth to her son,
the Terrible One&quot;. This divine birth of the Lord of the
Nether World was accompanied by the bellowing roar of a gong-
like instrument that outdid, for the ecstatic audience, the
mightiest thunderclap, coming from the bowels of the earth. </p>

<p> Some Christian bishops, in the last days of the Mystery,
thought they had discovered and could reveal the secret of
Eleusis. One said that in this pagan rite there was materialized
a stalk of barley. How true according to his limited lights, yet
how utterly false. The Bishop had not known the night of nights
at Eleusis. He was like one who has not known LSD or the
mushrooms of Mexico or the morning-glory seeds. For close on to
two thousand years a few of the ancient Greeks passed each year
through the portals of Eleusis. There they celebrated the divine
gift to mankind of the cultivated grain and they were also
initiated into the awe some powers of the nether world through
the purple dark of the grain's sibling that Dr Hofmann has once
again made accessible to our generation. The myths of Demeter and
Persephone and all their company fit our explanation in every
respect. Nothing in any of them is incompatible with our thesis. </p>

<p> Until yesterday we knew of Eleusis only what little a few of
the initiates told us but the spell of their words had held
generations of mankind enthralled. Now, thanks to Dr Hofmann and
Gordon Wasson, those of us who have experienced the superior
hallucinogens may join the fellowship of the ancient initiates in
a lasting bond of friendship, a friendship born of a shared
experience of a reality deeper far than we had known before. </p>

<h6>CHAPTER FOUR</h6>

<h3>ANCILLARY DATA</h3>

<hr>

<p> A Greek scholar, writing just half a century ago, did not
hesitate to dismiss the worship of Demeter at Eleusis as
&quot;trivial and absurd; but,&quot; he added, &quot;there can be
no doubt that it did much to satisfy the emotional side of the
religious instincts of the Greeks. Its modern analogue is perhaps
the Salvation Army.&quot; We trust that our own comparisons will
be less bizarre than his. In our generation we enjoy the
advantage of having rediscovered the hallucinogenic experience.
Moreover, the value of interdisciplinary collaboration is that it
gives us access to knowledge otherwise apt to be beyond the reach
of scholars. Our joint effort has yielded a radical answer to our
problem: it sets the stage for much reexamination of traditional
opinions about the classical Greeks and their tragic literature
in celebration of the god Dionysus. </p>

<p> The ancient testimony about Eleusis is unanimous and
unambiguous. Eleusis was the supreme experience in an initiate's
life. It was both physical and mystical: trembling, vertigo, cold
sweat, and then a sight that made all previous seeing seem like
blindness, a sense of awe and wonder at a brilliance that caused
a profound silence since what had just been seen and felt could
never be communicated: words are unequal to the task. Those
symptoms are unmistakably the experience induced by an
hallucinogen. To reach that conclusion, we have only to show that
the rational Greeks, and indeed some of the most famous and
intelligent amongst them, could experience and enter fully into
such irrationality. </p>

<p> Eleusis was different from the convivial inebriation of
friends at a <i>symposion</i> or the drunken <i>komos</i> revel
at the festivals of drama. Eleusis was something for which even
the maenadic ecstasy of the mountain women was only partial
preparation. In their various ways, other Greek cults too enacted
aspects of the ancient communion practiced between gods and men,
between the living and the dead, but it was at Eleusis alone that
the experience occurred with overwhelming finality: here alone
was the grand design fulfilled of the maiden resurrected with her
son conceived in death, and of the ear of barley that like her
had sprouted beneath the earth. By this resurrection was
validated the continuance of all that a Greek held most dear, the
civilized way of life that, beyond each city's constitution, was
the Greek heritage, evolved out of aboriginal primitivism just as
all life too came from the beneficent accord with the lord of
death. Here indeed is a rich full-bodied myth, filled with
contradictions like all the myths of an unlettered age, one
saying this and another saying that and a third saying something
else, but somehow in the end harmonizing into one whole, a myth
that for the Greeks explained the beginning and the end of
things. </p>

<p> Months of learning and rituals preceded the revelation on the
Mystery night, each action programming in further detail the
meaning and substance, the full ramifications of the vision that
lay ahead. At last the initiates would sit on the steps in the
initiation hall. It was all done now except for the finale. They
had learned the secret version of the sacred myth, they had
bathed in the sea, abstained from various tabu foods and drinks,
sacrificed a pig, taken the long walk along the Sacred Way from
Athens, and made the perilous crossing of the final division of
water before their arrival at the city of their Eleusinian hosts.
Outside the sanctuary walls, there was the night- long dance
beside the Maiden's Well on the very ground that the goddess had
visited. Then there was the fast and the momentous entrance into
the forbidden territory past the cave that was an entrance to
Hades and the rock where Demeter had sat in grief. In the
initiation hall, there was the final ceremonial dance of the
priestesses carrying the chalice of grain upon their heads as
they mixed and distributed the sacred potion: fragrant <i>blechon</i>,
the despised herb associated with the illicit nature of the
abduction, immersed in water to which was added a sprinkling of
flour from barley grown in the Rarian plain. The barley's
potential as the foodstuff for mankind depended upon keeping at
bay the encroachment of the reddening corruption that would draw
it back to its worthless avatar, the rust-infested weed. Like the
<i>blechon</i>, the weed too was thus associated with primitivism
and the ways of life before the institutions of society brought
man to a higher mode of existence. Of these two plants the
initiates drank and then paused expectant for redemption while
the hierophant chanted the ancient words. Then, suddenly, there
was light and the boundaries on this world burst their bounds as
spiritual presences were felt in their midst and the hall was
flooded with glowing mystery. </p>

<p> From beginning to end here there was a reenactment of a
sacred drama in which the initiates as well as the officiants had
their role to play, until at last they experienced as actors the
ineffable, all of their senses and emotions being shot through
with what would thereafter be forever the unspeakable. </p>

<p> As the initiates passed through the lengthy proceedings, they
were admitted to many secrets, but the hierophants may well have
withheld from them the Secret of Secrets: the sacred water of the
potion had already soaked up in the right dosage from the
immersed ergot what it contained of ergine and ergonovine, as we
call them today. But the hierophants were certainly, through the
centuries, seeking ways to improve their technique, their
formulae. In the course of those two millennia may they not have
discovered a kind of ergot that contains solely the
hallucinogenic alkaloids such as has been found in modern times
in ergot of <i>Paspalum distichum</i>? Indeed herbalists other
than the hierophantic families may have shared in this discovery
and it may have been their knowledge that prompted the rash of
profanations in B. C. 415. The inside story of those events will
never be known but that there was a story to tell is certain. </p>

<p> In unlettered cultures the knowledge of the herbalist --- the
knowledge of the properties of plants and their use --- was
everywhere a body of secret lore passed on by word of mouth from
herbalist to apprentice and sometimes from one herbalist to
another. The apprenticeship took years before one practiced on
one's own, and one never stopped learning. There were questions
of dosage, of side effects, of proper plant ingredients that
became poisons when taken to excess. In Mexico Bernardino de
Sahagun and Francisco Hernandez were gifted Spaniards and they
spent endless effort and time to take down from the Indians the
virtues of various Mexican plants. But they were Europeans who
knew not the American plant world, and in their European world
they were certainly not what we would call botanists or
herbalists. Their intentions were good but their ignorance was
complete. What they have to tell us about the hallucinogens is
childish. They could have tried the hallucinogens but elected not
to do so, spurned the chance. What a different story they would
have told us if they had lived for a number of years as
apprentices of the Indian <i>sabios</i>. </p>

<p> In the Homeric hymn to Demeter, on arriving at Eleusis, tired
and disconsolate over the loss of her daughter Persephone,
Demeter was offered a drink of wine, which she declined. Since
every act in this narrative had mythic meaning, it seems that
drinking the alcoholic beverage did not go with the drinking of
the divine potion called kykeon. The two kinds of inebriation
were incompatible. In Mexico those who will take the mushrooms
know that they must refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages for
four days before the <i>velada,</i> as the mushroom celebration
is called. Alcoholic inebriation would profane, would defile, the
divine draught, alike in Mexico and Greece. </p>

<p> The Eleusinian Mysteries were in the exclusive hands of the
Eumolpus and Kerykes families. For close to two thousand years,
these hierophants governed with autocratic authority the rites at
Eleusis. By contrast, in the sacred mushroom country of Mexico
every village has its <i>sabios</i> (&quot;wisemen&quot;) who are
the custodians of the rite. (In some remote Mixe villages the
individual families take the mushrooms when they feel the need,
without the guidance of a sabio. Whether this informal practice
in the Mixe country marks a breakdown in the rite or the survival
of an earlier archaic procedure, we do not know.) In Greece the
&quot;initiate&quot; took the potion only once in his life, and
thus he could not compare successive experiencies. In Mexico one
may consult the mushroom whenever a grave family problem presents
itself. Some Indians choose never to take the mushroom, others
only once, yet others intermittently. The newcomer to the
experience is constantly warned that ingesting the hallucinogen
is in the highest degree <i>delicado,</i> &quot;delicate&quot;
with a connotation of grave danger. </p>

<p> At Eleusis and in Mexico certain items of food were
proscribed for some time before the big night. It is impossible
to compare the dietary exclusions, so different are the foods,
except that in both cases eggs are tabu. Fasting was practiced in
Greece and also in Mexico, from the morning throughout the day:
in both cases one faced the night on an empty stomach. In Mexico
before the Conquest it was the practice in aristocratic circles
to drink nourishing chocolate spiked with the inebriating
mushrooms, in this way breaking the fast as the events of the
night were launched on their course. Owing to the silence
enjoined on everyone who had taken part in the Mystery, there are
scarcely any hints as to what happened in the writers of the
flourishing period of Eleusis, but in the early centuries of the
Christian era, with Eleusis breaking down, we discover a few
references, obscure, inhibited, that may permit us some uncertain
glimpses. We find mention of a collation served to the initiates
when a large cake called the <i>pelanos,</i> made of barley and
wheat harvested in the adjacent sacred Rarian plain, was broken
into pieces and the portions served to all. In the sources one
hears of a bond of alliance and friendship that sprang up among
the initiates, and some have suggested that this sprang from the
collation they had shared together. It is not incompatible with
the Greek texts to suppose that the collation paralleled the
breaking of the fast in Mexico, the <i>pelanos</i> taking the
place of the chocolate. But surely the bond of alliance and
friendship had nothing to do with the collation: nothing so
jejune would have sufficed. The overwhelming effect of the night
under the influence of an hallucinogen gives natural birth to a
feeling of shared supernatural experience never to be forgotten,
a feeling of <i>cofradia,</i> of brotherhood. Two of us have
known this personally in Mexico: those who pass through a <i>velada</i>,
in the right set and setting, live through an awesome experience,
and feel welling up within them a tie that unites them with their
companions of that night of nights that will last for as long as
they live. Here we think is the bond of alliance and friendship
of which the Greek sources speak obscurely. </p>

<p> Then there is the matter of secrecy. In Mexico nothing had
been heard of the sacred mushrooms in sophisticated circles since
the early friars mentioned them briefly in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. It has been said that the mushrooms were a
'secret&quot; of the Indians living in the highlands of southern
Mexico. Our own little group flushed them out into the open. But
we think this 'secret&quot; was never really a secret. In the
Indian communities everyone knew about them and also about the
morning-glory seeds. Every villager could, if he wished, learn
the art of recognizing the sacred mushrooms and many did so.
There was a small trade in the mushrooms, supplying the demand
among the natives who had moved to the cities and who still
wished to &quot;consult&quot; them. The Church had originally
opposed them and the Holy Office of the Inquisition in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries tried to stamp out the native
use of them by vigorous persecutions. They failed, of course, but
the natural mycophobia of the Spanish population, their contempt
for peculiar native practices, and the similar attitude of the
French, the Germans, and the English who later came to know
Mexico led naturally to an absence of communication between the
natives and the occupying races on matters that lay closest to
the Indians&quot; hearts. It is small wonder that the sacred
mushrooms, after an abortive spate of notices, hopelessly
inadequate, in the writings of the early friars, have remained
unknown to the world to our own times. The Indians would not take
the initiative in speaking about them. The 'secrecy&quot; was not
a conspiracy of silence: it was imposed on the Indians by the
White Man, owing to the lack of intelligent and sympathetic
curiosity in the elite of the White circles. </p>

<p> The secrecy in the ancient Greek world about the Eleusinian
Mysteries was somewhat different. The laws of Athens made it a
crime to speak about what went on at Eleusis in the telesterion.
Toward the end of the Homeric hymn to Demeter, this silence is
expressly enjoined on all initiates. In B. C. 415 there was a
spate of deliberate profanations of the Mysteries by the jet set
in Athens and a crackdown followed, harsh penalties being
inflicted. But the secrecy ran far beyond the reach of the laws
of Athens. That secrecy ruled everywhere in the Greek world and
was never seriously violated. It too was self-enforcing. Those
who knew the superior hallucinogens through personal experience
were not inclined to discuss with outsiders what was revealed to
them: words could not convey to strangers the wonders of that
night and there would always be the danger that the effort to
explain would be met with incredulity, with the scoffing and
mockery that would seem to the initiate sacrilegious, would wound
him in the very core of his being. One who has known the
ineffable is loath to embark on explanations: words are useless. </p>

<p> So far as we can say, at every point what happened at Eleusis
fits in with the hallucinogenic experience in Mexico but in one
major respect the Mexican rite outdistances Eleusis. They both
share in the great Vision (&quot;Vision&quot; embracing all the
senses and the emotions), but in Mexico the sacred mushrooms (and
the other superior hallucinogens) serve also as oracles. The
hierophants of Eleusis saw a new crop of initiates every year and
there were many initiates. With the limitations that this
procedure imposed, they could not serve as consultants either to
individuals or the State on grave problems where these would be
needing advice. In Mexico, on the other hand, the hallucinogen is
consulted from time to time on all kinds of serious matters. The
questions put to the mushrooms must be serious: if they are
unworthy or frivolous, the suppliant is in for a sharp rebuff.
Faith in the mushrooms among the Indians where traditional
beliefs still prevail is absolute. When the suppliant has
observed all the tabus, when the <i>velada</i> takes place under
the right circumstances of darkness and silence, and when he
poses his questions with a pure heart, the mushrooms will not
lie. So say the Indians. And such meager evidence as one of us
has suggests that they may be right. </p>

<p> Toward the end of the last century the world learned of
peyotl and early in the middle of this century the hallucinogenic
morning-glory seeds were identified by Richard Evans Schultes. A
little later the sacred mushrooms of Mexico received their full
meed of public attention, located and written up by Roger Heim
and one of us. They were shown the way by a botanist, Blas Pablo
Reko, and an anthropologist, Robert J. Weitlaner. Now the three
of us are submitting to the modern world what well may be the key
to the mystery of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The tie that binds
the grain of Triptolemus to the supernal experience of Eleusis,
easily and safely attainable from ergot, is so close and natural
and poetically satisfying, complying point by point with the myth
of Demeter and Persephone, that are we not virtually compelled to
accept this solution? </p>

<p> Further avenues of inquiry open up. For example, the pregnant
empresses of Byzantium lived in a porphyry-lined chamber so that
their progeny would be born &quot;in the purple&quot;
(&quot;porphyry&quot; = purple). Was this &quot;purple&quot; the
color of <i>Claviceps purpurea</i> and do we have here a
posthumous outcropping of the purple-robed Demeter and
Hades-of-the-purple-hair? The earliest codices were written on
purple vellum. Was this because only the most exalted color would
be fitting, eg, for St. Augustine's <i>De Civitate Dei</i>? By a
knee-jerk reflex the values of the Pagan world would thus live on
under the Christian Dispensation. </p>

<HR><CENTER>
<H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
WE TAKE DRUGS FOR TWO MAIN REASONS; EITHER TO RESTORE ourselves
to the condition we regard as normal&#151;to cure infections, and
to take away pain; or to release us from normality&#151;to enable
us to feel more lively, or more relaxed; to alter our mood, or
our perceptions. It is with this second category (of drug use,
not of drugs; the drugs themselves may be the same) that I am
concerned. For some reason, there is no generally accepted colloquial
description. 'Narcotic' is quite familiar, but it has acquired
a pejorative tinge, and in any case it should properly be used
only about a drug used to induce drowsiness or stupor. For a while
'dope' did service, but by the time Tom Lehrer was singing about
the old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he went, it had begun
to slip out of favour, and is now more commonly used to describe
what is taken by athletes to improve their form, or given to racehorses
to upset the odds. I have stuck simply to the term 'drugs'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
I have used words like 'addiction' in their colloquial rather
than their more specialised clinical sense; and I have tried to
avoid the jargon of the pharmacologists, except when quoting it.
Their term for the mood-altering drugs, 'psychotropic', has established
itself; but they have yet to agree on how best to describe a drug
used to alter perception. The term most often employed, 'hallucinogen',
is both ugly and misleading, as the experiences are not necessarily
hallucinatory; but the commonest alternative, 'psychotomimetic',
is even uglier and more misleading, as the experiences do not
often resemble psychosis. 'Phantastica', which Louis Lewin tried
to popularise, has not caught on; nor, mercifully, have 'psychotogenic'
or 'psycholitic'; and Humphrey Osmond's 'psychedelic' has shifted
its meaning, in popular usage. I have preferred 'vision-inducing'
.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There is another category of drugs which I had intended to include;
aphrodisiacs. I found, though, that virtually all the drugs known
to man, not to mention all sorts of foodstuffs and drinks which
are not ordinarily regarded as drugs, have had the reputation
at one time or another of stimulating sexual appetite, or improving
sexual performance. As the same drugs, at other times, have often
had the reputation of diminishing desire, and spoiling performance,
it is doubtful whether the category of aphrodisiac can be accepted,
except subjectively.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
I have also dealt only in passing with the economic consequences
of drug use. For centuries, a vast acreage has been given over
to growing the plants which provide the raw material of drugs.
Huge sums have been spent on processing, distributing and retailing
the finished products, and on providing the accessories, from
public houses to hubble-bubbles. States have extracted immense
revenues from drug duties and used them to pay for everything
from social services to guided missiles. Obviously the influence
of drugs on the world's economy has been incalculable; but to
deal adequately with this aspect of the subject would require
another, and a very different, book.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The reasons for some other omissions will be found in the section
on sources. But there is also one inclusion, which I find sometimes
causes surprise. Alcohol is clearly a drug; the drug, of our civilisation
and many before. But it has also long been consumed, often primarily,
as a beverage. I have dealt with attitudes to drink, and legislation
designed to control drinking, only when they have been inspired
by fears of its effects when used as a drug.

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
WHY DID MAN FIRST TAKE TO DRUGS ? IT IS UNLIKELY THAT we will
ever know for certain; archaeological discoveries&#151;the seeds
of drug plants found in pots; cave drawings of the plants themselves&#151;indicate
that the practice must be many thousands of years old, and the
information is too scanty to justify anything more than speculation.
Our main source of evidence about early drug practices comes from
explorers, missionaries, traders and colonial administrators,
and more recently from anthropological field workers, who have
described what they have seen in primitive communities. Unluckily,
what they saw was often so alien to the preconceptions which they
brought with them from civilisation that they rarely described
it with detachment. Still, certain patterns emerge, with a reasonable
consistency.<P>&nbsp;  
<H3>From the New World</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The most revealing accounts of drug use by savages, as they were
long described by men accounting themselves civilised, are in
the chronicles of the followers of Columbus, reporting what they
saw and heard in the Caribbean islands, and later in North and
South America. They found a great variety of plant drugs in use
there: cohoba, coca, peyotl, certain species of mushroom, datura
(jimsonweed), ololiuqui (morning glory), caapi, and 
others&#151;tobacco being the commonest. None of these plants was known in
Europe at the time; nor was any drug in use there for the purpose
for which they were most widely taken in the New World, to generate
energy. The only drug then in common use in Europe was alcohol;
and wine or beer were ordinarily taken mainly for refreshment.
The American Indians, the chroniclers reported, chewed tobacco
or coca leaves as a substitute for refreshment&#151;to give themselves
a psychological 'lift', as if into a mild form of trance. This,
they claimed, enabled them to work long hours, or travel long
distances, or fight protracted battles, without the need for food,
drink, or sleep.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Drugs were also taken in America as alcohol was in Europe, for
intoxication&#151;but again, with a difference. As Girolamo Benzoni
reported in one of the early published accounts of life there,
an Indian would settle down to fill himself up with tobacco smoke
until to outward appearances he was hopelessly drunk. But he was
putting himself out of his mind with a purpose; for 'on returning
to his senses, he told a thousand stories of his having been at
the council of the gods, and other high visions'; and such stories
were taken very seriously by the tribe.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Although the same drug might be taken both for everyday working
purposes and for intoxication, it would as a rule be used as an
intoxicant only by&#151;or with the supervision of&#151;a medicine man,
qualified by character and training to interpret what was seen
or heard. The visions, the Indians believed, were glimpses of
a world on a different plane of reality, but just as real; inhabited
by spirits who had access to useful sources of knowledge. In particular,
they would reveal what was in store for the tribe, or individual
members of it. The process was described by the chronicler Gonzalvo
Fernando d'Oviedo y Valdez. The Indians of Hispaniola, he wrote,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
had secret means of putting themselves in touch with spirits whenever
they wished to predict the future. This is how they set about
the matter. When a chief called one of those priests of the desert,
this man came with two of his disciples, one of whom bore a vase
filled with some mysterious drink, and the other a little silver
bell. When he arrived, the priest sat himself down between the
two disciples on a small round seat in presence of the chief and
some of his suite. He drank the liquor which had been brought,
and then began his conjurations, calling aloud on the spirits;
and then, highly agitated and furious, he was shaken by the most
violent movements . . . He then seemed to be plunged into a kind
of ecstasy and to be suffering curious pains. During all this
time one of the disciples rang the little bell. When the priest
had calmed down, and while he lay senseless on the ground, the
chief, or some other, asked what they desired to know, and the
spirit replied through the mouth of the inspired man in a manner
perfectly exact.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Spanish chroniclers did not doubt the accuracy of the information
collected. They were quite prepared to believe that the drugs
induced visions, and that in them, the future could be foretold.
But the whole process&#151;the convulsions, the strange voices&#151;was
reminiscent of what they knew, and feared, as diabolic possession.
Such visions, they were aware, might come from God; but it was
unthinkable that God should have provided such a valuable service
for the heathen. The only possible explanation was that, as the
Dominican Diego Duran put it, 'the devil must be speaking to them
in that drunken state'. As it was not considered safe to investigate
the devil's handiwork, for fear of falling into his clutches&#151;or,
later, the Inquisition's&#151;the opportunity to investigate drug-induced
divination was not grasped.<P>&nbsp;  
<H3>Travellers' tales</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Ironically, the emergence of a more sceptical attitude also discouraged
inquiry; for a reason hinted at by Nicolas Monardes in his <I>Joyful
News out of the New Found World,</I> which contained the first
attempt at a survey of the American plant drugs. Monardes did
not dispute that the devil was involved. Having knowledge of herbal
lore, the devil must have revealed it to the Indians, 'that they
might see the visions he had prepared for them, and so deceive
them'. But Monardes doubted the authenticity of the information
transmitted by the medicine men. It was simply their attempt to
make sense of their incoherent visions, he felt&#151;and had often
to be deliberately left obscure, so that whatever happened the
medicine men could claim to have predicted it. As a member of
the Church, in other words, he took divination seriously; as a
man of science he was reluctant to do so.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, though reports
continued to filter back to Europe from time to time of remarkable
divinatory feats by medicine men under the influence of drugs,
they attracted attention only as curiosities. A typical example
was the reaction to the account which Count Filip von Strahlenberg,
a Swedish army officer who had spent years as a prisoner of war
in Siberia, gave of the Koryak tribesmen, in which he described
how they used the red-capped amanita muscaria mushroom&#151;the 'fly
agaric'&#151;as an intoxicant. Only the better-off families, Strahlenberg
explained, could afford to buy them, and store them for the winter.
Whenever they had a feast, they would pour water over them, boil
them, and enjoy the visions. 'The poorer sort', he went on,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
who cannot afford to lay in a store of these mushrooms, post themselves
on these occasions round the huts of the rich, and watch the opportunity
of the guests coming down to make water; and then hold a wooden
bowl to receive the urine, which they drink off greedily, as having
still some virtue of the mushroom in it, and by this way, they
also get drunk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A story like this helped to give 'travellers' tales' their derisory
reputation. It slipped easily into the repertory of the ranconteur&#151;and
of the satirist; Oliver Goldsmith used it to lend point to some
remarks on the degeneracy of the English nobility. And even when
later visitors to Siberia&#151;voluntary or involuntary&#151;were to
confirm that it was true, they were interested less in the purposes
for which the drug was taken, than by the fact that it could retain
its intoxicating properties even when recycled through urine four
or five times; and that reindeer, too, were susceptible&#151;a discovery
which the Koryaks had been able to exploit. Gavril Sarychev, who
spent from 1785 to 1793 in the region, found that the Chuckchi
herdsman kept a sealskin container for his urine; whenever he
wanted to round up his reindeer, 'he only has to set this container
on the ground and call out <I>'Girach, Girach!',</I> and they
promptly come running toward him from afar'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Only rarely did commentators note that the intoxication which
the fly agaric induced was of a very different kind from that
which followed the consumption of alcohol; or that it was used
by the Siberian shamans for the same purpose as the American medicine
men used tobacco or peyotl. But an account by another exile, Stephan
Kraseninnikov, of his enforced residence in Kamchat kaland showed
the similarities. A man under the influence of the fly agaric,
he wrote in 1755, could be recognised by
<BLOCKQUOTE>
the shaking of the extremities, which will follow after an hour
or less, after which the persons thus intoxicated have hallucinations,
as in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying
or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament; owing
to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors,
while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and
a tub of water as deep as the sea. But this applies only to those
who over-indulge, while those who use a small quantity experience
a feeling of extraordinary lightness, joy, courage and a state
of energetic well-being.

<H3>Anthropology</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Travellers' tales merge imperceptibly into anthropology; but one
of the landmarks on that road was <I>Travels in Peru,</I> by the
respected Swiss naturalist J. J. von Tschudi. He had read accounts
by Pizarro's followers, describing how the Indians could perform
prodigious feats of endurance by chewing coca leaves; and he was
able to verify them when he arrived in the 1830s, finding that
the porters he employed could go for five days and nights with
no food and very little sleep. Coca was also used by the medicine
men; but datura was preferred, being more potent&#151;as Tschudi
reported, after watching its effects on an Indian who took it.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Shortly after having swallowed the beverage, he fell into a heavy
stupor. He sat with his eyes vacantly fixed on the ground, his
mouth convulsively closed, and his nostrils dilated. In the course
of about a quarter of an hour his eyes began to roll, foam issued
from his half-opened lips, and his whole body was agitated by
frightful convulsions. These violent symptoms having subsided,
a profound sleep of several hours succeeded. In the evening, when
I saw him again, he was relating to a circle of attentive listeners
the particulars of his vision, during which he alleged he had
held communication with the spirits of his forefathers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Accounts of this kind, from investigators whose trustworthiness
was not in question, began to be increasingly common&#151;particularly
from South America, where new tribes, and new drugs, were continually
being discovered. In his geographical survey of Ecuador, published
in 1868, Manuel Villavicenzio described the effects of ayahuasca&#151;also
known as caapi, or yage
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a few moments it begins to produce the most rare phenomena.
Its action appears to excite the nervous system; all the senses
liven up and all faculties awaken; they feel vertigo and spinning
in the head, then a sensation of being lifted into the air and
beginning an aerial journey; the possessed begins in the first
moments to see the most delicious apparitions, in conformity with
his ideas and knowledge. The savages say that they see gorgeous
lakes, forests covered with fruit, the prettiest birds who communicate
to them the nicest and the most favourable things they want tohear, and other beautiful things relating to their savage life.
When the instant passes they begin to see terrible horrors about
to devour them, their first flight ceases and they descend to
earth to combat the terrors who communicate to them all adversities
and misfortunes awaiting them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By 1871, when Edward Tylor published his <I>Primitive Culture</I>&#151;the
first serious attempt at a comparative survey of tribal life and
lore&#151;a mass of such information had become available, and it
was remarkably consistent. Almost all communities, in every part
of the world, had their medicine men, witch doctors, or shamans,
selected mainly on account of their ability to communicate with
the spirits. To visit the spirit world, the medicine man had to
be able to enter a state of trance; and this was frequently attained
with the help of drugs. In this state he behaved as if he were
drunk, or in a kind of fit; but he would be able to recall his
visions when he recovered. Or he might appear to be possessed,
describing what he was seeing (or hearing) in a voice not his
own. Either way, his function was to bring back information of
use to his tribe: the answers to such questions as what the enemy
tribes were planning; where more game might be found; how to detect
a witch; and what treatment to give a sick member of the tribe.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The evidence presented Tylor with an embarrassing problem. His
great ambition was to divest anthropology of its 'travellers'
tales' label, and secure its recognition as an academic discipline
(as eventually he was to do; he became the holder of the first
Chair of Anthropology at Oxford). He was aware that the scientific
Establishment of the time rejected the validity of divination,
and he agreed, describing it as a 'monstrous farrago'. But they
also refused to admit the existence of the trance state, and possession.
Reviewing the evidence, Tylor found it impossible to accept that
the state of 'ecstasy', as it was then commonly called, in which
a man is transported out of his right mind, was always spurious.
But to accept it, let alone to admit its importance to primitive
man, might lead to the anthropologist being classified with the
mesmerists, hypnotists and spiritualists, all at the time busy
trying to batter down orthodoxy's defences; and this would have
been fatal to his academic prospects. So Tylor skirted round the
subject, with such discreet phrases as 'North American Indians
held intoxication by tobacco to be supernatural ecstasy, and the
dreams of men in this state to be inspired'. In doing so, he set
the fashion followed by Sir James Frazer in <I>The Golden Bough,</I>
and by most orthodox anthropologists to this day.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Reports from explorers, naturalists and anthropologists, however,
continued to pour in, revealing the great respect in which the
drug-induced trance state was held by primitive tribes. In Guiana
in the 1870s, for example, Everard Im Thurn discovered that before
a youth was initiated into his tribe he had to move away from
it for a period of fasting, and at the same time accustom himself
to drink 'fearfully large draughts' of tobacco juice mixed with
water. Then, 'maddened by the draughts of nicotine, by the terrors
of his long solitary wanderings, and fearfully excited by his
own ravings, he is able to work himself at will into those most
frantic passions of excitement during which he is supposed to
hold converse with the spirits, and to control them'. If he learned
to control them, he could become a medicine man, second only in
importance to the chief of the tribe, and sometimes even more
influential.. Was it really possible that these and other primitive
tribes, throughout history, throughout the world, had been taken
in by a total imposture?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At last, in the 1890s, experiments with hypnosis finally convinced
the scientific establishment that the trance state existed; and
the way was opened for a fresh look at the phenomenon. But the
investigators arrived as blinkered as before; because orthodoxy,
in accepting the trance state, classified it as a form of mental
disorder. In retrospect, this is understandable; medicine men
under the influence of drugs tended to behave in ways which, in
any civilised country, would have led to their being certified
insane. Russian anthropologists, in particular, investigating
shamanism&#151; a term loosely applied to the whole medicine man/witch
doctor/ shaman complex&#151;lent confirmation by attributing it to
the fearful sub-Arctic living conditions, and dismissing the visions
which the shamans claimed to see under the influence of the fly
agaric as no more meaningful than the pink elephants seen by an
alcoholic with delirium tremens.
<A NAME="back1"></A><A HREF="#foot1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The 'Arctic mania' was a preposterous theory, in view of the fact
that shamanism in one form or another existed wherever primitive
tribes were found. But research of a kind which might have led
to a more plausible explanation was hampered not only by continuing
scientific scepticism, but by the undisguised hostility of missionaries&#151;hoping
to stamp out what they felt were pagan drug cults; and of colonial
administrators, anxious to demonstrate that they, rather than
the shaman, witch doctor or medicine man, were in command. In
the early years of the century, therefore, when it would still
have been possible to investigate drug-induced trances in tribes
untainted by much contact with civilisation, little serious research
was done, except by a few interested individuals, and they were
often frustrated. Frank Melland, who in the early years of the
century was a shrewd observer of African customs in Rhodesia,
described in a book about his experiences how he had the good
fortune to hear about some secret native dances. One was named
after the drug taken by the dancers, which gave them extraordinary
endurance; those who took it, he was told, could travel a hundred
miles in the course of a night. In the other the participants,
after taking the drug, were hypnotised by the witch doctor so
that they too could enter the spirit world. But he was unable
to verify the information, because the Africans feared that if
the colonial government came to know the dances were held, they
would be banned; and Melland, as a magistrate, would be required
to enforce the prohibition.<P>&nbsp; 
<H3>The possessed</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was only when young anthropologists began to undertake intensive
field work, which involved staying long enough with a tribe to
win its trust and to understand its customs, that drug-induced
divination began to be taken a little more seriously. One of these
field workers was destined to be influential: Edward Evans-Pritchard,
subsequently Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford University.
When he went out to the Sudan in the 1920s to study the Azande,
he watched the witch doctors at work; and from his observations,
he drew a revealing picture of the process, and the part drugs
played in it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A predecessor there, Monsignor Lagae, had described how the witch
doctor's object was to reach a state where the drug he had taken
'glows <I>(brille)</I> through his body, and through it he begins
to see witchcraft clearly'. This, Evans-Pritchard found, was an
accurate description. The 'medicine', as they thought of it&#151;not
so much the drug itself, when one was used, but its effect&#151;'goes
to their stomachs, and dancing shakes it up and sends it all over
their bodies, where it becomes an active agent, enabling them
to prophesy'. The prophecies were not necessarily verbalised;
the witch doctor 'does not only divine with his lips, but with
his whole body. He dances the questions that are put to him.'
EvansPritchard's houseboy, who himself qualified as a witch doctor,
described the process. While he was dancing, he had to await the
verdict of the drugs. 'When the medicines take hold of him, a
man begins to dance with reference to someone. He dances in vain,
and goes in the soul of the medicine and arrives at another man.
He sees him and his heart cools about that man. The witch doctor
says to himself: that man does not bewitch people.' But eventually
'his heart shakes about him' and he knows that the man in front
of him IS a witch. Even if the witch should be from his own family,
the medicine will stand alert within him', compelling him to reveal
the truth.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By the time Evans-Pritchard's work on the Azande appeared, in
1937, there was more willingness to concede that shamanism might
not be simply a form of hysteria. Though Freud's theories still
met with resistance, his basic premise of an unconscious mind
had come to be accepted; and he had surmised that from the unconscious
man could have access to information which was not available to
him through his five senses&#151;a proposition that Jung accepted
and expanded. If so, was it not possible that what the diviner
was trying to explain, when he claimed that the medicine 'stood
alert within him, was that in some way it liberated instinct,
which answered the required questions without the intervention
of consciousness? In primitive communities, after all, instinct
may well be a surer guide, on many issues, than imperfect reasoning
ability There seems no reason to doubt', M. J. Field concluded
from her long experience working in Ghana, 'that the utterances
of a possessed person, concentrating on a narrowed field, may
exceed in wisdom those he can achieve when exposed to all the
distractions of normal consciousness.' However odd such a method
of getting information might appear to the materialist, Field
found that it worked&#151;'by their fruits ye shall know them, and
the fruits of most spirit possession in Ghana are wholesome and
sustaining' Michael Gelfand came to a similar conclusion from
his experience in Rhodesia. Irrational though their technique
might seem, it could be very effective; the practitioner might
be no scientist&#151; he wrote in his <I>Witch Doctor</I>&#151;'but
he practices his art with superb skill'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In any case, the fact was that most primitive communities used
divination as a guide in their everyday affairs; and anthropologists
began to realise that to ignore or depreciate its influence was
like an atheist refusing to study the effect of Christianity on
history on the ground that he did not believe in God. And gradually,
a hypothesis has evolved to account for divination, and to explain
its social role.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Like other forms of animal life, man originally had instinct as
his guide, supplemented by the five senses. But with the development
of consciousness, reasoning power, and memory, the capacity to
consult instinct was gradually lost, except when it broke through
as the 'sixth sense', or intuition. For primitive man, the loss
would have been serious, had it not been for the fact that certain
individuals retained the ability to dissociate&#151;to throw off
consciousness, and to liberate instinct.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Dissociation took various forms. The diviner might dance out the
required answers, as Evans-Pritchard had observed; he might become
possessed, as if taken over by a disembodied personality; or he
might have visions in which the spirits would show him or tell
him what he wanted to learn. How the information was secured,
though, did not much matter, so long as it appeared to be relevant
and useful. But as man came to rely more on memory and reasoning
power he found it more difficult to enter the required trance
state; and it was at this point that drugs came to be used, to
induce it&#151;man being guided, perhaps, by instinct to the required
plant drugs, just as animals are guided to the right plants to
make up for vitamin deficiencies.
<A HREF="#foot2"><SUP>2</SUP></A><A NAME="back2"></A>
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In his <I>Shamanism,</I> published in 1951, Professor Mircea Eliade
interpreted this development as being a sign of decadence. Narcotics&#151;as
he called them, with obvious distaste, lumping tobacco, alcohol
and the fly agaric together&#151;were a recent innovation, 'only
a vulgar substitute for pure trance', and 'an imitation of the
state which the shaman is no longer capable of attaining otherwise'.
Recently, however, this verdict has been challenged, notably by
R. G. Wasson in his <I>Soma,</I> and by some of the contributors
to the first full scale academic symposium on plant drugs, held
at the University of California in 1970&#151;the proceedings of which
were subsequently edited by Professor Peter T. Furst and published
as <I>Flesh of the Gods.</I> Drugs are indeed a substitute for
the ability to enter the trance state voluntarily, but that is
not necessarily a symptom of decadence; if man can find such substitutes
for faculties which he has lost in his evolution, that may be
held to be to his credit. And there is no evidence that the trance
state induced by drugs is necessarily any different from the state
attained by other means.<P>&nbsp;  
<H3>Horizons beyond</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
One question remains unanswered. Until very recently, to take
divination seriously enough even to consider the possibility that
extra-sensory perception might be involved, as a product of the
drug-induced trance state, was to court ridicule. But orthodox
science has been shifting its stance, moving towards guarded acceptance
of the proposition that some phenomena, formerly regarded as supernatural,
may acquire scientific respectability. Certainly the former prejudice
against research studies in this field is disappearing.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The historical evidence for links between taking certain drugs
and the ability to practise divination would fill a book. Constantly
men have believed that they have been on the verge of proving
it&#151; like Joseph Kopek, a Polish general exiled to Siberia in
the 1790s, whose experiments with the fly agaric not merely made
him believe he was a diviner, but enabled him to correct the mistakes
of the local shaman ('I warned him to improve in those matters;
and I noticed that he took those warnings almost as the voice
of revelation'). Could anybody now deny, Kopek went on,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
that in spite of our vast knowledge of natural phenomena, there
still exist almost countless phenomena about which we can only
guess? Can one put a limit to nature at a point that delimits
the possibilities of enquiries and discoveries of human research?
Innumerable effects of recently discovered magnetic forces; effects
that cannot be detected by physical means nor pinpointed with
any degree of precision to some specification on the human body,
seem to reconcile in some measure the controversy concerning this
mushroom. It is possible that in the sleep brought by the influence
of this mushroom, a man is able to see at least some of his real
past and, if not the future, at least his present relations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the letters and memoirs of travellers, missionaries and colonial
administrators over the past century and a half there are countless
stories, some of them well attested, of witch doctors accurately
describing what was happening in distant places, or correctly
forecasting future events. But they were all, by their nature,
'anecdotal'; and it was always possible to pick holes in an anecdote&#151;as,
for example, in the case of an episode recounted at the turn of
the century by the respected South African merchant David Leslie,
who had decided out of curiosity to test a local diviner. Leslie
had eight native hunters out working for him, searching for elephant;
could the diviner tell him how they were faring? The diviner made
eight fires, and threw roots into them; then, he took a drug,
and fell into a convulsive trance. When he came round, he raked
out the fires one by one, describing as he did so what was happening
to each hunter; how some had been fortunate; others had done badly;
and two had been killed. The account, Leslie claimed, had proved
to be true in every particular. But could the diviner not have
cheated? Dudley Kidd argued in <I>The Essential Kafir,</I> published
in 1902, that he could have combined local knowledge with intelligent
guesswork. Leslie, though he might be convinced that this explanation
was inadequate, had no way of proving that the diviner really
had been using second sight.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Tales of the kind that Leslie told have continued to be heard
from many parts of the world, particularly from those regions
of America where peyotl can be found. Dr. Rafael Bayon, working
in Colombia at the beginning of the century, became convinced
that with its help the local shaman could see and hear distant
events on behalf of a patient, 'consistent with exact observations
of things of which the patient neither has, nor could have, the
least previous knowledge'. Twenty years later the French missionaries
assured the pharmacologist Andre Rouhier that shamans who were
asked a question only needed to take peyotl 'and they obtain a
solution to the problem before them in an auditory form &#151;a person
appearing to them and telling them what they want to know; or
visually&#151;as if, for example, they were to see the landscape,
the persons or the plants which would serve them to the end desired'.
Recently, Carlos Castaneda has described Don Juan's paranormal
faculties in his books; and in <I>Flesh of the Gods,</I> Douglas
Sharon&#151;an anthropological field worker&#151;has given a convincing
account of the powers of the Peruvian shaman Eduardo Calderon
Palomino.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
When Palomino realised that he had a vocation to be a <I>curandero,</I>
a healer/diviner, he began to practise with the help of tobacco,
which gave him 'very rapid sight, mind and imagination'. (It was
for this purpose, he surmised, that people had originally taken
snuff; the <I>curanderos</I> found it helped to clear their minds
and speed their thoughts.) But when he wanted to induce visions,
he took the potent San Pedro cactus. He described the effects
to Sharon:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . first, a slight dizziness that one hardly notices. And then
a great vision, a clearing of all the faculties of the individual.
It produces a slight numbness in the body and afterwards a tranquillity.
And then comes a detachment, a type of visual force in the individual,
inclusive of all the senses; seeing, hearing, smelling, touching,
etc.&#151;all the senses, including the sixth sense, the telepathic
sense of transmitting oneself across time and matter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The cactus drug, Palomino thought, developed the power of perception,
enabling a man to 'distinguish powers or problems of disturbances
at a great distance, so as to deal with them'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This evidence&#151;and there is a great deal more of it&#151;suggests
that drug-induced divination as practised in primitive communities
deserves more serious attention than it has received. If it can
be demonstrated that drugs are capable of liberating the clairvoyant
faculty in certain individuals, so that with the help of their
training as shamans they can use it for the benefit of the tribe,
there will have to be a radical reappraisal both of shamanism
and of the drugs associated with it. R. G. Wasson has even suggested
that they may have had an evolutionary role, by giving primitive
man a glimpse 'of horizons beyond any that he knew in his harsh
struggle for survival'.<P>&nbsp;  <HR WIDTH=50%>

<A NAME="foot1"></A>1. The anthropologists did, however, fully
confirm the old travellers' tale. According to Vladimir Jochelson,
writing in 1905, reindeer no longer even needed to be summoned
with the call <I>Girach! Girach!</I>  <A HREF="#back1">(back)</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Frequently the reindeer come running to camp from a far off pasture
to taste of snow saturated with urine, having a keen sense of
hearing and of smell, but their sight is rather poor. A man stopping
to urinate in the open attracts reindeer from afar, which, following
the sense of smell, will run to the urine, hardly discerning the
man, and paying no attention to him. The position of a man standing
up in the open white urinating is rather critical when he becomes
the object of attention from reindeer coming down on him from
all sides at full speed.

climate, discover in frozen tundras or remote jungles the one
plant, indistinguishable from so many others of the same species,
which could, by a most elaborate process, bring them fantasies,
intoxication, and freedom from care? How unless by help from the
plants themselves ?  <A HREF="#back2">(back)</A>

<H2>Drugs and the Priesthood</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THE CHANGE OF ATTITUDE TO DRUGS, BY WHICH THEY CAME TO BE regarded
as a threat rather than as an asset to society, was connected
with the decline of shamanism and the emergence in its place of
organised religions and their priesthoods; an evolution which
the earlier anthropologists took to be a sign of progress, towards
less irrational forms of belief, but which can now be interpreted
rather differently.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Shaman to priest</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As man's reasoning power developed, and his capacity to consult
instinct declined, fewer men could be found who had the ability,
with or without a drug, to slip into the trance state; and it
became progressively more difficult to interpret the pronouncements
of those who could. More powerful doses of whatever drug was in
use could not have helped, as they would have promoted simple
intoxication, without benefit of revealing visions. The medicine
no longer 'stood alert' within the shaman, leading him inexorably
to the answer he was seeking, uncovering the identity of witch
or thief. He began to need aids, as if to pick up and amplify
instinct's weak transmissions. Just as there are some water diviners
who search for underground sources unaided, while others need
to use a forked hazel twig or a pendulum, so there were (and still
are) some shamans who needed no aids, while others had to employ
devices&#151;horns, say, which they could hold, and which seemed
to dictate their movements. And in the next stage, they began
to seek their visions in smoke, or in bowls of liquid&#151;much as
a present-day fortune teller consults a crystal ball; or to throw
bones, and observe the pattern they formed as they fell; or to
examine the entrails of animals.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So long as these techniques were employed as a means to induce
a trance&#151;so long as the smoke or the entrails were simply a
way of rousing the unconscious mind to take over&#151;drugs still
had their part to play in making the process easier. But the time
was to come when divination by such means became standardised.
The pattern in which the bones fell, the state of the entrails,
were consciously 'read', as were omens; a bird flying past from
one direction meant one forecast; from another direction, a different
forecast. In time, divination was reduced to rote&#151;to routine.
Dissociation was then no longer needed; and drugs became superfluous.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At the same time, the development of patterns of belief&#151; religions&#151;made
dissociation an untrustworthy and unnerving experience, because
the material pouring out of the unconscious might be at variance
with approved doctrine. A safer way was to employ ritual; the
regular repetition of words and actions, designed to break down
consciousness without inducing a full trance. Ritual required
more self-control on the shaman's part, in order that he should
be able to reproduce the formula exactly, time after time. Dissociation
was no help; and drugs were a positive handicap. As a result shamans
began to be chosen on other grounds than their ability to induce
trances; and it was at this point that, in effect, they became
priests.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The priest, as the American anthropologist A. L. Kroeber defined
him half a century ago,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
is an official recognised by the community. He has duties and
powers. He may inherit, be elected, or succeed by virtue of lineage
subject to confirmation. But he steps into a specific office which
existed before him and continues after his death. His power is
the result of his induction into the office, and the knowledge
and authority that go with it. He thus contrasts sharply with
the shaman&#151;logically at least. The shaman makes his position.
Any person possessed of the necessary mediumistic faculty, or
able to convince a part of the community of his ability to operate
supernaturally, is thereby a shaman. His influence is essentially
personal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The demarcation line, as Kroeber emphasised, cannot always be
clearly drawn; in early civilizations, shamanism and religion
often co-existed, particularly where potent plant drugs were available&#151;peyotl,
datura, the fly agaric. The most striking example emerges from
the verses of the <I>Rig Veda</I>&#151;the testimonies of the shaman/priesthood
which was one outcome of the Aryan influx into India, three thousand
years ago
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have drunk soma, have become immortal <BR>
Gone to the light have we, the gods discovered <BR>
What can hostility do against us?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
These hymns to a plant deity, as Wasson pointed out in his <I>Soma,</I>
were composed over a period of centuries, by men who lived far
remote from each other, but shared the same experiences from it;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . In the hierarchy of Vedic gods certain others took precedence
over Soma: but since Soma was a tangible, visible thing, its inebriating
juice to be ingested by the human organism in the course of the
ritual, a god come down and manifesting himself to the Aryans,
Soma played a singular role in the Vedic pantheon. The poets never
tire of stressing Soma's sensuous appeal . . . The priests, after
imbibing the juice, seem to have known, for the nonce, the ecstasy
of existence in the World of the Immortals. The divine element
was not just a symbol of spiritual truth as in the Christian communion:
Soma was a miraculous drink that spoke for itself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It remains uncertain from which plant Soma was extracted. (Wasson's
contention that it must have been the fly agaric makes more sense
than most early theories, which even proffered such unlikely candidates
as rhubarb); and the testimonials cannot be regarded as a wholly
reliable source of information about its qualities&#151;a similar
collection of eulogies of beer or tobacco could be collated from
English sources which would be hardly less idolatrous. Nevertheless
the impression left of Soma's transcendental qualities is significant,
because it reveals that the drug&#151; whatever it may have been&#151;was
being taken for a different end. The purpose was no longer basically
functional&#151;to secure access to useful information. Rather, it
was to lift the mind to a higher plane of perception. The suggestion
has even been made that the shaman priests did not take the drug
to try to achieve artificially the exalted state of mind that
mystics achieved through yoga. The mystics, through yoga, may
have been trying to recapture the exalted states of mind which
formerly had required the assistance of Soma for their attainment.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In many other parts of the world, plant drugs which had originally
been used to facilitate access to the spirits came to be regarded,
and later worshipped, as spirits, or deities, in their own right.
In Peru, Tschudi reported, 'it was believed that any business
undertaken without the benediction of coca leaves could not prosper,
and to the shrub itself, worship was rendered'. Chewed coca was
thrown on veins of ore in the Peruvian mines, in the belief they
would be softened, and easier to work. A few years later the French
traveller H. A. Weddell, exploring Bolivia, found that married
men going on a journey would throw a dollop of chewed coca leaf
on to a rock, in the belief that if it did not still adhere td
the rock when they returned, it would be proof that in their absence
their wives had not adhered to their marital vows. Many innocents,
Weddell feared, must have suffered a <I>bastonnade,</I> as a result.
In the 1920s Alexander Goldenweiser described how the Chuckchi
tribesmen in Siberia took the fly agaric in the expectation that
the mushrooms would appear to them in the guise of mushroom men,
who would 'lead the dreamer through the world and show him real
and imaginary things'. Later, Wasson observed the same process
in Mexico, where the mushrooms had begun to take command:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They speak through the <I>curandero</I> or shaman. He is as though
not present. The mushrooms answer the questions put to them about
the sick patient, about the future, about the stolen money or
the missing donkey . . . similarly the eater of the fly agaric
comes under the command of the mushrooms, and they are personified
as amanita girls or amanita men, the size of the fly agaric,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The fruit of the vine</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Drugs, therefore, remained an essential part of shamanism, where
it survived. But wherever religions established themselves in
its place, and in particular where the religion was monotheistic,
the need for them disappeared, because the kind of divination
they inspired was regarded as a threat. Rulers did not care for
untamed sources of information, which might turn out to be subversive;
and priests, brooding over their entrails, looked with envy on
shamans, drawing their information directly from the spirit world
&#151;'the priest realises clearly where the danger lies', as Michelet
observed in his study of sorcery; 'an enemy, a menacing rival,
is to be feared in this High-Priestess of Nature he pretends to
despise'. Divination in such circumstances became regarded as
the devil's doing&#151;unless the diviner's probity or position was
such that this interpretation was unthinkable, or perhaps unmentionable.
It was equated with witchcraft, and the death penalty imposed
for anybody who practised it&#151;except when, as in the case of
the witch of Endor, it happened to be the State, in the person
of King Saul, who needed the prognostication. And drugs which
had been used to induce the trance state were naturally suspect.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was one drug available, however, which in this respect was
relatively safe: wine. Whereas other drugs appeared to give access
to information transmitted from a different world, what wine released&#151;though
it was often revealing: <I>in vino veritas</I>&#151;was mundane.
It induced visions only when taken in excess, over a protracted
period; and they were not of any divinatory value to a shaman,
or anybody else. As an intoxicant, in fact, alcohol's function
was&#151;in the phrase that has been so often echoed&#151;to 'take away
understanding'. It removed a man from the cares of the world,
without precipitating him into another. Although his behaviour
when in this condition might be anti-social and dangerous to himself
and his companions, it presented no real threat to the authority
of Church or State.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Wine, though, was taken chiefly as a beverage. It was decidedly
safer to drink, in many regions, than water&#151;as well as tasting
agreeable. The Old Testament writings demonstrate that wine was
never, in that era, looked on with suspicion. Drunkenness was
condemned as a sin, but wine was no more held responsible for
it than meat was held responsible for the sin of gluttony. So
far from wine being suspect, it was usually coupled with bread
as God's great gift to man. An abundant grape harvest signified
divine pleasure; a superabundant harvest was taken to herald the
coming of the Messiah. Temperance reformers were later to point
to the existence of tribes or sects who renounced wine; but this
was not because of disapproval of its intoxicating properties,
but because they objected to the cultivation of the grapes. Nomads
tended to despise those who settled down to the sedentary life
of the farmer or town dweller; the Rechabite injunction 'ye shall
drink no wine' was accompanied by 'neither shall ye build house,
nor sow seed'. And where ascetic sects emerged, their worry was
that wine-bibbing was a form of self-indulgence. John the Baptist
would have objected as strenuously to the consumption of agreeably
flavoured non-alcoholic drinks.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Wine had two effects, however, which eventually aroused debate
on whether it ought to be&#151;in effect&#151;reclassified as a drug.
One was the possible consequences for society of intoxication,
when it unfitted men to do their jobs. It was up to the individual
to regulate his own drinking, Plato's Athenian argued in the <I>Laws;</I>
but the State had a right and a duty to protect citizens from
the effects of that drinking, should it put them at risk:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . if the practice is treated as mere play, and free licence
is to be given to any man to drink whenever he pleases, in what
company he pleases, and when engaged on any undertaking he pleases,
I could no longer vote for allowing any indulgence in the wine-cup
to such a city, or such a man. I would even go further than the
practice of Crete and Lacedaemon and propose an addition to the
Carthaginian law which prohibits the very taste of this liquor
to all soldiers in the field, and enforces water-drinking throughout
the duration of a campaign. I would absolutely prohibit its taste
in civic life to slaves of both sexes, to magistrates throughout
the year of their office, and equally absolutely to captains of
vessels and jurymen when on duty, and likewise to any member of
an important council when about to attend its meetings. Further
I would prohibit its use during the day absolutely, except under
the orders of a trainer or physician, and at night also to any
person of either sex contemplating the procreation of children,
to pass over the many other cases in which wine is not to be drunk
by rational men with a sound law.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Greeks were concerned only about how to prevent drinking from
becoming a security risk. Some early Christian sects, however,
began to take the argument a stage further, and suggest that there
was a more serious hazard: that it would imperil men's souls.
Gnostics, Manicheans and others argued that as wine was notoriously
an aphrodisiac, and the occasion of sin, to drink it must be sinful,
and wine itself must be inherently evil. Against them were ranged
those fathers of the Church on whom Greek thought still exercised
a decisive influence, and who contended that 'it is not what entereth
in that defileth a man'&#151;as Clement of Alexandria put it in the
second century A.D.&#151;'but that which goes out of his mouth';
a view echoed by St. Chrysostom, two centuries later:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... the simple ones among our brethren, when they see any person
disgracing themselves from drunkenness, instead of reproving such,
blame the fruit given them by God, and say, 'Let there be no wine'.
We should say then in answer to such, 'let there be no drunkenness;
for wine is the work of God, but drunkenness is the work of the
devil'. Wine makes not drunkenness, but intemperance produces
it. Do not accuse that which is the workmanship of God, but accuse
the madness of a fellow mortal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Hashish</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The knowledge that Jesus had been a wine drinker&#151;and had even
promised the disciples at the last supper that he would enjoy
wine with them in Paradise&#151;did not prevent the leaders of early
Christian sects from arguing that wine was the occasion of sin,
because they could claim that as Jesus was without sin, wine had
no power over him. But to the ordinary believer, the argument
sounded specious; and when Mahomet decided to instruct his followers
to forgo wine, one of the reasons&#151;it has been suggested &#151;was
that this would help to distinguish them from the wineloving Christians.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As this was the first attempt of its kind to prohibit the consumption
of a popular drug, it would be interesting to know more about
how the ban worked. Given a zealous priesthood, it would have
been relatively easy to enforce, because the location of the vineyards
would be known. They could easily have been destroyed; and wine
is too- bulky to be easily smuggled in any quantity on camel caravans.
The evidence, however, has yet to be sifted, to find what were
the prohibition's effects. Ironically we know more &#151;thanks to
the work of Franz Rosenthal&#151;about one of the side-effects of
Mahomet's law: the controversy which followed in the Moslem world
whether hashish, the drug made from the hemp plant, ought also
to come under the ban, though it had not been formally indicted
in the Koran. In <I>The Herb,</I> published in 1971, Rosenthal
presented an illuminating sample of the opinions of philosophers
and priests, public health officials and poets, on the issue of
whether and how the consumption of hashish should be restricted,
or stopped altogether: a foretaste of many a similar campaign
to come.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To judge from a brief account in Herodotus of the way the Scythians
threw hemp on heated stones and 'carried away by the fumes, shout
aloud', the hemp plant must long have been known to have intoxicating
qualities; and Moslem sects, such as the Sufis, continued to take
it in traditional shamanist ways. By Mahomet's time, though, it
seems to have been utilised chiefly as a medicine for, among other
disorders, dandruff, diarrhoea, earache, gonorrhea and worms.
But then&#151;perhaps because of the ban on wine &#151;hemp came again
to be eaten, or drunk in some form of infusion in the Moslem world.
There are difficulties, Rosenthal warned, in the way of any assessment
of its precise effects on people, because 'hashish', the term
ordinarily used, not merely covered a variety of different hemp
preparations, but also took in opium and henbane, and was loosely
used about herbs in general. Hemp, Rosenthal surmised, must gradually
have come to be identified with hashish because it was regarded
as the herb; 'the most representative and, probably, the most
widely used of the hallucinatory drugs employed by medieval Muslims'.
And when the authorities realised it was being increasingly adopted
as a substitute for wine, they began to cast around for excuses
to stop it. The Koran, they argued, banned wine because it could
be an intoxicant; hashish was being taken as an intoxicant; therefore
hashish should be banned. The upper classes tended to agree&#151;
particularly employers: hashish-eating was mainly a working class
habit. It was bad for the working man's health, they explained;
damaging his complexion, giving him halitosis, and eventually
leading him to immorality, insanity, and mental exhaustion (much
the same arguments, in fact, as were later to be used in England
against masturbation).
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The supporters of hashish argued that it had not been banned in
the Koran precisely because it did not intoxicate&#151;not, at least,
in the same way as wine. Wine caused quarrelsomeness; hashish
induced 'languid placidity'&#151;as even its critics appear to have
conceded; in the attacks on the drug, Rosenthal could find no
mention of any really violent actions against others under its
influence. In some people, it created a pleasant stupor; in others
it excited the imagination; that was all. It could not be condemned
as anti-social. The law should therefore not meddle with it. As
a Jurist put it ingeniously in a verse:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hashish intoxication contains a hidden secret<BR>
Too subtle for minds to explain<BR>
They have declared it forbidden without any justification<BR>
&nbsp;  on the basis of reason and tradition<BR>
Declaring forbidden what is not forbidden is forbidden
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As hashish was admitted to be less intoxicating than such alternatives
as opium and henbane&#151;and even nutmeg, which enjoyed a considerable
reputation as a narcotic&#151;any attempt to suppress it, its supporters
added, might only lead its purchasers to more dangerous drugs.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
These arguments did not impress the authorities, who determined
to try to curb the consumption of hashish. But how? Should it
be banned outright; or should it be permitted for specific purposes,
with penalties for misuse? Periodically, outright prohibition
was attempted; but enforcement proved impracticable. The hemp
plant grew wild; and even if it had not, it would have been impossible
to stop cultivation, as it was valuable for other purposes&#151;for
making fibre, as well as medicine. It was quite easy to transport,
or if necessary to smuggle, to those who wanted it; and because
it was cheap there was a ready demand even from the poorest classes&#151;'I
am satisfied', as a poet put it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . with a morsel of porridge <BR>
And a round pill of hashish, <BR>
Why should I reproach time from which individual <BR>
Destiny proceeds, by complaining about lack of means?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The pattern which emerges from Rosenthal's research is significant,
because it has recurred again and again up to the present day.
Drugs come under attack because they make Church and State uneasy,
for fear that they will render people, particularly the young,
less amenable to discipline. As the authorities do not care to
admit that this is their real reason for wanting to stop drug-taking,
they claim they are only concerned with their subjects' health,
morals, and welfare. They then find that prohibition simply does
not work. The anti-hashish campaigners, according to Rosenthal,
were forced to admit that they were 'fighting a losing battle
with the reality of the social environment', and eventually they
sank into 'complete resignation'. It was the first in a long line
of such losing battles in authority's protracted war to control
drugs.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Witch's brew</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There are other gaps in the history of drugs in this era which
will have to await research like Rosenthal's to fill in. Some
are unlikely ever to be filled. We will probably never know for
certain what the constituents were of Homer's nepenthe; or what
drug was used in the shamanist Eleusinian cult in ancient Greece,
in which the initiate was given a potion designed to induce delectable
visions, after which he could never be the same again. In general,
the information about drugs and their social effects in classical
times, and in the Middle Ages, is too scanty and unreliable to
serve as the basis for anything more than enjoyable speculation.
And although there is plenty of evidence about the attempts to
control drunkenness&#151;Solon established the death penalty for
magistrates who were found under the influence and numerous regulations
were made to prohibit slaves, or minors, or women from drinking
&#151;there is very little evidence how such laws worked in practice.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Apart from wine, there does not seem to have been any drug in
common enough use in Europe to disturb the authorities' peace
of mind. Drugs crop up chiefly in connection with witchcraft.
Professor Michael Harner has recently argued that they were of
central importance to witchcraft in Europe, but that this has
been obscured by the fact that so much of the source material,
most of it in Latin, has never been studied by anybody with an
interest in this aspect of the subject. From the later evidence
of witchcraft trials, it is clear that witches employed such plants
as henbane and deadly nightshade&#151;sometimes making them into
unguents, and smearing them on parts of their bodies&#151;as a way
of liberating themselves. to undertake their Sabbat rides. It
is also clear that, like shamans, they believed that while they
were under the influence of these drugs they really could fly
through the air. One seventeenth-century witch, more fortunate
than many in that she had a shrewd priest dealing with her, boasted
she could prove it;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
rubbing ointment on herself to the accompaniment of magic incantations,
she lay her head back and immediately fell asleep. With the labor
of the devil she dreamed of Mistress Venus and other superstitions
so vividly that, crying out with a shout and striking her hands
about, she jarred the bowl in which she was sitting and, falling
down from the stool, seriously injured herself about the head.
As she lay there awakened, the priest cried out to her that she
had not moved; 'for heaven's sake, where are you ? You were not
with Diana and as will be attested by these present, you never
left this bowl'. Thus, by this act and by thoughtful exhortations
he drew out this belief from her abominable soul.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Harner cites a number of similar examples, suggesting that witchcraft
was not, as some historians have suggested, a symptom of mass
hysteria, having no existence in its own right, but a debased
form of shamanism, which the hostility of the Church had prevented
from coming out into the open.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The prevailing belief in diabolic possession, however, meant that
the drugs a witch used were not regarded as responsible for her
conduct; and there is no indication that drugs were otherwise
employed, except as medicines. Consequently, they were not an
issue. Drunkenness continued to be condemned, and legislated against&#151;but
as a social nuisance rather than as a sin. So when Columbus's
men returned with their descriptions of the purposes for which
drugs were used in the New World, they were too unfamiliar to
be feared as a threat to faith or morals in Europe. They could
be welcomed, in fact, for the medicinal properties they were believed
to possess.

<H3>Tobacco: herba panacea</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THERE WAS SOME DISPUTE AT THE TIME&#151;AMONG SCHOLARS, 
THERE still is&#151;over who deserved the praise or execration for introducing
tobacco into Europe. The Spanish colonists soon took to it, in
spite of official disapproval. Bartholomew de las Casas found
some of them on the island of Hispaniola who had been reported
for smoking; when remonstrated with for indulging in so vicious
a habit, they had replied it was 'not in their power to stop'.
And sailors brought the habit home. But it gained its initial
popularity in Europe as a medicine. Its value in treating fevers
and other disorders led Jean Nicot, French Ambassador at the Portuguese
Court, to take tobacco plants to France, when he returned there
in 1561, as a present for Catherine de Medici; and by the time
Nicholas Monardes published his <I>Joyful News out of the New
Found World,</I> a few years later, it had begun to be regarded
as the great cure-all: <I>herba panacea,</I> valuable whether
taken into the lungs, or into the digestive system&#151;or applied
externally, to wounds; effective alike against headaches carbuncles,
chilblains, worms, or venereal disease.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This was not illogical, in the prevailing climate of orthodox
medical opinion, based on the assumption that health depended
on a correct balance of the humours: blood, bile, and phlegm.
A medicine which could 'cleanse the superfluous humors of the
brain' could be expected to remove whatever symptoms that superfluity
had brought on, mental or physical; and also to preserve health&#151;those
who took it, according to the mathematician Thomas Hariot, who
was with Raleigh's expedition to Virginia in 1585, were 'not subject
to many grievous diseases with which we in England are sometimes
afflicted'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was for this reason, presumably, that Raleigh brought tobacco
plants back from Virginia to plant on his Irish estate; his friend
Edmund Spenser, who used to stay there, listed 'divine tobacco'
in <I>The Faery Queen</I> as one of the herbs Belphoebe gathered
to staunch the flow of blood from Timais's wound. But Raleigh
began to enjoy tobacco in its own right, smoking it in a pipe
as the Indians did in Virginia. Friends and acquaintances, introduced
to smoking, caught the habit; and soon, it became the fashion.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Tobacco caught on not because it induced a trance state, and visions.
Young Englishmen of the time would have been terrified if it had.
They took to the drug simply because it was fashionable and&#151;as
soon as they got over the initial reaction of giddiness or nausea&#151;enjoyable.
It provided a mild 'lift', when that was desired; or it assisted
relaxation. But it had one unwelcome consequence. It created a
craving so powerful that by the 1890s, the writer of an English
herbal was complaining that some men could not restrain themselves
from having a smoke, 'no, not in the middle of their dinner'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Smoking happened to become fashionable in England at a time when
Puritanism was also establishing itself, based on an ethic closer
to that of John the Baptist than of Jesus. The Puritan was not
then in a position to deny tobacco's medicinal virtues, but it
did not escape him that the people who smoked it were rarely concerned
for their health. It was consequently possible to argue that because
tobacco 'drinking' (as it was then often described, in the sense
of 'drinking it all in') was not confined to specific doses at
certain times of day, it could actually be harmful&#151; like other
drugs whose dosage was inadequately regulated: particularly to
the young. Here, the Puritan found allies in the nobility and
gentry who, even if they themselves liked to smoke, were apt to
be indignant when their sons insisted on following the fashion.
Ben Jonson portrayed the type&#151;the clown Sogliardo in <I>Every
Man out of his Humour,</I> 'so enamoured of the name of a gentleman
that he will have it, though he buys it. He comes up every term
to learn to take tobacco'. The parents suffered&#151;'the patrimony
of many noble young gentlemen', Edmund Gardner, author of the
<I>Trial of Tobacco,</I> observed, had 'vanished clear away with
this smoky vapour'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was this aspect of the dangers of tobacco that 'Philaretes'
emphasised in his <I>Work for Chimney Sweepers,</I> which appeared
in 1602, denouncing smoking as a 'pestiferous vice'. Still fresh
in the memory, he recalled, were reports
<BLOCKQUOTE>
that divers young Gentlemen, by the daily use of this tobacco,
have brought themselves to fluxes and dysentries, and of late
at Bath a scholar of some good account and worshipful calling
was supposed to have perished by this practice, for his humours
being sharpened and made thin by the frequent use of tobacco,
after that they had once taken a course downward, they ran in
such violence, that by no art or physician's skill could they
be stayed, till the man most miserably ended his life, being then
in the very prime and vigour of his age.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Philaretes explained how this had happened. Tobacco, he asserted,
worked by evaporating man's 'unctuous and radical moistures'&#151;as
was demonstrated in the fact that it was employed to cure gonorrhea
by drying up the discharge. But this process, if too long continued,
could only end by drying up 'spermatical humidity', too, rendering
him incapable of propagation. Experience also showed that tobacco
left men in a state of depression, 'mopishness and sottishness',
which in the long run must damage memory, imagination and understanding.
Nor was it any use the defenders of tobacco arguing that the Indians
took it without such ill-effects; the Indians had accustomed themselves
to taking it from childhood.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Tobacco: counterblast</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
<I>Work for Chimney Sweepers</I> was the first of scores of similar
pamphlets which were to appear later on the same theme, denouncing
the use of tobacco&#151;and later of other drugs&#151;for non-medical
purposes. Whatever the drug, the writer was likely to claim that
it was physically and mentally destructive, if not in its immediate
effects, then in the long term; that it put the youth of the country
particularly at risk&#151;as some scarifying illustration from Bath
(or Baden, or Ballston Spa, N.Y.) would demonstrate; and that
it had a sinister past record. As the composer of the prototypical
broadside, Philaretes could be cited as deserving of some small
niche in the history of drugs. But his offering was to be overshadowed
by the more famous <I>Counterblast to Tobacco</I> which came out
two years later, in 1604&#151;its anonymous author's identity not
being concealed for long: James I, newly ascended to the British
throne.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In certain respects, the <I>Counterblast</I> was ahead of its
time. James did not waste time trying to explode tobacco's reputation
as a cure-all by citing examples of its failures; he contented
himself with exposing the contradictions in the claims made on
its behalf.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It cures the gout in the feet and (which is miraculous) in that
very instant when the smoke thereof&#151;light&#151;flies up into the
head, the virtue thereof&#151;as heavy&#151;runs down to the little
toe. It helps all sorts of agues. It makes a man sober that was
drunk. It refreshes a weary man, and yet makes a man hungry. Being
taken on going to bed, it makes one sleep soundly; and yet being
taken when a man is sleepy and drowsy, it will, as they say, awake
his brain, and quicken his understanding. As for the curing of
the Pox, it serves for that use only among the poxy Indian slaves.
Here in England it is refined, and will not deign to cure here
any other than cleanly and gentlemanly diseases. Omnipotent power
of tobacco!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
James also emphasised tobacco's most commonly encountered pernicious
effect: 'many in this kingdom have had such a continual use of
taking this unsavoury smoke, they are not now able to resist the
same, no more than an old drunkard can abide to be long sober'.
But he spoiled his case by clearly hinting at one of the reasons
for his dislike of tobacco: his hatred of Raleigh. Nor could he
resist the temptation to set out his arguments against tobacco
in the form of literary conceits. Tobacco, he sought to prove,
was 'the lively image and pattern of hell', because it had in
it all the vices for which man might expect hell to await him:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to wit; first, it was a smoke; so are the vanities of this world.
Secondly, it delighteth them who take it; so do the pleasures
of the world delight the men of the world. Thirdly, it maketh
men drunken, and light in the head; so do the vanities of the
world, men are drunken therewith. Fourthly, he that taketh tobacco
saith he cannot leave it, it doth bewitch him; even so, the pleasures
of the world make men loath to leave them, they are for the most
part so enchanted with them; and further, besides all this, it
is like hell in the very substance of it, for it is a stinking
loathsome thing; and so is hell.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was a little too pat, confirming that James was less the shrewd
observer of the effects of the drug that he appeared to be, than
the diligent collector of all the possible rationalisations which
could be mustered against it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
That autumn, James informed the High Treasurer of England that
all importers of tobacco would have to pay, in addition to the
customs duty of 2d a pound that Elizabeth had imposed, the sum
of 6/8d; an increase of 4,000 per cent. It was the first attempt
of its kind to get rid of a drug by indirect prohibition&#151;by
imposing a tax so heavy that only the very rich would be able
to afford to buy it. And this discrimination was deliberate. When
tobacco had been discovered, the preamble recalled, it had been
taken 'by the better sort', only as physic. But it had recently,
'through evil custom and the toleration thereof, been taken in
excess by a number of riotous and disorderly persons of mean and
base condition who, contrary to the usages of which persons of
good calling and quality make, spend most of their time in idle
vanity, to the evil example and corrupting of others'. They also
spent too much of their wages, which they ought to be spending
on their families, 'not caring at what price they buy'; so that
people's health was being impaired, making them unfit for work,
and consuming their resources, and also the country's, because
'a great part of the treasure of our land is spent and exhausted
by this drug alone'. James, in other words, had been moved to
action less because of the drug's effect on his subjects' health,
than because it might make them less loyal and hard-working. Men
who took time off to smoke could be expected to expend much of
that time in talk; and the talk might turn to gunpowder, treason
and plot . . . 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To judge by the <I>Counterblast,</I> James would have preferred
to ban tobacco outright; but that could possibly have been dangerous,
with so many pipe-smokers among the Court circle; and it would
certainly have been difficult, with tobacco in such demand as
a medicine. So the intention&#151;the preamble continued&#151;was simply
to provide a restraint on consumption, in order to reduce the
amount being imported, while leaving 'sufficient store to serve
for the necessary use of those who are of the better sort, and
have and will use the same with moderation to preserve their health'.
But the new duty, James soon found, had precisely the opposite
effect to that which he had intended. The people who used tobacco
to cure ailments, finding it so expensive, were forced back on
older herbal remedies which cost little or nothing. Those who
had begun to smoke for pleasure, however, and become addicted
could not bear to do without their pipefuls. And although with
so heavy a duty to be paid, merchants did indeed, as James had
hoped, find it less profitable to import tobacco, this only meant
that they found it more profitable to smuggle it. In the decade
that followed the introduction of the duty, tobacco consumption
continued to increase, not least among the poor. 'There is not
so base a groom'&#151;the pamphleteer Barnabe Rich complained in
1614&#151;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
that comes into the alehouse to call for his pot, but he must
have his pipe of tobacco, for it is a commodity that is now as
saleable in every tavern, inn, and ale house, as either wine,
ale or beer, and in apothecaries' shops, grocers' shops, chandlers'
shops, they are (almost) never without company, that from morning
to night are still taking of tobacco; what a number are there
besides, that keep houses, or open shops, which have no other
trade to live by but the selling of tobacco.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Tobacco: fund-raiser</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In ordinary circumstances James, with his sublime intellectual
arrogance, would have been likely to try stiffer measures to check
smuggling. But that would have meant increased expenditure, which
he was in no position to undertake. He was chronically desperate
for funds; and the signs that tobacco smoking was on the increase
had suggested a way to secure them. In 1608 he had ordered a reduction
in the duty to a shilling a pound, selling the right to collect
it to one of his favourites, Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery.
Tobacco imports began to rise so rapidly that James found he had
sold himself short; in 1615 he revoked the deal (paying Montgomery
compensation) so that he could sell the right to collect the duty
for a sum more closely approximating to what it would be worth
to the patent holder&#151;&#163;16,000 a year, by 1620.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For the remainder of James's reign solvency was the essential
consideration. By farming out the duty, he in effect ensured that
it would be kept as high as it could go without causing the importer
to switch to smuggling. But the importers were not the only problem.
Distributors and retailers, it was found, were stretching their
stocks by adulterating the tobacco with ground up stalks and leaves
of other plants, and disguising the thinness of the flavour by
adding small quantities of spirits, and spices, to delude the
customer&#151;unlike Jonson's Abel Drugger:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He lets me have good tobacco, and he does not <BR>
Sophisticate it with sack, lees, or oil <BR>
Nor washes it in muscadel and grains <BR>
Nor buries it in gravel, underground <BR>
Wrapped up in greasy leather, or piss'd clouts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
'Sophistication' was frowned on by the authorities because it
lost them revenue. When half of what was sold was no longer pure
tobacco, this meant, in effect, that duty was being paid only
on one out of two pipefuls smoked. The practice became so notorious
that James had to intervene to authorise the inspection of stocks
held by retailers. As a result, before the end of his reign he
found himself setting himself up as guardian of the purity of
the drug which twenty years before he had tried to suppress. And
the irony only began there. The British colonists in Virginia,
who for some years had almost despaired of being able to survive,
experimented in 1611 with growing tobacco. The flavour happened
to appeal to the British smoker. It was very much in James's financial
interest that this taste should be encouraged because, as the
House of Commons was told in 1620, the amount of sterling leaving
the country in bullion to pay for tobacco had reached six figures.
Such vast (for that period) sums were better channelled into British
colonies&#151;helping them to become self-supporting, and eventually
to contribute to the Treasury&#151;than shipped to swell the treasure
chests of Portugal and Spain.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Without wishing it, therefore&#151;to the end of his life, James
continued to recall 'the dislike which we have always had of the
use of tobacco in general', and to share the uneasiness of the
Virginia Company about allowing the colony's economy to rely on
a 'deceivable weed', the fashion for which 'must soon vanish into
smoke'&#151;the British Government had embarked upon a course of
economic imperialism, based on two assumptions. One was that as
colonies were revenue-raising enterprises&#151;or at least, it was
hoped, financially self-supporting&#151;they must be allowed, and
if necessary encouraged, to produce any commodity which could
be sold profitably, even if it were not regarded as desirable
in itself. The other was that if the commodity were not regarded
as desirable in itself, its manufacture and sale could always
be excused by pointing out that people were going to buy it anyway,
so they might as well buy a British product. By this means, quality
would be ensured; and the profits would benefit the British taxpayer.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Tobacco: banned</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Hypocritical though James's attitude to tobacco became, at least
his policies were flexible enough to be administratively feasible.
In other parts of the Old World, the reaction of rulers to the
introduction of tobacco was generally the same, but they often
preferred to take what must have appeared to be the simplest course;
outright prohibition of the drug, with severe penalties for anybody
caught selling or taking it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Visiting Constantinople in 1611, George Sandys was told that on
the orders of the Sultan Amurath a man caught smoking had been
paraded through the streets mounted facing backwards on an ass,
with a pipe drawn through the cartilage of his nose. In Iran,
the Sultan's brother Shah Abbas imposed similar penalties; Sir
Thomas Herbert, arriving there with a British delegation in 1628,
found that Abbas had sentenced two merchants who had been caught
importing tobacco to have their noses and ears cut off; and their
consignment, forty camel loads, was burned&#151;its 'black vapour
gave the whole city infernal incense for two whole days and nights
together'. Both rulers, when such punishments proved insufficient
to check smuggling, introduced the death penalty. Jean Tavernier,
visiting Iran in the 1670s, was told that some rich merchants
found smoking in an inn had been punished, by Abbas's heir, as
befitted the nature of their crime, by having molten lead poured
down their throats. In India, the Great Mogul Jehangir Khan decreed
that anybody found smoking should have his lips slit. When ambassadors
from the Duke of Holstein arrived in Moscow in 1634, they saw
eight men and a woman publicly knouted for selling tobacco, and
the death penalty was decreed that year for habitual offenders.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fashion of tobacco-smoking for some reason took longer to
spread through Europe; but by the middle of the seventeenth century
several states had laws against it. In the Canton of Berne, where
the laws were related to the Ten Commandments, tobacco smoking
was put in the same category as adultery, punishable by fines,
the pillory, and imprisonment. And when this failed, the Canton
set up a special Tobacco Court, modelled on the Inquisition, with
payments for informers and harsh penalties for those who were
convicted.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
These laws and penalties, admittedly, were not based exclusively
on the objection to tobacco as a drug. The Tsar Michael claimed
also to be concerned about fire hazards; there were objections
to the fumes and the spitting which accompanied smoking; and there
was the fear that where men smoked together, they might be conspiring
together. But whatever the motive, and however savage the penalties,
the result was everywhere the same; prohibition was an utter failure.
Sandys noted that in spite of the warning given by the sight of
the convicted smoker paraded round Constantinople, people continued
to smoke clandestinely. Tavernier found men and women in Persia
'so addicted to tobacco that to take their tobacco from them,
is to take away their lives'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Everywhere, eventually, the ban had to be lifted, and tobacco
allowed in. Its consumption was in future to be restricted only
by a variety of Government expedients to make money out of it
by the levying of customs or excise duties&#151;or by a state monopoly
of the kind Richelieu introduced in France and which lasts to
this day; and by local by-laws, directed not against tobacco as
a drug, but against its unwelcome social side-effects.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Tobacco: tamed</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
How did it come about that tobacco, from being the drug most commonly
used to induce visions in the New World, should have soon been
domesticated in Europe; so that, as the flow of tributes from
essayists and poets reveal, it was welcomed as a mild mental stimulant,
stirring ideas, and as a mild tranquilliser, soothing away nervous
tensions? The tobacco smoked in Europe may not have been as strong
as that used by the Indians, and it was probably not taken in
such powerful doses; but that is not sufficient to account for
the difference. The most likely explanation is that the European
mind had been carried too far from its moorings in instinct for
tobacco to be capable of producing the trance state; and there
was no shamanist tradition which could have been taken up to exploit
tobacco in the way the medicine man was accustomed to do.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
When tobacco smokers were seen to be physically no worse off for
their indulgence&#151;their semen did not dry up, and many of them
lived on into old age&#151;suspicions died; and during the Great
Plague, tobacco attained respectability even among those who,
like Samuel Pepys, had feared it as a dangerous drug. In the spring
of 1665 he saw how a cat could be killed by 'the oil of tobacco';
but a month later the sight of doors marked with a red cross and
the inscription 'Lord Have Mercy Upon Us' prompted him to resort
to it: 'I was forced to buy some roll-tobacco to smell and to
chew, which took away the apprehension.' And with a growing sense
of Britain's maritime destiny, the tobacco trade attained full
respectability, coming to be regarded not simply as a commercial,
but as a national, asset. When an increase in the tobacco duty
was mooted in 1685, a critic of the project was quick to point
out that in addition to bringing in so much revenue, and providing
the colonists with the wherewithal to buy vast quantities of English
manufactures, 'the tobacco trade employed nearly two hundred ships,
the breeding ground of many mariners'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In America, too, tobacco-smoking among the colonists followed
the pattern newly established in Europe. Even the Indians began
to use it more for ritual and symbolic purposes&#151;the 'pipe of
peace'. In some States where tobacco was not grown attempts were
made to curb consumption: Massachusetts banned smoking in company
(even among consenting adults) in 1632, and three years later
tried to stop its sale by retailers. But such regulations proved
unenforceable, and tobacco developed into an industry second only
in importance to alcoholic liquor. The effects on the health of
the community cannot now be estimated; but some idea of the social
and economic significance of the development was provided by Joseph
C. Robert in <I>The Story of Tobacco in America,</I> published
in 1949. Tobacco not merely saved the Virginia settlement; it
<BLOCKQUOTE>
created the pattern of the Southern plantation; encouraged the
introduction of Negro slavery, then softened the institution;
begot an immortal group of colonial leaders; strained the bonds
between mother country and Chesapeake colonies; burdened the diplomacy
of the post-Revolutionary period; promoted the Louisiana purchase;
and, after the Civil War, helped to create the New South . . .
Dispute and violence are milestones along this tobacco road; Culpeper's
Rebellion marked the seventeenth century, the Black Patch war
the twentieth. Colonial Virginians used tobacco as money; in the
confusion following the Second World War the American cigarette
was currency 'from Paris to Peking'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Tea: coffee</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Tobacco was the only drug from the Americas which caught on in
the Old World; but in the middle of the seventeenth century two
other drugs which had not been known before in Europe began to
appear from the East: tea&#151;which Pepys recorded as a novelty
in 1661&#151;and coffee. Both were originally introduced, as tobacco
had been, for medicinal purposes&#151;the apothecary telling Mrs.
Pepys it was 'good for her cold and defluxions'. Both, like tobacco,
aroused authority's suspicion when it was found they were being
taken for pleasure.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Coffee came from the Middle East, where its appearance had so
alarmed the authorities in Mecca and Cairo that they had tried
to prohibit its sale, with regulations that all stocks found should
be burned, and all people found drinking it punished. As with
Indian hemp, earlier, the accusation was that coffee was an intoxicant&#151;a
reputation which Sir Anthony Shirley, one of three brothers with
a reputation as travellers in far-away lands, confirmed after
he had tasted it in Aleppo in 1598. So when it was introduced
into Europe, a number of rulers reacted to it as their forbears
had reacted a century before to tobacco, decreeing fines, imprisonment
and corporal punishment for those involved in its distribution
or consumption. But the tendency was to regard it as a danger
chiefly to the lower orders; the aristocracy reserved the right
to drink coffee. Inevitably such qualified prohibition proved
unworkable; and rulers soon switched to the method King James
had pioneered, taxing it instead.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Tea did not attract the same hostility because, except in Britain,
it continued for two centuries to be sold by druggists, and bought
by the public, chiefly as a remedy for internal disorders (it
was to surprise the town of Angouleme when Balzac's Mme Bargeton
gave a tea party, as tea was still sold there in chemists' shops
for indigestion&#151;for which purpose the cure of Yonville was to
recommend it to Madame Bovary). In Britain, where it became popular
as a pick-me-up, it provoked some virulent attacks from satirists
and from politicians; Henry Savile told Mr. Secretary Coventry
in 1678 that it was a base, unworthy and filthy substitute for
wine. But by then it was too late. One of Charles II's first acts
at his restoration had been to impose a duty on tea; and it had
proved to be one of his most profitable fiscal expedients. When
the traveller and philanthropist Jonas Hanway tried to launch
a campaign against it a century later, he had against him not
only Dr. Johnson&#151;'a hardened and shameless tea drinker' as he
described himself, 'who with tea amuses the evening, with tea
solaces the midnight, and with tea welcomes the morning'&#151;but
also almost the entire population of Britain, poor and rich alike,
who by this time were consuming it in such quantities that it
had become one of the State's chief sources of revenue.

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THE FACT THAT SO SMALL A NUMBER OF PLANT DRUGS WERE KNOWN in the
Old World, compared to the new, has naturally led to speculation:
why ? The reason, the American anthropologist Professor Weston
La Barre has suggested, is simple; that shamanism had survived
in the Americas, and it was 'so to speak, culturally programmed
for an interest in hallucinogens and other psychotropic drugs'.
And not only for an interest in them: the medicine man, by training
as well as by instinct, knew how to exploit drugs. The Europeans,
taught as they were to regard divination as the work of the devil,
were culturally programmed to regard vision-inducing plant drugs
as his instrument. In Europe, this was not a problem; though witches
might use them, they were not ordinarily encountered in everyday
life, and few people would have thought of experimenting with
them. But the drugs found in use in the New World appeared to
be a direct threat to Church and State&#151;not then differentiated;
and the tendency, wherever shamanist drug-practices were found,
was to try to suppress them.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Coca</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Drugs came under attack even when they were widely used for secular
purposes, as medicines, or to increase endurance&#151;as in the case
of coca, in Peru. The Inca religion had retained an element of
shamanism, and coca was one of the drugs used by the diviner-priests
to help themselves into a trance; or, where that art had been
lost, the diviner burned the leaves so that he could 'see' coming
events in the curling smoke. Infusions of coca were taken at festivals;
corpses were buried with coca, to help them over the Inca equivalent
of the Styx; there was a 'Coca Mama'&#151;the equivalent of the Corn
Mother of other cults; and coca was included in sacrifices, on
the principle that whatever was most valued should be given up
to the gods. Appalled at these manifestations of idolatry, missionaries
and priests were soon denouncing coca. It was formally condemned
at the first Ecclesiastical Council held in Lima in 1551, and
again in 1567 as connected with the work of idolatry and sorcery,
'strengthening the wicked in their delusions, and asserted by
every competent judge to possess no true virtues; but, on the
contrary, to cause the deaths of innumerable Indians, while it
ruins the health of the few who survive.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The civil authorities had their own reasons for mistrusting coca.
Anything so closely linked with Inca tradition was likely to become
identified with it, in the minds of those who cherished the hope
of overthrowing Spanish rule. There was also a more practical
reason for suppressing the use of the drug. It was taken by workers
throughout the day, pouched in the cheek, and replenished when
necessary. The need for replenishment did not suit employers,
who felt it was an unnecessary expense. By a simple device, they
had ensured that labour in Peru would be both readily available
and cheap; a tax had been imposed on every Indian of working age,
which meant that the male population had to find work, in order
to be able to pay it. The tax was nicely judged to leave the worker
with only nominal wages&#151;a penny a day&#151;and his keep. As part
of his keep, however, he expected a ration of coca. Why, employers
naturally asked themselves, should they have to provide him not
only with food and water but with a luxury&#151;worse, a drug condemned
by the Church?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Prohibition was demanded, and in ordinary circumstances, could
have been expected to follow. But those Spaniards who had established
themselves as the owners of the coca plantations on the slopes
of the Andes had quickly made their fortunes. From 1548 to 1551,
the Spanish chronicler Cieza de Leon recalled, 'there was not
a root, nor anything gathered from a tree, except spice, which
was in such estimation', and they grew rich on the proceeds. They
were not inclined to let the source of their wealth be wrested
from them; and their profits gave them the means to campaign in
Lima and in Madrid to save their business from extinction. Prohibition,
they claimed, would be impracticable. The coca plantations might
be ploughed up, but this would not stop the plant from being grown
illicitly. And what evidence was there that coca was bad for the
Indians? On the contrary, not merely did it help them to work
long hours; it provided them with the necessary stimulus to do
the work&#151;coca being the only currency available to them.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
These were arguments which could be expected to make some impression
on the Government, in its capacity as an employer. More surprisingly,
they also made an impression on the Church. A Spanish priest,
Blas Valera, who worked in Peru in the early years of the seventeenth
century&#151;and who thought highly of coca, particularly as a medicine&#151;described
how the change of heart came about. Some people, he recalled,
had been hostile, 'moved only by the fact that in former times
the heathen offered coca to their idols, as some wizards and diviners
still do'. Because of this, they had argued that coca should be
suppressed. If the Incas had offered coca and nothing else in
their sacrifices, this might have been reasonable. But they had
also sacrificed cattle; was beef therefore to be banned ? On reflection,
it had been decided that it would be best not to ban coca, but
instead, to instruct the natives how to avail themselves of God's
gifts in a Christian fashion. This resolution, Valera noted, had
not been without its benefits to the Church; 'the income of the
bishop, canons and other priests of the Catholic Church of Cuzco
is derived from the tithe on the coca leaf'. 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So the Indians, though they were punished if they were caught
using coca in religious observances, were allowed to take it while
working, in order that they might be able to put in still longer
hours. The consequences were to be summarised four centuries later
by John Hemming, in <I>The Conquest of the Incas:</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Coca plantations lay at the edge of humid forests, thousands of
feet below the natural habitat of the Andean Indians. This did
not deter Spanish planters and merchants who made huge profits
from the coca trade. They forced highland natives to leave their
<I>encomiendas</I> and work in the hot plantations. The change
of climate was devastating to Indians with lungs enlarged by evolution
to breathe thin air. Antonio de Zuniga wrote to the King: 'Every
year among the natives who go to this plant a great number of
Your Majesty's vassals perish.' There were also ugly diseases
in the plantations. A tiny mosquito-like dipterous insect that
lives between 2,500 and 9,500 feet in the Andean foothills carries
the destructive 'verruga' or wart disease, in which victims die
of eruptive nodules and severe anemia. Coca workers also caught
the dreaded 'mal de los Andes' or <I>uta,</I> which destroys the
nose, lips and throat and causes a painful death. Bartolome de
Vega described the native hospital of Cuzco 'where there are normally
two hundred Indians with their noses eaten away by the cancer'.
Those who escaped the diseases returned to their mountain villages
debilitated from the heat and undernourishment; they were easily
recognisable, pale, weak and listless. Contemporary authorities
estimated that between a third and half of the annual quota of
coca-workers died as a result of their five-month service.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Decrees from Lima, and even from King Philip in Madrid, tried
to regulate working hours and conditions. The frequency with which
they had to be repeated&#151;one Viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, issued
over twenty ordinances designed to protect the Indians&#151;suggests
that they were not obeyed; not, at least, until wastage reduced
the supply of labour to the point when the employers in their
own self-interest had to begin to treat their workers with more
consideration, or risk having too few of them to harvest the coca
crop.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This pattern was to be repeated in colonised territories. Missionaries
disliked shamanism and the drugs associated with it because they
were pagan; the colonial authorities, because they might be a
focus for unrest, and for law-breaking. But where a plant drug
could be exploited commercially, farmers, entrepreneurs and traders
would find reasons for permitting, and encouraging, its consumption.
They would use their influence to persuade the colonial authorities
that it was essential to the colony's economy; and&#151;particularly
if they could extract revenue out of the drug&#151;the colonial authorities
would usually allow themselves to be persuaded.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Peyotl</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Where commercial considerations were unimportant, either because
the drug was taken exclusively in shamanist rites, or because
it could not be cultivated, the Church was more likely to have
its way: as it did with the peyotl cactus. As late as the middle
of the seventeenth century, when Francisco Hernandez published
his pioneering work on the flora and fauna of Mexico, he was still
careful to intimate his disapproval of the way certain of the
plants he described were used. By eating peyote he noted, the
Indians 'can foresee and predict anything; for instance, whether
enemies are going to attack them the following day? Whether they
will continue in favourable circumstances? Who has stolen household
goods? And other things of this sort.' Far from being impressed,
when Hernandez described what peyotl looked like he observed that
it 'scarcely issues forth, as if it did not wish to harm those
who discover it and eat it'. Similarly with ololiuqui&#151; the 'morning
glory'; when the priests wished to commune with their gods, and
to receive messages from them, they ate it to induce a delirium,
in which 'a thousand visions and satanic hallucinations appeared
to them'. A catechism used in Mexico in that period reveals the
priests' attitude. 'Art thou a soothsayer?' each convert would
be asked.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dost thou foretell events by reading signs, or interpreting dreams,
or by water, making circles and figures on the surface? Dost thou
suck the blood of others, or dost thou wander about at night,
calling upon the demon to help thee ? Hast thou drunk peyote or
hast thou given it to others to drink, in order to find out secrets
or to discover where stolen or lost articles were ?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In 1620, peyotl was formally denounced:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We, the Inquisitors against heretical perversity and apostasy,
by virtue of apostolic authority declare, inasmuch as the herb
or root called peyotl has been introduced into these provinces
for the purposes of detecting thefts, of divining other happenings,
and of foretelling future events, it is an act of superstition,
to be condemned as opposed to the purity and integrity of our
holy Catholic faith. The fantasies suggest intervention of the
devil, the real authority of this vice.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The civil authorities shared the Inquisition's views. They, too&#151;according
to the chronicler Fr Joseph de Acosta&#151;were impressed by the
evidence that under the influence of peyotl shamans were able
'to report mutinies, battles, revolts and death occurring 200
or 300 leagues distant, on the very day they took place, or the
day after'. That divination could provide such a rapid communication
service was an excellent reason for banning consumption of the
drug. With characteristic cunning, however, the devil had provided
alternatives; as well as ololiuqui, there were tobacco, datura
and certain types of mushroom. All that Church and State could
do was ban the drug cult ceremonies; and when the risk of holding
them openly became too great, the cults continued underground.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Alcohol: Siberia</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Suppression was not the only weapon with which colonists could
attack indigenous drug cults. They brought their own substitute
drug with them: alcohol. Along with beer and wine, they introduced
spirits: brandy, whiskey, gin and rum. Traders found it convenient
to use them to lubricate negotiations, buying and selling; and
then, as merchandise in their own right.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The results were often depressing. When the Russians began the
conquest of Siberia at the end of the sixteenth century, they
determined to put down shamanism; and to that end they banned
the consumption of the fly agaric&#151;a futile gesture; the naturalist
Nikolai Sljunin observed in 1900 that the law was 'completely
ignored'. The introduction of vodka by traders proved a more effective
weapon. Vodka was cheap&#151;and readily available, unlike mushrooms,
all the year round. But not merely did it fail to provide the
shaman with visions; it actually blocked them&#151; coming to be
regarded, according to Sljunin, as an antidote to the mushroom's
effects. The evidence, in fact, suggests that it was not drugs
which made Siberian shamanism decadent, as Mircea Eliade claimed;
it was one particular drug, alcohol, which destroyed the shaman's
ability to induce a trance, and tempted him to fake it, and delude
the company with conjuring tricks. 
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Alcohol: Tahiti</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Traditionally, the saddest story of the effects of alcohol concerns
Tahiti. When the island was discovered in the 1760s, the crews
who had been there returned with glowing accounts of a paradise,
where the people lived free from worldly cares, doing little work
because most of their wants were provided for by nature; enjoying
sexual relations uninhibitedly because they were untroubled by
the taboos or the guilt which Christianity had attached to them;
and in general appearing to lead a wonderfully contented existence.
Their only mild intoxicant came from a root which, when ground
up, could be made into the drink kava; and was taken only on ceremonial
occasions. Though Captain Cook's crew were told that it could
make men drunk, they never saw this happen. When first offered
alcoholic drinks, their Tahitian guests took them in all innocence,
became drunk, and&#151;after experiencing hangovers&#151;took care not
to get drunk again, 'shunning a repetition of it', Joseph Banks
observed in his account of the visit, 'instead of greedily desiring
it as most Indians are said to do'. It was as if the islanders,
close to nature as they were, had no need of artificial intoxication;
they lived in the happy state which Europeans tried in vain to
reach with the help of alcohol.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Before long, however, as more ships began to call, some Tahitians
began to develop a taste for alcohol; particularly members of
the ruling families, who were recipients of much of the hospitality.
The missionaries, who by this time were establishing themselves,
abetted the process. On arrival, they had determined to compel
the Tahitians to cover their nakedness, and to cease their uninhibited
sexual play. They were also anxious to put an end to Tahitian
religious rites&#151;among them, the ceremonial drinking of kava&#151;because
they were pagan. To implement these reforms, however, they had
to win the Paramount Chief's support. The heir, Pomare II, intimated
that he was willing to back the missionaries, so long as they
did not interfere with his personal pleasures. Arriving in 1802
on his voyage round the world John Turnbull found the royal family
demoralised by excess, and Pomare an alcoholic and a public menace.
Under the influence of drink, Turnbull feared, he would not scruple
to kill anybody who annoyed him.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What possible benefit&#151;Diderot had asked&#151;could Christians with
their hypocrisy, guilt and ambition, bring to the South Sea islanders?
They would arrive, he warned, 'with crucifix in one hand and dagger
in the other, to cut your throats or force you to accept their
customs and opinions'. Gin bottle in the other, would have been
nearer the mark; but Diderot's warning&#151;'one day under their
rule you will be almost as unhappy as they are'&#151;was soon shown
to be justified. Tahitians lost their childlike innocence, which
made even their pilfering endearing; they had to wear 'Mother
Hubbards'; they had to work; they were no longer happy; and they
drank. When William Ellis arrived on Tahiti as a missionary in
1817, he found Turnbull's fears had been justified. Under Pomare,
intemperance prevailed 'to an awful and unprecedented degree'.
On impulse, men would get together to erect a still, and then
over a period of days consume its product, 'sinking into a state
of indescribable wretchedness, and often practising the most ferocious
barbarities'. While the liquor lasted they were more like demons
than human beings; and after it was finished,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
sometimes in a deserted still-house might be seen fragments of
the rude boiler, and the other appendages of the still, scattered
in confusion on the ground; and among them, the dead and mangled
bodies of those who had been murdered with axes or billets of
wood in the quarrels that had terminated their debauch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As soon as they had established their authority, the missionaries
tried to stop the islanders from drinking spirits; but with so
many ships coming in, the task was hopeless. Among the arrivals
was the <I>Beagle,</I> in 1835. When Darwin offered the Tahitian
guides a drink they 'put their fingers before their mouths and
uttered the word &quot;missionary&quot; '&#151;but they did not refuse.
'The natives having nothing at all to do', Gauguin reported half
a century later, 'think of one thing only: drinking.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Was alcohol the cause of the destruction of Tahiti's island paradise,
or were there more insidious reasons? Other Pacific islands were
given much the same introduction to colonialism and Christianity;
not all of them were so marked by it. Pondering this on his tour
of the Pacific, early in the 1890s, Robert Louis Stevenson came
to the conclusion that it was unwise to put the blame for what
had happened there either on gin or on 'Tartuffe insisting on
unhygienic clothes'. No single cause, he felt, was responsible
for decay, where it was to be found. What was decisive was the
amount of dislocation involved in the islanders' way of life:
'where there have been fewest changes, important or unimportant,
salutary or hurtful, there the race survives. Where there have
been most, important or unimportant, salutary or hurtful, there
it perishes.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
J. W. Anderson, who had travelled around among the Pacific islands
in the 1870s, was of the same opinion. He cited the stability
of Fiji as an example. There, he found, yangona (as kava was known)
was still taken in an elaborate ritual. First, young men and women
with good teeth were employed to chew the root, until it was of
the right consistency to be put in a bowl of water and its juices
squeezed out. The resulting liquid appeared 'greenish-grey and
muddy-looking'; it tasted to him like 'a mixture of rhubarb, magnesia
and soapsuds'; and it left those who drank it rather unsteady
on their feet. So the missionaries wanted to ban the ceremony&#151;as
did some employers, who disapproved of the time it wasted; islanders
would drop whatever they were doing to attend. But it had not
been banned; rightly, Anderson felt. The chewing process might
appear to be disgusting (and to spread unmentionable diseases);
the kava itself might be debilitating, to anybody who took it
to excess. But in moderation it did no harm. The islanders, in
fact, regarded it as a purifier of the blood. And even those who
took so much of it that they became intoxicated displayed 'neither
unseemly behaviour nor incoherency of speech', but rather showed
'an inclination to remain mute in a mood of happy dreaminess'.
In the circumstances, Anderson hoped, kava drinking would continue,
'for the chances are that by and by, its substitute will be <I>&quot;yangona
papalangi&quot;</I> that is, white man's grog; and we are too
well aware what havoc the fire water plays among savages who once
take a liking to it'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Alcohol: America</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As Anderson's reference showed, alcohol had become notorious for
its effects on primitive communities; particularly in North America,
where distilled liquors had been unknown before the arrival of
the colonists from Europe. As in the Pacific, it was the traders
who introduced the American Indians to 'fire water'; and the Indians,
unaccustomed to intoxication (tobacco was ordinarily used for
that purpose by the shaman, but not by members of the tribe, except
under his guidance) developed a craving for it. Towards the end
of the seventeenth century missionaries were beginning to report
the dire consequences, 'Lewdness, adulteries, incest, and several
other crimes which decency keeps me from naming'&#151;Father Chrestien
Le Clerq wrote of a tribe on the Gulf of St. Lawrence&#151;'are the
usual disorders which are committed through the trade in brandy,
of which some traders make use in order to abuse the Indian women,
who yield themselves readily during their drunkenness to all kinds
of indecency.' The places where the Indians drank brandy, another
missionary wrote in 1705, were 'an image of hell. Fire flies in
all directions, blows with hatchets and knives make the blood
flow on all sides. They commit a thousand abominations&#151;the mother
with her sons, the father with his daughters, and brothers with
their sisters. They roll about on the cinders and coals, and in
blood.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was stories such as these to which Anderson (and Banks, a century
earlier) were referring; the assumption then being that alcohol
had been the really destructive influence. But this view has recently
been challenged by Craig MacAndrew and Robert Edgerton in their
<I>Drunken Comportment: a social explanation,</I> published in
1969. They were able to show that the American Indians, like the
Tahitians, when they first tried spirits were attracted by the
novelty of the experience&#151;'a merry-go of the brain', as one
of them described it&#151;but for a while were not adversely affected.
So long as their experience was 'untutored by expectations to
the contrary'&#151;MacAndrew and Edgerton claimed&#151;'the result was
neither the development of an all-consuming craving nor an epic
of drunken mayhem and debauchery'. That epic only came when their
way of life had been destroyed by the settlers, and their culture
debased&#151;another instance of the destructive power of change
which Stevenson had observed.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But there was more to it, MacAndrew and Edgerton decided, than
simple change. The consumption of spirits brought out a trait
which had already existed in their tribal societies: cruelty.
The Red Indians had been notoriously cruel to captured foes, practising
tortures on them of the most savage but sophisticated kind. They
now learned from the white traders that a man should not be held
responsible for what he did under the influence of drink. Alcohol
therefore provided them both with the stimulus and the excuse
to repeat the kind of behaviour they had formerly indulged in,
with tradition's sanction, when they captured a member of an enemy
tribe.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was not the drug, therefore, that was responsible for the way
people behaved under its influence. The drug was simply the release
mechanism, the behaviour being largely conditioned by expectations.
Where the expectations from an established drug were of gentle
intoxication, as with kava, it was in the colonists' self-interest
to encourage it, and discourage the sale of spirits; and where
this became settled policy, as on Fiji, the results appeared satisfactory&#151;as
Basil Thomson, who spent many years in Fiji around the turn of
the century, recalled in his memoirs. Although the missionaries
had continued to wage their campaign against yangona with 'a fiery
zeal', the civil authorities had contented themselves with regulations
chiefly designed to try to restrict its use to precisely the ceremonial
occasions that the missionaries most deplored. As a magistrate,
Thomson had to enforce this policy; and he came to the conclusion
it was justified, because the vice of kava drinking 'if it isa vice at all, cannot 
reasonably be condemned for bringing in
its train any of these social evils that are due to alcohol'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But colonial authorities were sometimes less far-sighted; and
they could not, as a rule, stop the introduction of alcohol. Nor
was it easy for them to prevent the erosion of traditional cultures
and beliefs. Shamanism had been based on certain assumptions which
Christianity and, later, the even more powerful force of rationalism
challenged. Inexorably, the shaman's authority was eroded. He
might still get his visions from tobacco, or other drugs. But
they were of little comfort to the tribe if they predicted, correctly,
that it was futile to oppose the superior power wielded by the
white man&#151;and disastrous when they incorrectly roused expectations,
as occasionally they did, that the white man was going to be destroyed
by a whirlwind, or some other form of divine retribution. When
Sitting Bull smoked, and gave a hundred pieces of his flesh, before
dancing the Sun Dance, his aim was to receive a vision; and he
had one, which revealed that white soldiers were coming, and that
the Sioux would slaughter them. The Sioux duly did, when Custer
and his force appeared. But the vision had not revealed what was
to follow: the massacre of the Indians at Wounded Knee, which
banished their last hope of successful resistance.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In such circumstances, vision-inducing drugs were a hazard; and
shamanist observances came to rely more upon ritual&#151;or on alcohol.
Where alcohol was involved, they often came to resemble saturnalia,
of the kind Ruth Underhill described in her study of the religion
of the Papago Indians. At the annual rainmaking ceremony the shaman
was still employed, but only as a subordinate. The most important
role was that of the brewer, who made the fermented liquor from
cactus fruit; the shaman being required simply to protect the
brew from harmful influences. If he failed, he rather than the
brewer would suffer for it. The principle which had attached itself
to the ceremony was that 'the saturation of the body with liquor
typifies and produces the saturation of the earth with rain';
the aim was to get everybody concerned 'full', without any expectation
of visions, let alone of clairvoyance. Neophytes, admittedly,
were encouraged to 'dream' songs which could be added to the tribal
repertoire: but to judge by the samples Underhill obtained suitability
was not equated with any great originality of insight.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Come and sing! <BR>
Come and sing! <BR>
Sing for the evening! <BR>
The sun stands there. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
And in the traditional songs and speeches, the emphasis was on
the pleasures of inebriation for its own sake. To each recipient
of the brew, the cup-bearer would say
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Drink, friend ! Get beautifully drunk <BR>
Hither bring the wind and the clouds.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Nor did the use of the term 'beautifully' mean that the Papagos
were under any illusions as to the effects of the liquor&#151;as
one of the songs sung during the progress of the ceremony indicated:

<H3>Gin</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
IT WAS NOT, THEN, ALCOHOL AS SUCH WHICH WAS THE DESTRUCTIVE influence,
but the fact that a potent variety&#151;spirits&#151;was introduced
to communities suffering from social dislocation after the loss
of their old stability. And Britain, in the early seventeenth
century, was taught the same lesson by gin.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Until 'Geneva', as it was originally known, began to become popular,
distilled liquors had not been drunk in Europe on any substantial
scale&#151;except among the rich, who enjoyed their brandy. But in
the seventeenth century Geneva drinking spread to Holland, and
among those who acquired a taste for it was William of Orange.
Chronically in need of funds to finance his campaigns against
the French, he had become aware of the value of drugs as a source
of revenue; part of the price he demanded for consenting to oust
James II was that he should be awarded the revenue from the tobacco
duties; and when he and Mary ascended the throne, one of his first
actions was to break the London Distillers' Guild monopoly, and
allow anybody to manufacture spirits on payment of a duty. The
conflict with France, checking the import of brandies, provided
a further inducement to British distillers; and production began
rapidly to increase.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
That spirits could have the attributes of a drug was remarked
upon by the economist Charles D'Avenant in 1695. Brandy-drinking,
he wrote, was becoming a growing vice among the common people
(he was presumably using brandy as a synonym for spirits, as few
of the common people could have afforded cognac), 'and may in
time prevail as much as opium with the Turks, to which many attribute
the scarcity of people in the East'&#151;opium having won the reputation
of diminishing sexual appetite, and eventually of weakening sexual
performance. So far as Government and Parliament were concerned,
though, the new taste for spirits was a godsend. 'It pays rent
for our land, employs our people', Daniel Defoe noted in his <I>Review</I>
in 1713; distilling had become 'one of the most essential things
to support the landed interest' (which happened to be supporting
him, at the time; he was working as an undercover agent for the
Government). It should consequently, he urged, be 'specially preserved,
and tenderly used'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Distilling was tenderly used&#151;more tenderly even than brewing.
Gin cost around 18p a gallon to manufacture, so it could be sold
at a price which would enable anybody who wished to get drunk
to do so for less than it would cost to get drunk on beer. It
began to replace beer as the tipple of the poor, at least in London;
and the results alarmed the London magistrates. A committee they
appointed to investigate reported in 1726 that gin was sold in
one house in ten in some London parishes (one house in five, in
one parish); that as a result of its availability and cheapness,
the poor were giving themselves over to vice and debauchery; and
that even in the workhouses, where the sodden creatures ended
their days, gin was smuggled in. The inmates were prepared to
suffer any punishment 'rather than live without it, though they
cannot avoid seeing its fatal effects by the death of those among
them who had drunk most freely of it'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fate of the poor in workhouses was of little concern to Members
of Parliament. What was disturbing to them about the report was
the suggestion that soldiers and, worse, servants were being daily
suborned by gin; it was scarcely possible for them to go anywhere
'without being drawn in either by those who sell it or by their
acquaintances, whom they meet with in the street, who generally
begin by inviting them to a dram'. M.P.s, though, shared a landed
interest. Distilling from grain pushed up their income. The Prime
Minister, Robert Walpole, did not want to lose his majority; nor
did he care to sacrifice the revenue from the duty paid by the
distillers. Even when increasingly horrifying reports drove him
in 1729 to put a curb on the sale of gin, the outcry from the
farmers, coupled with the fact that enforcement proved impossible,
soon led to its being withdrawn.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The London magistrates&#151;responsible for the city's health, as
well as for law and order&#151;began again to warn that the situation
was deteriorating; and in a further report in 1736 they presented
a picture of the degeneration of the poor too ugly to be ignored.
Spirits were clearly responsible. The workers were being encouraged
to drink the whole week 'upon score', and 'too often without minding
how fast the score runs against them, whereby at the week's end
they find themselves without any surplusage to carry home to their
families, which must of course starve, or be thrown on the parish'.
Their wretched wives were also becoming gin drinkers 'to a degree
hardly possible to be conceived. Unhappy mothers habituate themselves
to these distilled liquors, whose children are born weak and sickly,
and often look shrivel'd and old as though they had numbered many
years. Others again daily give it to their children.'
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Gin: prohibition</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The worry was not that gin made men and women drunk. Drunkenness,
as distinct from what people might do when they were in that condition,
was not in this period regarded as a heinous offense: 'an honest
drunken fellow', Defoe had noted in 1702, 'is a character in man's
praise'. If the Londoner had got roaring drunk on gin the way
the Irish and the Scots were reputed to get drunk on whiskey&#151;because
they liked to get drunk on whiskey, from time to time&#151;he would
have caused the magistrates little concern. But he was using gin
as a quick, cheap way of escape&#151;not as an intoxicant, but as
a narcotic. This was, in fact, the prototype of future drug scares,
presenting many of the features which were to become so familiar;
among them, the first reported parliamentary debate on the issue
of prohibition.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Appalled by the evidence, Sir John Jekyll proposed in the Commons
that a duty of 20 shillings a gallon should be put on spirits
sold by retail. The motion was opposed by Sir William Pulteney.
This was not, Pulteney emphasised, because he had anything to
say in favour of the consumption of spirits, which had become
excessive and mischievous, sapping the people's health and morals.
His criticism was that the measure amounted to prohibition.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Prohibition, Pulteney explained, was doubly unjust; in principle,
because it struck at spirits, rather than at their misuse (nobody
had argued that spirits consumed in moderation did harm, so to
stop them being sold for consumption in moderation was 'carrying
the remedy much farther than the disease'); and in practice, because
it was the Government itself which had encouraged men to sink
capital in distilleries and in shops&#151;'it is a dangerous, it
is, Sir, a terrible thing to reduce many thousands of families
at once to a state of despair'. But the essential objection to
prohibition was that it did not work&#151;as the earlier experience
of the Walpole government had shown. The spirits which had previously
been available were simply replaced by an illicit liquor 'which,
I believe in derision of the Act, they called &quot;Parliament
Brandy&quot;'. If legal channels dried up, spirits would inevitably
begin to flow in through other, illegal channels.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Parliamentary debates were not at the time legally reported and
only the outline of the prohibitionists' reply to Pulteney survives,
but it indicates why they were not prepared to listen to his warning.
He had concluded by saying that in so far as the measure did not
amount to total prohibition&#151;spirits could still be bought by
the hogshead&#151;this too was unjust, because it would allow the
rich to buy and drink as much as they liked, when they liked,
while stopping the poor from buying a glass of gin over the counter.
This, Jekyll's supporters made clear, was precisely their aim.
As one of them put it, the justification for the Bill was that
it would keep spirits out of the reach of 'persons of inferior
rank', who were 'the only sort of people apt to make a custom
of getting drunk with such liquor'. Nor was it possible to cater
for those who would, if allowed to drink, drink in moderation.
Where spirits were available in the shops, 'few would keep themselves
within any bounds, because a small quantity deprived them of their
reason, and the companions they usually met with at such places
encouraged them to drink to excess'. The only concession the supporters
of the measure were prepared to make was that spirits should still
be available when prescribed by a physician, in cases of illness.
Otherwise, if the law was found to amount in practice to prohibition
so far as the poor were concerned, so much the better.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Against Walpole's advice&#151;he was mainly concerned with the loss
of revenue, but he agreed with Pulteney that prohibition would
not work&#151;the measure was passed. The consequences were to be
described by Walpole's biographer, Coxe. The people, he recalled,
reacted
<BLOCKQUOTE>
in the usual mode of riot and violence. Numerous desperadoes availed
themselves of the popular discontents, and continued the clandestine
sale of gin in defiance of every restriction. The demand of penalties,
which the offenders were unable to pay, filled the prisons, and
removing every restraint, plunged them into courses more audaciously
criminal. It was found that a duty and penalty so severe as to
amount to an implied prohibition, were as little calculated to
benefit the public morality, as the public revenue.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Act failed partly because the Government's enforcement officers,
the excisemen, were universally hated. When they were active,
they were in danger of their lives; but frequently they were inactive,
because they preferred to come to terms with the lawbreakers.
Where demand was strong enough, as Walpole had warned after his
earlier experience, the smuggler could afford 'to blind the officer
with a large bribe', especially as he knew that once a bribe had
been accepted, the officer 'is, and must be, his slave for ever'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The means which were adopted to enforce the Act also had unfortunate
consequences. To catch those who manufactured, sold, or purchased
illicit spirits, a reward of &#163;5 had been offered for information
leading to a conviction. The preliminary results were gratifying:
over four thousand such convictions were secured, and payments
made for them, in the first two years. By that time, though, it
was becoming apparent that an unascertainable but substantial
proportion of the convictions had been obtained by perjury, to
get the &#163;5 which, to an unskilled labourer, represented almost
three months' wages. And many other people who had been detected
consuming drink purchased illicitly had paid the standard blackmail
fee of &#163;10 to avoid prosecution.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Gin: licensing</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
After Walpole's fall, his successors decided to repeal the Act.
As Lord Bathurst [as reported from memory by Samuel Johnson, then
working for the <I>Gentleman's Magazine</I>] explained to the
House of Lords in 1743, perjuries had become so common and flagrant,
'that the people thought all informations malicious; or at least,
thinking themselves oppressed by the law, they looked upon every
man that promoted its execution, as their enemy'. Intimidation
and violence&#151;some informers had been murdered in the streets&#151;had
made it impossible to bring offenders to court, 'so that the law,
however just might be the intention with which it was enacted,
or however seasonable the methods prescribed by it, has been now
for some years totally disused'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Experience, therefore, had shown that it was impossible to prevent
the retailing of spirits. 'What then'&#151;Bathurst asked the House&#151;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
are we to do? Does not common sense point out the most proper
method, which is to allow their being publicly retailed but to
lay such a duty upon the distillery and upon licenses as without
amounting to a prohibition will make them come so dear to the
consumer that the poor will not be able to launch out into an
excessive use of them?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The expedient was not new; James I had resorted to it with tobacco,
when prohibition failed. And the motive on this occasion appeared
to Opposition peers to be the same: the Treasury's need for more
revenue, to pay for Britain's contribution to the war on the Continent.
This was deplorable, Lord Chesterfield thought. If spirit-drinking
were a vice, it ought to be punished as such.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Would you lay a tax upon a breach of the Ten Commandments ? Would
not such a tax be wicked and scandalous because it would imply
an indulgence to those who would pay the tax ? No reasonable man
would suppose you intend to discourage, much less prohibit, this
vice, by giving every man that pleases an indulgence to break
out himself, or to promote it in others upon condition of his
paying a small tax annually.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Lord Hervey was equally scathing. All that was wrong with the
law, he insisted, was that it had not been enforced. Now, instead,
they were to have a duty whose proceeds were being mortgaged to
pay for the war. In other words, they were establishing the worst
sort of drunkenness to pay for an expense which in his opinion
was both unnecessary and ridiculous, 'like a tradesman mortgaging
the prostitution of his wife or daughter, for the sake of raising
money to supply his luxury or extravagance'. And he went on to
inveigh against drunkenness, 'of all vices the most abominable'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Drunkenness happened not to be one of Hervey's vices; drink gave
him gall-bladder trouble. But when Lord Sandwich, who entertained
his Hell Fire Club friends to drunken orgies at which the Black
Mass was celebrated, told the House that his regard for the morals
of the people compelled him to oppose the Bill, Bathurst could
not resist remarking that he hoped that all public houses were
not going to be regarded as chapels of the devil, simply because
a man might eat or drink too much in them. 'According to this
way of reasoning, I am afraid, many of your lordships' own houses
would come under the same denomination, and you yourselves would
not be quite free from the character of being devils.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Patiently, Bathurst explained that though the Government hoped
to make money from the duty, the measure must at the same time
reduce spirit-drinking, because spirits would cost more. To those
critics who wondered whether, if the price rose, the measure could
be enforced, he replied that this time the Government would have
allies; if, as had been surmised, 50,000 publicans took out licences
to sell spirits, 'there will likewise be 50,000 informers against
unlawful traders'. In any case, as spirits would now be legally
available, the public would no longer side with the sellers of
illicit liquor.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
So it was eventually to prove. For a while the distillers, fearing
for their profits, managed to secure a modification of the Act;
but by 1751 the consequences were so manifestly shocking&#151;reflected
in Henry's Fielding's <I>Reasons for the Late Increase in Robbers,</I>
and Hogarth's 'Gin Lane'&#151;that the Act's original provisions
were reimposed. The dire warnings of Chesterfield and Hervey were
quickly shown to have been unjustified. The consumption of spirits
in Britain, which had been estimated at eight million gallons
in 1743, fell to two million in the 1760s and to around one million
in the 1780s. Only one of Chesterfield's forecasts proved correct;
that if Governments once began to enjoy the considerable revenue
which would accrue to them from the duty, they would never let
it go. They never did.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Gin: scapegoat</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Gin-drinking had spread 'with the rapidity and the violence of
an epidemic', the historian Lecky was to write: 'small as is the
place which this fact occupies in English history, it was probably,
if we consider all the consequences that have flowed from it,
the most momentous in the eighteenth century&#151;incomparably more
so than any event in the purely political or military annals of
the country.' And in a celebrated passage, he went on to describe
the degradation that gin had wrought, with the retailers 'accustomed
to hang out painted boards announcing to their customers they
could be made drunk for a penny, dead drunk for twopence, and
have straw for nothing; cellars strewn with straw were accordingly
provided into which those who had become insensible were dragged,
and where they remained until they had sufficiently recovered
to renew their orgies'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Contemporary accounts suggest that Lecky did not exaggerate. Speaker
after speaker in the 1743 debate, regardless of his politics showed
how appalling the effects of drinking spirits had become producing
'not only momentary fury', Lord Lonsdale claimed 'but incurable
debility and lingering diseases; they not only fill our streets
with madmen, and prisons with criminals, but our hospitals with
cripples'. The statistical evidence points the same way. The birth
rate in London fell, in the early part of the century; so did
the expectation of life among young children. Nearly ten thousand
children under the age of five were dying annually, the Commons
were told in 1751, because of the effects of 'the grand destroyer'
on their parents. 'Inquire from the several hospitals in this
city' Corbyn Morris wrote the same year, 'whether any increase
of patients, and of what sort, are daily brought under their care
? They will all declare, increasing multitudes of dropsical consumptive
people arising from the effects of spirituous liquors.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Yet those spirituous liquors were not really to blame for what
had happened in England&#151;any more than for what was to happen
on Tahiti. It was the way that gin had been virtually thrust down
Londoners' throats which had been responsible; coupled with the
condition of London's poor at the time. Gin drinking was not merely,
as Dorothy George described it in her <I>London Life in the Eighteenth
Century,</I> 'essentially a disease of poverty'; it was a disease
of the ugly kind of poverty portrayed by Fielding, Morris and
many another writer. The picture that emerges is of a squalor
and degradation far worse even than in the London of the Great
Plague; and it was from this that the London poor were seeking
escape.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Even so, had spirits come gradually into use Londoners might have
learned to come to terms with them, as the Dutch had. But not
only were they a novelty in Britain; their sale was relentlessly
pushed by the distillers (whose trade, Hervey complained, became
the most profitable of any in the kingdom&#151;'except that of being
broker to a Prime Minister'). And the distillers themselves had
been given every encouragement by the Government, hungry for more
revenue&#151;and by the landowner M.P.s, hoping for higher rents.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was the way gin was introduced, coupled with the environment,
that made its effects destructive. When Bishop Berkeley boasted
that Britain was the freest country in Europe, the Bishop of Gloucester
wrote to him to say there was indeed freedom of a kind&#151;for
unbounded licentiousness: 'there is not only no safety living
in this town' he wrote from London, 'but scarcely in the country
now, robbery and murder are grown so frequent . . . Those accursed
spirituous liquors which, to the shame of our government, are
so easily to be had, and in such quantities drunk, have changed
the very nature of our people.' The crimes which so disturbed
the Bishop, though, were not as a rule committed in drink&#151;or
even for drink, in the sense of a man robbing to pay for it, though
that must have been common enough. The worst crimes were committed
by those who worked for the illicit distiller and the smuggler,
because the demand for his illicit goods was sufficient to enable
him to pay them well enough not merely to work for him, but if
necessary to commit crimes of violence, even murder, for him.
Nor was it simply the London gin-drinkers who had provided the
demand. Long before they had begun to worry the magistrates, the
British ruling class had shown that they were determined to continue
to buy their claret and their cognac, regardless of whether the
Government wanted to exclude them, as when Britain was at war
with France. And at other times, when they were admitted legally
on payment of duty, the M.P.s who voted for the tax had no compunction
in buying their own supplies more cheaply, knowing they must have
been smuggled in.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The lesson the gin plague taught, in fact, was not so much that
prohibition was futile, as that it was futile unless the Government
enjoyed public confidence and support. Where it was known that
the members of the ruling class&#151;Walpole himself being notoriously
one of them&#151;did not feel that prohibition should apply to them,
the law fell into contempt. Efforts to enforce it, therefore,
tended simply to inflame the public; often even those citizens
who were not spirit drinkers, and would have liked to see consumption
stopped, but were more deeply concerned about the corruption that
attempts to stop it involved. That was why, as Bathurst had realised,
prohibition had been unworkable. It was impossible to find anybody
willing to undertake 'a task at once odious and endless, or to
punish offences which every day multiplied, and on which the whole
body of the common people&#151;a body very formidable when united&#151;was
universally engaged'.

<H2>The Opium Wars</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THE GIN PLAGUE OF LONDON HAD SHOWN HOW A GOVERNMENT, and a governing
class, could encourage the spread of drug-taking in its own financial
interest, with destructive consequences; but at least it had been
possible for them to reverse the policy when those consequences
became apparent. A plant drug which grew in Britain's new colonial
territory in India was to prove even more profitable; and as the
bulk of it was sold away from British territory, there was no
need to worry what the consequences might be.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Opium had long been manufactured from the sap of the poppies grown
in the Middle East and in India; and traveller after traveller
in those regions had reported that unlike in Europe, where it
was employed mainly as a sedative, it was taken as a stimulant,
particularly when Dutch courage was required. 'There is no Turk
who would not buy opium with his last penny', the French naturalist
Belon noted in the sixteenth century, 'because they think that
they become more daring, and have less fear of the dangers of
war.' In India, John Fryer observed in the 1670s, wrestlers took
it to help them to perform feats ordinarily beyond their strength,
and warriors, 'to run up on any enterprise with a raging resolution
to die or be victorious'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Had the British arrived in India as colonists, they would probably
have felt bound to try to suppress opium consumption as a danger
to law and order&#151;and to health; it could create a powerful craving,
as Robert Clive, who became addicted to it, was to find. But apart
from the risk of addiction, opium represented no threat to the
East India Company, so long as it remained primarily a mercantile
body. The Moguls possessed a monopoly of opium production in Bengal,
and they were disposed to restrict consumption, as far as possible,
to themselves and their circle. They were willing, though, to
sell it to the Company; and the Company's ships began to take
it to the East Indies and to China.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Warren Hastings</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Opium had long been used in China medicinally; and in the seventeenth
century people had begun to burn small quantities of it in the
flame of a candle, to inhale the fumes&#151;the idea presumably deriving
from seeing tobacco smoked. Disturbed by reports of the spread
of the new fad, the Emperor decreed in 1729 that opium must no
longer be imported, except under licence. But by this time it
had won too many adherents. The flow continued in defiance of
the ban, just as with tobacco in those countries which had tried
to enforce prohibition a century before.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Most of the opium was brought in from the Middle East by the Portuguese,
through Macao; but when the East India Company inherited the Mogul
empire after Clive's victory at Plassey, they also inherited the
Mogul's opium monopoly, and the prospect of selling more of it
in China, with her estimated 300,000,000 population, was attractive.
There was a snag, however: foreigners were permitted to trade
with China only through Canton. The Company enjoyed a monopoly
of British trade there&#151;including opium brought in under licence.
Its rights might be forfeited if it were caught smuggling. The
Company therefore began to sell its opium in India to the owners
of merchant ships who were prepared to smuggle it into China;
and these 'country ships', as they came to be called, took it
to Macao.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For a while, the operations were on a very small scale; but when
Warren Hastings took over the management of the Company in 1772,
becoming Governor-General of British India, he soon grasped the
tremendous potential of the traffic and set about expanding it
for the benefit of the Company's finances. Hastings had no illusions
about what he was doing. He described opium as a 'pernicious'
commodity, 'which the wisdom of the Government should carefully
restrain from internal consumption'&#151; that is, from consumption
in British India. Foreign commerce was a different matter. When
war with the Dutch temporarily closed the opium market in their
colonies in the East Indies, Hastings switched a consignment to
Canton, in a privateer armed at the expense of the Company. The
venture was not a success. Blackmailed by the Canton merchants'
guild with the threat of disclosure, the Company's Canton agents
had to sell the opium to them for a derisory price. But the 'country
ships' continued to provide a safe and increasingly lucrative
method of distribution.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Shortly before the end of the century another imperial edict against
opium was promulgated; and it was to be followed by many more,
pleading, warning, threatening. Far from paying any attention,
the 'country ships' began to extend their activities; 'some ill-disposed
individuals', the Emperor was informed in 1807, had even begun
to carry the opium they brought over the mountain passes into
the interior. Soon, it reached Pekin. In 1813 he discovered to
his horror that members of his bodyguard, and some of the court
eunuchs, had become enslaved by the habit. Stiffer penalties were
decreed, flogging and the wearing of the <I>cangue</I>&#151; a kind
of portable pillory; but without success. The lower classes, it
was found, were taking to the habit; 'vagabonds clandestinely
purchase and eat it' a further edict complained in 1815, 'and
eventually become sunk into the most stupid and besotted state,
so as to cut down the powers of nature and destroy life.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The situation was unprecedented. Doubtless the French Government
had been very willing, a century earlier, that French wine and
brandy should continue to be smuggled into Britain, the proceeds
going to help the French wine industry, and at the same time depriving
the British Government of needed revenue. But the French Government
had not itself acted as a principal; whereas the Government of
British India&#151;as the Company had virtually become&#151;were by
this time purchasing the entire poppy harvest in their territories,
with the deliberate intention of processing the opium and sending
the bulk of it to China. To avoid jeopardising their legal commercial
undertakings&#151;in particular, the tea trade, which had reached
massive proportions&#151;they still had to pretend that they were
not engaged in smuggling. Nor, technically, were they, as the
'country ships' did not sail under the Company's flag. But they
were licensed by the Company&#151;no ship could take opium out of
India without such a licence. Their operations, too, were financed
by the Company, whose Canton agents received the price for the
opium from the Chinese merchants who purchased it. The Company's
money was also laid out, where necessary, in bribes. When a new
Governor from Pekin arrested some of the Cantonese who were involved
in the traffic, and compelled them under torture to confess, the
Company's Canton agents warned that sales might be subject to
some delay; but they made it clear that this would be only until
a new bribery scale had been agreed with the 'officers and police
people employed to prevent the sales', to compensate them for
the additional risk they had run.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
If criticised for this involvement in drug smuggling, the Company's
line was that it was up to the Chinese, if they wanted, to enforce
their own laws; and in this the Company was doing its best to
help by restricting production, and keeping up the price, so that
most people would not be able to afford it. 'Were it possible
to prevent the use of the drug altogether', the Governor-General
virtuously claimed in 1817, 'except strictly for the purpose of
medicine, we would gladly do it in compassion to mankind'. The
Company's directors in London expressed their approval, but added
that restriction of the supply was a policy which would be acceptable
only so long as it meant higher profits; otherwise, 'the expediency
of proportionately increasing the annual provision will naturally
engage your attention'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Very soon, the Indian Government's attention was duly engaged.
Attracted by the rising price of opium, Princes in the Indian
Native States were beginning to encourage production; and in quantity
and quality 'Malwa', as it was known, began to rival the Company's
opium from Bengal. The Company hastily abandoned its policy of
restricting consumption, reduced its prices, and in 1827 resorted
to what was described as a policy of 'voluntary persuasion' of
the Princes to sell their opium only through the Company, in Calcutta
or Bombay. The voluntary persuasion took the form of telling the
Princes that they had to make a choice between keeping the friendship,
or incurring the enmity, of the British Government. Past experience
had shown that an Indian ruler who incurred the enmity of the
British Government was liable to lose his throne, and sometimes
his life. Friendship, on the other hand, meant a subsidy to compensate
for the loss of revenue from opium. It was not long before the
great bulk of the Malwa opium produced in the Native States was
under the Company's control.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Napier incident</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At the Canton end the Company had also had a setback; but it,
too, had turned out in the end to be an advantage. By 1820 the
system of bribery had become so well-established that the 'country
ships' were actually sailing up the Canton estuary to Whampoa,
the port of Canton, confident that officials would look the other
way when the consignments were unloaded. Once again, however,
a new Governor, determined to carry out Pekin's instructions&#151;or
at least appear to be carrying them out&#151;arrested a number of
the Chinese involved. He also ordered that all ships coming up
the Canton river must be searched; any ship found carrying any
opium would have not merely the opium, but its entire cargo confiscated,
and would thereafter be banned from the China trade.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The smugglers departed&#151;but only as far as Lintin island, at
the mouth of the estuary. There, they set up what was in all but
name, a British base. The opium clippers were fast and well-armed,
more than a match for Chinese junks which were sent to intercept
them. They brought their cargoes to Lintin, packed in chests-of-drawers,
containing about 140 lbs of opium made up into balls about the
size of a small grapefruit; discharged the chests in depot ships;
and returned to India for more. From Lintin, the opium was either
taken by country ships farther along the coast, or transferred
locally to 'fast crabs', or 'scrambling dragons'&#151; the names
by which the Chinese authorities denounced them, in a proclamation
in 1826&#151;shallow-beamed boats manned by thirty or forty oarsmen,
designed so that they could skim over bars and shallows, and along
remote creeks. The penalty for being caught was death; but this
actually helped the traffic, because the smugglers had no hesitation
in fighting it out if, owing to some breakdown in the bribery
chain, they were intercepted. Lintin was ideally suited to 'fast
crab' activities. It also saved port dues for the larger ships;
and it was free from Chinese interference. During the 1 820s,
as a result, the amount of Indian opium imported into China quadrupled.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was no question, as yet, of the Company's trying to justify
the opium traffic on any other ground than <I>caveat emptor.</I>
The taking of opium for pleasure was still regarded as a destructive
vice&#151;and not just in India; Stamford Raffles denounced it as
a malign influence on the people of Java, 'degrading their character
and enervating their energies'. De Quincey's <I>Confessions,</I>
too, when they were published in 1821, alerted public opinion
at home to the agonies of addiction. So when the House of Commons
Committee was set up to investigate the affairs of the East India
Company in 1830, the Company's line was that it must be allowed
to retain its opium monopoly, because only in that way could production
be restricted, and consumption kept down by 'making the price
as high as possible'. It would have required little research by
the Committee to find that so far from trying to keep the price
up and consumption down, the Company was selling four times as
much opium to the Chinese at a considerably lower price than it
had ten years before; but the Company had another argument in
reserve, which was to prove decisive. The value of the opium sold
in China amounted to well over two million pounds&#151;getting on
for half the amount then annually devoted to paying for the Crown
and the Civil Service in Britain. If the Government of India was
deprived of the revenue from opium, it would have to be raised
from other sources, and the British taxpayer might have to be
called upon. It would not be desirable, the Committee recommended,
'to abandon so important a source of revenue as the opium trade,
the duty upon opium being one which falls principally on the foreign
consumer'. The Government gratefully accepted the recommendation;
and although the Company was stripped of its other privileges,
the opium monopoly was retained.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This meant, in effect, that the British Government was now directly
responsible for the opium traffic, through the Government of India,
'the Company' being hardly distinguishable from the Indian civil
service. Even the pretence that production was being kept down
to keep prices high and consumption low was abandoned. The Company's
agents were instructed to put pressure on the Bengal peasants
to sow more poppies; as the agents were paid on a commission basis,
they needed no inducement, using various forms of blackmail to
bring recalcitrant peasants into line.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Largely due to the pioneer efforts of Jardine Matheson's 'opium
clippers', too, new areas were opened up to the smuggling traffic
along the Chinese coast to the north of Canton. Language was a
difficulty; William Jardine shrewdly solved it by employing a
missionary, Charles Gutzlaff, as interpreter. 'We look up to the
ever-blessed Redeemer, to whom China with all its millions is
given', Gutzlaff wrote; 'in the faithfulness of His promise we
anticipate the glorious day of a general conversion, and are willing
to do our utmost to promote the good work'; the good work being
the introduction of the Chinese to the bibles, tracts, and ointments,
which he distributed wherever his duties as interpreter, in the
haggling over opium prices&#151;which brought much satisfaction and
profit to Jardine Matheson&#151;permitted.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Some members of the Whig Government, though, were uneasy about
the traffic. It did not pass unnoticed abroad that the Government
which, in 1833, had paraded its devotion to the cause of humanity
by abolishing the slave trade, had now taken over the role of
principal in the most massive smuggling operation the world had
ever known, designed to keep the Chinese people supplied with
a notoriously dangerous drug, consumption of which was generally
restricted, and in some places prohibited, on British territory.
The remedy, Lord Palmerston decided, was to persuade the Chinese
Government to end the Canton monopoly, and to open up other ports
to foreign trade&#151;which would be accompanied, the expectation
was, by the legalisation of opium. In 1834 he despatched Lord
Napier to China, to negotiate the deal.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A naval officer turned sheep farmer, Napier knew nothing of China
or the Chinese, and succeeded only in irritating the Canton authorities.
Recriminations followed; and the viceroy put a ban on trade of
any kind by British ships. Napier's reply was a show of force:
two British frigates managed to fight their way up the river to
Canton. The Chinese blocked their way back, with stakes and fireships.
Napier realised he was trapped. Harassed, and suffering from fever,
he had to accept the offer of a Chinese boat for his return journey
from Canton down to the sea. It deposited him at Macao where,
a few days later, he died.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The prohibition debate</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Up to this point, information about the effects of the opium on
the Chinese had been scanty; and it was never to be wholly reliable.
But in 1832 two American missionaries founded the <I>Chinese Repository,</I>
a monthly magazine which, amongst other things, provided translations
of Chinese documents ranging from imperial decrees to fly-posters;
and the evidence pointed to growing alarm about the drug. The
army, in particular, had succumbed. Of a thousand soldiers sent
as reinforcements to help put down a rising in the province of
Canton, the commanding officer had had to reject two hundred as
unfit for service; and opium was blamed when the rebels defeated
the imperial force. The son of the Governor of Canton, it also
transpired, had been smuggling it through to his friends in Pekin
in the equivalent of the diplomatic bag. Chinese historians have
suggested that this attraction opium smoking had for the sons
of men of wealth and position may have been decisive, in what
was to follow: for the Emperor himself&#151; Tao-Kwang, who had succeeded
to the throne in 1820&#151;was a victim; his three eldest sons all
died of opium addiction.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The difficulty which confronted the Emperor was how to suppress
the opium traffic, now that it had obtained such a hold. The story
of the opium in the diplomatic bag had come out only because it
turned out to be of such poor quality that the merchant concerned
was to be proceeded against, just as if it were legal merchandise;
and how deeply both merchants and civil authorities were involved
was revealed again in 1834. The Repository reported that the new
Governor of Canton (the old one having been sacked for his failure
to suppress the traffic), angry at finding that he had been overcharged
for his opium supply, had attempted to arrest the suppliers, only
to find they had already absconded. When the authorities did take
action against smugglers&#151;the <I>Repository</I> explained&#151;it
was not to stop smuggling, but to ensure that it was kept in existing
channels: 'it would seem that the smuggling trade is becoming
a monopoly of the Government.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The fact, too, that so many respectable citizens&#151;or their sons&#151;were
opium smokers encouraged extortion and blackmail. Since the beginning
of the century, the American merchant Charles W. King&#151;one of
the very few merchants of any nationality in Canton who had refused
to have anything to do with the traffic&#151;complained in a letter
to the British Superintendent of Trade:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
the British merchants, led on by the East India Company, have
been driving a trade in violation of the highest laws and the
best interests of the Chinese empire. This cause has been pushed
so far as to derange its currency, to corrupt its officers, and
ruin multitudes of its people. The traffic has become associated,
in the politics of the country, with the axe and the dungeon;
in the breasts of men in private life, with the wreck of property,
virtue, honour and happiness. All ranks, from the Emperor on the
throne to the people of the humblest hamlets, have felt its sting.
To the fact of its descent to the lowest classes of society, we
are frequent witnesses; and the Court gazettes are evidence that
it has marked out victims for disgrace and ruin even among the
imperial kindred.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Law-abiding citizens were not necessarily safe as Gutzlaff was
to lament, when he came to write the life of the Emperor. The
great bane of China, Gutzlaff&#151;of all people&#151;argued, had been
the introduction of opium by foreigners. The rewards offered to
informers in the attempt to suppress it made them 'both numerous
and unscrupulous; whoever had a grudge against his neighbour,
denounced him as a transgressor of the laws against the drug';
and the excuse 'searching for the drug', had been used by officials
to commit thefts, and other outrages. Thousands of innocent people,
Gutzlaff lamented, had been the victims.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The failure of the prohibition policy, and the disastrous consequences
arising out of the effort to enforce it, had attracted the attention
of some of the teachers at an academy which had been founded in
1820 in Canton. Perhaps because it had not settled into the traditional
academic grooves, the possibility of legalising opium imports,
subject to a duty, had been discussed; and among those influenced
by the arguments in favour of that course was Hs&uuml; Nai-chi,
who had later become an imperial official in the province of Kwantung,
and seen for himself the effects of the failure of prohibition.
In May 1836 he addressed a memorial to the Emperor, putting the
case for admitting opium legally, on payment of duty.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Hs&uuml; did not dispute that 'so vile a practice', and the evils
arising out of it, should if possible be stopped. His argument
was that prohibition not merely had failed to stop the evils,
but had created many more; and the severer the interdicts against
it became, 'the more widely do the evils arising therefrom spread'.
When it had first been found that prohibition was not working,
flogging and the <I>cangue</I> had been introduced; then, exile,
imprisonment, and even death. Yet 'the smokers of the drug have
increased in number, and the practice has spread almost through
the whole empire'. Supporters of the prohibition policy had been
forced back on the argument that it was not the regulations, but
how they were carried out, that was the trouble; 'it is said,
the daily increase is owing to the negligence of officers in enforcing
the interdicts!' But this negligence, Hs&uuml; insisted, was the
fault of the interdicts. The more severe they became, the greater
the incentive to criminals to employ violence, or corruption,
or both.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In its general approach, the memorial was remarkably similar in
its line of argument to Bathurst's in the House of Lords nearly
a century before. But Hs&uuml;'s analysis went a little deeper
in its recognition of why the severity of a penal code, so far
from helping in the effort to suppress a drug, must make it easier
for the importer. As he was not himself at risk, the penalties
did not matter to him. At worst, all that he had to worry about
was having to pay out more in bribes. But even that could be,
in the end, to his advantage. The higher the payment offered,
the easier it became to find officials who would succumb.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Emperor was sufficiently impressed by Hs&uuml;'s memorandum
to refer it, in June, to the Governor of Canton, Teng T'ing-chen,
who had taken office earlier that year. Teng had already been
converted to the legalisation policy: his recommendations followed
the line Hs&uuml; had laid down. But other advisers expressed
horror at the proposal&#151;in much the same terms as Hervey and
Chesterfield had used about the Spirits Licensing Bill. 'When
have not prostitution, gambling, treason, robbery, and suchlike
infractions of the laws afforded occasion for extortionate underlings
and worthless vagrants to benefit themselves, and by falsehood
and bribery to amass wealth?', Chu T'sun, Sub-Chancellor of the
Grand Secretariat, asked. 'But none, surely, would contend that
the law, because in such instances rendered ineffectual, should
therefore be abrogated!' The consequences of such a step would
be disastrous:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The laws that forbid the people to do wrong may be likened to
the dykes which prevent the overflowing of water. If any one,
then, urging that the dykes are very old, and therefore useless,
should have them thrown down, what words could express the consequences
of the impetuous rush and all-destroying overflow!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The damage, Chu feared, might already have been done, simply by
the knowledge that there was a move in favour of legalisation:
'the instant effect has been, that crafty thieves and villains
have on all sides begun to raise their heads and open their eyes,
gazing about and pointing the finger, under the notion that when
once these prohibitions are repealed, thenceforth, and forever,
they may regard themselves as free from every restraint'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Another memorialist added a recommendation which may well have
been decisive. The opium sellers, he pointed out, were actually
living in Canton: even Jardine himself. Why? Why not arrest <I>them,</I>
for breaking the imperial law? Why not send all their ships back,
and allow no resumption of trade of any kind until all opium smuggling
activities had ceased? 'If commands be issued of this plain and
energetic character, in language strong, and in sense becoming,
though their nature be the most abject&#151;that of a dog, or a sheep&#151;yet,
having a care for their own lives, they will not fail to seek
the gain, and to flee the danger.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
This was the policy that the Emperor elected to follow. For having
raised the hopes of the opium smokers that the drug might be legalised,
Hs&uuml; Nai-chi was removed from his post. An official who had
sent in detailed plans showing how prohibition could be enforced,
Lin Tse-Hs&uuml;, was despatched early in 1839 to Canton as Imperial
Commissioner, charged with the suppression of the opium traffic.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The first Opium War</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The story of Lin's commissionership, which provoked the first
Opium War, has often been told; in recent years by, among others,
Maurice Collis, in <I>Foreign Mud;</I> Arthur Waley, in <I>The
Opium War through Chinese Eyes;</I> and Hsin-Pao Chang in <I>Commissioner
Lin and the Opium War.</I> It represents the classic example of
the limitations of honesty, integrity and assiduity in carrying
out a campaign to suppress the traffic in a drug. Yet Lin felt
he was well-placed to achieve his aim. He had a half-Nelson on
the British merchants, because he knew they could not afford to
risk the loss of the tea trade, through Canton; and he determined
to exploit the hold this gave him. The British merchants, he announced
after his arrival, must surrender all their opium stocks. When,
thinking to placate him, they offered to surrender a thousand
chests, he took the opportunity to show that he knew exactly how
much more opium they had, and to inform them that until they handed
it over, all trade with British vessels, and all movement of British
shipping up and down the Canton river, would cease.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
At this point the Chief Superintendent of Trade, Captain Charles
Elliot, managed to get up to Canton. As Chief Superintendent,
he was a kind of unofficial British Consul in China; and he had
written time after time to Palmerston to warn him that if the
opium traffic was allowed to develop unchecked, a crisis must
develop. It now had; and, though he had no official powers, he
decided there was no help for it but to hand over all the opium:
more than 20,000 chests. Lin put an end to the blockade, took
delivery of the opium, and personally supervised its destruction.
It was mixed with salt and lime, dissolved in water, and flushed
away into the sea.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Lin had achieved his first objective; but it availed him nothing.
Elliot ordered all British subjects and all British ships out
of the Canton river, so that they could no longer be held virtually
as hostages&#151;the American merchants, most of whom had been involved
in the opium traffic, staying in Canton to act as agents for the
British, so that the tea trade would not be disrupted. The opium
arriving from India was simply switched to points along the coast,
as an Imperial Censor, Pu Chi-t'ung, had warned would happen,
in a memorial to the Emperor. And Lin found himself unable to
check the smuggling. After the destruction of the opium, he intended
to have a purge of the customs officials; but too many of them,
he found, were implicated in the traffic. Even where he managed
to stir them to action, this only&#151;as he explained to the Emperor
in the spring of 1840&#151;led to the smugglers adopting more ingenious
ruses to circumvent them. Sometimes opium would be hidden in the
rear apartments of houses, where the women lived, their presence
embarrassing the searchers. Sometimes it was buried in forests,
or in the precincts of temples. It had even been put into chests
disguised as coffins, and laid to rest, until required, in tombs.
And Lin was finding it hard to get informers, because they were
no use to him unless they knew the traffic&#151;in which case they
would work for the smugglers, who could afford to pay them more.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
What was being demonstrated, for the first time on such a large
scale, was the impracticability of prohibition as a way to suppress
the traffic in a drug, particularly in a drug as addictive as
opium. Addicts, who felt they had to have it, would pay whatever
the smugglers charged. If supplies dwindled owing to more effective
customs work, the price rose, allowing a bigger margin of profit
out of which to bribe the customs officials into connivance. And
as smuggling was so extensive, many thousands of people, from
the rowers of the fast crabs to the opium smokers, had a common
interest in breaking the law, and protecting others who broke
it. Where respectable citizens or officials were involved, there
were opportunities for extortion and for blackmail; and the higher
the legal penalties for opium offenses, the greater the risk that
those involved would commit acts of violence and even murder,
rather than allow themselves to be caught.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
All this, Lin was to learn in the months which elapsed between
the departure of the British from Canton, and the arrival of the
expeditionary force which Elliot had asked for, to punish the
Commissioner for his presumption. Elliot had not altered his views
about opium. 'No man entertains a deeper detestation of the disgrace
and sin of this forced traffic', he wrote to Palmerston, in November
1839 'than the humble individual who signs this despatch. I see
little to choose between it and piracy.' But British property
had been extorted by compulsion, and destroyed; that, he felt,
was 'the most shameless violence which one nation has ever yet
dared to perpetrate against another'. While awaiting Palmerston's
instructions, he used the small naval force he had at his disposal
to protect the British merchant fleet, which lay at anchor off
Hong Kong, and to inflict some punishment on presumptuous Chinese
naval junks.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The British force arrived in June 1840; including what Lin described
as 'cartwheel ships, that can put the axles in motion by means
of fire, and can move rather fast'. Still more important, the
new steamships could move in a flat calm, or directly up wind.
They did not, however, waste any time trying to move up the river
to Canton. They went north, to put more direct pressure on Pekin.
Lin, who had been basking in the Imperial favour, was abruptly
removed from his post, and sent into exile. His mistake&#151;as the
Censor, Pu, had realised&#151;lay in imagining that the threat of
closure of the legitimate British trade would suffice to bring
the opium traffic to an end. It mattered little to the British
merchants that instead of picking up their tea at Canton, they
had to leave the Americans to collect it there, and receive it
from them at Hong Kong. What was vital was that the flow of their
imports of opium should continue; and Lin had been unable to stop
it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was not seriously impeded even by the hostilities which followed,
as militarily the resistance was insignificant. By some judicious
diplomatic manoeuvres and some injudicious attempts at deception,
the Chinese managed to avoid capitulation until the summer of
1842, when they were finally compelled to accept the British terms.
By then, the opium traffic was back to normal.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The treaty of Nanking</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The war had not, admittedly, been fought exclusively to legitimise
the opium traffic. Palmerston could claim that he was mainly concerned
with compelling the Chinese to accept free trade. But opium happened
to be by far the most profitable commodity involved. 'Had there
been an alternative', Commissioner Lin's biographer Hsin-pao Chang
commented, '&#151;say, molasses, or rice&#151;the conflict might have
been called the Molasses War, or the Rice War'. But there was
no alternative. Not merely was opium the only British import for
which there was any substantial demand in China: the demand had
grown enormously. In the late 1820s the Company exported an average
of less than 10,000 chests annually to China; that figure had
increased, in the year before Lin was appointed, to 40,000. Palmerston
was fully aware of the situation; Sardine, who had returned to
England just before Lin arrived at Canton, had been called in
to brief him, 'I have to instruct you'&#151;Palmerston accordingly
informed Captain Elliot&#151;'to make some arrangement with the Chinese
Government for the admission of opium to China as an article of
lawful commerce.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Palmerston knew, though, that it would be unwise to make this
instruction public. The Chinese plenipotentiaries, he went on,
must not be given the idea that it was 'the intention of H.M.
Government to use any compulsion'. Had H.M. Government been seen
to be forcing the Chinese to legalise opium, its enemies abroad
and at home would have been handed a serviceable weapon; and its
shaky majority, which had narrowly survived a debate on its China
policy in the Commons in 1840, would have been again imperilled.
The line to take to the Chinese, Palmertson suggested, was that
they should offer to legalise opium in their own interest. They
should be reminded that they could not stop it coming in, for
even if the supply of opium from India could be checked, 'plenty
of it would be produced in other countries, and would thence be
sent to China'; and they should allow themselves to be gently
persuaded to profit out of necessity by taxing it.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
When Elliot was sacked in 1841, similar instructions were given
to his successor, Sir George Pottinger. The British Government,
the Chinese plenipotentiaries were to be told, did not insist;
but it must be impressed on the Chinese how very much in their
own interest the legalisation of opium would be. Pottinger duly
presented Palmerston's view, only to be met with a blank refusal
even to discuss the possibility of legalisation. Opium, they told
him, was an evil, growing daily worse. They could not, even if
they wanted to, countenance the proposal, as the Emperor would
repudiate them. Pottinger's instructions left him no room to manoeuvre;
and the change of Government in Britain in 1841 promised to make
his task still more difficult&#151;the Tories in Opposition having
come out strongly against the opium traffic in a debate in the
Commons the year before.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the event, though, the Tories' principles underwent a rapid
change when they crossed the floor of the House. They did not
care to put any further pressure on the Chinese to admit opium;
Pottinger was told he could accept the continuance of the ban.
But he was instructed to warn the Chinese that, so far as British
shipping was concerned, they 'need not trouble themselves whether
our vessels bring opium or not'. In other words, British ships
suspected of smuggling must not be searched. As the Chinese would
presumably ask the British Government, in these circumstances,
not to allow British ships to be used for smuggling, Pottinger
was told he should instruct their owners to conform&#151; leaving
the traffic to 'Chinese fast boats and other craft', as before.
And it was this system&#151;'mutual connivance', as Pottinger's successor
Sir John Davis tetchily described it&#151;that came into operation
after the peace settlement.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The Arrow War</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Mutual connivance was an unsatisfactory basis for peace. It survived
only because in the immediate post-war period, the Chinese were
in no mood to risk a resumption of hostilities. In 1850 the new
Emperor, Hsien-feng, issued a fresh edict against opium smoking,
giving offenders a brief period of grace in which to break the
habit, after which anybody caught would be beheaded, and his family
sent into slavery. But a few months later the Taiping&#151;the 'long-haired
ones'&#151;rose in rebellion; and although they were opposed to the
use of drugs of any kind&#151;tobacco smoking, even, was punishable
by death&#151;their victories benefited the opium traffic. The leaders
of the Taiping were too preoccupied with the struggle against
the imperial troops; and at the same time, it became difficult
for the Emperor to enforce prohibition, even in those regions
which still nominally adhered to his cause.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The traffic, too, was greatly facilitated by the fact that under
the terms of the Treaty of Nanking the British had taken Hong
Kong. Pottinger had assured the Chinese plenipotentiaries that
the exportation of opium from Hong Kong to China would be forbidden;
and it was. But the ban was never enforced. There was nothing
to prevent opium from being smuggled out to the mainland. As soon
as the smugglers realised that the Canton authorities, rather
than risk precipitating another war, were not searching British
vessels, they began to register the smuggling craft as British,
and sail them openly up the Canton estuary, with the Union Jack
as their flag of convenience.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Opium also poured into Northern China through Shanghai which,
as the northernmost of the ports opened to foreigners by the Pottinger
treaty, served a hitherto largely inaccessible region. In the
ten years following the treaty, the opium traffic to China doubled.
This roused British hopes that the Emperor, realising his ban
had failed and needing funds to mount more effective operations
against the Taiping, might be converted to the policy of legalisation,
as some of his courtiers desired. But he remained determined to
stamp out opium smuggling. To this end, he had sent Yeh Ming-Chen,
a disciple and friend of Commissioner Lin's, to Canton to resume
Lin's policies. Caution, and the need to deal with the Taiping,
meant that there was no immediate confrontation of the kind Lin
had precipitated; but Yeh cleverly fanned the anti-British feeling
which had arisen since the war among the Cantonese. There were
ugly incidents, and the British merchants began to realise that
they and their commerce were in growing danger.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
An excuse would be needed, though, for a new campaign. Yeh provided
it in the autumn of 1856, when Mandarins arrested the crew of
the lorcha <I>Arrow</I>, lying off Canton. Lorchas were a hybrid
species, with a Western-style hull and eastern-style sails; they
had been found convenient for smuggling, and the <I>Arrow</I>
was one of many which, though Chinese-owned, had been registered
as British for that purpose in Hong Kong. For form's sake, the
master was British; but the crew were Chinese, some of them being
criminals known to the Chinese authorities. So far as the British
authorities were concerned, this made no difference. Criminals
or not, they were under the protection of the British flag. (The
discovery that the <I>Arrow's</I> registration had expired, so
that it was no longer a British vessel, caused only momentary
embarrassment; it could legally have re-registered, the explanation
was, the next time it arrived in Hong Kong.) When Yeh refused
to apologise, the navy was called in, and proceeded to shell his
official residence in Canton.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Tory Opposition were outraged. The <I>Arrow</I> affair, they
complained, was a shoddy excuse for the war which Palmerston now
clearly proposed to wage; and in an impassioned debate in the
Commons, they did what they had failed to do in 1840, winning
the Radicals to their side and defeating the Government in a vote.
It was just the opportunity Palmerston had needed. He held a general
election, taking care to ensure it was fought on the issue of
the insult to the British Crown. 'An insolent barbarian wielding
authority at Canton,' he told the electors of Tiverton, 'has violated
the British flag, broken the engagement of treaties, offered rewards
for the heads of British subjects in that part of China, and planned
their destruction by murder, assassinations and poisons.' The
electorate, their patriotic passions aroused, enthusiastically
voted him and his supporters back into office.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Emperor managed to delay the final capitulation, as his predecessor
had, by some judicious stalling, and some injudicious deception.
Lord Elgin, leading the British expeditionary force, had to occupy
Pekin and burn down the Emperor's Summer Palace, to convince him
that when terms were accepted, even under duress, they must be
kept. And one of the terms imposed, on this occasion, was that
in future imports of opium would be legally permitted, on payment
of a duty. As before, it was possible to maintain that this was
not what the war had been fought about&#151;a view which suited Elgin,
who personally thought the flimsy <I>Arrow</I> pretext scandalous,
and was so disgusted with what he saw of the effects of opium
in China that he declined to treat it as a significant item on
the negotiation agenda. It had, in fact, by this time become part
of a much wider set of objectives: shared by the French, who had
commercial designs on China, and had joined in the fighting, and
the Americans, who had helped in spite of their neutrality. The
common aim was to compel the Chinese to conform to the ways of
the West in diplomacy and in trade. Nevertheless opium was still,
for the British, the main consideration. The returns of the years
between the wars had shown no great improvement in legal exports
to China; the East India Company and the opium merchants, not
British manufacturers, had been the chief beneficiaries of the
opening of Shanghai to foreigners. How much importance the British
delegation attached to opium was demonstrated when they persuaded
the American plenipotentiary, William B. Reed, who had been formally
instructed to accept the right of the Chinese to maintain prohibition,
to repudiate his brief.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
As expected, legalisation produced a rapid increase in the demand,
which the manufacturers in India were ready to meet. From fewer
than 60,000 chests in 1859-60, the figure rose almost to 90,000
ten years later, and to over 105,000 in 1879-80. And as it was
no longer possible to hope that opium could be kept out, the Chinese
had a powerful incentive to cultivate poppies, from which to manufacture
their own. There had been occasional reports since the early 1830s
of illicit poppy cultivation, but not on a scale sufficient to
cause the Imperial government much alarm. Now, farmers who grew
poppies could feel they were performing a patriotic duty, helping
to reduce the drain of currency out of the country. For a while,
though, the home product did not pose any threat to imports. In
the Treaty negotiations the Chinese plenipotentiaries, anxious
to demonstrate that there had been no change of view&#151;that the
drug was still objectionable on moral grounds &#151;had argued for
a high import duty, to reduce consumption. The British, determined
to keep the price of their product competitive, demanded the right
to decide what rate of duty should be levied, and reduced by half
the rate the Chinese had proposed, so that when the cost of smuggling
operations was taken into account, the new selling price need
not be substantially higher than the old. As the Indian product
was considered greatly superior, there need be no immediate fear
of any abatement of demand.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For form's sake, the Government's argument was that the Chinese
had voluntarily abandoned prohibition; but few who were in a position
to know their attitude were deceived. 'Nothing that has been gained
was received from the free will of the Chinese', Sir Thomas Wade,
one of the British negotiators, was to write ten years later;
'the concessions made to us have been from the first to the last
extorted against the conscience of the nation&#151;in defiance, that
is to say, of the moral convictions of its educated men.' And
Wade was in no doubt that the consequences for the Chinese had
been terrible. In all the cases in his experience, opium had led
to 'the steady descent, moral and physical, of the smoker'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Opium: bane or benefit?</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Up to this point, the assumption that opium was injurious to the
health and morals of the Chinese had hardly been questioned. The
most commonly cited authority on the subject was the missionary
W. H. Medhurst, who had gone out in 1816, and whose book <I>China</I>
was published in 1840. By his reckoning, the amount of opium smuggled
in at that time was enough to demoralise nearly three million
people
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the habit is once formed, it becomes inveterate; discontinuance
is more and more difficult, until at length, the sudden deprivation
of the accustomed indulgence produces certain death. In proportion
as the wretched victim comes under the power of the infatuating
drug, so is his ability to resist temptation less strong; and
debilitated in body as well as mind, he is unable to earn his
usual pittance, and not infrequently sinks under the cravings
of an appetite which he is unable to gratify. Thus they may be
seen, hanging their heads by the doors of the opium shops, which
the hard-hearted keepers, having fleeced them of their all, will
not permit them to enter; and shut out from their own dwellings,
either by angry relatives or ruthless creditors, they die in the
streets unpitied and despised.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The opium habit, Medhurst estimated, reduced life expectation
by about ten years, destroyed health while life lasted, and at
the same time ruined countless families because of the drain on
the smoker's resources.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the 1840 Commons debate, a few voices had been raised in opium's
defence, but the contention had been simply that its evils had
been greatly exaggerated, and that its effects were no worse than
those of over-indulgence in ardent spirits, all too familiar in
the West. Between the opium wars, however, there were occasional
intimations that opium need not have dire effects. The comments
from Chinese sources remained implacably hostile, and so did the
bulk of the reports from missionaries; but Dr. Benjamin Hobson,
who had worked for years as a doctor among the poor in Canton,
was one of those who realised that there was not necessarily any
inevitability about the process of degeneration, even for addicts.
'I have found' he wrote,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
the habitual use of opium even compatible with longevity . . .
though its tendency is to undermine the constitution, and only
support the system by a false and dangerous stimulus, yet, if
it can be taken regularly and of good quality, it does not abridge
the duration of life to the extent that might reasonably be expected
that it should do.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The opium merchants took their cue. The ending of prohibition
after the second Opium War relieved them of their worries in China;
but they still had to watch public opinion in Britain. The Palmerston
era was ending; the Conservatives had always been hostile to his
China policy; and the anti-opium campaign, led by Lord Shaftesbury,
was gaining influential non-party support. It was time, the merchants
realised, to present their wares in a more positively favourable
light; and on November 28th, 1867, Jardine Matheson put them in
a letter to the Governor of Hong Kong. The ugly picture formerly
drawn of the effects of opium on the Chinese, they claimed, had
been forgotten; 'since 1860 it has been rendered abundantly clear
that the use of opium is not a curse, but a comfort and a benefit
to the hard-working Chinese'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Had it been only Jardine Matheson who took this line, it could
safely have been ignored. And when similar views were expressed
by British consuls in the Treaty Ports in China, and transmitted
to the Foreign Office, it was possible to suspect that they might
be more concerned with British trade than with British moral prestige.
But the cause was eventually supported by men who had no direct
interest in opium, and who were unlikely to have been deluded
or suborned; including Sir George Birdwood, a former Professor
of <I>Materia Medica</I> in Bombay. Opium smoking, he told the
readers of <I>The Times</I> in a letter published on December
26th, 1881, was 'almost as harmless an indulgence as twiddling
the thumbs, and other silly-looking methods of concentrating the
jaded mind'. The following year a book by William Bretherton,
a retired Hong Kong solicitor, cited a number of testimonials
to opium from men of standing on the island; and in 1892, an even
more impressive array of its supporters was paraded by G. H. M.
Batten, a former Indian civil servant, in a paper read in London
to the Society of Arts.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The opportunity to solve the mystery came in 1893, when the pressure
of public opinion in England, and a motion in the House of Commons,
pushed the Government into setting up a Royal Commission to investigate
the subject. Their verdict was that opium in general was used
in moderation, and led 'to no evident ill effects'. One member
of the Commission, admittedly, dissented in a scathing minority
report; and later, Joseph Rowntree was able to produce quite a
damning critique of the report itself&#151;showing, for example,
that although forty-nine out of the fifty-two missionaries from
China who had given evidence had condemned opium, the report had
quoted only the opinions of two of the three who had been less
critical. Nevertheless the minutes of evidence showed that as
well as merchants and colonial civil servants, many doctors and
some missionaries believed that the opium habit was on balance
harmless, and could even be regarded as socially desirable.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
How was it possible that two such mutually contradictory sets
of evidence could each be supported by so much knowledgeable and
trustworthy testimony? There was one obvious clue. Most of the
witnesses who condemned opium had worked in China. In India, where
the Commission had held most of its sittings, most witnesses were
in opium's favour. Could it not be&#151;some of them had suggested&#151;that
the explanation was simple; the Chinese smoked opium, whereas
the Indians ate it, or drank it?
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But evidence from other colonies failed to support this proposition.
In the Malay peninsula, the colonial authorities agreed, the reverse
was the case; 'Opium eating in all its forms', the Auditor-General
of the Straits Settlements claimed, 'when once established as
a habit, produces an invariable bodily and mental condition which
imperatively calls for a constant, if graduated, increase of the
drug. Now, this is not the case with opium smoking.' And evidence
from the same region upset another hypothesis; that the Chinese
might be in some way hereditarily susceptible to addiction. In
the Straits Settlements, Major McCullum informed the Commission,
only the 'indolent Malays' suffered ill-effects from the drug.
For the Chinese it was 'a harmless, even a beneficial stimulant'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Reading between the lines it is clear that the Royal Commission,
baffled, came to assume that the explanation must be looked for
in the circumstances in which opium addiction was observed. The
'anti-opiumists', as they were described, must have seen the effects
of the abuse of opium; they must have seen, or heard about, only
the addicts, and been thereby misled into thinking that addiction
was inevitable. Again and again, in the reports from China, the
emphasis was on the inescapable nature of the perdition awaiting
the opium smoker. As the Rev. A. Elwin, a missionary in China
for over twenty years, put it, there was no such thing as a moderate
smoker; 'the dose is always, I believe, increased by degrees'.
But there were scores of witnesses in India to demonstrate this
was nonsense&#151;including missionaries; Dr. H. Martyn Clark testified
that he knew of no 'hardier, thriftier or more careful people'
than the peasants of the Punjab, where he had worked; yet most
of them regularly took opium, a habit which 'seems to interfere
neither with their longevity nor with their health'. The most
reasonable explanation, therefore, was that the missionary, an
alien in China, had been dealing with the cast-offs, the derelicts;
whereas in India, he was familiar with all levels of the community.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Although there was a measure of truth in this, it would not account
for the whole range of different reactions to opium described
over the course of the century, in different regions&#151;or in the
same region, in different periods. When opium had been introduced
into Assam, along with cheap labour for the new tea plantations,
an official had protested in 1839 that in the course of a few
years the opium plague had 'depopulated this beautiful country,
turned it into a land of wild beasts'; and in the process, it
had 'degenerated the Assamese from a fine race of people to the
most abject, crafty and demoralised race in India'. Yet fifty
years later, though the consumption of opium there was higher
per head than in any other part of India, it was giving no trouble.
'They take their opium', Commissioner Driberg reported, 'just
as a good Englishman would take his &quot;peg&quot;.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Again, R. L. Stevenson's surmise&#151;that it was the rapidity of
the social changes which was disruptive, leading as it did to
the abuse of drink or drugs&#151;seems the most likely explanation.
Opium had come suddenly into Assam, along with an influx of cheap
labour, disrupting the community's old way of life. It did the
same in Burma, the only British colony where it gave serious trouble.
And it was a menace in China, in those regions which the smugglers
could reach to 'push' the Indian produce. But in India itself,
it posed no problem, being used mainly not as a narcotic, but,
like coca in Peru, as a way of 'enabling the taker to undergo
severe and continuous physical exercise'&#151;Dr. Francis Anstie
noted in his treatise on drugs in the 1860s&#151;'without the assistance
of ordinary food'. It was for this purpose, Dr. W. Myers told
the Royal Commission, that the chair-bearers, couriers and coolies
of Formosa took opium. He had been forced to alter his 'preconceived
prejudices with reference to the universally baneful effects of
the drug', when he found that they used it every day, as a matter
of course, rarely needing to increase the amount.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Significantly, where the Chinese were allowed to smoke opium,
outside their own country's jurisdiction, they did nothing to
disturb the authorities. The opium smoker learned to discriminate,
choosing his own brand, and savouring it with the relish of a
connoisseur. In a book describing his experiences as an attach&eacute;
in Pekin, published in 1900, A. B. Freeman Mitford&#151;the future
Lord Redesdale&#151;could seriously claim that to deprive the Chinaman
of his Indian opium, and to condemn him to the 'miserable substitute'
grown in China, 'would be like forbidding the importation of champagne
and Chateau Lafitte into England, and driving our epicures and
invalids to the necessity of falling back on cheap and nasty stimulants'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Mitford, though, had lived in a region where the inhabitants had
come to terms with opium. He had never seen, as missionaries had
seen, the destruction and misery that the drug could cause before
it was domesticated. In any case, the British Government could
not claim that it had only been trying to keep the Chinese supplied
with an agreeable pastime, because it had not made that its excuse.
Throughout the century, its aim had been to make the maximum profit
from the drug, regardless of its effect on the Chinese. For a
brief period at the beginning production had been restricted,
but this was to increase profits; the pretence that it was to
keep down consumption was abandoned the moment profits began to
fall. Two campaigns&#151;three, if Napier's is included&#151;had been
undertaken mainly to compel the Chinese to take the drug, preferably
legally. The reasons given, that they were designed to punish
the Chinese for seizing British property, and for insulting the
British flag, were transparently spurious; the property was a
smuggled drug, in the first instance, and the flag was flown by
a drug smuggler in the second. It was the most protractedly sordid
episode in British Imperial history; and it was also an intimation
that where revenue was involved, a government could be just as
grasping, and just as unscrupulous, as any entrepreneur. Governments
have since often thundered out denunciations of the men who manufacture
and sell opium and heroin. It was a Government which taught them
how.

<H2>Indian Hemp</H2></CENTER>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Hemp drugs; the legends</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THE LONG STRUGGLE TO END THE OPIUM TRAFFIC FROM INDIA TO China
had one curious and revealing by-product. When the Government
was compelled by the vote in the House of Commons to concede a
Royal Commission into opium, there was an immediate protest: why
single out opium when there were other drugs in common use in
India? For many years, the opium lobby had contended that hemp
was the more dangerous of the two. In 1840 the banker W. B. Baring
had told the Commons that if the traffic were suppressed, it might
simply lead to the adoption in the Far East of drugs 'infinitely
more prejudicial to physical health and energy than opium', citing
as an example 'an exhalation of the hemp plant, easily collected
at certain seasons, which was in every way more injurious than
the use of the poppy'. Reminded of hemp's existence, the Government
decided on what appears to have been a diversionary tactic. On
March 2nd, 1893 the Member of Parliament for Bradford East, W.
S. Caine&#151;a persistent antidrug campaigner&#151;asked for an enquiry
into the use of hemp drugs in India; and the Under Secretary of
State for India was able to assure him that the Viceroy was setting
it up, and would be glad if the results 'show that further restriction
can be placed upon the sale and consumption of these drugs'. 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was a mass of evidence available about their effects, but
little of it which could be described as scientific, apart from
some experiments conducted in the 1840s by Dr. W. B. O'Shaughnessy,
Professor of Chemistry in the Medical College of Calcutta. He
had begun with animals, finding that they reacted in much the
same way as humans. A middling-sized dog, given ten grains of
hemp, 'became stupid and sleepy, dozing at intervals, starting
up, wagging his tail, as if extremely contented; he ate some food
greedily; on being called to, he staggered to and fro, and his
face assumed a look of utter and helpless drunkenness. These symptoms
lasted about two hours, and then gradually passed away.' Finding
that no harm came to the animals, O'Shaughnessy next tried the
drugs on patients suffering from disorders for which there was
no effective remedy&#151;rheumatism, tetanus, cholera, convulsions&#151;with
 results which led him to claim in the <I>Transactions</I>
of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta that 'in hemp,
the profession has gained an anti-convulsive remedy of the greatest
value'. With hemp, though, as with coca, it was difficult to make
up pills or potions which were of consistent purity and strength;
and the essential drug element in the plant eluded researchers.
It remained in general use in medicine in India, particularly
at the village level; but it did not elsewhere establish the reputation
O'Shaughnessy expected.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In Britain, the drug&#151;hashish, as it was loosely described&#151;tended
to be thought of as sinister; not on the basis of experience or
experiment, but because of the reputation it had derived from
legends. One had come down from Marco Polo, who had heard it on
his voyage to China in the thirteenth century. The 'Old Man of
the Mountain', he was told, had desired that his people should
believe that a valley which he had enclosed, and made into a garden,
was Paradise; 'so he had fashioned it after the description that
Mahomet gave of his Paradise, to wit, that it should be a beautiful
garden running with conduits of wine and milk and honey and water,
and full of lovely women for the delectation of all its inmates'.
A selected youth would be given a drug to put him to sleep, and
carried into the valley, so that when he woke up he would find
himself, as he thought, in Paradise, and would enjoy its sybaritic
delights. He would then again be put to sleep, and transported
back out of the valley, 'whereat he was not over well pleased'.
All he had to do if he wished to return, the Old Man of the Mountain
would tell him, was to perform the service required of him: 'go
thou and slay so-and-so; and when thou returnest, my angels shall
bear thee into Paradise. And shouldst thou die, nevertheless even
so will I send my angels to carry thee back into Paradise.' So
great was the desire to get back that the initiates would face
any peril to do so; 'and in this manner the Old One got his people
to murder any one whom he would get rid of'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In Marco Polo's account, therefore, the drug featured only as
a way to enable the Old Man of the Mountain to transport the youths
to and from the valley. But the legend became embroidered in the
telling; the drug used to put the youths to sleep was given a
very different role. The murderers used it&#151;the story ran&#151;to
nerve themselves to carry out the Old Man's commands. When, early
in the nineteenth century, the French etymologist Sylvestre de
Sacy identified hashish, the drug, with <I>haschishin</I>&#151;assassin&#151;this
 was taken to be conclusive evidence that the members of the
Order of Assassins had derived their name from the drug they took
before committing their atrocious crimes. And the idea that hashish
could be taken for this purpose appeared to be confirmed when
it was learned that the 'whirling dervishes' used it, and when
Livingstone reported that the 'pernicious weed' was used by African
tribes to help them work themselves up into 'a species of frenzy'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was difficult, though, to reconcile the effects of the drug
in the legend, with the effects of the drug as actually observed
in most of the countries of the Middle and Near East, where it
was in common use. The drinks which the Arabs made from the hemp
plant, the French traveller C. S. Sonnini noted on his tour in
the late eighteenth century,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
throw them into a sort of pleasing inebriety, a state of reverie
that inspires gaiety and occasions agreeable dreams. This kind
of annihilation of the faculty of thinking, this kind of slumber
of the soul, bears no resemblance to the intoxication produced
by wine or strong liquors, and the French language affords no
terms by which it can be expressed. The Arabs give the name of
kid to this voluptuous vacuity of mind, this sort of fascinating
stupor.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Most observers echoed Sonnini; but this did not do much to redeem
the reputation of the drug. To the English, as they entered upon
the Victorian era, it was no recommendation to say that hashish
induced 'voluptuous vacuity', the secondary reputation it now
began to acquire&#151;nourished, doubtless, by Dumas's account of
its effects on the Baron Franz d'Epinay, in <I>The Count of Monte
Christo</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
. . . there followed a dream of passion like that promised by
the Prophet to the elect. Lips of stone turned to flame, breasts
of ice became like heated lava, so that to Franz, yielding for
the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a sorrow and
voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to his
thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces. The
more he strove against this unhallowed passion, the more his senses
yielded to the thrall, and at length, weary of the struggle that
taxed his very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and
exhausted beneath the enchantment of his marvellous dream.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The translators of <I>The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night</I>
confirmed the reputation of hashish, not simply as a drug by which
husbands could be put to sleep so that lovers could enjoy their
wives, but also as an aphrodisiac&#151;as illustrated in the translation
by Sir Richard Burton in the story of the lover who was about
to consummate his design when he woke up to find that it was all
a hashish-induced dream, and that he was surrounded by a crowd
of people laughing at him, 'for his prickle was at point and the
napkin had slipped from his middle'. The versions which circulated
in England might omit or bowdlerise such episodes, but the reputation
of hashish spread by hearsay, leaving the impression that even
if some doubt might remain about what precisely its effects were,
they were certainly deplorable.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Perhaps because of this reputation, the British Raj tended to
be more suspicious of Indian hemp drugs, as they were described
there, than of opium. They had been subjected to an enquiry on
more than one occasion in the past, the latest investigation having
been conducted as recently as the 1870s. Its report had claimed
that hemp drugs were less dangerous than their reputation suggested,
and that in any case prohibition was impracticable. The Liberal
Government decided to ignore these inconvenient findings, and
set up a fresh enquiry.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The members of the Commission were appointed in July 1893, under
the Chairmanship of the Hon. W. Mackworth Young, first Financial
Commissioner for the Punjab. Their terms of reference indicated
what was expected of them. They were to examine the trade in hemp
drugs; its effect on the social and moral condition of the people;
and 'the desirability of prohibiting the growth of the plant'.
The Commission was composed of three British colonial officials,
three 'native non-official gentlemen', and a Secretary, H. J.
McIntosh&#151;to whom much of the credit for the eventual report
was probably due.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Hemp drugs: enquiry</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Commission had been warned that it might have difficulty in
finding witnesses willing to come forward and tell what they knew
about the use and abuse of hemp drugs. No such difficulty was
experienced. Civil servants, army officers, magistrates, doctors,
lawyers, and business men filled in the questionnaire which was
circulated, and a gratifying number of them agreed to give verbal
evidence in amplification. One group only, the Commission was
surprised to find, appeared reluctant to offer their services.
A significant proportion of the missionaries who were sent the
questionnaire returned it without their answers. Their common
excuse was that they did not have a sufficient knowledge of the
matter. This was in striking contrast to the attitude of the missionaries
to opium, particularly in China, where they had been in the forefront
of the agitation to suppress the traffic. Why&#151;the Commissioners
wondered&#151;should the Indian missionary show such little concern?
Pondering that question, they picked up an early clue. If the
missionaries, of all people, disclaimed knowledge of the effect
of hemp drugs, the drugs could hardly be a very serious threat
to the social and moral condition of the Indian people.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The terms of reference had referred to 'drugs' in the plural;
and the Comrnissioners' first task was to try to sort them out&#151;which
was not easy. There was <I>ganja,</I> made from the dried flowering
tops of cultivated plants; <I>charas,</I> the resinous matter
scraped off them; and <I>bhang,</I> the dried leaves. But as Watt
had just pointed out in his study of Indian plants, and as witnesses
were to confirm, the distinctions in practice had little meaning.
One man's <I>charas</I> was another man's <I>ganja,</I> and the
drink made out of either was commonly called <I>bhang.</I> The
Commissioners heard witnesses who assured them that smoking bhang
was more dangerous than smoking ganja; 'but there are many others
whose experience is precisely the reverse'. Some witnesses thought
smoking less harmful than drinking; 'but there is a great deal
of evidence to a precisely opposite effect'. In the end the Commission
cautiously accepted the common opinion that the flowers and resin
might produce a more powerful drug than the leaves, but for the
purposes of its enquiry it seemed simpler to take them together
under the general label, hemp drugs.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
How extensively&#151;the Commissioners next had to consider&#151;were
hemp drugs consumed? Putting this question to witnesses revealed
just how sparse the information was on the subject, even among
those whose duties were 'believed to bring them into close and
constant contact with the people'. It was possible to make a tentative
estimate of the minimum quantity of <I>ganja</I> and <I>charas</I>
used, because a duty was payable on the manufactured product;
but it could safely be assumed that far more was used illicitly.
As for <I>bhang,</I> made from the leaves, much of it came from
the wild hemp plant, and there was no way of telling how much
of it was smoked, eaten and drunk, except observation&#151;and observation,
the Commissioners found, was a highly unreliable guide. Men who
offered themselves as knowledgeable witnesses might turn out to
be relying on hearsay; and those who claimed to have observed
their use and effects had often derived their information only
from visits to shops and shrines where smokers congregated&#151;the
equivalent, the Commissioners felt, of a man claiming to be knowledgeable
about the use and effects of alcohol in England, who had derived
all his knowledge from visits to pubs.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
From the evidence, however, one thing was obvious; that hemp drugs
were far more extensively used than the average British, or even
Indian, official realised. They were taken as medicine, not only
for specific disorders, on prescription, but as tonics, and aids
to digestion. Drunk with meals, bhang was the equivalent of the
English labouring man's glass of beer. They were also generally
taken among the Hindus on family party occasions, and in connection
with religious observances&#151;particularly those linked with Shiva
who, according to legend, had greatly appreciated the effects
of hemp. But by far the commonest use was by workers to give them
staying power. 'Gymnasts, wrestlers and musicians, palkibearers
and porters, divers and postal runners are examples of the classes
who use the hemp drugs on occasions of especially severe exertion
. . . all classes of labourers, especially such as blacksmiths,
miners and coolies, are said more or less generally to use the
drugs, as a rule in moderation, to alleviate fatigue.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
A medicine; an aid to endurance; a drink on family or religious
occasions: in none of these capacities, the Commissioners felt,
could the effects of hemp drugs be regarded as menacing. Even
when used as an intoxicant, its consequences generally appeared
innocuous&#151;where they could be assessed: the <I>Report</I> quoted
an unnamed writer as saying, 'the action of hemp on a man is so
various that when we read the several descriptions given, differing
so widely, we would scarcely suppose we were considering the same
agent'. In so far as they could be summarised, though, the immediate
effect of a hemp drug was
<BLOCKQUOTE>
refreshing and stimulating, and alleviates fatigue, giving rise
to pleasurable sensations all over the nervous system, so that
the consumer is 'at peace with everybody'&#151;in a grand waking
dream. He is able to concentrate his thoughts on one subject;
it affords him pleasure, vigour, ready wit, capacity for hard
work, and sharpness for business; it has a quieting effect on
the nervous system and removes restlessness and induces forgetfulness
of mental troubles; all sorts of grotesque ideas rapidly pass
through the mind, with a tendency to talk; it brightens the eyes
and, like a good cigar, gives content.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In young men, too, it might give rise to sensual thoughts. But
considering the drugs were so widely used, there was no evidence
to justify their ugly reputation. How had it spread? The reason,
the Commissioners decided, was because the drugs had no observable
effects when they were taken in moderation. Even those witnesses
who most disapproved of them had had no conception just how extensive
that consumption was. It was only the rare examples of immoderate
use that were seen by doctor or magistrate; 'the ruin wrought
in certain cases by excess has alone attracted their notice. They
feel towards drugs as a man feels towards alcohol, whose experience
has been mainly gained among the social wrecks of the lowest parts
of a great city.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The evidence obtained from replies to the questionnaires revealed
that the proportion of men who took hemp drugs immoderately must
be very small. It was nevertheless desirable, the Commissioners
decided, to investigate the allegations that had been made about
their effects on this minority; in particular, that the drugs
were responsible for much of the insanity in India, and for much
of the crime.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Hemp drugs and insanity</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was no shortage of witnesses to testify to the way hemp
drugs caused insanity; a few even expressed the view that to reopen
this particular line of enquiry was stupid, implying 'wilful blindness
to what has been abundantly proved'. And so the evidence at first
suggested. Statistics sent in from mental hospitals all over India
showed that for years, hemp drugs had been one of the chief causes
of mental breakdown. The foremost expert on the subject, Surgeon
Lt. Col. Crombie, had already shown in an article in the <I>Indian
Medical Gazette</I> that a third of the inmates of the Dacca hospital
of which he had been Superintendent had smoked <I>ganja;</I> and
in a very large proportion of cases, he believed, it had been
'the actual and immediate cause of their insanity'. The 1871 Commission,
which in other respects had tended to play down the danger of
the drugs, had accepted that their habitual use did tend to produce
insanity; and the Government of Burma had just put a ban on hemp
drugs largely for that reason.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There was no reason to doubt the validity of the statistical evidence;
nor was it challenged. Nevertheless the Commissioners decided
that it ought to be checked. Taking the last year for which full
statistics were complete, they ordered a re-examination of the
records of every patient admitted to a mental hospital in India,
where that admission had been attributed to hemp drugs, in order
'to ascertain how far the statistics were reasonably correct,
and, if possible, also to arrive at some conclusion as to whether
hemp drugs have any real connection with insanity'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The first discovery the check provided was that what was entered
in the asylum records of admission as the 'cause' of insanity
was not derived from a diagnosis made at the asylum. It was simply
taken down by a clerk from the description given by the policeman
or whoever was responsible for bringing the patient to the asylum,
at the time. Examining magistrates, whose duty it was to check
the admissions book, insisted that some specific cause should
be shown; and it had become standard procedure&#151;Major Willcocks,
of the Agra asylum, admitted&#151;to enter 'hemp drugs' as the cause,
wherever it was found that the patients took them; 'I cannot say
precisely why it has come down as the traditional practice.' He
had seen no reason to worry about the attribution, he explained,
as he had assumed the drugs were poisonous; 'my ordinary medical
practice did not bring me into contact with them at all. I only
came into contact with them in the asylum. I had no idea they
were used so extensively as I find on enquiry to be the case.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Of all the asylum superintendents, only three claimed responsibility
for the diagnosis entered in the admission books&#151;one of them
being the acknowledged authority, Surgeon Crombie. But when they
examined the admissions book for the Dacca asylum in the last
full year when he had been superintendent there, the Commissioners
found that it did not bear out his claim. In Dacca, as elsewhere,
the entries had been based on whatever explanation had been given
by the people who brought the man to the asylum. The Commission
therefore decided to check each individual patient's record. In
nine out of the fourteen cases of insanity attributed to hemp
drugs that year, and accepted as such by Crombie, the check showed
that hemp drugs could not have been responsible, as Crombie himself,
confronted with the results, had to admit. The idea which he had
publicised from his original figures&#151;that hemp drugs were responsible
for a third of the insanity cases in asylums in India&#151;had therefore
to be revised; the proportion was fewer than one in ten. Crombie
had apparently formed the view, the Commission observed, that
his experience had given his evidence about the danger of hemp
drugs a special value. This view had not been borne out by their
enquiry. Charitably, however, they ascribed his lapse to 'a mistake
of memory'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
When the follow-up was complete, it was found that insanity could
be related to hemp drugs in only forty cases from the whole of
India, in the year chosen&#151;less than seven per cent of admissions;
and even then, there was usually another possible cause. And 'cause',
the <I>Report</I> added, was a risky term to apply; 'intemperance
of any kind may sometimes be not the cause of insanity, but an
early manifestation of mental instability'. In such cases, over-indulgence
in hemp drugs could be regarded not as a cause but as a symptom
of some underlying predisposition to insanity.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Here, then, was evidence given by expert witnesses, accepted for
years, used as the justification for campaigns in other countries
to ban hemp drugs&#151;in the case of Burma being accepted as responsible
for the success of such a campaign&#151;now shown to be worthless.
How had the mistake been made ? The explanation, the Commissioners
decided, was simple. There was a natural tendency to look for,
and blame, a specific physical cause. Hemp drugs had been an obvious
choice, because as intoxicants they could sometimes produce symptoms
similar to those of insanity.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This popular idea has been greatly strengthened by the attitude
taken up by asylum superintendents. They have known nothing of
the effects of the drugs at all, though the consumption is so
extensive, except that cases of insanity have been brought to
them attributed with apparent authority to hemp drugs. They have
generalised from this limited and one-sided experience. They have
concluded that hemp drugs produce insanity in every case, or in
the great majority of cases, of consumption. They have accordingly
without sufficient enquiry assisted, by the statistics they have
supplied, and by the opinions they have expressed, in stereotyping
the popular opinion and giving it authority and permanence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Hemp drugs and crime</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There remained the other charge to be considered: that hemp drugs
bred crime. They did so, witnesses assured the Commission, in
three ways: by driving men to steal so that they could afford
to buy the drug; by releasing criminal instincts; or by destroying
a man's self-control, so that he 'ran amok'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Hemp drugs users, some witnesses explained, progressed inexorably
from moderation to excess; excess made them too lazy to earn their
living; and when addicted, they had to steal to maintain their
supply. The Commissioners were unimpressed. The evidence they
had collected had established that of the vast number of hemp
drug users, only a tiny proportion used them immoderately. How,
then, could it be claimed that the slide from moderation to addiction
was inexorable? As for releasing criminal instincts, hemp drugs
appeared to have precisely the opposite effect; they 'tended to
make a man timid, and unlikely to commit a crime'. But the idea
that the drugs could cause men to run amok was not so easy to
dispose of, based as it was on common knowledge.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Witness after witness confirmed its truth. R. D. Lyall, with over
thirty years of varied experience as an official and as a magistrate
in India, told the Commission about the cases of such temporary
homicidal frenzy, which he had personally had to deal with. So
did W. C. Taylor, a veteran of almost half a century's experience
of Bengal. Surgeon Crombie treated the Commission to a description
of how a Bengali babu, 'as the result of a single debauch, in
an attack of <I>ganja</I> mania slew seven of his nearest relatives
in bed during the night'. And an Assam tea planter described another
such ganja-induced frenzy which he had good reason to remember
vividly, as it had happened on his own estate.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Again, the Commissioners decided to check the information, and
asked the witnesses to provide the relevant records or references.
Some immediately admitted that their information had been at second-hand,
and could not be checked. Others promised to send along the details,
from newspaper files; and then could not find them. R. D. Lyall
was unable to trace a single case of those he had had to deal
with; and the only one which W. C. Taylor was able to recall of
the 'numerous cases' he had claimed to have been concerned with,
turned out when checked to have had no connection with hemp drugs.
An investigation of the records about Crombie's babu disclosed
that he had indeed been taking ganja, but he had also been taking
opium; that he had a history of insanity before drugs were implicated;
and that he had not been on a debauch before the murder, which
had been committed in a state of 'mere insane despair'. And when
the records of the case which the Assam tea planter had described
were re-examined, it was found that his account to the Commission
differed materially from the one he had given at the time; not
least in that he had made no mention, at the time, of <I>ganja.</I>
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In the end, the Commission were able to find only twenty-three
cases of homicidal mania which it was possible to check; and in
eighteen of them there was nothing to suggest that hemp drugs
had been responsible. 'It is astonishing', the <I>Report</I> commented,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to find how defective and misleading are the recollections which
many witnesses retain even of cases with which they have had special
opportunities of being well-acquainted. It is instructive to see
how preconceived notions based on rumour and tradition tend to
preserve the impression of certain particulars, while the impressions
of far more important features of the case are completely forgotten
. . . the failure must tend to increase the distrust with which
similar evidence, which there has been no opportunity of testing,
has been received.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Hemp drugs: verdict</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The <I>Report</I> concluded with the Commission's verdict on the
issue which they had been brought together to consider: should
hemp drugs be banned, in India, as they were in Burma? The answer
was an emphatic no. The drugs were not a serious hazard&#151;except
for a tiny majority of the idle and dissolute whose excessive
consumption endangered only themselves. Banning them would be
politically dangerous, because it would constitute an unpopular
interference with Hindu religious and family observances. In any
case, prohibition would be unworkable&#151;for reasons which Watt
had just pointed out; it would be impracticable to hold a man
responsible for the existence of a wild plant growing near his
hut, 'and it would be impossible to prohibit him from gathering,
from such a plant, the daily quota used by him and his family'.
And even if prohibition could be enforced, it would lead only
to the increased consumption of more dangerous drugs, opium and
alcohol. Why&#151;a Madras missionary had asked&#151;should the Government
of India be concerned about hemp, rather than about 'the widespread
and rapidly increasing and much more injurious habit of alcoholic
drink?' Other witnesses had suggested an answer: it was a plot
on the part of the liquor manufacturers. Graphs of sales figures,
the Commission found, lent confirmation to the view that consumption
of the hemp drugs and of alcohol were intermeshed. If hemp drugs
ceased to be so readily available, the sales of alcoholic liquor
could be expected to rise.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Summing up, the Commissioners in their <I>Report</I> could claim
that they had carefully examined the physical, mental and moral
effects of hemp drugs used in moderation, and that no observable
adverse effects had been discoverable. There was no evidence that
hemp drugs were habit-forming, in the way alcohol and opium were.
A man who consumed the drugs even in moderation might feel uneasiness,
or even a sensation of longing, if deprived of them. But that
was not in itself a reason for depriving him of them&#151;any more
than it would be in the case of tobacco.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The <I>Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission</I> was later
to be rescued from oblivion by the campaigners against the prohibition
of cannabis in America and Britain, in the 1960s; but its verdict
on that drug of 'not guilty' is of less importance than its analysis
of the remarkable irrelevance of accepted opinions about a drug,
even when they are supported by men who are supposedly experts
on the subject. Surgeon Crombie was a notable example of the kind
of man who has so often helped to translate public preconceptions
and prejudices on to Statute Books by lending the weight of his
authority to them, when in fact he has never bothered to examine
the evidence in front of him, in his job; he has simply rationalised
it to fit those preconceptions and prejudices.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By painstakingly going behind such opinions, and scrupulously
checking the records, the Commission were able to acquit hemp
drugs of the charges laid against them&#151;as they were used in
India. It does not follow that a similarly honest committee would
have come to the same conclusion in, say, the Cameroons, where
German officers in the 1880s reported that they found hemp being
taken for its 'stimulating effect on the nervous system, so that
it is highly valued on long tiring marches, on lengthy canoe voyages,
and on difficult night watches'&#151;where, in other words, it was
being used for the same purpose as coca in Peru, or opium in Formosa.
And Livingstone may perhaps have been right when he reported that
certain tribes in Africa took it to work themselves up into a
suitable state of frenzy before going into battle&#151;though this
is more doubtful, because his description of the process suggests
that they may have been taking it to calm their nerves. Indian
hemp drugs were taken for very different purposes, in different
parts of the world; and they appear to have performed whatever
service was expected of them.

<H2>The Poet's Eye</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
DRUGS DID NOT SIMPLY SATISFY EXPECTATION; ON OCCASION, THEY could
nourish it. In the 1790s Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who had been
prescribed laudanum&#151;opium in an alcohol solution&#151;for the relief
of pain, found that it altered his perception; it could give him
optical illusions&#151;about distances, say:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The poet's eye in his tipsy hour<BR>
Has a magnifying power<BR>
Or rather, the soul emancipates the eyes<BR>
Of the accidents of size
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Laudanum could also start reveries in which his imagination appeared
to carry him away, as if in a dream, but leaving him with sufficient
consciousness to be able to direct, to some extent, the course
they were taking. In one of them, he composed <I>Kubla Khan.</I>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Laudanum and laughing gas</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Why comparable experiences had not been familiar before, remains
a mystery. Opium had been used in Europe since medieval times;
chiefly as a sedative, but doctors had come to realise that its
effects could vary greatly. 'It causes sleeping, and watching'&#151;Dr.
John Jones wrote, in a treatise published at the beginning of
the eighteenth century&#151;'stupidity and promptitude in business,
cloudiness and serenity of mind. It excites the spirits, and yet
quiets them; it relaxes, and weakens, yet it enables us to undergo
labours, journeys, etc.; it causes a furious madness, yet composes
the spirits above all things.' But its vision-inducing potential
was not grasped until Coleridge's experience, and not generally
known until the publication in 1822 of Thomas de Quincey's <I>Confessions
of an English Opium Eater,</I> with his description of what happened
when he first took laudanum&#151;tincture of opium in alcohol&#151;
for rheumatic pains in the head:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
in an hour, O heavens! What a revulsion! what a resurrection,
from its lowest depths of the inner spirit ! What an apocalypse
of the world within me! That my pains had vanished was now a trifle
in my eyes; this negative effect was swallowed up in the immensity
of those positive effects which had opened up before me, in the
abyss of divine enjoyment thus suddenly revealed. Here was a panacea
. . . here was the secret of happiness, about which philosophers
had disputed for so many ages, at once discovered; happiness might
now be bought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat pocket;
portable ecstasies might be had corked up in a pint bottle; and
peace of mind could be sent down by the mail.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Agony of mind was soon to follow&#151;as Jones had warned; 'great
and even intolerable distresses, anxieties and depression of spirits'.
So intolerable were the withdrawal symptoms that many respected
citizens who had begun to take opium as Coleridge and de Quincey
had done, for the relief of pain, were unable to break the habit.
Some, laudanum destroyed; others, like William Wilberforce and
Wilkie Collins, managed to come to terms with it, taking large
but not increasing doses. But laudanum did not provide them with
visions. It merely kept the distresses, anxieties and depressions
at bay.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Might there not be other drugs, though, which could expand an
artist's horizon, without enslaving him? Shortly before the turn
of the century Humphry Davy, the discoverer of nitrous oxide,
found that 'sniffing' gave him a feeling of ecstasy; 'nothing
exists but thought' he told himself as he awoke; 'The universe
is composed of impressions, ideas, pleasures and pains!'. Soon,
'the laughing gas' and ether were being dispensed at 'frolics',
which became a popular pastime. In parts of Ulster, ether became
so popular that its consumption took on the proportions of an
epidemic, whose consequences were entertainingly described by
K. H. Connell in his <I>Irish Peasant Society,</I> from contemporary
accounts. The atmosphere of some towns 'was &quot;loaded&quot;
with ether. Hundreds of yards outside Draperstown, a visiting
surgeon detected the familiar smell; market days smelt &quot;not
of pigs, tobacco smoke or of unwashed human beings&quot;; even
the bank &quot;stove&quot; of ether, and its reek on the Derry
Central Railway was &quot;disgusting and abominable&quot;.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The Ulstermen appear to have been using ether as a cheap alternative
to alcohol; a tablespoonful&#151;enough on which to get pleasantly,
though briefly, inebriated&#151;cost one penny. But some people used
it as a vision-inducer. 'You always heard music, and you'd be
cocking your ears at it', as an ether-taker put it; or you would
'see men climbing up the walls and going through the roof, or
coming in through the roof and down the walls, nice and easy'.
What a man experienced after taking it was limited, apparently,
by his capacity for experience. As De Quincey put it, if a man
took opium whose talk was of oxen, he would dream about oxen&#151;'if
he were not too dull to dream'. For a few individuals, though,
ether or laughing gas provided sensations which they would treasure
throughout their lives. In his <I>Varieties of Religious Experience,</I>
William James was to recall how they could 'stimulate the mystical
consciousness to an extraordinary degree', and though the truths
might fade, 'the sense of a profound meaning having been there
persists'.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>The forbidden game</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The gases, however, could be dangerous in inexperienced hands;
and many experimenters could get little but hilarity out of them.
An alternative possibility as vision-inducer was Indian hemp,
introduced into France by the men of Napoleon's army of the Nile,
and taken up for experimental purposes in the 1840s by Jacques
Moreau, a Parisian doctor who thought it might help in the treatment
of patients suffering from mental illness. Trying it out on himself,
he found it put him into paroxysms of uncontrollable laughter,
and then gave him visions of an entirely pleasurable kind. 'It
is really happiness which is produced', he wrote,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
and by this I mean an enjoyment entirely moral, and by no means
sensual, as might be supposed&#151;a very curious circumstance, from
which some remarkable inferences might be drawn . . . for the
hashish eater is happy, not like the gourmand or the famished
man when satisfying his appetite, or the voluptuary in the gratification
of his amative desires&#151;but like him who hears tidings which
fill him with joy, or like the miser counting his treasures, the
gambler who is successful at play, or the ambitious man who is
intoxicated with success.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Dr. Moreau shared the delights of his discovery with the members
of the <I>Club des Hachichins,</I> founded in 1844, Dumas, Gautier
and Baudelaire being among its members. Gautier described his
reactions to the drug two years later in the <I>Revue de deux
mondes:</I> 'frenetic, irresistible, implacable laughter' succeeded
by grotesque hallucinations, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
fantasies of droll dreams confusedly danced about; hybrid creations,
formless mixtures of men, beasts and utensils; monks with wheels
for feet and cauldrons for bellies: warriors, in armours of dishes,
brandishing wooden swords in birds' claws; statesmen moved by
turnspit gears; kings plunged to the waist in salt-cellar turrets
. . .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Baudelaire's account was more clinical. People trying hashish
for the first time, he observed, would complain that it had little
effect, which might be attributed to their resistance. But it
would suddenly hit them with 'a sort of irrelevant and irresistible
hilarity . . . as painful as a tickle'. Occasionally this led
on to weakness and stupor, but for some people, 'a new subtlety
or acuity manifests itself in all the senses', and this was when
hallucinations set in. 'External objects acquire, gradually and
one after another, strange new appearances; they become distorted
or transformed. Next occur mistakes in the identity of objects,
and transposals of ideas. Sounds clothe themselves in colours;
and colours contain music.' 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Such experiences could be very satisfying; 'the universality of
all existence arrays itself before you in a new and hitherto unguessed
at glory'. But in the end, for Baudelaire, they were regressive
in their effects. The hashish-eater, he decided, 'completely confounds
dream with action, his imagination kindling more and more at the
spectacle of his own nature corrected and idealised, he substitutes
this fascinating image of himself for his real individuality&#151;so
poor in strength of will, and so rich in vanity'. And,

the morrow! the terrible morrow! All the body's organs lax and
weary, nerves unstrung, itching desires to weep, the impossibility
of applying oneself steadily to any task&#151;all these cruelly teach
you that you have played a forbidden game . . . The especial victim
is the will, that most precious of the faculties. It is said,
and it is almost true, that hashish has no evil physical effects;
or, at worst, no serious ones. But can it be said that a man incapable
of action, good only for dreaming, is truly well, even though
all his members may be in their normal condition ?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Other experimenters with hashish were to reach a similar conclusion;
among them the American Fitzhugh Ludlow&#151;though he stressed that
it was not the drug, but man's reliance on it, that caused the
problems: 'the soul withers and shrinks from its growth towards
the true end of its being beneath the dominance of any sensual
indulgence', so that though the bondage might continue to be golden,
there was all the while erosion of strength. 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Not all the devotees of hashish experienced Baudelaire's 'terrible
morrow'. A few were able to smoke it and examine its effects as
dispassionately as they might have examined the effects of tobacco;
among them the young Charles Richet, later to be a Professor of
Physiology in Paris, and a Nobel prizewinner. Richet observed,
as others had done, that for anybody under the influence of hashish,
time could appear to stand still&#151;or at least to pass more gradually;
and in 1877 he presented a plausible explanation. Man's mind,
he pointed out, is full of indetermined and incomplete ideas,
intertwined. Disentangling them took time; and 'as time is only
measured by the remembrance of ideas, it appears prodigiously
long'. What hashish did was speed up the process:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
in the space of a minute we have fifty different thoughts; since
in general it requires several minutes to have fifty different
thoughts, it will appear to us that several minutes are passed,
and it is only by going to the inflexible clock, which marks for
us the regular passage of time, that we perceive our error. With
hashish the notion of time is completely overthrown, the moments
are years, and the minutes are centuries; but I feel the insufficiency
of language to express this illusion, and I believe, that one
can only understand it by feeling it for himself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But such detachment was rare among the members of the <I>Club
des Hachichins</I> and their successors; and they had given hashish
a reputation as a vision-inducer which experience, for the majority
of people who tried it, failed to justify. It had been the atmosphere
of the <I>Club des Hachichins,</I> and the personalities of its
members, which had lent Indian hemp its potency, rather than any
quality in the drug.

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
THE INVESTIGATIONS OF MEN SUCH AS MOREAU AND O'SHAUGHNESSY reflected
a growing interest in pharmacology during the century, stemming
from the results of the research of Davy, Priestley and Lavoisier,
towards the end of the century before. Their discoveries had begun
to elevate chemistry to the status of an exact science; and pharmacologists
had naturally begun to look forward to the day when their branch
of the faculty would share in the distinction.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
For a while it looked as if their ambition was going to be realised.
One by one, plant drugs began to deliver up their secrets&#151;the
alkalis which, it was assumed, constituted the essential drug
element. Morphine was derived from opium in 1803, and other similar
discoveries followed: caffeine, quinine, nicotine. More reliable
evidence began to be available, too, about the purposes for which
drugs were used throughout the world; and it became possible to
investigate the subject not, as before, primarily from the standpoint
of the botanist or the chemist, but with a view to assessing the
role of drugs in society. And the first serious attempt at a general
survey was made by James Johnston in his <I>Chemistry of Common
Life,</I> which was published in 1854.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>James Johnston</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Johnston, who was Professor of Chemistry at the University of
Durham, had the breadth of outlook of a Benjamin Franklin or a
Humphry Davy; he was interested in chemistry not for its own sake,
but for what it provided for mankind. He was not thinking in terms
simply of the chemical processes by which bread, or wine, were
provided, but of what gave bread its flavour, and wine its bouquet.
How significant he felt drugs were can be gauged by the fact that
he devoted almost half the book to them; a chapter each to tea
and coffee; two chapters to alcoholic liquors; and no fewer than
eight chapters to 'the narcotics we indulge in', ranging from
tobacco to deadly nightshade.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Johnston was disturbed by what he felt was the irrational prejudice
against the use of narcotics of any kind, reflected in the efforts
that had been made in countries all over the world to suppress
them. It was absurd, he argued, to think of them as strange and
sinister, considering the vast number of people who regularly
took them. Precise estimates of the number of drug-takers were
impossible to come by; but tobacco, he estimated, was used by
800 million people; opium by 400 million; Indian hemp by 200 300
million; betel by 100 million; and coca by 10 million.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No nation so ancient but had its narcotic soother from the most
distant times; none so remote and isolated but has found within
its own borders a pain-allayer and care-dispeller of native growth;
none so savage which instinct has not led to seek for, and successfully
to employ, this form of physiological indulgence. The craving
for such indulgence, and the habit of gratifying it, are little
less universal than the desire for, and the practice of, consuming
the necessary materials of our common food.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Nor was it any more reprehensible; on the contrary, Johnston argued,
man's recognition of the value of narcotics should be considered
as forming 'one of the most wonderful chapters in his entire history'.
In the first of the three stages of that history, man had found
how to provide for his material needs&#151;'beef and bread'. In the
second, he had sought ways to 'assuage the cares of his mind and
banish uneasy reflections', which he did with the help of alcoholic
beverages. And in the third, his object was
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to multiply his enjoyments, intellectual and animal, and for the
time to exalt them. This he attains by the aid of narcotics. And
of these narcotics, again, it is remarkable that almost every
country or tribe has its own, either aboriginal or imported; so
that the universal instinct of the race has led, somehow or other,
to the universal supply of this want or craving also.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Johnston cited tea and coffee as examples. Tea, in particular,
could be a dangerous drug; 'green tea, when taken very strong,
acts very powerfully on some constitutions producing nervous tremblings
and other distressing symptoms, acting as a narcotic, and in inferior
animals even producing paralysis'. But men had learned to use
it more discreetly, so that 'it exhilarates without sensibly intoxicating'.
Even the poorest took it, preferring the 'luxury' of a cup of
tea to an extra potato or a larger loaf&#151;a choice which Johnston
wholeheartedly approved; 'he will probably live as long under
the one regimen as the other; and while he does live, he will
both be less miserable in mind, and will show more blood and spirit
in the face of difficulties, than if he had denied himself this
trifling indulgence'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was not the chemical properties of the plant&#151;Johnston argued&#151;but
the uses to which man put it, that mattered; a point which comes
across even more forcibly when his book is read today, as many
of the plants which he included are no longer considered to be
drugs. The English beer drinker esteems hops for imparting flavour;
to Johnston, the hop was 'the English narcotic', justly celebrated
as a sleep inducer, and 'unquestionably one of the sources of
the pleasing excitement, gentle narcotic intoxication, and healthy
tonic action which well-hopped beer is known to produce on those
whose constitutions enable them to drink it'. Even more surprising
is Johnston's description of lettuce.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The juice of these plants, when collected and dried, has considerable
resemblance to opium. If the stem of the common lettuce, when
it is coming into flower, be wounded with a knife, a milky juice
exudes. In the open air, this juice gradually assumes a brown
colour, and dries into a friable mass. The smell of this dried
juice is strongly narcotic, recalling that of opium. It has a
slightly pungent taste but, like opium, leaves a permanent bitterness
in the mouth. It acts upon the brain after the manner of opium
. . . eaten at night, the lettuce causes sleep; eaten during the
day, it soothes and calms and allays the tendency to nervous irritability.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
There are other reminders in the <I>Chemistry of Common Life</I>
that the classification of what is, and what is not, a plant drug
may vary from country to country, and from period to period. But
even more significant, in the light of what was to happen later,
was Johnston's realisation that drugs could not be classified
by their observed pharmacological action on man, because that
action varied so greatly. Moslems, for example, took tobacco because
it soothed the mind to sleep, while leaving the body alert and
active. But,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
that such is not its general action in Europe, the study of almost
every German writer can testify. With the constant pipe diffusing
its beloved aroma around him, the German philosopher works out
the profoundest of his results of thought. He thinks and dreams,
and dreams and thinks, alternately; but while his body is soothed
and stilled, his mind is ever awake. From what I have heard such
men say, I could almost fancy that they had in this practice discovered
a way of liberating the mind from the trammels of the body, and
thus giving it a freer range and more undisturbed liberty of action.
I regret that I have never found it act so upon myself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To some extent, Johnston realised, individual reactions to a drug
could be accounted for by observing how the individual took it.
A glass of whiskey would have a different effect if it were tossed
off neat than if it were sipped, with water, for an hour. But
this, he felt, was not enough to account for the remarkable differences
in the effects of the same drug on different individuals&#151;and
even on different communities. Could it be, he wondered, that
the use of a particular drug over a long period gradually changed
the disposition and temperament of a people&#151;in turn changing
their reactions? There was no way of telling, with any certainty;
but 'the fate of nations has frequently been decided by the slow
operation of long-acting causes, unthought of and unestimated
by the historian, which, while the name and the local home of
the people remain the same, had gradually changed their constitution,
their character, and their capabilities'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In view of all this evidence, Johnston argued, to think in terms
of trying to prohibit drug-taking by legislation was futile:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A tendency which is so evidently a part of our general human nature,
is not to be suppressed or extinguished by any form of mere physical,
fiscal, or statutory restraint. It may sometimes be discouraged
or repressed by such means, but even this lesser result is not
always obtainable ... an empire may be overthrown by inconsiderate
statutory intermeddling with the natural instincts, the old habits,
or the growing customs of a people, while the instincts and habits
themselves are only strengthened and confirmed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Francis Anstie</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Johnston's thesis made an impression on Francis Anstie, a physician
at the Westminster Hospital who had been specialising in toxicology,
hoping&#151;as he explained in his <I>Stimulants and Narcotics,</I>
published in 1864&#151;to be able to remove the study of the subject
from the metaphysical to the physical level. To this end he had
experimented on himself, and on some patients, with a variety
of drugs; his original intention being to put them into categories,
such as the one suggested by the title of his book. To the patient,
as well as to the doctor, the distinction seemed clear; some drugs
were 'stupefying poisons'&#151;narcotics; others, 'grateful restoratives'&#151;stimulants.
But the result of his researches had upset his expectation that
he would be able to clarify the distinction for textbook purposes.
'To the philosophic student', he ruefully admitted, 'who desires
to arrange in orderly classification the weapons of his art, and
thereby to multiply his resources, the accurate definition of
these two classes of remedies offers a problem at once of great
interest and of extreme difficulty.' Chloroform, for example,
was regarded as a narcotic. But his experiments had shown him
that in certain circumstances, it could be a powerful stimulant.
The action of alcohol was even more confusing. At first sight,
it appeared to be a stimulant; 'but on analysing the symptoms
we are at no loss to perceive that it is the emotional and appetitive
part of the mind which is in action while the intellect, on the
contrary, is directly enfeebled'. It was at least possible, Anstie
speculated, that the outbreak of the passions which alcohol could
induce was due, 'not to any stimulation of them, but to the removal
of the check ordinarily imposed by reason and will'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
To most Europeans, Anstie went on, opium was a narcotic; to Orientals,
a stimulant. They were able, 'sometimes without any previous practice,
to take large quantities of opium without suffering stupefaction;
on the contrary, they appear much exhilarated in spirits, and
their minds work with much freedom. In some cases, muscular power
and the disposition for exertion seem actually to increase'. The
likely explanation, Anstie thought, was that opium prevented other
activities from interfering with mental processes, which gave
the appearance of an increase of intellectual power. And this
could also be an explanation of another mystery. Pain, he suggested,
was not relieved by sedatives and depressants&#151; except where
they poisoned the system, as when a man took enough alcohol to
render himself insensible. What relieved pain was the stimulating
effect of opium, or other drugs, in small doses. It was the stimulus,
he concluded, that mattered, and that might be given by some substance
which was not, in the strict sense, a drug, but which had the
appropriate effect; 'I have seen one patient suffering from severe
agony with peritonitis who developed rapid relief from the careful
and gradual injection of a pint of rich soup into the rectum'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Like Johnston, Anstie had been compelled to recognise what a minor
part the pharmacology of a drug might play in determining man's
reactions to it, compared with the part played by man's responses.
It was a matter of common observation that the same amount of
alcohol which would enliven one man, would depress another; or,
according to his circumstances make the same man jolly, one evening,
and sad, the next. But to the new generation of scientifically-minded
chemists, toxicologists and pharmacologists this was a thoroughly
unsatisfactory state of affairs. It left their discipline uneasily
suspended, like a hammock slung between one solid tree&#151;chemistry&#151;and
some young saplings&#151;biology, neurology, psychology&#151;which bent
and swayed in every scientific breeze.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Throughout the century, therefore, pharmacologists continued to
engage in a search for certainties; and in this they were naturally
encouraged by further discoveries of alkalis. These, it continued
to be assumed, represented the essential drug element in a plant.
When they were extracted they would obviate the wastage involved
in consumption of the rest of the plant; when refined, impurities
would be removed. And it would be easier to measure out the prescribed
strength of dosage. So it came about that morphine, the derivative,
began to replace opium and laudanum as a sedative and a painkiller.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The outcome was the first of a succession of cruel disillusionments.
So long as morphine continued to be taken strictly on prescription,
for specific medical purposes, it fulfilled expectations. But
some of the people for whom it was prescribed came to rely on
it for release from everyday cares, and others took it for a 'lift'.
It began to enslave addicts as effectively as laudanum had enslaved
de Quincey. The medical profession&#151;the doctors by this time
had formed themselves into a profession, and had begun to exercise
a closer supervision of drugs&#151;reacted with alarm, and for a
time addicts were treated by enforced deprivation. The withdrawal
symptoms, though, could be dangerous, as well as painful; cases
were reported of addicts, deprived of morphine, who had had hallucinations
and delirium, and some of them died under the treatment. What
was needed, clearly, was some drug which would do the work of
morphine, but without creating addiction. Any medical scientist
who found one would have his fortune made&#151;as the young Sigmund
Freud realised, when he first began to experiment with the alkali
which pharmacologists had extracted from the leaves of the coca
plant: cocaine.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Cocaine</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Unlike tobacco, coca had not established itself as a drug in Europe&#151;or
even in South America, among the colonists. For a young Spaniard
to begin to take it was regarded as a sign that he was rebelling
against his class; he would be repudiated, and forced either to
leave or to live with the Indians, and adopt their ways. Occasionally
travellers would return from voyages in the Andes with stories
of the feats of endurance which the Indians performed under its
influence; but although they were noted by Abraham Cowley (in
whose mind, Dr. Johnson was to recall, 'botany turns into poetry')
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Endowed with leaves of wondrous nourishment<BR>
Whose juice succ'd in, and to the stomach ta'en<BR>
Long hunger and long labour can sustain
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
its possibilities do not appear to have been recognised until
the Jesuit Don Antonio Julian lamented in his <I>Perla de America</I>
that it was not used in Europe alongside tea and coffee ('it is
melancholy to reflect that the poor of Europe cannot obtain this
preservative against hunger and thirst; that our working people
are not supported by this strengthening plant in their long continued
labours'). The author of a treatise published in 1793 suggested
that the sailors in European navies would benefit from a coca
ration; and in 1814 a writer in the <I>Gentleman's Magazine</I>
elaborated on the proposition. It was not yet clear how the South
American Indians achieved their feats of endurance, he admitted;
but
<BLOCKQUOTE>
it is certain they have that secret, and put it into practice.
They masticate coca, and undergo the greatest fatigue without
any injury to health or bodily vigour. They want neither butcher,
nor baker, nor brewer, nor distiller, nor fuel, nor culinary utensils.
Now, if Professor Davy will apply his thoughts to the subject
here given for his experiments, there are thousands even in this
happy land who will pour their blessings upon him, if he will
but discover a temporary anti-famine, or substitute for food,
free from all inconvenience of weight, bulk and expense, and by
which any person might be enabled, like the Peruvian Indian, to
live and labour in health and spirits for a month now and then
without eating.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, and the employment
of men, women and children in the mills twelve hours a day, six
days a week, there was an incentive to examine the claims for
coca more seriously; especially after von Tschudi's observations
in the 1830s convinced him that coca's reputation was well-founded.
When he took an infusion of the leaves of the plant, while he
was on a hunting expedition at 14,000 feet up in the Andes, he
found it worked for him, too: 'I could then during the whole day
climb the heights, and follow the swift-footed wild animals.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Taken in excess over a protracted period, Tschudi realised, coca
could have unwelcome effects; the inveterate chewer could be detected
from 'his unsteady gait, his yellow-coloured skin, his dim and
sunken eyes encircled by a purple ring, his quivering lips, and
his general apathy'. But this was unusual. Ordinarily, the drug
appeared to have no adverse effects. Even when it was taken in
very large amounts, there was no loss of consciousness; and many
of those who took it every working day (and doubled their intake
on festival occasions) lived on to a great age, in perfect health.
'Setting aside all extravagant and visionary notions on the subject',
he concluded, 'the moderate use of coca is not merely innocuous,
but it may even be conducive to health.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Tschudi's <I>Travels in Peru</I> was followed by accounts from
other travellers, most of them in agreement with him; and in the
1850s an Italian doctor, Paolo Mantegazza, experimented on himself
by chewing dried coca leaves. He experienced an increase in physical
and mental energy, and when he tried an infusion of the leaves,
he found that not merely did the inclination to take exercise
become irresistible; he also had an odd feeling of becoming isolated
from the external world, which would enable him to perform feats
which ordinarily he would not have attempted. On an impulse he
jumped up on his writing table, without smashing the lamp or other
objects on it. Nor did he suffer any reaction, comparable with
a hangover: following the activity he felt only quiet comfort.
And increasing the dose&#151;to the amount commonly consumed by the
natives of Peru&#151;only increased his sense of exhilaration. Joyously
he told his colleagues that he preferred 'ten years with coca
to a million centuries without'. In a treatise on the subject
published in Milan in 1859 he wrote, more sedately, that the principal
property of coca, 'not to be found in any other remedy, consists
in its exalting effect, calling out the power of the organism
without leaving any sign of debility'; and he recommended its
use for nervous disorders.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Gradually, coca began to win adherents in other countries. In
the early 1870s Sir Robert Christison tried it out on medical
students in Edinburgh, and was impressed by the results; the chewing
of coca leaves, he reported, 'not only removes extreme fatigue,
but prevents it', and the only effect it had on the mental faculties
was to eliminate the dullness ordinarily associated with fatigue.
In France racing cyclists began to take it, to increase their
powers of endurance; so did the Toronto Lacrosse Club, in Canada,
who with its assistance won the title 'Champions of the World'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
From the time of its foundation half a century before, the <I>Lancet</I>
has enjoyed exposing nostrums as quackery; and the budding reputation
of coca gave it yet another opportunity to live up to its reputation.
In 1876 it carried a report of an investigation by G. F. Dowdeswell,
a member of the staff of the University College Physics Department,
into the properties of coca and its action on the human body.
Dowdeswell claimed that he had been concerned solely with the
measurable effects on a human subject&#151;changes in pulse rate,
temperature, and so on; and he had demonstrated they were negative.
But consumption of coca had also failed to produce any of the
subjective effects 'so fervently described, and ascribed to it,
by others; not the slightest excitement, not even the feeling
of buoyancy and exhilaration which is experienced from mountain
air, or a draught of spring water'. Although Dowdeswell was not
prepared to claim that coca, in this capacity, was pharmacologically
inert, his experiments, he argued, demonstrated that its action
was so slight 'as to preclude the idea of its having any value
either therapeutically or popularly'. Whatever might be the virtue
of the coca leaf in South America, the <I>Lancet</I> commented
editorially, 'it seems to have lost much of its marvellous virtue
when used in this country.'
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Laboratory trials of that kind had not then acquired the authority
they were later to command; and even the <I>Lancet's</I> reputation
was not sufficient to stem coca's growing popularity as a stimulant.
The following year, it was admitted to the U.S. <I>Pharmacopeia;</I>
soon afterwards, to its British counterpart; and from the variety
of disorders for which it began to be prescribed it looked as
if it might be following the same triumphant clinical course that
tobacco had taken three centuries earlier. But it was just too
late. Pharmacologists succeeded in identifying what was assumed
to be the narcotic element of the coca leaf: cocaine. It seemed
self-evident that it would be absurd to ask a patient to chew
coca leaves, or drink infusions of them, when it was possible
to give him accurately measured doses of its essential ingredient.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But first, it was necessary to demonstrate that cocaine worked;
and in 1883 a German army doctor tried the drug out on soldiers
to see if it did the same for them as the leaves did for the natives
of Peru. It did. Cocaine, Dr. Theodor Aschenbrandt was able to
report, greatly increased their energy and endurance. The report
attracted Freud's attention. He had just become engaged to Martha
Bernays, and was looking for some medical discovery which would
make his name, and his fortune, so that they could afford to marry.
'I am procuring some myself', he wrote to tell her, 'and will
try it with cases of heart disease and also of nervous exhaustion,
particularly in the miserable condition after withdrawal of morphine',
a possibility which had been suggested in an American medical
journal. Having taken some cocaine&#151;it altered his mood from
depression to cheerfulness, he was delighted to find, without
impairing his ability to work&#151;he tried it on his friend Dr.
Fleischl, a morphine addict, with immediately gratifying results.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
'The temperament of an investigator'&#151;Freud had told Martha in
the letter describing his research into cocaine&#151;'needs two fundamental
qualities: he must be sanguine in the attempt, but critical in
the work'. He failed to heed his own advice. Cocaine, he decided,
was 'a magical drug'. He took it himself against depression and
indigestion; sent some to Martha; recommended it for a variety
of disorders; and wrote an essay on it published in 1884, which
was an extended eulogy. Cocaine provided 'exhilaration and lasting
euphoria'; 'an increase of self-control'; 'more vitality and capacity
for work'. Whether mental or physical, work could be performed
without any fatigue; there were none of the unpleasant after-effects
associated with alcohol; and 'absolutely no craving for the further
use of cocaine appears after the first, or even repeated, taking
of the drug; one feels, rather, a curious aversion to it'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
The following year, the first warnings were sounded. To some persons,
nothing was more fascinating than indulgence in cocaine&#151;a writer
commented in the <I>Medical Record</I> for November 28th, 1885&#151;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It relieves the sense of exhaustion, dispels mental depression,
and produces a delicious sense of exhilaration and well-being.
The after-effects are at first slight, almost imperceptible; but
continuous indulgence finally creates a craving which must be
satisfied; the individual then becomes nervous, tremulous sleepless,
without appetite, and he is at last reduced to a condition of
pitiable neurasthenia.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
By the spring of 1887 a Brooklyn doctor, J. B. Mattison, had compiled
a formidable dossier to show that cocaine was highly addictive&#151;as
Freud himself, who had passionately defended cocaine, now realised.
He had to watch Fleischl suffering from the agonies of chronic
intoxication, delirium tremens, and 'white snakes creeping over
his skin'.

There was no reason, in theory, why the unmasking of cocaine should
have had an adverse effect on the reputation of coca&#151;any more
than the discovery that tobacco's alkali, nicotine, was highly
poisonous had deterred people from smoking. But because the early
experimenters with cocaine had argued that, as Freud put it, cocaine
was 'the essential constituent of coca leaves', there was an understandable
tendency for coca to be found guilty by association; and it had
not been on the market for long enough to become established in
the way that tobacco had been before nicotine was found.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Coca had its defenders: chief among them W. G. Mortimer, a Fellow
of the New York Academy of Medicine. In 1901 he published his
history of the 'divine plant of the Incas', a rambling, repetitive,
but exhaustively researched defence of the use of the plant, as
distinct from its alkali. The pharmacologists, he asserted, had
deceived the public; cocaine no more represented coca than prussic
acid, found in minute quantities in peach stones, 'represents
that luscious fruit'. The analogy might not be precise, but the
proposition he derived from it was of fundamental importance:
that the action of cocaine on the human system, though in some
respects similar to that of coca, must not be considered as identical:
'each gives a peculiar sense of well being; but cocaine affects
the central nervous system more pronouncedly than does coca; not&#151;as
commonly presumed&#151;because it is coca in a more concentrated
form, but because the associated substances present in coca, which
are important in modifying its action, are not present in cocaine'.
As proof he was able to cite the discovery of Dr. Henry Rusby
that the Andean natives, making their careful selection of leaves
for chewing, did <I>not,</I> in fact, choose the leaves with the
highest cocaine content. And in the entire literature on the subject,
Mortimer claimed, before the attacks on cocaine, there had been
no serious criticism of coca. Nor was there any known case of
coca addiction or coca poisoning ('What it does for the Indian
at fifteen', one authority had asserted, 'it does for him at sixty;
a greatly increasing dose is not resorted to.') Not merely was
it as innocent as tea or coffee, 'which are commonly accepted
popular necessities&#151;but it is vastly superior to those substances'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
But how was it&#151;if the authorities Mortimer cited were correct&#151;that
the findings of scientific experimenters like Dowdeswell had been
negative? Perhaps, Mortimer surmised, they had used the wrong
kind of leaves. Or the explanation might be along the lines put
forward in 1881 by a New York physician, W. S. Searle: that not
only was coca's action so gentle that it could escape detection:
it might not take place at all in experiments, because the appropriate
mechanism would not be brought into action.

While no other known substance can rival coca in its sustaining
power, no other has so little apparent effect. To one pursuing
the even tenor of his usual routine, the chewing of coca gives
no special sensation. In fact the only result seems to be a negative
one, viz.: an absence of the customary desire for food and sleep.
It is only when some unusual demand is made upon mind or body
that its influence is felt. And to this fact is to be attributed
much of the incredulity of those who have carelessly experimented
with it and who, expecting some internal commotion or sensation,
are disappointed.

<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Mortimer himself felt that the explanation probably also lay in
the different circumstances in which coca was consumed in South
America, where it affected the body's capacity for work by more
efficient conversion of food into energy. Coca helped the Andean
Indians to avoid fatigue by acting upon the stored-up carbohydrates
to which they were accustomed. It might have no affect&#151;the implication
was&#151;on a Westerner accustomed to a different diet.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Whatever the explanation&#151;Mortimer concluded&#151;the evidence from
clinical experience was irrefutable. He had himself circularised
doctors all over America about their experiences with coca; over
350 had replied and a large majority of those expressing opinions
were agreed that coca improved the digestion, strengthened the
heart, stimulated the mind, and improved sexual performance. All
doctors who agreed with him, he urged, should accept the need
for a long and persistent campaign to explain coca's value, 'and
so reflect credit upon themselves through the advocacy and use
of a really marvellous drug'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
It was to no purpose. Coca might be all that Mortimer claimed,
but it lost caste; the medical profession gradually losing interest.
Cocaine, like morphine, continued to have a limited range of clinical
uses; but they would soon, it was hoped, be replaced for most
purposes by a new drug. Heroin had been derived from opium in
1898; soon it was being enthusiastically promoted by manufacturers,
and enthusiastically welcomed by doctors, as more effective than
its predecessors, and carrying&#151;the assurance was &#151;no risk
whatsoever of promoting addiction.
<P>&nbsp;  <H3>Mescaline</H3>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
After the disappointments with laudanum and Indian hemp, the search
for a safe and effective vision-inducing drug had languished for
a time; but towards the end of the century it was revived, largely
through the efforts of a young Berlin pharmacologist, Louis Lewin.
Lewin first made his reputation by some research into morphine;
then, he went on to make the first scientific study of kava. Missionaries,
Lewin had read, were inclined to regard kava as a powerful intoxicant
which ought to be banned; yet Europeans who took it generally
found that it had little or no effect on them. Why? Lewin decided
to find the active chemical principle, test it, and settle the
issue one way or the other. The tests convinced him that kava
was a mild stimulant, improving muscular efficiency and endurance;
and though it could be taken as an intoxicant, its effects were
relatively gentle, compared with alcohol. At least people under
its influence did not become noisy and aggressive.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Up to this point, Lewin was following Anstie's course; but whereas
Anstie's findings compelled him to give up the attempt to distinguish
drugs by their effects on man, Lewin remained sublimely confident
that it was only a matter of time before he could unravel the
strands sufficiently to allow him to categorise drugs according
to their effects. And he was greatly encouraged in this view by
peyote which came into his possession on a visit to America. The
botanical Museum in Berlin decided the cacti were a new species;
four alkaloids were extracted from them, including mescal&#151;mescaline;
and Lewin had his monument&#151; the sub-species was named after
him, <I>anhalonium lewinii.</I> 
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
In Lewin, however, peyotl induced no vision. He found it only
toxic (as did William James. It made him vomit; 'I will take the
visions on trust', he told his brother Henry). But another American,
the pioneer psychiatrist Weir Mitchell, was delighted with the
results, when he tried peyotl in the lE90s, finding it a powerful
physical and emotional stimulus. He could climb to the fourth
floor of his hotel two steps at a time without puffing; and later&#151;'deliciously
at languid ease, I was clearly in the land where it is always
afternoon'&#151;he had a sense of heightened intellectual power.
In retrospect he had to admit that a reading of what he wrote
under the influence failed to justify it; but he could not find
words to express the 'beauty and splendour of what I saw'.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
After reading Mitchell's account in the <I>British Medical Journal,</I>
Havelock Ellis took mescaline, with very similar results. His
first symptom was an access of energy, and of intellectual power;
then visions, the colours indescribably vivid and delightful,
so reminiscent of Monet's paintings that Ellis decided to offer
some mescal to an artist he knew, to observe the effect. The artist
duly had fantastic visions&#151;but they were accompanied by paroxysms,
pain, and the fear he was dying. 'It may at least be claimed,'
Ellis wrote, 'that for a healthy person to be once or twice admitted
to the rites of mescal is not only an unforgettable delight but
an educational influence of no mean value.' But he realised that
more research was needed; and the fact that Weir Mitchell had
also had unfortunate results when he tried it out on a colleague
did not encourage more orthodox medical scientists to carry it
on.
<BR>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
Mescaline had been discovered at the wrong time. Pharmacologists
were looking for drugs which had measurable effects; not drugs
which induced unquantifiable delight. And Lewin, though he had
no doubt that divine inspiration could account for such visions
as that of the prophet Ezekiel&#151;'a great cloud, and a fire unfolding
itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof
as the colour of amber'&#151;felt that visionary experiences were
ordinarily 'transitory states caused by substances produced in
the organism'. This was a view that was becoming increasingly
popular among scientists: that the visions of the alcoholic, the
schizophrenic and the mystic reflected biochemical changes in
the body. The chemical processes interested them. The visions,
they felt, were of no significance.
