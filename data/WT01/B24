<h1>social response to marihuana use</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;I find the great thing in this world is not so much
where we stand, as in what direction we are moving: To reach the
port of heaven, we must sail sometimes with the wind and
sometimes against it-but we must sail and not drift, nor lie at
anchor.&quot; </p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table
(1858) </p>

<hr>

<p>A general interpretation of the National Survey indicates that
roughly one-quarter of the American public is convinced that
criminal sanctions should be withdrawn entirely from marihuana
use. Another fourth of the public is equally convinced that
existing social and legal policy is appropriate, and would
ordinarily jail possessors, with the exception of young first
offenders. Approximately half of the citizenry is confused about
what marihuana means and ambivalent about what society ought to
do about its use. This half of the population is unenthusiastic
about classifying the marihuana user as a criminal, but is
reluctant to relinquish formal control over him. </p>

<p>In considering social and legal policy alternatives, the
Commission has analyzed the pattern of social response to
marihuana use. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The Initial Social Response</b> </p>

<p>As we noted in Chapter I, the initial social reaction to
marihuana use was shaped by the narcotics policy adopted by the
Federal Government. In the early legislation, marihuana was
officially characterized as a narcotic on the basis of the widely
shared assumption that it was a habit-forming drug, leading
inevitably to a form of dependence. Although the medical
community was aware that marihuana was distinguishable from the
opiates in that it did not produce physical dependence, no
functional distinction was drawn; it was assumed that most users
were psychologically compelled to continue using the drug. As one
psychiatrist noted in 1934, the marihuana &quot;user wants to
recapture over and over again the ecstatic, elated state into
which the drug lifts him . . . The addiction to cannabis is a
sensual addiction: it is in the services of the hedonistic
elements of the personality.&quot; </p>

<p>The notion of psychological dependence is still ill-defined,
and was understood even less in the early days of American
marihuana use. The Commission has concluded that the automatic
classification of marihuana as &quot;addictive&quot; was derived
primarily from an underlying social perception of the substrata
of society which used the drug: aliens, prostitutes, and persons
at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. </p>

<p>Additional characteristics of the opiates were also
transferred to marihuana. Particularly important in this regard
was the association of marihuana with aggressive behavior and
violent crime. One district attorney in New Orleans, where
marihuana use was particularly common, wrote in 1931: </p>

<p>It is an ideal drug to cut off inhibitions quickly . . . At
the present time the underworld has been quick to realize the
value of this drug in subjugating the will of human derelicts to
that of a master mind. Its use sweeps away all restraint, and to
its influence may be attributed many of our present day crimes.
It has been the experience of the Police and Prosecuting
Officials in the South that immediately before the commission of
many crimes the use of marihuana cigarettes has been indulged in
by criminals so as to relieve themselves from the natural
restraint which might deter them from the commission of criminal
acts, and to give them the false courage necessary to commit the
contemplated crime. </p>

<p>By 1931, those states in which marihuana use was at all common
had formally responded with a total eliminationist policy. They
generally amended the preexisting narcotics legislation to
include marihuana. Meanwhile, in 1929, the Federal Government
already had classified marihuana officially as a
&quot;habit-forming drug along with the opiates and cocaine, in
the legislation which established two federal &quot;farms&quot;
for treating narcotics addicts in Fort Worth, Texas, and
Lexington, Kentucky. </p>

<p>During the 1930's, the remaining states criminalized marihuana
use by adopting the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, in which the drug
was included (optionally) in the definition of narcotic drugs.
Then, in 1937, Congress adopted the Marihuana Tax Act, completing
the initial period of official response to marihuana use. </p>

<p>A difference of opinion among historians still exists as to
why policymakers thought national legislation was necessary at
that time. Whatever the reason, however, Congress responded
swiftly, without much attempt to learn the facts about the drug
and its use. The assumptions underlying that legislation were
summarized in the Report of the House Ways and Means Committee: </p>

<p>Under the influence of this drug the will is destroyed and all
power of directing and controlling thought is lost. Inhibitions
are released. As a result of these effects, it appeared from
testimony produced at the hearings that many violent crimes have
been and are being committed by persons under the influence of
this drug. Not only is marihuana used by the hardened criminals
to steel them to commit violent crimes, but it is also being
placed in the hands of high-school children in the form of
marihuana cigarettes by unscrupulous peddlers. Cases were cited
at the hearings of school children who have been driven to crime
and insanity through the use of this drug. Its continued use
results many times in impotency and insanity. </p>

<p>When Congress escalated penalties for narcotics offenses in
1951 and again in 1956, marihuana was included, with the
following effects: </p>

<p>Possession Minimum sentence </p>

<p>First offense ------------------------------------------ 2
years </p>

<p>Second offense ---------------------------------------- 5
years </p>

<p>Third and subsequent offense --------------------------- 10
years </p>

<p>Fine ------------------------------------------------- $20,000
</p>

<p>Sale Minimum sentence </p>

<p>First offense ------------------------------------------ 5
years </p>

<p>Second and subsequent offense --------------------------- 10
years </p>

<p>Sale to minor by adult ---------------------------------- 10
years </p>

<p>Parole or probation were made unavailable to all except first
offenders in the possession category. </p>

<p>The perceptions of 1937 were perpetuated in the comments of
Senator Price M. Daniel, Chairman of the Senate subcommittee
considering the 1956 Act, although by now an important new factor
had been added: </p>

<p>Marihuana is a drug which starts most addicts in the use of
drugs. Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to some of
the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted to the
habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin habit and then to
the final destruction of the persons addicted. </p>

<p><b>The Change</b> </p>

<p>With the adoption of marihuana use by middle and upper class
college youth in the mid-60's, the exaggerated notion of the
drug's dangers and the social tension so widespread during this
period combined to reopen the question of the impact of marihuana
use. But governmental policy held to the appropriateness of
existing law. </p>

<p>Arrests, prosecutions, convictions and sentences of
imprisonment all increased at both the federal and state levels.
Marihuana arrests by the U.S. Bureau of Customs increased
approximately 362% from fiscal year 1965 to 1970. Arrests by the
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, an agency which concerns
itself primarily with sale, rose 80% from 1965 to 1968. Because
major responsibility for enforcing the possession laws lies at
the state level, state arrests rose dramatically (1,000%) during
the five years from 1965 to 1970. Although the data compiled by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation are not comprehensive, the
FBI sample tracks the continuing increase of state arrests (Table
6). </p>

<p>In the wake of this upsurge in marihuana arrests, the criminal
justice system faced a far from usual &quot;criminal&quot;
population. Nonetheless, judging from federal figures, the number
of people prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated did rise
substantially as prosecutors and judges attempted to carry out
the law. </p>

<p>Beginning in 1966, however, the proportion of defendants
ultimately convicted declined gradually, as did the percentage of
defendants who were incarcerated, and the average length of their
sentences. This response reflected an attempt to -mitigate the
harshness of the law as applied to this new user population. By
1968, the trend toward leniency seemed to have temporarily
leveled off, before it accelerated again in 1969 (Table 7). </p>

<p>Paralleling the vigorous law enforcement effort between 1965
and 1968 was a punitive reaction in the schools and large numbers
of students using marihuana were suspended, expelled or referred
to the police. Similarly, the military's first reaction to the
surge of marihuana use took the form of court-martial,
administrative punishment, or discharge from the service.<br>

<p>The family, however, suffered the most from the sudden
conflict between accepted norms and this expression of youthful
independence. The use of drugs, particularly marihuana, became a
significant barrier between parent and child. Many young people
adopted marihuana as a symbol of their uneasiness with society's
prevailing norms. </p>

<p>As noted in Chapter 1, the sudden increase in marihuana use
precipitated extensive research by the medical and scientific
communities. By 1969, a consensus emerged holding that many of
the earlier beliefs about the effects of marihuana were
erroneous. Available U.S. data seemed to indicate that dependence
on the drug was rare, as was the incidence of psychosis among
marihuana users. Particularly important was the recognition that
there was little, if any, convincing proof that marihuana caused
aggressive behavior or crime. As such findings accumulated,
public attention was drawn increasingly to the consequences of
existing policy: soaring arrests, convictions and in some states,
lengthy sentences. </p>

<p>Policy-makers, in social institutions and government, as well
as the public began to believe that the harshness of the criminal
penalties was far out of proportion to the dangers posed by the
drug. As users were incarcerated, newspapers and television
stations often brought the matter to public attention,
particularly when the arrested youngster came from a prominent
family. </p>

<p>Official response to this development was twofold: a trend
toward leniency in marihuana cases within the legal system, and a
recognition by policy-makers of widespread uncertainty regarding
the effects of marihuana. </p>

<p>Reflecting the first response, the courts, prosecutors and
police applied existing law more leniently, and the law-makers in
most states and at the federal level changed the letter of the
law, reducing the penalties for possession of marihuana,
generally to a misdemeanor (up to a year in jail). In the
process, they repealed the mandatory minimums which had been of
major concern to the judiciary. </p>

<p>By June 1970, 24 states and the District of Columbia had
reduced the penalties, although 34 states and the District still
classified marihuana as a narcotic. Meanwhile, on the federal
level, Congress had been considering the Nixon Administration's
comprehensive proposal to overhaul the national government's
patchwork of drug legislation. </p>

<p>Since the passage of the Harrison Narcotics Act in 1914,
federal drug laws had taken the form of tax measures, an approach
compelled for constitutional reasons. The Marihuana Tax Act of
1937 followed the same format. The result, however, was a complex
set of offenses involving order forms and registrations. When the
Supreme Court declared certain aspects of the Tax Act
unconstitutional in 1969, revision of the law became essential.
Taking up the challenge, the Administration proposed a major
piece of legislation which tightened control over pharmaceutical
distributions and also reappraised the penalty structure for
narcotics and dangerous drug offenses. </p>

<p>Possession of all drugs, including marihuana, was reduced to a
misdemeanor. Special treatment for first offenders was provided,
allowing expungement of the record upon satisfactory completion
of a probationary period. Casual transfers of marihuana were
treated in the same manner as possession. After a series of
wide-ranging hearings, Congress passed the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act, and on October 27, 1970, the
President signed it into law. </p>

<p>After passage of the new federal drug law, the Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted a Uniform Controlled
Substances Act, conforming in structure and emphasis to the
federal law. Although the Uniform Act specifies no penalties, the
Commissioners recommended that possession of all drugs be a
misdemeanor. </p>

<p>At this writing, 42 of the states and the District of Columbia
classify possession as a misdemeanor or have adopted special
provisions so classifying possession of small amounts of
marihuana. In half of the remaining eight jurisdictions, the
courts have discretion to sentence possessors as misdemeanants. </p>

<p>In 11 jurisdictions, casual transfers are treated in the same
manner as possession, and in 27 jurisdictions, conditional
discharge is available to certain classes of offenders. </p>

<p>The second characteristic of the 1969-70 official response was
its acknowledgment of uncertainty. No longer perceived as a major
threat to public safety, marihuana use had now become primarily
an issue of private and public health. Scientific researchers
were asked to define the nature and scope of the health concern.
In a sense, lawmakers took the minimum official action dictated
by social and scientific realities, but were uncertain where to
go from there. The need to know more about the effects of the
drug, particularly its chronic, long-term effects, became the
core of official response. </p>

<p>Many states appointed special task forces and commissions to
report on marihuana and drug abuse in general. Congress directed
the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to file annual
Reports on Marihuana and Health and, in the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, established this
Commission. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Current Response</b> </p>

<p>In addition to an objective appraisal of the effects of
marihuana use, this Commission was directed to evaluate the
efficacy of existing law. The marihuana laws were and still are
the focus of much public debate. We have recognized from the
outset that a meaningful evaluation of the law is dependent upon
an understanding of objectives and the social context in which
the law operates. Particularly important in this connection are
the attitudes and practices of society's non-legal institutions
and the general direction of public opinion. </p>

<p>In order to comprehend the entire range of contemporary social
response, the Commission launched a threefold inquiry. First, we
designed a series of projects designed to ascertain opinion and
behavior within the criminal justice system. Included were an
analysis of all marihuana arrests during the last six months of
1970 in six metropolitan jurisdictions, a similar study of all
federal marihuana arrests during 1970, an opinion survey of all
local prosecuting attorneys, and a similar survey of attitudes
among a representative sample of Judges, probation officers, and
court clinicians. </p>

<p>We next focused on the practice and opinion of the medical,
clerical, educational, and business communities. To this end, we
solicited written responses from representative groups, invited
various spokesmen to testify before us, made numerous field
visits to secondary schools, colleges and universities and
surveyed opinion in free clinics and university health services.
We also launched a study of drug use and abuse in industry which
will be covered in our second Report on drug abuse. </p>

<p>Finally, we commissioned the National Survey of public opinion
about marihuana to which we have previously referred. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM<br>
</b></p>

<p>How does the criminal justice system respond when an enormous
increase in an illegal conduct, of a primarily private nature,
makes full enforcement of the law impossible, and when there is
widespread doubt about the rationale for making the conduct
illegal? This question guided our analysis of the responses and
opinions from members of the criminal justice system.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Law Enforcement Behavior</b> </p>

<p>On the basis of a detailed study of all federal marihuana
arrests during 1970 and of a sample of state arrests during the
last half of 1970 in Cook County, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Omaha,
Nebraska; Tucson, Arizona; San Mateo County, California; and the
Washington, DC Metropolitan Area, we present the following
findings. </p>

<p>FEDERAL The federal authorities make little or no effort to
seek out violators of laws proscribing possession of marihuana.
The Federal Government ceded responsibility for enforcement of
possession laws to the states several years ago. However, in the
course of general enforcement activity, the Federal authorities
do make possession arrests. If a person is arrested at the
Federal level for possession or casual transfer of small or
moderate amounts of marihuana, the case generally is either
dropped or turned over to the states for prosecution. </p>

<p>The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs does not
concentrate much of its energy on marihuana. By its own estimate,
approximately 6% of its investigative efforts are directed at
marihuana offenses. Most BNDD marihuana arrests occur as a result
of the agency's general investigation into the commercial
distribution of all drugs. </p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of all federal marihuana arrests
occur at or near the borders, as the Bureau of Customs, sometimes
in cooperation with the Border Patrol of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, attempts to interdict the importation of
the drug. </p>

<p><b>State</b> </p>

<p>At the state level, where enforcement of the possession laws
is focused, about 93% of the arrests in our sample were for this
offense. Yet, there was little formal investigative effort to
seek out violators of the possession laws. Instead, 69% of all
marihuana arrests arose from spontaneousor accidental situations
where there had been no investigation at all. Well over half of
these spontaneous arrests occurred when police stopped an
automobile and saw or smelled marihuana. The remaining
spontaneous arrests occurred when police stopped persons on the
street or in a park and discovered marihuana. </p>

<p>In an additional 16% of the cases, the marihuana arrest
resulted from police follow-up of a phoned tip or similar lead.
In less than 11% of all the cases was there any significant
police involvement. (Scope of investigation was unknown in about
4% of the cases). </p>

<p>Because of this enforcement pattern, arrests were concentrated
among the young. Typically the arrestee was a white male, in
school or employed in a blue collar job, without a prior record.
Of those arrested at the state level: </p>

<p>* 58% were under 21; 30% were between 21 and 26; 10% were over
26 (2% unknown) </p>

<p>* 85% were male; 15% were female </p>

<p>* 77% were white; 21% were black; 2% were Spanish speaking </p>

<p>* 27% were students, 2% were military; 28% were employed in
blue collar jobs; 15% were employed in white collar jobs; 11%
were unemployed (16% unknown) </p>

<p>* 44% had not been arrested previously; 31% had been arrested
previously (in 25% of the cases, the extent of prior contact was
unknown) ; only 6% of the arrestees had been previously
inearcerated </p>

<p>Such arrestees generally possessed only small amounts of
marihuana. Of our entire sample of 3,071 arrests: </p>

<ul>
    <li>67% were for possession of less than one ounce (18% were
        for less than one gram; 23% were for between one and 5
        grams; 26% were for between 5 and 30 grams) </li>
    <li>7% were for possession of between one ounce and 4 ounces </li>
    <li>8% were for possession of over 4 ounces </li>
    <li>13% were for possession of unknown quantities </li>
    <li>3 % were for transfer of less than one ounce </li>
    <li>3% were for transfer of over one ounce,* </li>
</ul>

<p>Offenders at the state level were generally arrested in
groups. </p>

<p>* 29 % were arrested alone </p>

<p>* 24% were arrested with one other person </p>

<p>* 43% were arrested with two or more other persons (4%
unknown) Faced with this population of offenders, the criminal
justice System responded often by dismissing or diverting to a
noncriminal institution the young first-offense possessor of
small amounts. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Adult Cases</b> </p>

<p>At least 48% of the cases were terminated in the defendant's
favor: </p>

<p>The police themselves disposed of l0% of the cases, refraining
from filing charges, or diverting the case, to some other
institution. </p>

<p>The prosecution declined to file complaints in an additional
7% of the cases. </p>

<p>An additional 28% of the cases were dismissed in the course of
pretrial judicial proceedings. </p>

<p>In 3% of the cases, the defendant was acquitted at trial. </p>

<p>*Because the figures have been rounded off, the total is not
always 100%.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Cases</b> </p>

<p>At least 70% of the cases were terminated in the youth's
favor: </p>

<p>The police themselves disposed of 21% of the cases, refraining
from referring the youth to juvenile authorities or diverting the
case to some other agency. </p>

<p>An additional 48% of the cases were dismissed either because
the juvenile officer responsible for filing a delinquency
petition refused to do so, or because the judge dismissed the
case prior to trial. </p>

<p>in 1% of the cases, the juvenile was found innocent. </p>

<p>Of the entire sample of arrests, both adult and juvenile, 33%
of those apprehended were ultimately sentenced,, after pleading
guilty or being found guilty. (Since 11% of the 3,071 cases -were
still pending at the time of our study, and disposition was
unknown in 2% of the cases, the figure may be as high as 40% of
all arrests). </p>

<p>Of those convicted for possession of marihuana, 24% were
incarcerated, usually for a year or less. Most of the remaining
persons were put on probation, although some were fined only. By
comparison, of those convicted of sale (5% of the convicted
individuals), 65% were incarcerated, usually for over a year. </p>

<p>In short, in the 2,610 cases where disposition was final and
was available to 6% of those apprehended were ultimately
incarcerated. </p>

<p>From this analysis of enforcement behavior. it appears that
the law enforcement community has adopted a policy of
containment. Although effort is sometimes expended to seek out
private marihuana use, the trend is undoubtedly to invoke, the
marihuana possession laws only when the behavior (possession)
comes out in the open. We were told by police officials in some
cities, for example, that arrests are made only when marihuana
use is flaunted in public. </p>

<p>The salient feature of the present law has become the threat
of arrest for indiscretion. The high percentage of cases which,
after arrest, are disposed of by dismissal or informal diversion
attests to the ambivalence of police officials, prosecutors and
judges about the appropriateness of existing law. Anyone
processed through the entire system does run a risk of
incarceration, especially when the individual had a prior record
and the offense was sale or possession of a significant amount. </p>

<p><b>Law Enforcement Opinion</b> </p>

<p>Prosecutorial opinion toward the existing system suggests both
a containment objective and a, flexible, response. As to
prosecution policy: </p>

<p>31% of the prosecutors state that they would not prosecute
anyone one arrested at a private, social gathering of marihuana
users who are passing a cigarette. </p>

<p>Large numbers of prosecutors admit that they consider factors
other than strength of the evidence in deciding whether or not to
prosecute a possession case; 41% cite age, 38% cite lack of prior
record, 36% consider the amount of marihuana seized and 26% take
into account the family situation of the accused; 31% thought one
or another of these non-legal factors was most important in his
decision </p>

<p>29% of the prosecutors acknowledge that they use informal
probation in lieu of prosecution in some cases. </p>

<p>As to the efficacy of existing law, a majority of the
prosecutors agree that the marihuana laws do not deter, or deter
only minimally: </p>

<p>Persons under 30 from initiating use (53%) </p>

<p>Users from using regularly (56%) </p>

<p>Users from transferring small amounts for little or no
remuneration (55%) </p>

<p>From the studies made by the Commission of enforcement
practices, we consider this to be a realistic assessment. </p>

<p>Conversely, however, the prosecutors agree that the laws have
a significant effect in deterring users from smoking marihuana
openly (62%) and persons over 30 from initiating use (44%). </p>

<p>We also asked the district attorneys for their views on an
appropriate legal policy concerning marihuana use. Their opinions
tend to fall in three groups. One group, representing about 25%
of the prosecutors, favors the status quo, and does not want any
further reduction in penalties. A fifth of the prosecutors
conclude, on the basis of their experience, that possession of
marihuana, and perhaps sale of the drug, should be removed
entirely from the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>The remaining prosecutors, a majority, is willing to consider
mitigation of the harshness of the law either by legislation or
by benign exercise of discretion, but is reluctant to relinquish
formal, criminal control. These prosecutors doubt the deterrent
value of the law and are willing to be lenient in appropriate
cases, but they believe some use of the legal system is necessary
to prevent all increase in marihuana use. </p>

<p>Underlying these opinions are diverse attitudes about
marihuana use and the efficacy of existing law. For example,
prosecutors who doubt the efficacy of existing law and reject the
&quot;escalation&quot; and &quot;aggressive behavior&quot;
hypotheses, are generally willing to modify the laws by their
enforcement policies and by legislative reform (Table 8). </p>

<p>The same general pattern of practice and opinion emerges at
the judicial and dispositional level. Only 13% of the responding
judges would jail an adult for possession of marihuana and only
4% said they would incarcerate a minor. Lesser proportions of
probation officers and clinicians would imprison adults (8% and
1%) and minors (2% and %). Conversely, 11% of the Judges, 15.5%
of the probation officers and 63.5% of the clinicians noted that
they would assess no penalty for possession by adults. For
minors, the proportions are 3%, 5%, and 35% respectively. </p>

</p>

<p>How to read table: 87.1%, of the prosecutors who favor no
change in existing law believe that marihuana leads to the use of
hard drugs; in contrast, 32.2% of the prosecutors who favor
legalization believe that marihuana leads to the use of hard
drugs. </p>

<p>With regard to appropriate legal policy, the judges exhibit
the same inclination as the prosecutors to look for alternatives
within a formal control system which would avoid the use of
criminal penalties. We asked essentially the same question in two
ways and received similar responses (Table 9). </p>

<p>The judges, as a group, are less enthusiastic about criminal
control than the prosecutors, but are equally unwilling to
relinquish formal control. By contrast, the probation officers
and clinicians, who have more personal contact with these
offenders and are perhaps more intensively aware of the control
potential of the criminal justice systern, are highly skeptical
about formal control (Tables 10, -and 11). </p>

<p>In conclusion, as one proceeds through the criminal justice
system, from district attorneys to court clinicians, the people
responsible for the functioning of that system seem to be
decreasingly enthusiastic about the appropriateness of criminal
control and decreasingly insistent on any technique for formal
control. </p>

<p>How to read table: When asked to identify the appropriate

informal control (1 1% would rely on personal choice and 22%,
would rely on informal social control). Similarly, when asked
about the appropriate statutory scheme for possession, 24.3% of
the judges preferred control outside the criminal justice system,
a functional equivalent of &quot;informal control.&quot; </p>

<p>Both Committees expressed doubt about the wisdom and

criminal justice system to deal with marihuana use. They both
urged the Commission to recommend the removal of criminal
penalties from possession of the drug for personal use and casual
non-profit transfers. Both Committees suggested that a regulatory
approach to distribution of the drug be given serious
consideration. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE NON-LEGAL INSTITUTIONS</b> </p>

<p>Law enforcement authorities, given available and prospective
resources, cannot possibly enforce the existing marihuana laws
fully. The best they can do is keel) marihuana use contained and
out of sight. In addition, many officials within the criminal
justice system are reluctant to enforce the marihuana laws, being
either uncommitted to the usefulness of this particular law or
opposed to the law itself. The net result is for the legal system
to leave much of the responsibility for social control to other
social institutions such as family, schools, churches, and the
medical profession. Since these other institutions themselves
have relied heavily on the legal system for control, caution and
confusion now dominate the social response to marihuana use. </p>

<p>The diminishing severity of the law enforcement response may
not have occurred if the other institutions of society had
continued to regard the marihuana user as a criminal. However,
many of these institutions have come to view the marihuana user
primarily in social or medical terms, and to recommend a form of
social control in accord with their respective self-interests or
orientations. In many cases, the ,attitudes of these other
institutions mirror that of the criminal justice system:
uncertainty about the proper role of formal legal control.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Family</b> </p>

<p>The most important institution for instilling social norms is
the family. Parental attitudes generally parallel public opinion,
and specific responses in our National Survey suggest an
inclination among parents and non-parents to deal with youthful
marihuana users through discussion and persuasion rather than
harsh or punitive measures. When asked what action they would
take upon discovering that one of their teenage children was
smoking marihuana with friends, 47% of the adults responded that
they would use persuasion and reason. Twenty-three percent
favored a punitive approach. Interestingly, 9% of the latter
group felt so strongly about the matter that they were willing to
report their own child to the police. A considerable number, 35%
indicated that they were uncertain about what to do, or failed to
respond to this multiple response question. </p>

<p>The non-punitive trend was also apparent when the adults were
asked what they would do if their teenage child was arrested for
a marihuana offense. A substantial number (58%) indicated they
would attempt to extricate their child from the situation, many
not wishing their child to have a police record, while 34%
expressed the sentiment that the child's arrest would help him
learn a lesson. </p>

<p><b>The Schools</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana use continues to increase among high school and
college students. The National Survey reveals that 30% of the
high school juniors and seniors have used marihuana. The National
Survey also reveals that 44% of those currently attending college
at the graduate or undergraduate levels have used it, while other
surveys indicate this figure is significantly higher in some
major universities. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, there has been, during the last two years,
ail appreciable change in the attitudes of school administrators,
faculty and even of the boards of education and trustees toward
marihuana use, Administrators at the secondary and college levels
are generally more relaxed and tolerant toward marihuana, use
than they were during the mid-1960's, when support for a punitive
response was common. After the initial shock of widespread use
dissipated, many school officials came to believe that strong
disciplinary action, including suspension and arrest, was
counterproductive. In addition, as the evidence accumulated that
marihuana, was not as dangerous as had once been thought,
parental and community pressures were sometimes brought to bear
on school administrators to be less punitive and more
understanding of marihuana use. </p>

<p>At the secondary level, the policies very somewhat from state
to state and even within states. Nevertheless, school boards
generally seem to have become less enthusiastic about suspension
and arrest as an appropriate response to marihuana use. One
school administrator in Philadelphia noted sarcastically that if
all users were suspended or arrested, the high schools would
become empty cells, with their entire clientele turned out onto
the streets. </p>

<p>A West Coast official emphasized that student alcohol use was
a much more serious problem than marihuana use; he even suggested
that legalization of marihuana might reduce alcohol use among the
young. The Commission ascertained that no suspensions for
marihuana use had occurred during 1971 in the entire school
system of a southern metropolitan area. Although security
officers in that system did make 20 arrests, they were all for
selling marihuana and other drugs. </p>

<p>At the secondary level, then, increased reliance is being
placed on persuasion rather than discipline, as a means of
discouraging marihuana use. Drug education programs, now being
instituted in almost every school system, often include
information about alcohol and tobacco. We will explore the
various pedagogical techniques employed in such programs and will
attempt to evaluate them in our next Report. </p>

<p>At the college level, the response is even more lenient. In
many cases official neutrality or even protection against police
intervention substitutes for the restraint common at the
secondary level. Under formal or informal arrangements with local
law enforcement officials, many schools bar on-campus arrests for
marihuana use. Apparently they have concluded that enforcement of
the marihuana laws causes more harm. than does use of the drug.
In some cases, college authorities have substituted their own
policy for society's official policy. The Commission learned at
one of its hearings in Chicago, for example, that a major
Midwestern university explicitly declared that students would be
subject to university disciplinary action if they were found in
possession of more than one week's supply of marihuana. </p>

<p>Control at the college level is usually considered a medical
Concern and is handled either through the university health
centers or free clinics. The trend toward leniency is also
apparent in the policy responses of the representative sample of
university health service and free clinic physicians. whose
profession presumably brings them into contact with the
population most it risk from marihuana. Among personnel of the
free clinics, 62% of the respondents favor legalization; 5% would
continue the present policy, and the remainder would either
reduce penalties (11%) or await further research (22%). </p>

<p>Even among the &quot;establishment-oriented&quot; health
service personnel, similar attitudes prevail. Nineteen percent
would continue the present policy, and 16% would legalize. Of the
remaining 55% (10% did not respond), 38% would reduce, penalties
and 17% would await further research. This pattern of views bears
a striking resemblance to that of the prosecuting attorneys, and
indeed of the public at large. The large majority indicates
uneasiness with the present system and opposition to
legalization, but is uncertain about exactly what to do. </p>

<p><b>The Churches</b> </p>

<p>The nation's churches play a major role in the process by
which society's norms and values are transmitted to the young.
Moral education, through individual and family counseling by
church personnel, is influential in the process of social
control, particularly for adolescents. Consequently, the
Commission sought to learn the attitudes, responses and
recommendations of the clergy. </p>

<p>The larger societal uncertainty about the social and moral
implications of marihuana use is also reflected in the attitudes
of religious institutions. For example, Dr. Thomas E. Price,
speaking for the National Council of Churches of Christ in the
U.S.A. before the Commission, referred to marihuana as a
&quot;tightly drawn moral knot.&quot; This uncertainty has led
many religious groups to minimize a punitive and repressive
response to marihuana use in their official statements and formal
programs. Instead, they have concentrated on educational and
rehabilitative programs. </p>

<p>Many church spokesmen have urged a reconsideration of social
and legal policy. The range of their suggestions for change
reflects, once again, widespread uncertainty. Some ask for some
form of &quot;adequate&quot; punishment or supervision so as to
discourage marihuana use. Others say &quot;reform or
elimination&quot; of penalties for possession would be
appropriate. And there are those who suggest legalization with
some government regulation. Some church spokesmen have defended
existing policy, recommending only that the law be more strictly
and uniformly enforced. </p>

<p><b>The Medical Community</b> </p>

<p>In contrast to the mixed opinions of other segments of
society, the medical profession has a rather broad consensus at
the present time. In a series of responses from various medical
societies, associations and committees, we found certain
recurrent themes. Every medical group emphasized the need for
more research into the effects of marihuana. There was uniform
emphasis on how marihuana, as a &quot;drug,&quot; affects heart,
head, blood, brain and so on, but not on how it affects society
as a behavior. The consensus was that marihuana, the drug, poses
some danger for the individual, physically or psychologically.
The only major disagreement is about the degree of such danger. </p>

<p>The second recurrent theme was that marihuana should
definitely not be legalized. Legalization would imply sanction,
medical groups said, with a probable, increase in use as a
result. One doctor compared legalization with the failure of
Prohibition: &quot;The fact [that] Prohibition was a failure
doesn't make alcoholism a good thing and the six million or so
(alcoholics) we have are no bargain. Therefore, since there is no
legitimate use for marihuana it seems rather silly to legalize
its use to initiate a second headache.&quot; Another reason
commonly given by physicians for opposing legalization is that
such a step should be taken if and when it is proven that
marihuana is not dangerous. </p>

<p>The third common theme of medical opinion was a call for a
more. lenient approach toward users, again a position reflected
in almost every quarter of society. One officer of a public
health association told a convention: &quot; (Our committee)
deplores the strong punitive measures suggested by some because
we feel that a jail sentence for the offense of smoking marihuana
is not likely to solve the problem of eliminating marihuana use.
On the contrary, a prison sentence is likely to do great damage
to a young person's personality as well as to his future
career.&quot; Another group called for prosecutors to use
discretionary powers in handling youthful first offenders. </p>

<p>When discussing penalties, the medical community begins to
take, a look at marihuana use as a form of social behavior rather
than simply a drug which produces certain physical and
psychological effects. One doctor wrote: &quot;Because marihuana
in present patterns of use is, by and large, a relatively
innocuous drug and because its use has many motivations from
simple curiosity to symbolism of hostility to the
'establishment', the legal penalties in many jurisdictions
throughout the United States are excessively punitive.&quot; </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Summary</b> </p>

<p>Social institutional spokesmen now commonly recognize that
control of marihuana is only partially a law enforcement problem.
Opinions cluster around the propositions that society should not
be punitive on the one hand, but should not make the drug
available, at least for now. Beyond these points, however,
uncertainty prevails. There is no common vision of an appropriate
social control policy. </p>

<p>Each institution is going about the business of control in its
own way. Parents emphasize mutual communication. The secondary
schools emphasize health education. The colleges recognize
personal freedom so long as it does not jeopardize the
educational enterprise. Churches emphasize uncertainty about the
moral implications of marihuana use. The medical fraternity
stresses the need for further research into the health
consequences of marihuana use. Uncertainly is the common
denominator. </p>

<p><b>THE PUBLIC RESPONSE</b> </p>

<p>For most Americans marihuana use is not an abstract
phenomenon. Fifteen percent of the adult population, the National
Survey revealed, has tried the drug and 44% of the non-trying
adults personally know someone who has used the drug. Fourteen
percent of the youth have tried the drug and 58% of the
non-triers personally know someone who has used the drug. Indeed,
six percent of the non-trying youth indicated that half or more
of their friends used marihuana. </p>

<p>The public is also aware of the consequences of the existing
system and concerned about its impact. Ninety-seven percent of
the adults know that selling marihuana is against the law. Only a
few less, 94%, know that possession is against the law. In fact,
one fourth of the adults know someone who has been arrested on a
possession charge. Ninety-two percent of the youth know that sale
is prohibited, and four out of five know that possession is
against the law. Fifty-three percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds
actually know someone who has been arrested for possession. </p>

<p>Acutely aware of the legal consequences of use, the public is
also cognizant of the difficulties encountered by the criminal
justice system in its attempt to enforce a widely-violated law,
Adults were asked whether they mostly agreed or mostly disagreed
with a series of 12 selected propositions regarding the
desirability of maintaining or altering the present system of
marihuana control. The two propositions which received the most
support relate to problems inherent in the existing laws. </p>

<p>Eighty-three percent of the adults mostly agreed with the
statement that &quot;because of marihuana a lot of young people
who are not criminals are getting police records and being put in
jail.&quot; And 76% agreed that &quot;laws against marihuana are
very hard to enforce because most people use it in private.&quot;
</p>

<p>Marihuana use is more personal than most public issues, but it
is also more confusing. Bombarded in recent years -with
contradictory &quot;findings&quot; and statistics about the
effects of marihuana, and with conflicting arguments about public
policy, the public tends to believe everything, whether pro or
con. Particularly important in this regard is the widespread
acceptance of beliefs which have little basis in fact. </p>

<p>Approximately half of the adult public believes that
&quot;many crimes are committed by persons who are under the
influence of marihuana,&quot; and that &quot;some people have
died from using it.&quot; Seven of every 10 adults believe that
&quot;marihuana makes people want to try stronger things like
heroin.&quot; Although the probability that a person believes
these statements increases with age, a significant percentage of
all groups are represented. </p>

<p>The underlying confusion is strongly indicated in the
contradictory attitudes toward various reasons for maintaining or
changing the law. For example, 43% of the adults thought, in the
context of an argument for making marihuana legal, that &quot;it
should be up to each person to decide for himself, like with
alcohol or tobacco.&quot; Yet 75% of the adults agreed, in the
context of an argument for keeping the laws the way they are,
that &quot;there are already too many ways for people to escape
their responsibilities. We don't need another one.&quot; </p>

<p>Youth tend to be less convinced than adults that marihuana use
may be fatal to the user, or cause him to commit crime or lead
him to use other drugs; but young people as a group also are
noticeably more uncertain about these matters. One of every four
young people indicated that they were unsure whether marihuana
caused death or crime, and one of every six expressed uncertainty
regarding the progression to other drugs. Similarly, young people
were more than twice as likely as adults to have &quot;no
opinion&quot; about the various propositions regarding the need
for legal change. </p>

<p>Public attitudes toward marihuana exhibit both doubt and
tension. On the one hand, we note an acute awareness of the legal
consequences of marihuana use and an appreciation of the adverse
impact of processing users through the criminal justice system.
On the other hand, we note some misconceptions about the dangers
of marihuana and confusion about the consequences of changing or
maintaining the present system. </p>

<p>Public responses on the basic questions of social and legal
policy reflect the underlying ambivalence. The overwhelming
majority of the public does not want to treat the marihuana user
harshly. This attitude appeared repeatedly through the entire
Survey. When asked &quot;For the good of the country, which of
the following courses of action would be the best thing to do
about [marihuana use] ?&quot; the public responded in the
following manner:<br>
</p>

<p>Percentage Youth Adults* 12-17 </p>

<p>Handle the problem mostly through the police and courts: </p>

<p>the process of arrest, conviction, punish- </p>

money on preventing and solving other crimes </p>

<p>No opinion --------------------------------------- 5 20 </p>

<p>*Some adults gave more than one answer. </p>

<p>Adults and youth were also asked to look at marihuana use from
the perspective of the system, and to identify the appropriate
penalty for possession of marihuana. Both groups were reluctant
to put users in jail, especially for a first offense.
Eighty-three percent of the adults and 64% of the youth would not
incarcerate a youthful first offender; 54% of the adults and 41 %
of the youth would not even give the young offender a police
record (Table 12). </p>

<p>Interestingly, the youth population as a whole was less
lenient than the adult population as a whole. Within each group,
however, the older teenagers and young adults were the most
tolerant in all respects. </p>

<p>These statistics suggest that the I public generally prefers
leniency when responding to questions specifically directed to
marihuana use. But when asked about &quot;control&quot; or
&quot;the law&quot; in general, the response often appears quite
harsh. For example, when asked to consider a range of five
alternative control schemes, most adults tended to resist change.
</p>

<p>Thirty-one percent of the adults thought that making marihuana
legally available through regulated channels (like alcohol) was
acceptable but 67% thought it was unacceptable. Although 23%
thought the removal of criminal sanctions from possession was
acceptable, 74% thought this approach was unacceptable. On the
other hand, 56% of the adults thought that the existing laws
were, acceptable; yet 41% found the present law unacceptable.
Finally, 72% thought &quot;stricter laws&quot; would be
acceptable, while only 26% thought such a change would be
unacceptable. Indeed 43% thought stricter laws were the
&quot;ideal solution&quot; and 62% thought this was the best of
the alternatives. </p>

<p>These responses seem to be contradictory. We are puzzled about
what the respondents thought they meant when they expressed a
preference for stricter laws. </p>

<p>They probably did not mean stricter penalties for possession.
Such an interpretation would be entirely inconsistent with
responses to questions aimed directly at appropriate policy
toward users. Under existing law some states still treat first
offenders as felons and most states treat multiple offenders as
felons. But, only a third of the adult respondents would put an
adult multiple offender in jail for more than a year. </p>

<p>The preference for stricter laws might be interpreted to mean
heavier penalties for sale, or better enforcement of existing
proscriptions against trafficking. Two-thirds of the adults did
indicate that they preferred heavier penalties for sale than for
possession. But penalties for selling for profit are already
quite heavy in every jurisdiction. </p>

<p>We suspect that a majority of the public, including many of
those favoring &quot;stricter laws,&quot; is actually disturbed
about the increase in marihuana use and would like a system which
would work better than the existing system to discourage use. A
majority of the adult public seeks a better system of control,
albeit one which is not punitive toward the user. Apparently
uneasy about the individual and social consequences of the
present system, the large center of public opinion is nonetheless
reluctant to relinquish formal control. </p>

<p>This insistence on maintenance of formal controls over the
user rests upon two interrelated factors: respect for law and
faith in the efficacy of legal control. First, the public does
not believe the, legal order should wither away simply because
many people choose to violate the laws against marihuana use.
Obedience, of the, law is highly valued in our society. </p>

<p>This factor is illustrated clearly by the widespread public
disagreement with the following arguments for changing the law:
76% of the adults disagreed with the statement that &quot;young
people would have more respect for the law if marihuana were made
legal;&quot; and four out of five adults disagreed with the
statement that &quot;so many people are using marihuana that it
should be made legal.&quot; </p>

<p>Second, most adults believe that legal remedies, even though
not punitive, are necessary to discourage use of the drug. This
belief is tied largely to their understanding of the effects of
the drug and is reflected in the response to the question about
&quot;the best way&quot; to handle the use of marihuana. As we
noted earlier, 51% of the public thought that marihuana use ought
to be handled as a medical problem. </p>

<p>Also, the substantial majority of people who are reluctant to
incarcerate possessors do prefer the imposition of fines without
a police record or probation. Both of these alternatives retain
formal control over the user and indicate faith in the deterrent
value of the law. The public responses in this respect bear a
striking resemblance to those of the judges and probation
officers, who repeatedly indicated a preference for non-punitive
formal control. </p>

<p>This interpretation of dominant opinion was drawn from
ostensibly inconsistent responses to a long series of questions
on appropriate social and legal policy. A substantial minority of
the public, however, exhibited a consistent pattern of response
to all questions. About a quarter of the public is convinced that
the criminal sanction should be withdrawn entirely from marihuana
use. Another quarter of the public prefers the criminal approach,
even for the user. </p>

<p>In sum, the existing system is not supported by the consensus
of public opinion that once existed. There is a consensus that
punitive measures are generally inappropriate. There is also a
predominant opinion that the legal system should not abandon
formal control.<br>

Abuse</b> </p>

</p>

<p>&quot;The difficulty in life is the choice.&quot; </p>

<p>George Moore (1900) </p>

<p>A constant tension exists in our society between individual
liberties and the need for reasonable societal restraints. It is
easy to go too far in either direction, and this tendency is
particularly evident where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>We have guided our decision-making by the belief that the
state is obliged to justify restraints on individual behavior.
Too often individual freedoms are submerged in the passions of
the moment, and when that happens, the public policy may be
determined more by rhetoric than by reason. Our effort has been
to minimize the emotional and emphasize the rational in this
Report. </p>

<p><b>Drugs In a Free Society</b> </p>

<p>A free society seeks to provide conditions in which each of
its members may develop his or her potentialities to the fullest
extent. A premium is placed on individual choice in seeking
self-fulfillment. This priority depends upon the capacity of free
citizens not to abuse their freedom, and upon their willingness
to act responsibly toward others and toward the society as a
whole. Responsible behavior, through individual choice, is both
the guarantor and the objective of a free society. <br>
</p>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>The use of drugs is not in itself an irresponsible act.
Medical and scientific uses serve important individual and social
needs and are often essential to our physical and mental
well-being. Further, the use of drugs for pleasure or other
non-medical purposes is not inherently irresponsible; alcohol is
widely used as an acceptable part of social activities. </p>

<p>We do think the use of drugs is clearly irresponsible when it
impedes the individual's integration into the economic and social
system. A preference for individual productivity and contribution
to social progress in a general sense still undergirds the
American value structure, and we emphasize the policy-maker's
duty to support this preference in a public policy judgment. </p>

<p>At the same time, in light of the emerging leisure ethic and
the search for individual meaning and fulfillment noted in
Chapter 1, we cannot divorce social policy from the questions
raised by the recreational use of drugs. Productivity and
recreation both have a place in the American ethical system. They
are not inconsistent unless the individual's use of leisure time
inhibits his productive role in society. </p>

<p>Drugs should be servants, not masters. They become masters
when they dominate an individual's existence or impair his
faculties. To the extent that any drug, including alcohol,
carries with it risks to the well-being of the user and seriously
undermines his effectiveness in the society, that drug becomes a
matter of concern for public policy. </p>

<p>An essential step in the process of policy-formation is a
determination of the circumstances under which use of any given
drug' poses such risks. For some drugs, the risks may be so great
that all permissible measures should be taken to eliminate use.
For other drugs, such risks may be present only under certain
specific circumstances, in which case society may defer to
responsible individual choice on the matter of recreational use
but take appropriate steps to minimize the incidence and
consequences of dysfunctional use. In our Report next year, for
which studies are already underway, we will consider from this
perspective the whole range of drugs now used for non-medical
purposes. </p>

<p>A Social Control Policy for Marihuana </p>

<p>In formulating a Marihuana policy, our strongest concern is
with irresponsible use, whether it be too often, too much,
indiscriminate, or under improper circumstances. The excessive or
indiscriminate use of any drug is a serious social concern; and
this is particularly true of marihuana since we still know very
little about the effects of long term, heavy use. We have little
doubt that the substantial majority of users, under any social
control policy, including the existing system, do not and would
not engage in irresponsible behavior. </p>

<p>In identifying the -appropriate social control policy for
marihuana, we have found it helpful to consider the following
policy options: </p>

<p>I Approval of Use. </p>

<p>II Elimination of Use. </p>

<p>III Discouragement of Use. </p>

<p>IV Neutrality Toward Use. <br>
</p>

<p>APPROVAL OF USE </p>

<p>Society should not approve or encourage the recreational use
of any drug, in public or private. Any semblance of encouragement
enhances the possibility of abuse and removes, from a
psychological standpoint, an effective support of individual
restraint. </p>

<p>For example, so long as this society (not only the government,
but other institutions and mass advertising as well) in effect
approved of the use of tobacco, the growing medical consensus
about the dangers of excessive use did not make a significant
impression on individual judgment. With the Surgeon General's
Report on Tobacco in 1964, Smoking and Health, a very real change
has occurred in the way society now thinks about cigarettes. </p>

<p>The institutions of society definitely add their influences to
the variety of social pressures which persuade individuals to use
any kind of drugs. Rational social policy should seek to minimize
such social pressures, whether they come from peers, from the
media, from social custom, or from the user's sense of
inadequacy. Official approval would inevitably encourage some
people to use the drug who would not otherwise do so, and would
also increase the incidence of heavy or otherwise irresponsible
use and its complications. On this basis we reject policy option
number one, approval of use. </p>

<p>ELIMINATION OF USE </p>

<p>For a half-century, official social policy has been not only
to discourage use but to eliminate it (option number two). With
the principal responsibility for this policy assigned to law
enforcement, its implementation reached its zenith in the late
1950's and early 1960's when marihuana-related offenses were
punishable by long periods of incarceration. This policy grew out
of a distorted and greatly exaggerated concept of the drug's
ordinary effects upon the individual and the society. On the
basis of information then available, marihuana was not adequately
distinguished from other problem drugs and was assumed to be as
harmful as the others. </p>

<p>The increased incidence of use, intensive scientific
reevaluation, and the spread of use to the middle and upper
socioeconomic groups have brought about the informal adoption of
a modified social policy. On the basis of our opinion surveys and
our empirical studies of law enforcement behavior, we are
convinced that officialdom and the public are no longer as
punitive toward marihuana use as they once were. </p>

<p>Now there exists a more realistic estimate of the actual
social impact of marihuana use. School and university
administrators are seldom able to prevent the use of marihuana by
their students and personnel and are increasingly reluctant to
take disciplinary action against users. Within the criminal
justice system, there has been a marked decline in the severity
of the response to offenders charged with possession of
marihuana. </p>

<p>In our survey of state enforcement activities, only 11% of all
marihuana arrests resulted from active investigative activity,
and most of those were in sale situations. For the most part,
marihuana enforcement is a haphazard process; arrests occur on
the street, in a park, in a car, or as a result of a phone call.
Among those arrested, approximately 50% of the adults and 70% of
the juveniles are not processed through the system; their cases
are dismissed by the police, by the prosecutors or by the courts.
Ultimately less than 6% of all those apprehended are
incarcerated, and very few of these sentences are for possession
of small amounts for personal use. </p>

<p>In the law enforcement community, the major concern is no
longer marihuana but the tendency of some users to engage in
other irresponsible activity, particularly the use of more
dangerous drugs. Official sentiment now seems to be a desire to
contain use of the drug as well as the drug subculture, and to
minimize its spread to the rest of the youth population. Law
enforcement policy, both at the Federal and State levels,
implicitly recognizes that elimination is impossible at this
time. </p>

<p>The active attempt to suppress all marihuana use has been
replaced by an effort to keep it within reasonable bounds. Yet
because this policy still reflects a view that marihuana smoking
is itself destructive enough to justify punitive action against
the user, we believe it is an inappropriate social response. </p>

<p>Marihuana's relative potential for harm to the vast majority
of individual users and its actual impact on society does not
justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish
those who use it. This judgment is based on prevalent, use
patterns, on behavior exhibited by the vast majority of users and
on our interpretations of existing medical and scientific data.
This position also is consistent with the estimate by law
enforcement personnel that the elimination of use is
unattainable. </p>

<p>In the case of experimental or intermittent use of marihuana,
there is room for individual judgment. Some members of our
society believe the decision to use marihuana is an immoral
decision. However, even during Prohibition, when many people were
concerned about the evils associated with excessive use of
alcohol, possession for personal use was never outlawed federally
and was made illegal in only five States. </p>

<p>Indeed, we suspect that the moral contempt in which some of
our citizens hold the marihuana user is related to other behavior
or other attitudes assumed to be associated with use of the drug.
All of our data suggest that the moral views of the overwhelming
majority of marihuana users are in general accord with those of
the larger society. </p>

<p>Having previously rejected the approval policy (option number
one), we now reject the eliminationist policy (option number
two). This policy, if taken seriously, would require a great
increase in manpower and resources in order to eliminate the use
of a drug which simply does not warrant that kind of attention.<br>
</p>

<p>DISCOURAGEMENT OR NEUTRALITY </p>

<p>The unresolved question is whether society should try to
dissuade its members from using marihuana or should defer
entirely to individual judgment in the matter, remaining benignly
neutral. We must choose between policies of discouragement
(number three) and neutrality (number four). This choice is a
difficult one and forces us to consider the limitations of our
knowledge and the dynamics of social change. A number of
considerations, none of which is conclusive by itself, point at
the present time toward a discouragement policy. We will discuss
each one of them separately. </p>

<p>1. User Preference Is Still Ambiguous </p>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco have long been desired by large numbers
within our society and their use is deeply ingrained in the
American culture. Marihuana, on the other hand, has only recently
achieved a significant foothold in the American experience, and
it is still essentially used more by young people. Again, the
unknown factor here is whether the sudden attraction to marihuana
derives from its psychoactive virtues or from its symbolic
status. </p>

<p>Throughout this Commission's deliberations there was a
recurring awareness of the possibility that marihuana use may be
a fad which, if not institutionalized, will recede substantially
in time. Present data suggest that this is the case, and we do
not hesitate to say that we would prefer that outcome. To the
extent that conditions permit, society is well advised to
minimize the number of drugs which may cause significant
problems. By focusing our attention on fewer rather than more
drugs, we may be better able to foster responsible use and
diminish the consequences of irresponsible use. </p>

<p>The more prudent course seems to be to retain a social policy
opposed to use, attempting to discourage use while at the same
time seeking to deemphasize the issue. Such a policy leaves us
with more options available when more definitive knowledge of the
consequences of heavy and prolonged marihuana use becomes
available. </p>

<p>2. Continuing Scientific Uncertainty Precludes Finality </p>

<p>In 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, society was cognizant
of the effects of alcohol as a drug and the adverse consequences
of abuse. But, because so many people wished to use the drug,
policy-makers chose, to run the risk of individual indiscretion
and decided to abandon the abstentionist policy. There are many
today who feel that if the social, impact of alcohol use had then
been more fully understood, a policy of discouragement rather
than neutrality would have been adopted to minimize the negative
aspects of alcohol use. </p>

<p>Misunderstanding also played an important part when the
national government adopted an eliminationist, marihuana policy
in 1937. The policy-makers knew very little about the effects or
social impact of the drug; many of their hypotheses were
speculative and, in large measure, incorrect. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the argument that misinformation in 1937
automatically compels complete reversal of the action taken at
that time is neither reasonable nor logical. While continuing
concern about the effects of heavy, chronic use is not sufficient
reason to maintain an overly harsh public policy, it is still a
significant argument for choosing official discouragement in
preference to official neutrality. </p>

<p>3. Society's Value System Is In a State of Transition </p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, two central influences in
contemporary American life are the individual search for meaning
within the context of an increasingly depersonalized society, and
the collective search for enduring American values. In Chapter
IV, we noted that society's present ambivalent response to
marihuana use reflects these uncertainties. </p>

<p>For the reasons discussed in the previous Chapters, a sudden
abandonment of an official policy of elimination in favor of one
of neutrality toward marihuana would have a profound
reverberating impact on social attitudes far beyond the one issue
of marihuana use. We believe that society must have time to
consider its image of the future. We believe that adoption of a
discouragement policy toward marihuana at this time would
facilitate such a reappraisal while official neutrality, under
present circumstances, would impede it. </p>

<p>4. Public Opinion Presently Opposes Marihuana Use </p>

<p>For whatever reasons, a substantial majority of the American
public opposes the use of marihuana, and would prefer that their
fellow citizens abstain from using it. In the National Survey,
64% of the adult public agreed with the statement that
&quot;using marihuana is morally offensive` (40% felt the same
way about alcohol). </p>

<p>Although this majority opinion is not by any means conclusive,
it cannot be ignored. We are well aware of the skeptics in with
which marihuana user, and those sympathetic to their wishes, view
the policy making process; and we are particularly concerned
about the indifference to or disrespect for law manifested by
many citizens and particularly the youth. </p>

<p>However, we are also apprehensive about the impact of a major
change in social policy on that larger segment of our population
which supports the implications of the existing social policy.
They, too, might lose respect for a policy-making establishment
which appeared to bend so easily to the wishes of a
&quot;lawless&quot; and highly vocal minority. </p>

<p>This concern for minimizing cultural dislocation must, of
course, be weighed against the relative importance of contrary
arguments. For example, in the case of desegregation in the
South, and now in the North, cult-Lire shock had to be accepted
in the light of the fundamental precept at issue. In the, case.
of marihuana, there is no fundamental principle supporting the
use of the drug, and society is not compelled to approve or be
neutral toward it. The opinion of the majority is entitled to
greater weight. </p>

<p>Looking again to the, experience with Prohibition, when an
abstentionist policy for alcohol was adopted on the national
level in 1918, its proponents were not blind to the vociferous
opposition of a substantial minority of the people. By the late
1920's and early 1930's, the ambivalence of public opinion toward
alcohol use and the unwillingness of large numbers of people to
comply with the new social policy compelled reversal of that
policy. Even many of its former supporters acknowledged its
futility. </p>

<p>With marihuana, however, the prevailing policy of eliminating
use had never been opposed to any significant degree until the
mid-1960's. Unlike the prohibition of alcohol, which had been the
subject of public debate off and on for 60 years before it was
adopted, present marihuana policy has not until now engaged the
public opinion process, some 50 years after it first began to be
used. Majority sentiment does not appear to be as flexible as it
was with alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p>5. Neutrality Is Not Philosophically Compelled </p>

<p>Much of what was stated above bespeaks an acute awareness by
the Commission of the subtleties of the collective consciousness
of the American people, as shown in the National Survey. There is
a legitimate concern about what the majority of the non-using
population thinks about marihuana use and what the drug
represents in the public mind. The question is appropriately
asked if we are suggesting that the majority in a free society
may impose its will on an unwilling minority even though, as it
is claimed, uncertainty, speculation, and a large degree of
misinformation form the basis of the predominant opinion. If we
have nothing more substantial than this, the argument goes,
society should remain neutral. </p>

<p>To deal with this contention, one must distinguish between
ends and means. Policy-makers must choose their objectives with a
sensitivity toward the entire social fabric and a vision of the
good society. In such a decision, the general public attitude is
a significant consideration. The preferred outcome in a
democratic society cannot be that of the policy-makers alone; it
must be that of an informed public. Accordingly, the policy-maker
must consider the dynamic relationship between perception and
reality in the public mind. Is the public consensus based on a
real awareness of the facts? Does the public really understand
what is at stake? Given the best evidence available, would the
public consensus remain the same? </p>

<p>Assuming that dominant opinion opposes marihuana use, the
philosophical issue is raised not by the goal but by how it is
implemented. At this point, the interests of the unwilling become
important. For example, the family unit and the institution of
marriage are preferred means of group-living and child-rearing in
our society. As a society, we are not neutral. We officially
encourage matrimony by giving married couples favorable tax
treatment; but we do not compel people to get married. If it
should become public policy to try to reduce the birth rate, it
is unlikely that there will be laws to punish those who exceed
the preferred family size, although we may again utilize
disincentives through the tax system. Similarly, this Commission
believes society should continue actively to discourage people
from using marihuana, and any philosophical limitation is
relevant to the means employed, not to the goal itself.<br>
</p>

<p>FOR THESE REASONS, WE RECOMMEND TO THE PUBLIC AND ITS
POLICY-MAKERS A SOCIAL CONTROL POLICY SEEKING TO DISCOURAGE
MARIHUANA USE, WHILE CONCENTRATING PRIMARILY ON THE PREVENTION OF
HEAVY AND VERY HEAVY USE. </p>

<p>We emphasize that this is a policy for today and the immediate
future; we do not presume to suggest that this policy embodies
eternal truth. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that our
successor policy planners, at an appropriate time in the future,
review the following factors to determine whether an altered
social policy is in order: the state of public opinion, the
extent to which members of the society continue to use the drug,
the developing scientific knowledge about the effects and social
impact of use of the drug, and the evolving social attitude
toward the place of recreation and leisure in a work-oriented
society. In our second Report next year, we will carefully review
our findings to see if our perceptions have changed or if society
has changed at that time.<br>
</p>

<p>Implementing The Discouragement Policy </p>

<p>Choice of this social control policy does not automatically
dictate any particular legal implementation. As we noted in
Chapter 1, there is a disturbing tendency among participants in
the marihuana debate to assume that a given statement of the
drug's effects, its number of users or its social impact compels
a particular statutory scheme. </p>

<p>Law does not operate in a social vacuum, and it is only one of
the institutional mechanisms which society can utilize to
implement its policies. Consequently, the evaluation of
alternative legal approaches demands not only logic but also a
delicate assessment of the mutual relationship between the law
and other institutions of social control, such as the church, the
family and the school. <br>
</p>

<p>THE ROLE OF LAW IN EFFECTIVE SOCIAL CONTROL </p>

<p>Social control is most effectively guaranteed by the exercise
of individual self-discipline. Elementary social psychology
teaches us that restraint generated within is infinitely more
effective and tenacious than restraint imposed from without. </p>

<p>One of the participants at our &quot;Central Influences&quot;
Seminar observed: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When people grow up into a society, the principal aim is
    to internalize drives-that is, I assume they come up 'with
    certain drives which can be satisfied in many ways and you're
    trying to internalize, ways of satisfying those drives which
    will be compatible with life in a community and also
    satisfying to the individual. The external restraints can
    only complement this, they cannot possibly substitute for it.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The supplemental effect of external restraints, particularly
legal restraints, must also be weighed against the nature of the
control sought. It was put this way at our Seminar: </p>

<p>Think of the social welfare function as a mountain-the hill of
the Lords really. Large parts of it are something of a plateau;
that is you can be all sorts of places on it and be safe. You
don't have to maximize. This is an economist's fallacy. You can
have all sorts of variations, you can be Socialists, Capitalists,
Mormons, Adventists and get away with it-even Liberals. But there
are cliffs, and you can fall off of them. This is what we are
worrying about today. We are nervous about these cliffs. </p>

<p>The &quot;no-no's&quot;-as the kids call them-are the fences
on these cliffs. That is, we have set up taboos and say there's a
cliff there. Now -one of the problems socially is that we set up
&quot;no-no's&quot; where there are no cliffs. There are no
cliffs and people jump over these [fences] and they say, &quot;No
cliffs! See no cliffs!&quot; [Then, over other fences-and]
chop-chop-chop-crash! See, it's just as dangerous to set up
fences without any cliffs as not have fences where there are
cliffs. </p>

<p>To this functional consideration of external restraint, we
must also add the philosophical faith in the responsible exercise
of individual judgment which is the essence of a free society. To
illustrate, a preference for individual productivity underlies
this society's opposition to indiscriminate drug use, the fact
that so few of the 24 million Americans who have tried marihuana
use it, or have used it, irresponsibly, testifies to the extent
to which they have internalized that value. </p>

<p>The hypothesis that widespread irresponsibility would attend
freer availability of marihuana suggests not that a restrictive
policy is in order but rather that a basic premise of our free
society is in doubt. We note that the escalation thesis, used as
an argument against marihuana rather than as a tool for
understanding individual behavior, is really a manifestation of
skepticism about individual vulnerabilities. For example,
one-half of the public agreed with the statement that &quot;if
marihuana were made legal, it would make drug addicts out of
ordinary people.&quot; </p>

<p>At the same time, we do feel that the threat of excessive use
is most potent with the young. In fact, we think all drug use
should continue to be discouraged among the young, because of
possible adverse effects on psychological development and because
of the lesser ability of this part of the population to
discriminate between limited and excessive use. </p>

<p>Social policy implementation in this regard is extraordinarily
difficult. For example, although existing social policies toward
tobacco, alcohol and marihuana alike oppose their use by the
young, those policies are far from being fully effective. For
example: </p>

<p>Tobacco </p>

<p>The National Survey (1971) indicates that of young people age
12-to-17, </p>

<ul>
    <li>50 % have smoked at one, time or another; </li>
    <li>15% smoke now; and </li>
    <li>At least 8% smoke at least a half a pack a day. </li>
</ul>

<p>In a 1970 sample of smoking habits in the 12-to-18 population
conducted for the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health,
it was found that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>18.5% of the boys and 11.9% of the girls were regular
        smokers; and </li>
    <li>About 8% of the boys and 5% of the girls smoked more than
        a half a pack a day. </li>
</ul>

<p>Alcohol </p>

<p>The National Survey also ascertained the drinking pattern
during the previous month of young people aged 12-to-17, finding
that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>At least 23% had used beer during that month, at least
        14% had used wine and at least 12% had used hard liquor;
        and </li>
    <li>6% had used beer five or more days during the months 3%
        had used wine five or more days, and 3% had used hard
        liquor five or more days. </li>
</ul>

<p>Marihuana </p>

<p>Of the 12-to-17 population, the Survey found that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>15% of this population had tried marihuana; </li>
    <li>At least 6 % still use it; and </li>
    <li>Less than 1% use it once a day or more </li>
</ul>

<p>The inclination of so many young people to experiment with
drugs is a reflection of a so-called successful socialization
process on one hand, and of society's ambivalence to the use of
drugs on the other. This entire matter will occupy much of our
attention in the coming year, but it is essential that we make a
few anticipatory comments now. </p>

<p>This nation tries very had to instill in its children
independence, curiosity and a healthy self-assurance. These
qualities guarantee a dynamic, progressive society. Where drugs
are concerned, however, we have relied generally on
authoritarianism and on obedience. Drug education has generally
been characterized by overemphasis of scare tactics. Some
segments of the population have been reluctant to inform for fear
of arousing curiosity in young minds. Where drugs are concerned,
young people are simply supposed to nod and obey. - </p>

<p>This society has always been and continues to be ambivalent
about the non-medical (in the strict sense) use of drugs. And
this ambivalence does not escape our children. If we can come to
grips with this issue, we might convince our youth that the
curiosity that is encouraged in other aspects of our culture is
undesirable where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>The law is at best a highly imperfect reflection of drug
policy. The laws proscribing sale of tobacco to minors are
largely ignored. Prohibitions of sale of alcohol to minors are
enforced sporadically. As to marihuana, there are areas
throughout this nation where possession laws are not enforced at
all. In other sections, such proscriptions are strictly enforced,
with no apparent decrease in marihuana use. </p>

<p>As a guiding doctrine for parents and children, the law is
certainly confusing when it imposes widely varying punishments in
different states, and even in different courts of the same state,
all for use of the same substance, marihuana. That marihuana use
can be treated as a petty offense in one state and a felony in
another is illogical and confusing to even the most sincere of
parents. </p>

<p>The law is simply too blunt an instrument to manifest the
subtle distinctions we draw between the motivations and the
circumstances of use. At the same time, legal status carries a
certain weight of its own, and other institutions must take
account of the law in performing their functions. </p>

<p>In legally implementing our recommended social policy, we seek
to maximize the ability of our schools, churches and families to
be open and honest in discussing all drugs, including marihuana.
The law must assist, not impede. In this respect, we note with
concern the counterproductive tendency in our society to seek
simple solutions to complex problems. Since the statutory law is
a simple tool, the tendency in our society to look to the law for
social control is particularly strong. </p>

<p>We have discussed the four basic social policy objectives of
elimination, discouragement, neutrality and approval of marihuana
use and have selected discouragement of use, with emphasis on
prevention of heavy and very heavy use, as our generalized aim.
We have considered three legal responses, each with a wide range
of alternatives: </p>

<p>1. Total Prohibition. </p>

<p>2. Partial Prohibition. </p>

<p>3. Regulation.<br>
</p>

<p>TOTAL PROHIBITION </p>

<p>The distinctive feature of a total prohibition scheme is that
all marihuana-related behavior is prohibited by law. Under the
total prohibition response now in force in every state and at the
federal level, cultivation, importation, sale, gift or other
transfer, and possession are all prohibited acts. In 11 states
and the District of Columbia, simply being present knowingly in a
place where marihuana is present is also prohibited; and many
states prohibit the possession of pipes or other smoking
paraphernalia. For our purposes, the key feature of the total
prohibition approach is that even possession of a small amount in
the home for personal use is prohibited by criminal law. </p>

<p>From the very inception of marihuana control legislation, this
nation has utilized a policy of a total prohibition, far more
comprehensive than the restrictions established during the
prohibition of alcohol. </p>

<p>Until recent years, society was operating under an
eliminationist policy. The exaggerated beliefs about the drug's
effects, social impact, and user population virtually dictated
this legal approach. During this entire, period, total
prohibition was sought through the use of heavier and heavier
penalties until even first-time possession was a felony in every
jurisdiction, and second possession offenses generally received a
mandatory minimum sentence without parole or probation. Yet the
last few years have seen society little by little abandoning the
eliminationist policy in favor of a containment policy. </p>

<p>Under the total prohibition umbrella, this containment policy
has been implemented by a unique patchwork of legislation,
informal prosecutorial policy and judicial practice. Possession
is now almost everywhere a misdemeanor. Although some term of
incarceration remains as a penalty for possessors, it is
generally not meted out to young first offenders or to possessors
of small -amounts. Instead, most such offenders are dismissed or
informally diverted to agencies outside the criminal system by
those within the system who are trying to help them avoid the
stigma of a criminal record. </p>

<p>Offenders who are processed within the criminal justice system
generally receive fines and/or probation. In many jurisdictions,
enforcement officials make little or no effort to enforce
possession proscriptions, concentrating instead on major
trafficking. Possessors are generally arrested only when they are
indiscreet or when marihuana is found incident to questioning or
apprehension resulting from some other violation. From our
surveys, state and federal, we have found that only minimal
effort is made to investigate marihuana possession cases. </p>

<p>Such a tendency is a reflection of the adoption of a
containment policy. By acting only when marihuana appears above
ground, enforcement officials are helping to keep its use
underground. The shift away from the elimination policy has been
matched by a similar shift in legal implementation, but the
distinctive feature of the total prohibition scheme still
remains: all marihuana-related behavior, including possession for
personal use within the home, is prohibited by criminal law. </p>

<p>Is such a response an appropriate technique for achieving the
social control policy we outlined above? The key question for our
purposes is whether total criminal prohibition is the most
suitable or effective way to discourage use and whether it
facilitates or inhibits a concentration on the reduction and
treatment of irresponsible use. We are convinced that total
prohibition frustrates both of these objectives for the following
reasons.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1. Application of the Criminal Law to Private Possession Is
Philosophically Inappropriate</b> </p>

<p>With possession and use of marihuana, we are dealing with a
form of behavior which occurs generally in private where a person
possesses the drug for his own use. The social impact of this
conduct is indirect, arising primarily in cases of heavy or
otherwise irresponsible use and<br>
from the drugs symbolic aspects. We do not take the absolutist
position that society is philosophically forbidden from
criminalizing any kind of &quot;private&quot; behavior. The
phrase &quot;victimless crimes,&quot; like &quot;public, health
hazard, has become a rhetorical excuse for avoiding basic social
policy issues. We have chosen a discouragement policy on the
basis of our evaluation of the actual and potential individual
and social impact of marihuana use. Only now that we have done so
can we accord appropriate weight to the nation's philosophical
preference for individual privacy. </p>

<p>On the basis of this evaluation we believe that the criminal
law is too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in
the effort to discourage use. It implies an overwhelming
indictment of the behavior which we believe is not appropriate.
The actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great
enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private
behavior, a step which our society takes only 'with the greatest
reluctance.<br>
</p>

<p><b>2. Application of the Criminal Law Is Constitutionally
Suspect</b> </p>

<p>The preference for individual privacy reflected in the debate
over the philosophical limitations on the criminal law is also
manifested in our constitutional jurisprudence. Although no
court, to our knowledge, has held that government may not
prohibit private possession of marihuana, two overlapping
constitutional traditions do have important public policy
implications in this area. </p>

<p>The first revolves around the concept that in a free society,
the legislature may act only for public purposes. The
&quot;police powers&quot; of the states extend only to the
&quot;public health, safety and morals.&quot; In the period of
our history when the people most feared interference with their
rights by the government, it was generally accepted that this
broad power had an inherent limitation. For example, early
prohibitions of alcohol possession were declared unconstitutional
on the basis of reasoning such as that employed by the Supreme
Court of Kentucky in 1915 in the case of Commonwealth v.
Campbell: </p>

<p><i>It is not within the competency of government to invade the
privacy of the citizen's life and to regulate his conduct in
matters in which alone is concerned, or to prohibit him any
liberty the exercise which will not directly injure society.</i> </p>

<p>Noting that the defendant was &quot;not charged with having
the liquor in his possession for the purpose of selling it, or
even giving it to another,&quot; and that &quot;ownership and
possession cannot be denied when that ownership and possession is
not in itself injurious to the public,&quot; the Kentucky court
concluded that: </p>

<p><i>The right to use liquor for one's own comfort, if they use
it without injury to the public, is one of the citizen's natural
and inalienable rights.... We hold that the police power-vague
and wide and undefined as it is-has limits. . . .</i> </p>

<p>Even the perceived dangers of opium were not enough to
convince some members of the judiciary that the government could
prohibit possession. It is historically instructive to consider
these words, penned in 1890, by Judge Scott in Ah Lim v
Territory: </p>

<p><i>I make no question but that the habit of smoking opium may
be repulsive and degrading. That its effect would be to shatter
the nerves and destroy the intellect; and that it may tend to the
increase of the pauperism and crime. But there is a vast
difference between the commission of a single act, and a
confirmed habit. There is a distinction to be recognized between
the use and abuse of any article or substance.... If this act
must be held valid it is hard to conceive of any legislative
action affecting the personal conduct, or privileges of the
individual citizen, that must not be upheld.... The prohibited
act cannot affect the public in any way except through the
primary personal injury to the individual, if it occasions him
any injury. It looks like a new and extreme step under our
government in the field of legislation, if it really was passed
for any of the purposes upon which that character of legislation
can be sustained, if at all.</i> </p>

<p>As a matter of constitutional history, a second tradition, the
application of specific provisions in the Bill of Rights, has
generally replaced the notion of &quot;inherent&quot;
limitations. The ultimate effect is virtually the same, however.
The Fourth Amendment's proscription of &quot;unreasonable
searches and seizures&quot; reflects a constitutional commitment
to the value of individual privacy. The importance of the Fourth
Amendment to the entire, constitutional scheme was eloquently
described by Justice Brandeis in 1928 in the case of Olmstead v
U.S.: </p>

<p><i>The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure
conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized
the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and
his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure
and satisfaction of life are to be found in material things. They
sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts,
their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against
the Government, the right to be let alone-the most comprehensive
of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.<br>
</i></p>

<p>Although the Fourth Amendment is itself a procedural
protection, the value of privacy which it crystallizes is often
read in conjunction with other important values to set
substantive limits on legislative power. The Supreme Court, in
the case of Griswold vs. Connecticut, held in 1965 that
Connecticut could not constitutionally prohibit the use of birth
control devices by married persons. Although the Justices did not
agree completely on the reasons for their decision, Justice
Douglas stated in the opinion of the Court: </p>

<p><i>The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying
within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental
constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in
forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their
manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means of
having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such
a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often
applied by this Court, that a &quot;governmental purpose to
control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state
regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily
broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedom.&quot;
(citation omitted) Would we allow the police to search the sacred
precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of
contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of
privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.</i> </p>

<p>Four years later, the Supreme Court, in Stanley v. Georgia,
held that even though obscenity is not &quot;speech&quot;
protected by the First Amendment, a state cannot constitutionally
make private possession of obscene material a crime. The Court's
reasoning is revealed in the following language: </p>

<p><i>[The] right to receive information and ideas, regardless of
their social worth, (citation omitted), is fundamental to our
free society. Moreover, in the context of this case- a
prosecution for mere possession of printed or filmed matter in
the privacy of a person's own home-that right takes on an added
dimension. For also fundamental is the right to be free, except
in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental
intrusions into one's privacy ...<br>
</i></p>

<p>While the judiciary is the governmental institution most
directly concerned with the protection of individual liberties,
all policy-makers have a responsibility to consider our
constitutional heritage when framing public policy. Regardless of
whether or not the courts would overturn a prohibition of
possession of marihuana for personal use in the home, we are
necessarily influenced by the high place traditionally occupied
by the value of privacy in our constitutional scheme. </p>

<p>Accordingly, we believe that government must show a compelling
reason to justify invasion of the home in order to prevent
personal use of marihuana. We find little in marihuana's effects
or in its social impact to support such a determination.
Legislators enacting Prohibition did not find such a compelling
reason 40 years ago; and we do not find the situation any more
compelling for marihuana today.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Total Prohibition Is Functionally Inappropriate<br>
</b></p>

<p>Apart from the philosophical and constitutional constraints
outlined above, a total prohibition scheme carries with it
significant institutional costs. Yet it contributes very little
to the achievement of our social policy. In some ways it actually
inhibits the success of that policy. </p>

<p>The primary goals of a prudent marihuana social control policy
include preventing irresponsible use of the drug, attending to
the consequences of such use, and deemphasizing use in general.
Yet an absolute prohibition of possession and use inhibits the
ability of other institutions to contribute actively to these
objectives. For example, the possibility of criminal prosecution
deters users who are experiencing medical problems from seeking
assistance for fear of bring attention to themselves. In
addition, the illegality of possession and use creates
difficulties in achieving an open, honest educational program,
both in the schools and in the home. </p>

<p>In terms of the social policy objective of discouraging use of
the drug, the legal system can assist that objective in three
ways: first, by deterring people from use; second, by symbolizing
social opposition to use; and finally, by cutting off supply of
the drug. </p>

<p>The present illegal status of possession has not discouraged
an estimated 24 million people from trying marihuana or an
estimated eight million from continuing to use it. Our survey of
the country's state prosecuting attorneys shows that 53% of them
do not believe that the law has more than a minimal deterrent
effect in this regard. Moreover, if the present trend toward
passive enforcement of the marihuana law continues, the law
ultimately will deter only indiscreet use, a result achieved as
well by a partial prohibition scheme and with a great deal more
honesty and fairness. </p>

<p>A major attraction of the law has been its symbolic value.
Yet, society can symbolize its desire to discourage marihuana use
in many other, less restrictive ways. The warning labels on
cigarette packages serve this purpose, illustrating that even a
regulatory scheme could serve a discouragement policy. During
Prohibition, the chosen statutory implementation symbolized
society's opposition to the use of intoxicating beverages; yet,
most jurisdictions did not think it necessary to superimpose a
proscription of possession for personal use in the home. </p>

<p>Finally, prohibiting possession for personal use has no
substantive relation to interdicting supply. A possession penalty
may make enforcement of proscriptions against sale a little
easier, but we believe this benefit is of minimal importance in
light of its costs. </p>

<p>The law enforcement goal repeatedly stated at both the federal
and state levels has been the elimination of supply and the
interdiction of trafficking. These avowed aims of law enforcement
make sense, since they are the most profitable means of employing
its manpower and resources in this area. </p>

<p>Indeed, the time consumed in arresting Possessors is
inefficiently used when contrasted with the same amount of time
invested in apprehending major dealers. Although a credible
effort to eliminate supply requires prohibitions of importation,
sale and possession-with intent-to-sell, the enforcement of a
proscription of possession for personal use is minimally
productive. </p>

<p>As noted, most law enforcement officials, district attorneys
and judges recognize the ineffectiveness of the possession
penalty. as a deterrent. Its perpetuation results in the making
of what is commonly referred to as &quot;cheap&quot; cases that
have little or no impact on deterring sale. </p>

<p>The marihuana supply system can be viewed as pyramid with the
major bulk of marihuana entering the system at top of the pyramid
and then descending to the base which represents the user
population. Common sense dictates where law enforcement should
devote its efforts. To remove the profit from the traffic
requires arresting sellers, not users. The oft-heard argument
that the police need possession penalties to compel users to
reveal their sources is not convincing. &quot;Turning
informants&quot; at the base of the pyramid is of marginal value
and limited utility in reaching upwards toward the apex. Further,
the National Survey showed that 60% of the users don't
&quot;buy&quot; marihuana but get it from a friend. The volume of
traffic in the drug at these levels is at best minimal. </p>

<p>In short, personal possession arrests and even casual sales,
which account for more than 95% of the marihuana arrests at the
state local level, occur too low in the chain of distribution to
diminish supply very effectively. </p>

<p>In addition to the misallocation of enforcement resources,
another consequence of prohibition against possession for
personal use is the social cost of criminalizing large numbers of
users. Our empirical study of enforcement of state and federal
marihuana laws indicates that almost all of those arrested are
between the ages of 18 and 25, most have jobs or are in school,
and most have had no prior contact -with the criminal justice
system. The high social cost of stigmatizing such persons as
criminals is now generally acknowledged by the public at large as
well as by those in the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>According to the National Survey, 53% of the public was
unwilling to give young users a criminal record and 87% objected
to putting them in jail. The nation's judges expressed an
overwhelming disinclination to sentence and convict users for
marihuana possession. Of these judges only 13% thought it was
appropriate to incarcerate ail adult for possession and only 4%
would jail a juvenile for marihuana possession. This
disinclination is reflected in the low percentage of arrested
users who are convicted, and the even lower percentage who are
jailed. </p>

<p>Even among the nation's prosecutors, a substantial majority
favor the present trend toward avoiding incarceration for first
offenders. Most jurisdictions have devised informal procedures
for disposing of cases in lieu of prosecution. Our empirical
study shows that 48% of the adult cases, and 70% of the juvenile
cases, were dropped from the system at some point between arrest
and conviction. The picture displayed is one of a large
expenditure of police manpower to enforce a law most participants
further along the line are not anxious to apply. </p>

<p>Other disturbing consequences of laws proscribing possession
for personal use are the techniques required to enforce them.
Possession of marihuana is generally a private behavior; in order
to find it, the police many times must operate on the edge of
constitutional limitations. Arrests without probable cause,
illegal searches and selective enforcement occur often enough to
arouse concern about the integrity of the criminal process. </p>

<p>Yet another consequence of marihuana possession laws is the
clogging of judicial calendars. President Nixon has noted that
one of the major impediments to our nation's efforts to combat
serious crimes is the fact that the judicial machinery moves so
slowly. Swift -arrests, prosecution, trial and sentence would
significantly improve the deterrent effect of law. Yet the
judicial system is overloaded with petty cases, with public
drunkenness accounting for about 50% of all non-traffic offenses.
</p>

<p>In his March 1971 address to the National Conference on the
Judiciary, President Nixon said: </p>

<p>What can be done to break the logjam of justice today, to
ensure the right to a speedy trial-and to enhance respect for
law? We have to find ways to clear the courts of the endless
stream of &quot;victimless crimes&quot; that get in the way of
serious consideration of serious crimes. There are more important
matters for highly skilled judges and prosecutors than minor
traffic offenses, loitering and drunkenness. </p>

<p>To this list we would add marihuana possession, which accounts
for a rising percentage, of judicial caseloads. In Chicago alone,
during the last half of 1970, there were more than 4,000
possession arrests. </p>

<p>A final cost of the possession laws is the disrespect which
the laws and their enforcement engender in the young. Our youth
cannot understand why society chooses to criminalize behavior
with so little visible ill-effect or adverse social impact,
particularly when so many members of the law enforcement
community also question the same laws. These young people have
jumped the fence and found no cliff. And the disrespect for the
possession laws fosters a disrespect for all law and the system
in general. </p>

<p>On top of all this is the distinct impression among the youth
that police may use the marihuana laws to arrest people they
don't like for other reasons, whether it be their politics, their
hair style or their ethnic background. Whether or not such
selectivity actually exists, it is perceived to exist. </p>

<p>For all these reasons, we believe that the possession offense
is of little functional benefit to the discouragement policy and
carries heavy social costs, not the least of which is disrespect
and cynicism among some of the young. Accordingly, even under our
policy of discouraging marihuana use, the better method is
persuasion rather than prosecution. Additionally, with the sale
and use of more hazardous drugs on the increase, and crimes of
violence escalating, we do not believe that the criminal justice
system can afford the time and the costs of implementing the
marihuana possession laws. Since these laws are not mandatory in
terms of achieving the discouragement policy, law enforcement
should be allowed to do the job it is best able to do: handling
supply and distribution. </p>

<p>A criminal fine or similar penalty for possession has been
suggested as a means of alleviating some of the more glaring
costs of a total prohibitory approach yet still retaining the
symbolic disapproval of the criminal law. However, most of the
objections raised above would still pertain: the possibilities of
invasion of personal privacy and selective enforcement of the law
would continue; possessors would still be stigmatized as
criminals, incurring the economic and social consequences of
involvement with the criminal law; the symbolic status of
marihuana smoking as an anti-establishment act would be
perpetuated. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a fine most likely would deter use no more
than does the present possibility of incarceration. It would
continue to impede treatment for heavy and very heavy use and
would persist in directing law enforcement away from the policy's
essential aim which is to halt illegal traffic in the drug. </p>

<p>For all these reasons, we reject the total prohibition
approach and its variations.<br>
</p>

<p><b>REGULATION</b> </p>

<p>Another general technique for implementing the recommended
social policy is regulation. The distinguishing feature of this
technique is that it institutionalizes the availability of the
drug. By establishing a legitimate channel of supply -and
distribution, society can theoretically control the quality and
potency of the product. The major alternatives within this
approach lie in the variety of restraints which can be imposed on
consumption of the drug and on the informational requirements to
which its distribution can be subject. </p>

<p>We have given serious consideration to this set of
alternatives; however, we are unanimously of the opinion that
such a scheme, no matter how tightly it might restrict
consumption, is presently unacceptable.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme at this Time Would
Inevitably Signify Approval of Use</b> </p>

<p>In rejecting the total prohibition approach, we emphasized the
symbolic aspects. In essence, we do not believe prohibition of
possession for personal use is necessary to symbolize a social
policy disapproving the use. Theoretically, a tightly controlled
regulatory schemes with limited distribution outlets, significant
restraints on consumption prohibition of advertising and
compulsory labeling, could possibly symbolize such disapproval.
Our regulatory policy toward tobacco is beginning to slowly to
reflect a disapproval policy toward Cigarette smoking.
Nonetheless, given the social and historical context of such a
major shift in legal policy toward marihuana, we are certain that
such a change would instead symbolize approval of use, or at
least a position of neutrality. </p>

<p>The Commission is concerned that even neutrality toward use as
a matter of policy could invest an otherwise transient phenomenon
with the status of an accepted behavior. If marihuana smoking
were an already ingrained part of our culture, this objection
would be dispelled. However, we do not believe that this is the
case,. We are inclined to believe, instead, that the present
interest in marihuana is transient and will diminish in time of
its own accord once the major symbolic aspects of use are
deemphasized, leaving among our population only a relatively
small coterie of users. With this possibility in mind, we are
hesitant to adopt either a policy of neutrality or a regulatory
implementation of our discouragement policy. The law would
inevitably lose its discouragement character and would become
even more ambiguous in its rationale and its enforcement. </p>

<p>The effect of changing a social policy direction may be seen
with tobacco policy. In recent years, society has ostensibly
adopted a policy of discouraging cigarette smoking. This new
policy has been implemented primarily in the information area
through prohibition of some forms of advertising and through
compulsory labeling. Yet, the volume, of cigarettes used
increased last year. We believe that the failure of the new
policy results from the fact that it supplants one that formerly
approved use. This set of circumstances argues against any policy
which would be regarded as approval of use, including a
regulatory scheme. It is always extremely difficult to transform
a previously acceptable behavior into a disapproved behavior.<br>
</p>

<p><b>2. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme Might Generate a
Significant Public Health Problem<br>
</b></p>

<p>We noted above that institutionalizing availability of the
drug would inevitably increase the incidence of use, even though
that incidence might otherwise decrease. Of greater concern is
the prospect that a larger incidence of use would result in a
larger incidence of long term heavy and very heavy use of potent
preparations. </p>

<p>There are -now approximately 500,000 heavy users of less
potent preparations in this country, representing about 2% of
those who ever tried the drug. Even if the prevalence of -heavy
use remained the same in relation to those who ever used, this
at-risk population would inevitably increase under a regulatory
scheme. If the emotional disturbances found in very heavy hashish
users in other countries were to occur in this country, the
adverse social impact of marihuana use, now slight, would
increase substantially. </p>

<p>We have acknowledged that society, nonetheless, chose to run
such a risk in 1933, when Prohibition was repealed. But alcohol
use was already well-established in this society, and no
alternative remained other than a regulatory approach. In light
of our suspicion that interest in marihuana is largely transient,
it would be imprudent to run that risk for marihuana today.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme Would Exacerbate Social
Conflict and Frustrate a Deemphasis Policy</b> </p>

<p>A significant segment of the public on both sides of the issue
views marihuana and its &quot;legalization&quot; in a highly
symbolic way. Any attempt to adopt a regulatory approach now
would be counterproductive in this respect. The collision of
values resulting from such a dramatic shift of policy would
maintain the debate at a highly emotional level and would
perpetuate the tendency to perceive marihuana use as a symbol of
the struggle between two conflicting philosophies.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. Not Enough Is Known About Regulatory Models In This Area</b>
</p>

<p>Advocates of legalization of marihuana are often inclined to
propose a licensing scheme or an &quot;alcohol model&quot;
without offering a specific program of regulation taking all the
variables into account. Responsible policy planning cannot be so
cursory. Consequently, we have given serious study to the many
issues presented by such a scheme and to the nation's experience
with other drug licensing schemes. On the basis of our inquiry,
we are convinced that such a step should not be taken unless a
realistic assessment of the efficacy of existing schemes and
their potential application to marihuana indicates it would be
successful. Such an assessment raises a number of disturbing
questions. </p>

<p>The regulatory approaches which this nation has used in the
cases of alcohol and tobacco have failed to accomplish two of
their most important objectives: the minimization of excessive
use and the limitation of accessibility to the young. Despite the
warning and restraints on distribution and consumption, more than
50 million Americans smoke cigarettes regularly, and more than
nine million Americans are &quot;problem&quot; drinkers. We have
previously cited data indicating how many of our children begin
habits which have been legally forbidden to them. Since the young
user and the chronic user of marihuana are of primary concern to
our public health officials, the lack of success with alcohol and
tobacco discourages an assumption that the regulation of supply
would minimize use by the younger generation. </p>

<p>Another important purpose of a regulatory scheme is to channel
the product through a controlled system of supply and
distribution. In that way the quality and quantity of the
substance can be regulated. The efficacy of such a scheme as
applied to marihuana is questionable. </p>

<p>Cannabis can be grown easily almost anywhere in the United
States with little or no human assistance. Even if a legitimate
source of supply were established, it is likely that many persons
would choose to ignore the legitimate source and grow their own,
the purity of which would not be in question. If such a practice
were illegal, the necessity for a concerted governmental
eradication program is raised, which would involve a monumental
law enforcement effort. According to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, there are presently an estimated five million acres
of wild marihuana growing in this country and an undetermined
number of acres under cultivation. </p>

<p>Yet, if such a practice were not forbidden, the
revenue-raising, product-control and consumption-restriction
features of a regulatory scheme would be threatened. Instructive
to note is the fact that intensive regulation of alcoholic
beverage production 'has not eliminated illicit production.
During 1970, in fact, 5,228 illegal stills were destroyed by the
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the U.S. Treasury and
5,279 persons were arrested. In 1971, 3,327 illegal stills were
destroyed and 5,512 persons were arrested. </p>

<p>Another disturbing question is raised by the issue of potency
regulation. Most advocates of legalization stipulate potency
limitations as one feature of their scheme. Presumably they would
limit the THC content of the regulated product. This is not an
easy undertaking. Especially when cannabis is so easily grown and
a black market is so easily created, we are dubious about the
success of a regulatory scheme distributing only a product with
low THC content. Again, attention must be paid the prospect of
increased hashish use under a regulatory scheme; merely
stipulating potency control is not sufficient. As we noted in
Chapter II, the heavy, long-term use of hashish is a source of
major concern to the Commission from both private and public
health standpoints. </p>

<p>These are a few of the problems confronting the policy-maker
if be seeks to devise an effective regulatory system of
distribution for what is, in fact, a universally common plant.
Our doubts about the efficacy of existing regulatory schemes,
together with an uncertainty about the permanence of social
interest in marihuana and the approval inevitably implied by
adoption of such a scheme, all impel us to reject the regulatory
approach as an appropriate implementation of a discouragement
policy at the present time. </p>

<p>Future policy planners might well come to a different
conclusion if further study of existing schemes suggests a
feasible model; if responsible use of the drug does indeed take
root in our society; if continuing scientific and medical
research uncovers no long-term ill effects; if potency control
appears feasible and if the passage of time and the adoption of a
rational social policy sufficiently desymbolizes marihuana so
that availability is not equated in the public mind with
approval. <br>
</p>

<p><b>PARTIAL PROHIBITION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The total prohibition scheme was rejected primarily because no
sufficiently compelling social reason, predicated on existing
knowledge, justifies intrusion by the criminal justice system
into the private lives of individuals who use marihuana. The
Commission is of the unanimous opinion that marihuana use is not
such a grave problem that individuals who smoke marihuana, and
possess it for that purpose, should be subject to criminal
procedures. On the other hand, we have also rejected the
regulatory or legalization scheme because it would
institutionalize availability of a drug which has uncertain
long-term effects and which may be of transient social interest. </p>

<p>Instead we recommend a partial prohibition scheme which we
feel has the following benefits: </p>

<p>Symbolizing a continuing societal discouragement of use; </p>

<p>Facilitating the deemphasis of marihuana essential to
answering dispassionately so many of the unanswered questions; </p>

<p>Permitting a simultaneous medical, educational, religious, and
parental effort to concentrate on reducing irresponsible use and
remedying its consequences; </p>

<p>Removing the criminal stigma and the threat of incarceration
from a widespread behavior (possession for personal use) which
does not warrant such treatment; </p>

<p>Relieving the law enforcement community of the responsibility
for enforcing a law of questionable utility, and one which they
cannot fully enforce, thereby allowing concentration on drug
trafficking and crimes against persons and property; </p>

<p>Relieving the judicial calendar of a large volume of marihuana
possession cases which delay the processing of more serious
cases; and </p>

<p>Maximizing the flexibility of future public responses as new
information comes to light.<br>
</p>

<p>No major change is required in existing law to achieve all of
these benefits. In general, we recommend only a decriminalization
of possession of marihuana for personal use on both the state and
federal levels. The major features of the recommended scheme are
that: production and distribution of the drug would remain
criminal activities as would possession with intent to distribute
commercially; marihuana would be contraband subject to
confiscation in public places; and criminal sanctions would be
withdrawn from private use and possession incident to such use,
but, at the state level, fines would be imposed for use in
public.* </p>

<p>Specifically, we recommend the following statutory schemes.<br>
</p>

<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FEDERAL LAW<br>
</b></p>

<p>Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act
of 1970, Congress provided the following scheme with respect to
marihuana, by which was meant only the natural plant and its
various parts, not the synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) : </p>

<ul>
    <li>Cultivation, importation and exportation, and sale or
        distribution for profit of marihuana are all felonies
        punishable by imprisonment for up to five years for a
        first offense and by up to 10 years for a second offense
        (the available penalty is doubled for sale to a minor). </li>
    <li>Possession of marihuana with intent to distribute is a
        felony punishable by imprisonment for up to five years
        for the first offense and by up to 10 years for a second
        offense. </li>
    <li>Possession of marihuana for personal use is a misdemeanor
        punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine
        for first offense and by up to two years in jail and a
        $2,000 fine for second offense (expungement of criminal
        record is available for first offenders). </li>
    <li>Transfer of a small amount of marihuana for no
        remuneration is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one
        year in jail and a $1,000 fine for first offense and by
        up to two years in jail and a $2,000 fine for second
        offense (Congress singled out marihuana in this way to
        allow misdemeanor treatment of casual transfers and
        permitted first offender treatment, as allowed for
        possession for personal use). </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission recommends only the following changes in
federal law:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>POSSESSION OF MARIHUANA FOR PERSONAL USE WOULD NO LONGER
        BE AN OFFENSE, BUT MARIHUANA POSSESSED IN PUBLIC WOULD
        REMAIN CONTRABAND SUBJECT TO SUMMARY SEIZURE AND
        FORFEITURE. </li>
    <li>CASUAL DISTRIBUTION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
        REMUNERATION, OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING
        PROFIT WOULD NO LONGER BE AN OFFENSE.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission further recommends that federal law be
supplemented to provide:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A PLEA OF MARIHUANA INTOXICATION SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE
        TO ANY CRIMINAL ACT COMMITTED UNDER ITS INFLUENCE, NOR
        SHALL PROOF OF SUCH INTOXICATION CONSTITUTE A NEGATION OF
        SPECIFIC INTENT. <br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>* Commissioners Rogers, Congressman from Florida, and Carter,
Congressman from Kentucky, agree with the Commission's selection
of a discouragement policy and also agree that criminalization
and incarceration of individuals for possessing marihuana for
their own use is neither necessary nor desirable as a means of
implementing that policy. </p>

<p>At the same time, both Commissioners feel that the contraband
concept is not a sufficiently strong expression of social
disapprobation and would recommend in addition a civil fine for
possession of any amount of marihuana in private or in public. </p>

<p>Both Commissioners feel that the civil fine clearly symbolizes
societal disapproval and is a simple mechanism for law
enforcement authorities to carry out. If a person is found by a
law enforcement officer to be in possession of marihuana, the
officer would issue such person a summons to appear in court on a
fixed day. Although a warrant would not issue for Research of a
private residence unless there were probable cause to believe a
criminal offense was being committed, a police officer
legitimately present for other reasons could issue a civil
summons for violation of the &quot;possession&quot; proscription.<br>
</p>

<p>Commissioners Rogers and Carter believe that the legal system
must be utilized directly to discourage the person from using
marihuana rather than being utilized only indirectly as In the
case of contraband. </p>

<p>This civil fine would not be reflected in a police record, nor
would it be considered a criminal act for purposes of future job
consideration, either in the private sector or for government
service. </p>

<p>Agreeing with the other Commissioners that the casual
transfers of marihuana for no profit should be treated in the
same manner as possession for one's own use, Congressmen Rogers
and Carter do not agree that it should extend to transfers
involving remuneration. They prefer the limiting language of the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 which
does not include the term &quot;or insignificant remuneration not
involving a profit.&quot; </p>

<p>Apart from the addition of the civil fine to the contraband
recommendation in the respects set out above, Congressmen Carter
and Rogers are in complete agreement with the statutory
recommendations set out in the Report. </p>

<p>Commissioner Ware concurs completely with the statements made
by Congressmen Rogers and Carter but wishes to reemphasize that
the social policy and legal scheme adopted is applicable only to
marihuana and should not be construed to embrace other
psychoactive drugs. The policy set forth in this Report, subject
to the already noted comments of the two Congressional
Commissioners, makes sense for marihuana on the basis of what is
known about the drug and in the absence of any conclusive showing
which would verify some of the anecdotal law enforcement
testimony heard by the Commission regarding criminal behavior
exhibited while under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Commissioner Ware feels that some penalty short of
criminalizing the user, such as a civil fine or some type of
intensive drug education, will act as a positive deterrent toward
minimizing the incidence of marihuana use especially among the
young. Further, he is opposed to the use of any drug for the
express purpose of getting intoxicated, and includes alcohol
within this category. The Commissioner feels that what is needed
is an internalizing of discipline among our citizenry, with the
legal system assisting this process through the use of
disincentives. </p>

<p>Commissioners Hughes, Senator from Iowa, and Javits, Senator
from New York, feel that the Commission has taken a major, highly
laudable step in recommending that the private use of marihuana
be taken out of the criminal justice system. They concur in its
threshold judgment that overall social policy regarding this drug
should seek to discourage use, while concentrating primarily on
the prevention of irresponsible use. They disagree, however, with
three specific recommendations relating to the implementation of
this discouragement policy. </p>

<p>First, they would eliminate entirely the contraband provision
from the partial prohibitory model adopted by the Commission.
They want it eliminated first because its legal implications are
confusing and the subject of disagreement even among lawyers.
Whether or not possession of a given substance is criminal,
possession of material designated as contraband makes that
possession unlawful. Also, marihuana designated as contraband
would be subject to government search and seizure, even though
the underlying possession is no longer criminal. The
provision-which does not apply to marihuana held for personal use
within the home is considered by both Commissioners to be an
unnecessary &quot;symbol&quot; of the discouragement policy. It
will not foster elimination of the misunderstanding and mistrust
which is a hallmark of our current marihuana policy. </p>

<p>Commissioner Hughes and Javits seek to eliminate it also
because as a practical matter it serves no useful law enforcement
purpose within the overall partial prohibitory model. If
marihuana held for personal use within the home is not
contraband, why should marihauna held for personal use within
one's automobile be contraband? The area of operation of the
contraband provision is extremely narrow. If one possesses more
than one ounce of marihuana in public, it may be seized without
regard to the contraband doctrine since such possession is a
criminal violation. </p>

<p>Since the contraband provision does not apply to marihuana
possession and use in private, the only effective area covered by
the contraband provision is the area of possession in public of
less than one ounce. The Commission has chosen to remove the
stigma of the criminal sanction in this kind of case. To impose
instead a contraband provision, which it is argued is in the
nature of a civil &quot;in rem&quot; seizure which does not
operate against the person, is to cloud the issue and to weaken
the force of the basic decriminalization. A persuasive
justification simply has not been made. </p>

<p>Both Commissioners seek to eliminate it also because they
believe that the voice of the Commission should be loud and clear
that the preservation of the right of privacy is of paramount
importance and cannot be casually jeopardized in the pursuit of
some vague public or law enforcement interest which has not been
defined and justified with clarity and precision. </p>

<p>The second area of disagreement with the Commission's
recommendations concerns the casual distribution of marihuana and
the not-for-profit sale. As understood:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) The totally donative transfer is not subject to criminal
penalty, regardless of where it takes place. </p>

<p>(2) The transfer of small amounts for insignificant
remuneration not involving a profit is not subject to criminal
penalty (except if it is accomplished in public, in which case it
is subject to criminal sanction), but (3) The transfer of
&quot;large amounts&quot; for &quot;significant&quot;
remuneration not involving a profit is subject to criminal
penalty. </p>

<p>Footnote 4 on page 158 of the Report, the Commission refers to
a Report of The Senate Judiciary Committee on the Comprehensive
Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. In substance, it
implies that within the meaning of the Act, transfers of -more
than one or two marihuana cigarettes in return for 50 cents or
one dollar to cover cost are not intended to be covered as casual
transfers, but rather are to be treated as unlawful sales. </p>

<p>Commissioners Hughes and Javits feel that the Commission has
failed to set forth a clear standard which will adequately inform
the public of their obligations under the law. The recommendation
and its discussion in the Report are confusing and fail to
provide the individual with sufficient guidance to allow him to
act without having to dodge in and out of illegality. It also
undermines a basic, stated objective of the Commission i.e., to
concentrate the weight of the criminal sanction upon significant
supply and distribution activities, rather than upon casual
consumption. </p>

<p>Moreover, proscribing even the most casual not-for-profit
transfers when they occur in public is, in their opinion, wrong.
Such transfers are necessarily incident to private possession and
use. To hold that they should be subject to criminal sanction is
logically inconsistent with the Commission's rationale and
recommendation on decriminalization of such private activities. </p>

<p>Instead, both Commissioners recommend that all not-for-profit
sales be excluded from the criminal sanction. It Is fundamental
that there be a clear separation between the serious, commercial,
profit-making-seller, or &quot;pusher&quot; as he is known, and
the individual who merely splits the cost of a reasonable supply
of the drug with his friends or acquaintances. </p>

<p>Thirdly, exception is taken to the retention of the criminal
sanction on public possession of more than one ounce. The
individual who buys an ounce and a half would be a criminal when
he buys on the corner, when he puts it in his pocket, when he
gets in his car and drives home, when he is on his doorstep, but
not when he crosses the threshold of his home. Commission policy
should direct the attention of the law enforcement community to
the person who sells the drug for profit, and not to the person
who uses the drug privately. </p>

<p>If an individual has more than a few ounces in his possession,
and there is probable cause to believe that he intends to sell it
for profit, that activity is already covered under the
Commission's recommendation that possession with intent to sell
is illegal. Therefore, there is no need to further proscribe
simple public possession. </p>

<p>All the component parts of the recommended policy of the
Commission should be consistent with its objective of
non-interference with casual transfers and possession and use
which is essentially and fundamentally private and personal. </p>

<p>The contraband device, the not-for-profit sale, and public
possession of some reasonable amount which should be presumed to
be necessarily incident to private use should all be removed from
the ambit of legal sanction. To do so would be to strike down
&quot;symbols&quot; of a public policy which had never been
adequately justified in the first instance. Such steps would in
no way jeopardize the firm determination of the Commission that
the use of marihuana ought to be discouraged. <br>
<br>
</p>

<p><a name="Lastedit"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STATE LAW<br>
</b></a></p>

<p>Under existing state marihuana laws, cultivation distribution
and possession with intent to distribute are generally felonies
and in most states possession for personal use is a misdemeanor.
The Commission strongly recommends uniformity of state laws and,
in this regard, endorses the basic premise of the Uniform
Controlled Substances Act drafted by the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. The following are our
recommendations for a uniform statutory scheme for marihuana, by
which we mean, as under existing federal law, only the natural
cannabis plant and its various parts, not the synthetic
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) <br>
</p>

<p><b>Existing Law<br>
</b></p>

<p>CULTIVATION, SALE OR DISTRIBUTION FOR PROFIT AND POSSESSION
WITH INTENT TO SELL WOULD REMAIN FELONIES (ALTHOUGH WE DO
RECOMMEND UNIFORM PENALTIES).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Private Activities<br>
</b></p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PRIVATE OF MARIHUANA FOR PERSONAL USE WOULD NO
LONGER BE AN OFFENSE. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION IN PRIVATE OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
REMUNERATION OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING A PROFIT
WOULD NO LONGER BE AN OFFENSE. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Public Activities<br>
</b></p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PUBLIC OF ONE OUNCE OR UNDER OF MARIHUANA WOULD
NOT BE AN OFFENSE, BUT THE MARIHUANA WOULD BE CONTRABAND SUBJECT
TO SUMMARY SEIZURE AND FORFEITURE. </p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PUBLIC OF MORE THAN ONE OUNCE OF MARIHUANA WOULD
BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION IN PUBLIC OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
REMUNERATION OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING A PROFIT
WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>PUBLIC USE OF MARIHUANA WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE
BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>DISORDERLY CONDUCT ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC USE OF OR
INTOXICATION BY MARIHUANA WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP
TO 60 DAYS IN JAIL, A FINE OF $100, OR BOTH. <br>
</p>

<p>OPERATING A VEHICLE OR DANGEROUS INSTRUMENT WHILE UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF MARIHUANA WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP TO
ONE YEAR IN JAIL, A FINE OF UP TO $1,000, OR BOTH, AND SUSPENSION
OF A PERMIT TO OPERATE SUCH A VEHICLE OR INSTRUMENT FOR UP TO 180
DAYS. </p>

<p>A PLEA OF MARIHUANA INTOXICATION SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE TO ANY
CRIMINAL ACT COMMITTED UNDER ITS INFLUENCE NOR SHALL PROOF OF
SUCH INTOXICATION CONSTITUTE A NEGATION OF SPECIFIC INTENT. </p>

<p>A PERSON WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY LIABLE IN CIVIL COURT FOR ANY
DAMAGE TO PERSON OR PROPERTY WHICH HE CAUSED WHILE UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The recommended federal approach is really a restatement of
existing federal policy. From official testimony and record
evaluation, we know that the federal law enforcement authorities,
principally the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
and the Bureau of Customs, do not concentrate their efforts on
personal possession cases. The avowed purpose of both Bureaus is
to eliminate major traffickers and sources of supply. For the
most part, the federal agencies have left possession enforcement
to the states. Underlying this approach is a need -to maximize
the use of enforcement resources for major priorities and allow
the states, in exercising their &quot;police powers,&quot; to
assume the responsibility for local activities, including
possession for personal use. </p>

<p>By withdrawing the criminal sanction from possession for
personal use we are, in effect, codifying official policy. In
addition, such a scheme follows the model chosen for alcohol in
the Volstead Act, and also revives the approach taken by Congress
in the Drug Abuse Control Amendments (DACA) of 1965. We are in
agreement with the original thrust of DACA, when Congress brought
previously uncontrolled drugs, LSD, barbiturates and
amphetamines, under control but did not assess criminal penalties
for possession for personal use. </p>

<p>Instead, Congress placed on the prosecution the burden of
proof that the possession was for purposes of sale. Regardless of
whether or not Congress was wise in imposing a penalty in 1968
for possession for personal use, a subject we will consider in
our next Report, we think the original DACA concept is
enlightened where marihuana is concerned. </p>

<p>At the same time, present federal law classifies marihuana as
contraband, and this feature should be maintained. The contraband
concept serves the discouragement policy in two ways: it assists
the removal of supply from the market and it symbolizes a
continuing societal opposition to use. Accordingly, if a person
is found in possession of marihuana in public and the government
is unable to prove any intent to sell, it may nevertheless seize
the marihuana and confiscate it is contraband. </p>

<p>The contraband provision would apply only to possession in
public and would not extend to possession for personal use in the
home. During Prohibition, the Federal Government and most of the
states employed a similar statutory limitation. For example, the
Volstead Act provided that a private dwelling could not be
searched &quot;unless it is being used for the unlawful sale of
intoxicating liquor. . . .&quot; I The impact of this contraband
concept is that marihuana possessed or found in public can be
summarily seized by law enforcement officials and forfeited to
the state for subsequent destruction .2 The criminal justice
system is not involved in the process. The individual receives no
record of any kind; he simply loses the economic value of the
marihuana.3 </p>

<p>With regard to the casual distribution of small amounts of
Marihuana for no remuneration or insignificant remuneration not
involving a profit we are following the approach taken in the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 which
in essence treats such casual transfers as the functional
equivalent of possession. In doing so, Congress recognized that
marihuana is generally shared among friends and that not all
people who distribute marihuana are &quot;Pushers.&quot;* </p>

<p>' 39. Unlawful P0ssession of liquor or property designed for
manufacture thereof ; search warrants. It shall be unlawful to
have or possess any liquor or property designed for the
manufacture of liquor intended for use in violating this chapter
or which has been so used, and no property rights shall exist in
any such liquor or property. A search warrant may issue as
provided in [sections 611 to 631 and 633 of Title 181 and such
liquor, the containers thereof, and such property so seized shall
be subject to such disposition as the court may make thereof. if
it is found that such liquor or property was so unlawfully held
or possessed, or had been so unlawfully used, the liquor, and all
property designed for the unlawful manufacture of liquor, shall
be destroyed, unless the court shall otherwise order. No search
warrant shall issue to search any private dwelling occupied as
such unless it is being used for unlawful sale of intoxicating
liquor, or unless it is in part used for some business purpose
such as a store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boarding
'house. 'Me term &quot;private dwelling&quot; shall be construed
to include the room or rooms used and occupied not transiently
but solely as a residence in an apartment house, hotel or
boarding house. The property seized on any such warrant shall not
lie taken from the officer seizing the same on any writ of
replevin or other like process. (Oct. 28, 1919, e. 85, Title 11,
 25, 41 Stat. 315) </p>

<p>'The federal and state provisions presently in force regarding
the seizure and forfeiture of an automobile transporting
marihuana would no longer be applicable. They would still remain
in force for other controlled drugs classified as contraband. </p>

<p>3 See the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter, Ware, Hughes
and Javits expressed in the footnote on pages 151-156.<br>
<br>
The accuracy of Congress' appraisal is underscored by the
National Survey. When people who had used marihuana were asked
how they first obtained the drug, 61% of the adults and 76% of
the youth responded that it had been given to them. Only 4% of
the adults and 8% of the youth said that they had bought it. When
asked who their source had been, 67% of the adults and 85% of the
youth responded that it had been a friend, acquaintance or family
member. </p>

<p>The close association between the concepts of casual transfer
and personal possession is also underscored by the fact that 56%
of the prosecutors in our survey thought that the present law did
not deter casual transfer at all or deterred it only minimally. </p>

<p>With regard to importation and exportation, we recommend no
change in existing law and make the following observations.
First, the United States must maintain its international standing
and, as a member of the community of nations, this country should
do everything in its power to restrict the exportation of
marihuana to other countries and to penalize such international
traffic. </p>

<p>As to importation of marihuana, the most effective way to
discourage use is to cut off supply at the top of the pyramid.
Recognizing that most of the marihuana consumed in the United
States comes from abroad, we feel that the Bureau of Customs at
the borders should have all necessary authority to halt and
interdict supplies intended for consumption in this country.
There has been a long-standing practice of excepting ports and
borders from procedural rules applying within the United States.
One example is that Customs officials are allowed to search
without the showing of probable cause, even though such a showing
is mandatory for searches conducted within the United States. We
can see a legitimate reason for continuing this policy. <br>
</p>

<p>*In considering this relationship, the Senate, in the Report
of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate
regarding S. 3246 (a precursor bill to the new Federal law)
stated:<br>
</p>

<p>The language &quot;distributes a small amount of marihuana for
no remuneration or insignificant remuneration not involving a
profit&quot; as contained in section 501 (c) (4) is intended to
cover the type of situation where a college student makes a
quasi-donative transfer of one or two marihuana cigarettes and
receives 50 cents or a dollar in exchange to cover the cost of
the marihuana. </p>

<p>Transfers of larger quantities in exchange for larger amounts
of money, or transfers for profit, are not intended to be covered
by this section, but rather are to be covered by section 501 (c)
(2) which deals 'with unlawful distribution. This language
sketches a prototype situation which the Committee had in mind;
however, the wording of the Federal Act and of our
recommendations is not intended to establish inflexible rules.
The objective in both provisions is to distinguish between
commercial sellers and casual distributors. Ultimately the courts
will have the responsibility of drawing this distinction
according to the evidence in individual cases. The recommended
provision intentionally establishes a loose standard not tied to
specific amounts of marihuana or money.<br>
</p>

<p>See also the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter, Ware,
Hughes and Javits expressed in the footnote on pages 151-156.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF STATE RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The states have primary responsibility for enforcing the
existing proscriptions against possession for personal use. Their
present efforts are designed mainly to keep marihuana use
contained, and in private. Such an enforcement policy is
consistent with our social policy approach, and is an appropriate
exercise of the states' obligations to maintain public order. So
while we see no need for criminal sanctions against possession
for personal use or against casual transfers, we recommend a
number of provisions for confining marihuana use to the home. </p>

<p>The first point is that even marihuana possessed for personal
use is subject to summary seizure and forfeiture if it is found
in public. This concept is now applicable under federal law which
we commend also to the states. In our view, the contraband
feature symbolizes the discouragement policy and will exert a,
major force in keeping use private. </p>

<p>Another means of symbolizing the discouragement policy which
has been suggested is the imposition of a civil fine on those
possessing marihuana outside the home for personal use.* Under
such an approach, a fine would be levied and processed outside
the criminal justice system. Essentially, possession of marihuana
would be the equivalent of a traffic offense in those
jurisdictions where such an offense is not criminal. </p>

<p>Such a scheme would accomplish little more than that achieved
under a partial prohibition scheme. Warrants would presumably not
be issued for searches of private residences, and possession
offenses would be detected only by accident or if the offender
uses the drug in public. The more direct way to confront such
behavior is a penalty against public use. </p>

<p>A further problem with the civil fine approach lies in the
area, of non-payment of the fine. With traffic tickets, or with
civil fines levied against industrial polluters, society can
compel compliance by withdrawing its permission to engage in
regulated activity. For example, it can revoke the motorists'
license to drive or the polluters' license to do business within
the state. In short, the state has remedies beyond the criminal
law to achieve its policy goal. The same would not be true for
the marihuana user and enforceability of the statute would
ultimately require court action.<br>
</p>

<p>*See the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter and Ware
expressed in the footnote on pages 151-153. <br>
</p>

<p>As we have suggested, a central feature, of our statutory
approach at the state, level would be a vigorously enforced
prohibition of public use. No intoxicant should be used in
public, both because it may offend others and because the user is
risking irresponsible behavior if he should be under its
influence in public. Moreover, where marihuana is concerned,
continuing societal disapproval requires that the behavior occur
only in private if at all. Public use, under the proposed scheme,
would therefore be punishable by a fine of $100. </p>

<p>We also recognize the need for some prophylactic measure for
anticipating distribution, even though there may be no intent to
sell for profit. To this end, and in order to deter public use,
possession and transfer, we have drawn a line at one ounce of
marihuana. Possession in public of more than this amount would be
punishable by a fine of $100. </p>

<p>For these same reasons, we believe the states should prohibit
all transfers outside the home, whether or not for remuneration.
A transfer for profit would be a felony, as under present law. A
casual transfer of a small amount would be punishable by a fine
of $100. </p>

<p>Taken together, the contraband feature, the proscriptions of
public use and public possession of more than an ounce (even if
for personal use) and the prohibition of public transfers will
reflect the discouragement policy underlying the entire, scheme. </p>

<p>The remaining set of recommendations alms at irresponsible
behavior under the influence of marihuana. Whatever the precise
legal scheme employed, these provisions should be included. </p>

<p>First, the &quot;drunk and disorderly&quot; statutes presently
in force in the states are useful tools for maintaining public
order. We would suggest similar statutes in the case of
marihuana, punishing offenders by up to 60 days in jail, a fine
of $100, or both. Law enforcement authorities must have a means
to halt antisocial behavior exhibited incidental to marihuana
use. </p>

<p>The second aspect of irresponsible behavior is the operation
of automobiles, other vehicles, or any potentially dangerous
instrument while under the influence of marihuana. Such behavior
is gross negligence in itself, risking harm to others
unnecessarily. In addition to penalizing a person who
&quot;drives under the influence&quot; as a serious misdemeanant,
we would impose absolute civil liability on anyone who harms the
person or property of another while under the influence of
marihuana. </p>

<p>Finally, no one should be able to limit his criminal
accountability by alleging that he was under the influence of
marihuana at the time of the crime. Under both federal and state
law, the defendant should not be able to negate the mental
element of &quot;specific intent,&quot; which some offenses
carry, by pleading that he was under the influence of marihuana
and was therefore unable to have formed such an intent. Unlike
many users of heroin, the user of marihuana is not physically
dependent on the drug. The use of the drug is usually a matter of
choice. Although we believe on the basis of available evidence
that there is no causal connection between marihauna use and
crime, we would under no circumstances allow a person to escape
the consequences of his actions by hiding behind the cloak of
marihuana use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Having discussed our recommended scheme at the federal and
state levels, we think it useful to answer some objections we
anticipate will be raised. Possible objections are:<br>
</p>

<p>1. Partial prohibition is not a sufficient reflection of the
discouragement policy. </p>

<p>2. Partial prohibition is logically inconsistent. </p>

<p>3. A possession penalty is necessary for effective enforcement
of sale proscriptions. </p>

<p>4. Partial prohibition won't &quot;work&quot; for marihuana
any more than it did for alcohol. </p>

<p>5. A possession offense is essential as a device for detecting
problem users. </p>

<p>6. Retention of a possession offense is required by our
international obligations. </p>

<p>7. A firm distinction should be drawn between less potent and
more potent preparations. <br>
</p>

<p><b>1. The Partial Prohibition Approach Is a Sufficient
Reflection of the Discouragement Policy<br>
</b></p>

<p>To those who would argue that a criminal sanction against use
is a necessary implementation of an abstentionist policy, we need
only respond that this country has not generally operated on that
assumption. We would be astounded if any person who lived during
the 1920's was not aware of a definite governmental policy
opposed to the use of alcohol. Yet, only five states prohibited
possession for personal use during Prohibition. The failure of
the 18th Amendment, the Volstead Act and 43 state prohibition
acts to criminalize private possession certainly did not signify
official approval of or neutrality toward alcohol use. </p>

<p>As we pointed out in Chapter 1, our nation has not generally
seen fit to criminalize private drug-related behavior; only in
the narcotics area was possession made a crime and marihuana was
brought within the narcotics framework because of unfounded
assumptions about its ill effects. We think it is time to correct
that mistaken departure from tradition with respect to marihuana.
As during Prohibition, the drug will remain contraband, and its
distribution will be prohibited.<br>
</p>

<p>Even as late as 1965, an abstentionist drug policy was not
thought to require prohibition for personal use. At that time,
Congress enacted the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, bringing LSD,
amphetamines and barbiturates under federal control. National
policy was clearly opposed to use of the hallucinogens and the
non-prescription use of amphetamines and barbiturates, yet
Congress did not impose a penalty for possession. Whether or not
Congress' subsequent decision in 1968, to impose such a penalty
was appropriate is an issue we will cover in our next Report
after analyzing the individual drugs controlled. The important
point now is that such a penalty is not a necessary feature of a
discouragement policy for marihuana, regardless of its, propriety
for other drugs.<br>
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>The Partial Prohibition Approach Is Not Logically
        Inconsistent </b></li>
</ol>

<p>It will. be, argued that a law which permits a person to
acquire and use marihuana but does not permit anyone to sell it
to him for profit is logically unsound. We do not agree. If we
had recommended a social policy of approval or neutrality toward
use, partial prohibition would indeed have been illogical.
However, under a discouragement policy, such a, scheme is
perfectly consistent. </p>

<p>Under partial prohibition, use is discouraged in three main
ways. First, law enforcement authorities will make a concerted
effort to reduce the supply of the drug. If a person wishes to
use marihuana, he will have to seek out a person to sell it to
him; and if his seller is in the business of distributing
marihuana for profit, the seller is violating the law. </p>

<p>Second, the user will have to confine his disapproved behavior
to the home. If lie uses the drug in public, he has committed an
offense; if lie possesses it in public, it may be summarily
seized as contraband. </p>

<p>Third, continuing efforts will be made by educators, public
health officials, and official government spokesmen to discourage
use. Realizing that educational efforts are not always
successful, we would hope for a sound program. In any event, the
law should be an ancillary rather than a focal consideration. </p>

<p>There is nothing theoretically Inconsistent about a scheme
which merely withdraws the criminal sanction from a behavior
which is not immoral but which is disapproved. The individual is
being allowed to make his own choice. Hopefully, he will choose
not to use marihuana. If he chooses to do so, however, he will
have to do so discreetly and in private. Apart from its ultimate
possession by the user, however, all marihuana-related activity
is prohibited. The drug is contraband from its initial growth,
through its harvest and distribution. It ceases to be contraband
only when possessed and used in the home.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Prohibition of All Possession Is Not Essential to
Prohibition of Sale<br>
</b></p>

<p>The other side of the &quot;inconsistency&quot; objection is
the argument by law enforcement officials that they cannot
adequately enforce proscriptions against sale without a
possession penalty. We disagree. We have already explained that
enforcement of a possession offense to some extent impedes the
effort to reduce supply. Possession cases are generally regarded
in the law enforcement community and by judges and prosecutors as
&quot;cheap&quot; cases. Few seriously contend that prosecution
of possessors reduces supply. </p>

<p>Some persons argue in response that the law should remain on
the books as a tool not against the possessor but against the
seller. They say that a possession offense is helpful in three
ways. First, a prosecution can be used as a bargaining tool to
encourage the possessor to reveal his source; this is called
&quot;turning an informant.&quot; Second, the police may know
that a person is a seller, but may not be able to prove either
sale or intent to sell, so they can at least charge such
suspected sellers with simple possession. </p>

<p>Third, a corollary of the second argument is that the
possession offense provides a useful tool in the &quot;plea
bargaining&quot; process. That is, a seller may plead guilty to
the lesser offense of possession, now generally a misdemeanor,
instead of running the risk of trial and conviction of the more
serious offense of sale, generally a felony. The prosecution may
accept such a &quot;bargain' if it is uncertain of the strength
of the case, to avoid delay in sentencing, to reduce judicial
backlog or in return for information from the defendant. </p>

<p>From an institutional standpoint, we do not find these
arguments persuasive. First, if a possession offense is on the
books, possession is a criminal activity. We oppose criminalizing
conduct when its purpose and intent is directed not toward that
conduct but toward another behavior. </p>

<p>In answer to the informant argument, the marihuana user (and
this may not be true of other drugs) is simply too low in the
distributional chain to help very much. As indicated earlier, the
National Survey shows most users receive their marihuana from
their friends or acquaintances either as a gift or at cost.
Rarely is the time spent on him or on his &quot;source&quot; a
fruitful allocation of the law enforcement official's time. Also,
it is institutionally improper to hold the criminal sanction over
a person to force him to talk, when we otherwise would be
unwilling to use that sanction. </p>

<p>As to the &quot;lack of proof&quot; and &quot;plea
bargaining&quot; arguments, we believe they challenge a
fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system. That is, under
our law, a person is not guilty just because the police think he
is guilty; his offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
to a judge or jury. If a possession offense were not on the
books, the police would have to gather enough evidence to convict
the seller of sale or of possession with intent to sell, and the
prosecution would have to convince the judge beyond a reasonable
doubt. The defendant, suspected seller or not, is entitled to due
process of law. </p>

<p>The &quot;lack of proof&quot; argument is nothing more than a
plea for an &quot;easy out&quot; when the police do not have
enough evidence. This simply represents an admission that law
enforcement officials want a possession offense which they can
apply selectively, to people whom they think, but cannot prove,
are sellers. Such a notion is inconsistent with the basic premise
of our system of equal treatment under the law. If
&quot;simple&quot; possession is not an offense for some, it is
not an offense for all. A &quot;known seller&quot; is entitled to
the same rights as anyone else: criminal conduct must be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not favor coddling criminals. We
do insist, as did the framers of the Constitution, that suspected
criminal behavior be proved.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. That Partial Prohibition Did Not &quot;Work&quot; For
Alcohol Doesn't Mean It Won't For Marihuana<br>
</b></p>

<p>Prohibition failed to achieve its avowed purpose of
eliminating the use of intoxicating liquors from American life.
Risking an oversimplification, we think two reasons were
essentially responsible for this failure: the unwillingness of a
substantial minority, and probably a majority, of the American
public to discard a habit deeply ingrained in their lives; and
the inability of the law enforcement community to eliminate the
bootlegging traffic which catered to this continuing demand. </p>

<p>As we have repeatedly noted, one of the reasons for adoption
of a partial prohibition approach is uncertainty about the extent
to which marihuana use is ingrained in American culture. Indeed,
adoption of partial prohibition is the best way to find out for
sure. If the social interest turns out to be only transient, this
policy will prove particularly appropriate. </p>

<p>Similarly, an increase in marihuana use may be prevented by a
concerted effort to eliminate major trafficking, the scope of
which is presently only a small fraction of Prohibition
bootlegging. We do not pretend that supply of a plant so easily
grown can be eliminated. However, an intensive effort to
eliminate commercial criminal enterprise should have some impact
on the extent of use. <br>
</p>

<p><b>5. The Possession Offense Is Not Required as a Detection
Device <br>
</b></p>

<p>In addition to their deterrent and symbolic functions, the
drug possession laws serve a third function not shared by most
other criminal laws. Like laws against public drunkenness, they
facilitate societal detection of drug-dependent persons. Ideally,
such persons, although apprehended by law enforcement
authorities, may be detained for purposes of treatment and
rehabilitation. </p>

<p>Whatever the merits of such an argument for the opiates and
alcohol, such an argument does not apply to marihuana. Only a
very small percentage of marihuana users are drug-dependent or
are in need of treatment. Their dependence is generally upon
multiple drug use, not on marihuana. In any event, the existence
of such a small population does not justify retention of the
possession offense as a detection device.<br>
</p>

<p><b>6. International Obligations Do Not Require Maintenance of
a Possession Penalty<br>
</b></p>

<p>Some have raised the possibility that removal of simple
possession criminal penalties would contravene this country's
obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961),
to which it became a signatory in March, 1967. We do not believe
the provisions of that Convention compel the criminalization of
possession for personal use. </p>

<p>Nowhere in the Convention are its Parties expressly required
to impose criminal sanctions on possession for personal use.
Article 4 requires Parties to &quot;take such legislative and
administrative measures as may be necessary . . . . to limit
exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production,
manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and
possession of drugs.&quot; Penal sanctions are not necessarily
included in this formulation. </p>

<p>Article 36, which deals specifically with penal provisions,
requires each party to adopt &quot;such measures as will
ensure&quot; that the listed activities, including possession,
&quot;shall be punishable offenses.&quot; Some have argued that
this provision requires prohibition of personal use. </p>

<p>However, from a comprehensive study of the history of the
Convention, the Commission has concluded that the word
&quot;possession&quot; in Article 36 refers not to possession for
personal use, but to possession as a link in illicit trafficking.
This interpretation is bolstered also by the failure to include
&quot;use&quot; in Article 36 even though it has been included in
Article 4. </p>

<p>Finally, we must consider Article 33, which provides that
&quot;the Parties shall not permit the possession of drugs except
under legal authority.&quot; This Article also does not require
the imposition of any sanctions on possession for personal use.
Experts consulted by the Commission have indicated that this
Article may, nevertheless, require that the Parties to limit
possession and use to medical and scientific purposes. To
affirmatively allow drugs to remain in the possession of persons
for non-medical use would in this view contravene Articles 4 and
33 to read together. From this perspective our international
obligations may require the classification of marihuana, as
contraband. For this reason, together with a desire to symbolize
our discouragement policy in a clear way, we have included the
contraband feature in our legal implementation scheme. </p>

<p>In conclusion, our reading of the Convention is that a Party
may legitimately decide to deal with non-medical use and
possession of marihuana through an educational program and
similar approaches designed to discourage use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>7. No Potency Distinction is Necessary at the Present Time</b>
</p>

<p>Following the approach taken in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970, we have drawn a line between
the natural cannabis plant and the synthetic
tetrahydrocannabinols. &quot;Marihuana&quot; is defined as any
and all parts of the natural plant. That we choose this approach
for purposes of statutory implementation does not mean that we
are unaware of the difference between the less potent and more
potent preparations of the natural plant. </p>

<p>As noted in Chapters 11 and III, the highest risk of cannabis
use to the individual and society arises from the very long-term,
very heavy use of potent preparations commonly called hashish. No
such pattern of use is known to exist in the United States today.
</p>

<p>The predominant pattern of use in the United States is
experimental or intermittent use of less potent preparations of
the drug. Even when hashish is used, the predominant pattern
remains the same. In addition, whatever the potency of the drug
used, individuals tend to smoke only the amount necessary to
achieve the desired drug effect. </p>

<p>Given the prevailing patterns of use, the Commission does not
believe it is essential to distinguish by statute between less
potent and more potent forms of the natural plant. Reinforcing
this judgment are the procedural and practical problems attending
an effort to do so. </p>

<p>If the criminal liability of ail individual user is dependent
on the THC content of the substance, neither lie nor the
arresting officer will know whether he has committed a crime
until an accurate scientific determination is made. Even if such
accurate determinations were feasible on a large scale, which is
not now the case, such after-the-fact liability is foreign to our
criminal laws. </p>

<p>Under present circumstances, then, a statutory line based on
potency is neither necessary nor feasible. We emphasize also that
any legal distinction is an artificial reflection of the
Commission's major concern: the heavy use of the drug over a long
term. The most emphatic element of official policy should be to
discourage such use, especially of the more potent preparations.
Unfortunately precise legislative formulations regarding the
amount of the drug presumed to be for personal use do not assist
this effort at all. Whether it is lawful to possess one ounce of
hashish or a proportionate amount based on potency (for example,
one-fourth ounce), an individual prone to use the drug heavily
will do so. Society's resources should be committed to the task
of reducing supply of the drug and persuading our citizens not to
use it. Expenditure of police time and financial resources in an
attempt to ascertain the THC content of every seized substance
would make little, if any, contribution to this effort.<br>
</p>

<p><b><u>A Final Comment<br>
</u></b></p>

<p>In this Chapter, we have carefully considered the spectrum of
social and legal policy alternatives. On the basis of our
findings, discussed in previous Chapters, we have concluded that
society should seek to discourage use, while concentrating its
attention on the prevention and treatment of heavy and very heavy
use. The Commission feels that the criminalization of possession
of marihuana for personal is socially self-defeating as a means
of achieving this objective. We have attempted to balance
individual freedom on one hand and the obligation of the state to
consider the wider social good on the other. We believe our
recommended scheme will permit society to exercise its control
and influence in ways most useful and efficient, meanwhile
reserving to the individual American his sense of privacy, his
sense of individuality, and, within the context of ail
interacting and interdependent society, his options to select his
own life style, values, goals and opportunities. </p>

<p>The Commission sincerely hopes that the tone of cautious
restraint sounded in this Report will be perpetuated in the
debate which will follow it. For those who feel we have not
proceeded far enough, we are reminded of Thomas Jefferson's
advice to George Washington that &quot;Delay is preferable to
error.&quot; For those who argue we have gone too far, we note
Roscoe Pound's statement, &quot;The law must be stable, but it
must not stand still.&quot; </p>

<p>We have carefully analyzed the interrelationship between
marihuana the drug, marihuana use as a behavior, and marihuana as
a social problem. Recognizing the extensive degree of
misinformation about marihuana as a drug, we have tried to
demythologize it. Viewing the use of marihuana in its wider
social context, we have tried to desymbolize it. </p>

<p>Considering the range of social concerns in contemporary
America, marihuana does not, in our considered judgment, rank
very high. We would deemphasize marihuana as a problem. </p>

<p>The existing social and legal policy is out of proportion to
the individual and social harm engendered by the use of the drug.
To replace it, we have attempted to design a suitable social
policy, which we believe is fair, cautious and attuned to the
social realities of our time.<br>

Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Chapter V </h1>

<h1>marihuana and social policy </h1>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The difficulty in life is the choice.&quot; </p>

<p>George Moore (1900) </p>

<p>A constant tension exists in our society between individual
liberties and the need for reasonable societal restraints. It is
easy to go too far in either direction, and this tendency is
particularly evident where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>We have guided our decision-making by the belief that the
state is obliged to justify restraints on individual behavior.
Too often individual freedoms are submerged in the passions of
the moment, and when that happens, the public policy may be
determined more by rhetoric than by reason. Our effort has been
to minimize the emotional and emphasize the rational in this
Report. </p>

<p><b>Drugs In a Free Society</b> </p>

<p>A free society seeks to provide conditions in which each of
its members may develop his or her potentialities to the fullest
extent. A premium is placed on individual choice in seeking
self-fulfillment. This priority depends upon the capacity of free
citizens not to abuse their freedom, and upon their willingness
to act responsibly toward others and toward the society as a
whole. Responsible behavior, through individual choice, is both
the guarantor and the objective of a free society. <br>
</p>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>The use of drugs is not in itself an irresponsible act.
Medical and scientific uses serve important individual and social
needs and are often essential to our physical and mental
well-being. Further, the use of drugs for pleasure or other
non-medical purposes is not inherently irresponsible; alcohol is
widely used as an acceptable part of social activities. </p>

<p>We do think the use of drugs is clearly irresponsible when it
impedes the individual's integration into the economic and social
system. A preference for individual productivity and contribution
to social progress in a general sense still undergirds the
American value structure, and we emphasize the policy-maker's
duty to support this preference in a public policy judgment. </p>

<p>At the same time, in light of the emerging leisure ethic and
the search for individual meaning and fulfillment noted in
Chapter 1, we cannot divorce social policy from the questions
raised by the recreational use of drugs. Productivity and
recreation both have a place in the American ethical system. They
are not inconsistent unless the individual's use of leisure time
inhibits his productive role in society. </p>

<p>Drugs should be servants, not masters. They become masters
when they dominate an individual's existence or impair his
faculties. To the extent that any drug, including alcohol,
carries with it risks to the well-being of the user and seriously
undermines his effectiveness in the society, that drug becomes a
matter of concern for public policy. </p>

<p>An essential step in the process of policy-formation is a
determination of the circumstances under which use of any given
drug' poses such risks. For some drugs, the risks may be so great
that all permissible measures should be taken to eliminate use.
For other drugs, such risks may be present only under certain
specific circumstances, in which case society may defer to
responsible individual choice on the matter of recreational use
but take appropriate steps to minimize the incidence and
consequences of dysfunctional use. In our Report next year, for
which studies are already underway, we will consider from this
perspective the whole range of drugs now used for non-medical
purposes. </p>

<p> <b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>marihuana and social policy </h1>

<p> <b>A Social Control Policy for Marihuana<br>
</b> </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
A Social Control Policy for Marihuana </h3>

<p> In formulating a Marihuana policy, our strongest concern is
with irresponsible use, whether it be too often, too much,
indiscriminate, or under improper circumstances. The excessive or
indiscriminate use of any drug is a serious social concern; and
this is particularly true of marihuana since we still know very
little about the effects of long term, heavy use. We have little
doubt that the substantial majority of users, under any social
control policy, including the existing system, do not and would
not engage in irresponsible behavior. </p>

<p> In identifying the -appropriate social control policy for
marihuana, we have found it helpful to consider the following
policy options: </p>

<p> I Approval of Use. </p>

<p> II Elimination of Use. </p>

<p> III Discouragement of Use. </p>

<p> IV Neutrality Toward Use. <br>
</p>

<h4>APPROVAL OF USE </h4>

<p> Society should not approve or encourage the recreational use
of any drug, in public or private. Any semblance of encouragement
enhances the possibility of abuse and removes, from a
psychological standpoint, an effective support of individual
restraint. </p>

<p> For example, so long as this society (not only the
government, but other institutions and mass advertising as well)
in effect approved of the use of tobacco, the growing medical
consensus about the dangers of excessive use did not make a
significant impression on individual judgment. With the Surgeon
General's Report on Tobacco in 1964, Smoking and Health, a very
real change has occurred in the way society now thinks about
cigarettes. </p>

<p> The institutions of society definitely add their influences
to the variety of social pressures which persuade individuals to
use any kind of drugs. Rational social policy should seek to
minimize such social pressures, whether they come from peers,
from the media, from social custom, or from the user's sense of
inadequacy. Official approval would inevitably encourage some
people to use the drug who would not otherwise do so, and would
also increase the incidence of heavy or otherwise irresponsible
use and its complications. On this basis we reject policy option
number one, approval of use. </p>

<h4>ELIMINATION OF USE </h4>

<p> For a half-century, official social policy has been not only
to discourage use but to eliminate it (option number two). With
the principal responsibility for this policy assigned to law
enforcement, its implementation reached its zenith in the late
1950's and early 1960's when marihuana-related offenses were
punishable by long periods of incarceration. This policy grew out
of a distorted and greatly exaggerated concept of the drug's
ordinary effects upon the individual and the society. On the
basis of information then available, marihuana was not adequately
distinguished from other problem drugs and was assumed to be as
harmful as the others. </p>

<p> The increased incidence of use, intensive scientific
reevaluation, and the spread of use to the middle and upper
socioeconomic groups have brought about the informal adoption of
a modified social policy. On the basis of our opinion surveys and
our empirical studies of law enforcement behavior, we are
convinced that officialdom and the public are no longer as
punitive toward marihuana use as they once were. </p>

<p> Now there exists a more realistic estimate of the actual
social impact of marihuana use. School and university
administrators are seldom able to prevent the use of marihuana by
their students and personnel and are increasingly reluctant to
take disciplinary action against users. Within the criminal
justice system, there has been a marked decline in the severity
of the response to offenders charged with possession of
marihuana. </p>

<p> In our survey of state enforcement activities, only 11% of
all marihuana arrests resulted from active investigative
activity, and most of those were in sale situations. For the most
part, marihuana enforcement is a haphazard process; arrests occur
on the street, in a park, in a car, or as a result of a phone
call. Among those arrested, approximately 50% of the adults and
70% of the juveniles are not processed through the system; their
cases are dismissed by the police, by the prosecutors or by the
courts. Ultimately less than 6% of all those apprehended are
incarcerated, and very few of these sentences are for possession
of small amounts for personal use. </p>

<p> In the law enforcement community, the major concern is no
longer marihuana but the tendency of some users to engage in
other irresponsible activity, particularly the use of more
dangerous drugs. Official sentiment now seems to be a desire to
contain use of the drug as well as the drug subculture, and to
minimize its spread to the rest of the youth population. Law
enforcement policy, both at the Federal and State levels,
implicitly recognizes that elimination is impossible at this
time. </p>

<p> The active attempt to suppress all marihuana use has been
replaced by an effort to keep it within reasonable bounds. Yet
because this policy still reflects a view that marihuana smoking
is itself destructive enough to justify punitive action against
the user, we believe it is an inappropriate social response. </p>

<p> Marihuana's relative potential for harm to the vast majority
of individual users and its actual impact on society does not
justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish
those who use it. This judgment is based on prevalent, use
patterns, on behavior exhibited by the vast majority of users and
on our interpretations of existing medical and scientific data.
This position also is consistent with the estimate by law
enforcement personnel that the elimination of use is
unattainable. </p>

<p> In the case of experimental or intermittent use of marihuana,
there is room for individual judgment. Some members of our
society believe the decision to use marihuana is an immoral
decision. However, even during Prohibition, when many people were
concerned about the evils associated with excessive use of
alcohol, possession for personal use was never outlawed federally
and was made illegal in only five States. </p>

<p> Indeed, we suspect that the moral contempt in which some of
our citizens hold the marihuana user is related to other behavior
or other attitudes assumed to be associated with use of the drug.
All of our data suggest that the moral views of the overwhelming
majority of marihuana users are in general accord with those of
the larger society. </p>

<p> Having previously rejected the approval policy (option number
one), we now reject the eliminationist policy (option number
two). This policy, if taken seriously, would require a great
increase in manpower and resources in order to eliminate the use
of a drug which simply does not warrant that kind of attention.<br>
</p>

<h4>DISCOURAGEMENT OR NEUTRALITY </h4>

<p> The unresolved question is whether society should try to
dissuade its members from using marihuana or should defer
entirely to individual judgment in the matter, remaining benignly
neutral. We must choose between policies of discouragement
(number three) and neutrality (number four). This choice is a
difficult one and forces us to consider the limitations of our
knowledge and the dynamics of social change. A number of
considerations, none of which is conclusive by itself, point at
the present time toward a discouragement policy. We will discuss
each one of them separately. </p>

<h5>1. User Preference Is Still Ambiguous </h5>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco have long been desired by large numbers
within our society and their use is deeply ingrained in the
American culture. Marihuana, on the other hand, has only recently
achieved a significant foothold in the American experience, and
it is still essentially used more by young people. Again, the
unknown factor here is whether the sudden attraction to marihuana
derives from its psychoactive virtues or from its symbolic
status. </p>

<p> Throughout this Commission's deliberations there was a
recurring awareness of the possibility that marihuana use may be
a fad which, if not institutionalized, will recede substantially
in time. Present data suggest that this is the case, and we do
not hesitate to say that we would prefer that outcome. To the
extent that conditions permit, society is well advised to
minimize the number of drugs which may cause significant
problems. By focusing our attention on fewer rather than more
drugs, we may be better able to foster responsible use and
diminish the consequences of irresponsible use. </p>

<p> The more prudent course seems to be to retain a social policy
opposed to use, attempting to discourage use while at the same
time seeking to deemphasize the issue. Such a policy leaves us
with more options available when more definitive knowledge of the
consequences of heavy and prolonged marihuana use becomes
available. </p>

<h5>2. Continuing Scientific Uncertainty Precludes Finality </h5>

<p> In 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, society was cognizant
of the effects of alcohol as a drug and the adverse consequences
of abuse. But, because so many people wished to use the drug,
policy-makers chose, to run the risk of individual indiscretion
and decided to abandon the abstentionist policy. There are many
today who feel that if the social, impact of alcohol use had then
been more fully understood, a policy of discouragement rather
than neutrality would have been adopted to minimize the negative
aspects of alcohol use. </p>

<p> Misunderstanding also played an important part when the
national government adopted an eliminationist, marihuana policy
in 1937. The policy-makers knew very little about the effects or
social impact of the drug; many of their hypotheses were
speculative and, in large measure, incorrect. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the argument that misinformation in 1937
automatically compels complete reversal of the action taken at
that time is neither reasonable nor logical. While continuing
concern about the effects of heavy, chronic use is not sufficient
reason to maintain an overly harsh public policy, it is still a
significant argument for choosing official discouragement in
preference to official neutrality. </p>

<h5>3. Society's Value System Is In a State of Transition </h5>

<p> As discussed in Chapter 1, two central influences in
contemporary American life are the individual search for meaning
within the context of an increasingly depersonalized society, and
the collective search for enduring American values. In Chapter
IV, we noted that society's present ambivalent response to
marihuana use reflects these uncertainties. </p>

<p> For the reasons discussed in the previous Chapters, a sudden
abandonment of an official policy of elimination in favor of one
of neutrality toward marihuana would have a profound
reverberating impact on social attitudes far beyond the one issue
of marihuana use. We believe that society must have time to
consider its image of the future. We believe that adoption of a
discouragement policy toward marihuana at this time would
facilitate such a reappraisal while official neutrality, under
present circumstances, would impede it. </p>

<h5>4. Public Opinion Presently Opposes Marihuana Use </h5>

<p> For whatever reasons, a substantial majority of the American
public opposes the use of marihuana, and would prefer that their
fellow citizens abstain from using it. In the National Survey,
64% of the adult public agreed with the statement that
&quot;using marihuana is morally offensive` (40% felt the same
way about alcohol). </p>

<p> Although this majority opinion is not by any means
conclusive, it cannot be ignored. We are well aware of the
skeptics in with which marihuana user, and those sympathetic to
their wishes, view the policy making process; and we are
particularly concerned about the indifference to or disrespect
for law manifested by many citizens and particularly the youth. </p>

<p> However, we are also apprehensive about the impact of a major
change in social policy on that larger segment of our population
which supports the implications of the existing social policy.
They, too, might lose respect for a policy-making establishment
which appeared to bend so easily to the wishes of a
&quot;lawless&quot; and highly vocal minority. </p>

<p> This concern for minimizing cultural dislocation must, of
course, be weighed against the relative importance of contrary
arguments. For example, in the case of desegregation in the
South, and now in the North, cult-Lire shock had to be accepted
in the light of the fundamental precept at issue. In the, case.
of marihuana, there is no fundamental principle supporting the
use of the drug, and society is not compelled to approve or be
neutral toward it. The opinion of the majority is entitled to
greater weight. </p>

<p> Looking again to the, experience with Prohibition, when an
abstentionist policy for alcohol was adopted on the national
level in 1918, its proponents were not blind to the vociferous
opposition of a substantial minority of the people. By the late
1920's and early 1930's, the ambivalence of public opinion toward
alcohol use and the unwillingness of large numbers of people to
comply with the new social policy compelled reversal of that
policy. Even many of its former supporters acknowledged its
futility. </p>

<p> With marihuana, however, the prevailing policy of eliminating
use had never been opposed to any significant degree until the
mid-1960's. Unlike the prohibition of alcohol, which had been the
subject of public debate off and on for 60 years before it was
adopted, present marihuana policy has not until now engaged the
public opinion process, some 50 years after it first began to be
used. Majority sentiment does not appear to be as flexible as it
was with alcohol.<br>
</p>

<h5>5. Neutrality Is Not Philosophically Compelled </h5>

<p> Much of what was stated above bespeaks an acute awareness by
the Commission of the subtleties of the collective consciousness
of the American people, as shown in the National Survey. There is
a legitimate concern about what the majority of the non-using
population thinks about marihuana use and what the drug
represents in the public mind. The question is appropriately
asked if we are suggesting that the majority in a free society
may impose its will on an unwilling minority even though, as it
is claimed, uncertainty, speculation, and a large degree of
misinformation form the basis of the predominant opinion. If we
have nothing more substantial than this, the argument goes,
society should remain neutral. </p>

<p> To deal with this contention, one must distinguish between
ends and means. Policy-makers must choose their objectives with a
sensitivity toward the entire social fabric and a vision of the
good society. In such a decision, the general public attitude is
a significant consideration. The preferred outcome in a
democratic society cannot be that of the policy-makers alone; it
must be that of an informed public. Accordingly, the policy-maker
must consider the dynamic relationship between perception and
reality in the public mind. Is the public consensus based on a
real awareness of the facts? Does the public really understand
what is at stake? Given the best evidence available, would the
public consensus remain the same? </p>

<p> Assuming that dominant opinion opposes marihuana use, the
philosophical issue is raised not by the goal but by how it is
implemented. At this point, the interests of the unwilling become
important. For example, the family unit and the institution of
marriage are preferred means of group-living and child-rearing in
our society. As a society, we are not neutral. We officially
encourage matrimony by giving married couples favorable tax
treatment; but we do not compel people to get married. If it
should become public policy to try to reduce the birth rate, it
is unlikely that there will be laws to punish those who exceed
the preferred family size, although we may again utilize
disincentives through the tax system. Similarly, this Commission
believes society should continue actively to discourage people
from using marihuana, and any philosophical limitation is
relevant to the means employed, not to the goal itself.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>FOR THESE REASONS, WE RECOMMEND TO THE PUBLIC AND ITS
POLICY-MAKERS A SOCIAL CONTROL POLICY SEEKING TO DISCOURAGE
MARIHUANA USE, WHILE CONCENTRATING PRIMARILY ON THE PREVENTION OF
HEAVY AND VERY HEAVY USE.</b> </p>

<p> We emphasize that this is a policy for today and the
immediate future; we do not presume to suggest that this policy
embodies eternal truth. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that
our successor policy planners, at an appropriate time in the
future,, review the following factors to determine whether an
altered social policy is in order: the state of public opinion,
the extent to which members of the society continue to use the
drug, the developing scientific knowledge about the effects and
social impact of use of the drug, and the evolving social
attitude toward the place of recreation and leisure in a
work-oriented society. In our second Report next year, we will
carefully review our findings to see if our perceptions have
changed or if society has changed at that time.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse </b></p>

<h2>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding </h2>

<p><b>Commissioned by President Richard M. Nixon, March, 1972</b>
</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>addendum<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The previous Chapter recommended a social policy oriented
toward the discouragement of marihuana use and presented a set of
proposals for the legal implementation of that policy. In
addition to these legal recommendations for federal, and state
action, the Commission believes certain other recommendations
should be presented for action. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Ancillary Recommendations</b> </p>

<p>These recommendations are presented in three categories: (1)
legal and law enforcement, (2) medical, and (3) other. Some of
these recommendations apply to other drugs as well and will be
discussed further in our second Report. However, we consider it
useful to make recommendations now so that policy planners can be
informed of the implications of what has been studied to date. </p>

<p>Foremost among the Commission's conclusions is a need for
consistency between federal and state laws affecting marihuana
distribution and use, and uniformity of marihuana laws among the
states. The administration of all marihuana laws must be mutally
reenforcing so that total governmental response to marihuana is
both equitable and understandable. </p>

<p><b>Legal and Law Enforcement Recommendations</b> </p>

<p><b>1. Federal</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, ESPECIALLY
THE BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS AND THE BUREAU OF
CUSTOMS, SHOULD IMPROVE THEIR STATISTICAL REPORTING SYSTEMS SO
THAT POLICIES MAY BE PLANNED AND RESOURCES ALLOCATED ON THE BASIS
OF ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION. </p>

<p>In an effort to obtain information relating to enforcement of
the marihuana laws including arrest, prosecution, sentencing and
conviction data, the Commission found that sufficient information
was available about prosecution and court action, but not about
the activities of the law enforcement agencies. We were
confronted by and large with inadequate statistical information
and little or no in-depth evaluation. </p>

<p>The statistical reporting procedures of the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the Bureau of Customs are not
uniform, making it extremely difficult to assess the
effectiveness of the two principal drug enforcement agencies of
the Federal Government. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs keeps centralized files but the Bureau of Customs maintains
its files on a regional basis. In both Bureaus, statistical
information is kept only in its raw form; that is, number of
arrests, number of seizures and so on. Very little analysis
exists of the procedures leading to arrest, of the
characteristics of persons arrested, and of the law enforcement
strategies involved in the arrest. For law enforcement personnel
to understand more fully how they are carrying out their
functions so that internal assessments of particular policies can
be made, sophisticated statistics must be maintained. </p>

<p>Both the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the
Bureau of Customs are aware of these problems. Both were
extremely helpful to the Commission and its research staff in
seeking useful information from the mass of raw statistics.
However, the information from the available statistics is
incomplete and of limited utility for policy planning purposes. </p>

<p>In support of this priority recommendation, Congress is urged
to provide additional and adequate funding for this area, at the
same time requiring both agencies to utilize a common reporting
system so that information can be more easily shared between
them. </p>

<p>In addition, it is recommended that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, in its Uniform Crime Reports, requests the state
agencies to identify marihuana cases separately from narcotic
cases and report them as a separate component. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS
DRUGS SH0ULD INCREASE ITS TRAINING PROGRAMS OF STATE AND LOCAL
POLICE WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE TRAINING IN THE DETECTION OF
TRAFFICKING CASES. </p>

<p>The Commission's interviews with state and local police,
officials revealed a consistent desire to upgrade the quality of
their investigations. Since the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, through its National Training Institute, has
been performing this task well, it is recommended that the funds
be granted by the Congress to extend the range of the educational
program offered and increase the number of persons trained. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: INCREASED BORDER SURVEILLANCE, A TIGHTENING OF
BORDER PROCEDURES, AND A REALISTIC ERADICAT10N PROGRAM TO
DIMINISH THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY, COUPLED
WITH A MORE EFFECTIVE PROGRAM FOR DIMINISHING THE DOMESTIC
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MARIHUANA, ARE REQUIRED. </p>

<p>The Commission, as part of its mandate, studied drug
trafficking patterns along the borders of the United States. An
analysis of border marihuana seizures was also made. The results
of both studies indicated that proportionately larger seizures
were made along the borders at locations where, there were no
manned checkpoints. The Commission therefore recommends that more
vigorous effort be made by federal agencies to interdict
smugglers along the entire border while continuing their efforts
at the formal checkpoints. </p>

<p>In discussions with representatives of other countries, a
common observation made by foreign officials has been this
country's somewhat indifferent attitude about the eradication of
our home-grown marihuana, an attitude that is not appreciated by
other countries wider pressure from the United States to destroy
their crops. Since this Administration has wisely made illicit
trafficking in all drugs a foreign policy priority, we recommend
that priority be supported by an equally assiduous effort to
eradicate marihuana within our borders. </p>

<p>We recommend further that preclearance procedures be
eliminated so that Customs personnel may more effectively control
smuggling of marihuana and other drugs. Preclearance is a
procedure whereby passengers and their baggage destined for the
United States are inspected by U.S. Customs, Immigration and
Agriculture officials prior to departure from a foreign location.
This practice is in effect in Bermuda, Montreal, Nassau, Toronto,
Vancouver, Winnipeg and the Virgin Islands. Other locations are
petitioning for the same privilege. </p>

<p>An inherent weakness in the preclearance procedure is that
Customs personnel stationed outside the United States have no
authority for search, seizure and arrest. This fact is well-known
to the professional smuggler who uses it to his advantage. Since
we have been informed that preclearance creates a gap in Customs'
interdiction process, reason dictates that the procedure be
eliminated in the interest of tighter control. </p>

<p><b>H. State</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: ALL STATES SHOULD ADOPT THE UNIFORM CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES ACT TO ACHIEVE UNIFORMITY WITH REGARD TO MARIHUANA AND
OTHER DRUG LAWS, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE LEGAL RESPONSE TO
POSSESSION FOR ONE'S OWN USE BE UNIFORMLY ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH OUR RECOMMENDATION IN CHAPTER V OF THIS REPORT. </p>

<p>As noted earlier, one of the greatest needs in the entire drug
area is uniformity of state laws with regard to structure and
penalties. While this recommendation applies to all drugs and not
just marihuana, we feel it essential to make this recommendation
now to help deemphasize the marihuana problem. Significant
differences in penalties among the states constitute a valid
source of irritation and conflict among various segments of our
population. In an age of high mobility, it is unconscionable that
penalties should vary so greatly in response, to the same
behavior. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: EACH STATE SHOULD ESTABLISH A CENTRALIZED
COMPULSORY REPORTING AND RECORD-KEEPTNG AUTHORITY SO THAT
ADEQUATE AND ACCURATE STATISTICS OF ARRESTS, SENTENCES AND
CONVICTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS ARE AVAILABLE. </p>

<p>Several states have systems for maintaining records of drug
arrests on a statewide basis. Accurate reporting and compilation
of these cases permit the state to assess accurately the impact
of law enforcement on drug offenders. The Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration of the Department of Justice should
assist the states to establish compulsory statistical reporting
centers so that individual state needs are met and a clearer
picture of the national trends can be, ascertained. Efficient
state record-keeping will have an additional benefit of
increasing the reliability of the Uniform Crime Reports compiled
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THOSE STATES REQUIRING PHYSICIANS TO REPORT
DRUG USERS SEEKING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD CHANGE SUCH
REQUIREMENTS TO INSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE DRUG USER'S
IDENTITY, SO THAT PERSONS NEEDING MEDICAL HELP WILL FEEL FREE TO
SEEK IT. </p>

<p>Seventeen states* currently require physicians to report to a
government agency information on those persons treated by them
who are dependent on, or are habitual users of drugs. No common
pattern emerges among these states. </p>

<p>*California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico. New York,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, Washington. </p>

<p>After reviewing these statutes, the Commission believes that
the disadvantages of maintaining such reporting systems outweigh
the benefits to society or the individual. Fear of disclosure to
the police discourages many persons front seeking needed medical
help. Furthermore, the requirement makes the physician an
informant and an agent of law enforcement. </p>

<p>While a need exists for reliable statistics regarding the
number and nature of those persons being treated, the Commission
does not feel that identification of the individual user is
necessary. We again emphasize that society should encourage
persons in need of medical attention to seek out authorized
practitioners without having to fear legal repercussions for such
action. </p>

<p><b>III. International</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: IF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BECOME A SIGNATORY
OF THE PROPOSED PSYCHOTROPIC CONVENTION, WE RECOMMEND THAT
CANNABIS BE REMOVED FROM THE EXISTING SINGLE CONVENTION AND
CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN TO LISTING IT IN THE PSYCHOTROPIC
CONVENTION AMONG DRUGS WHICH HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS. </p>

<p>Under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, of which
the United States became a signatory in 1967, cannabis, with the
exception of its leaves and stems, is included with narcotic
drugs and cocaine. While that categorization had some
justification in 1961 when knowledge about marihuana was more,
limited, this justification no longer exists. More importantly,
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in
cannabis, is not included in the Single Convention and is
proposed for inclusion in the Psychotropic Convention. </p>

<p>The Commission sees little sense in having the potent
psychoactive ingredient in cannabis covered in one Convention and
the natural supplying data from its major foreign studies of
chronic cannabis users in Jamaica and Greece. For medical
research purposes, an analysis of data derived from populations
in other countries with 10, 20 or 30 years of experience with
heavy marihuana use will provide useful information about
probable consequences if the, incidence of marihuana use in the
United States were to continue and increase, and if more people
engaged in heavy, long term use. </p>

<p><b>IV. Therapeutic Uses</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: INCREASED SUPPORT OF STUDIES WHICH EVALUATE
THE EFFICACY OF MARIHIUANA TN THE TREATMENT OF PHYSICAL
IMPAIRMENTS AND DISEASE IS RECOMMENDED. </p>

<p>Historical references have been noted throughout the
literature referring to the use of cannabis products as
therapeutically useful agents. Of particular significance for
current research with controlled quality, quantity and
therapeutic settings, would be investigations into the treatment
of glaucoma, migraine, alcoholism and terminal cancer. The
NIMII-FDA Psychotomimetic Advisory Committee's authorization of
studies designed to explore the therapeutic uses of marihuana is
commended. </p>

<p><b>V. Community-Based Treatment</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: COMMUNITY-BASED TREATMENT FACILITIES SHOULD BE
PROMOTED IN CARlNG FOR PROBLEM DRUG USERS UTILIZING EXISTING
HEALTH CENTERS WHEN POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. </p>

<p>In studying marihuana, the Commission has obtained information
about a number of treatment centers and services. The wide range
of agencies and the variety of goals and techniques present a
confusing array of services available to drug users, varying
widely in their effectiveness. Uniform criteria for evaluating
the &quot;success&quot; of these programs is urgently needed. </p>

<p>The medical members of the Commission believe that some of the
techniques being used may pose as much potential harm as good.
Many young people who are experiencing profound difficulties
resulting from the use of drugs may suppose they are being
treated and helped, when in reality they are not. In some cases,
the short-term benefit may be disruptive to the long-term welfare
of the individual. In the rush to provide treatment facilities,
many programs have been given impressive credentials without
meeting minimal medical standards. It is essential that treatment
facilities have, as their primary orientation, the well-being of
the individual under treatment. </p>

<p><b>VI. Training Programs</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: PUBLIC HEALTH COURSES ON THE SOCIAL ASPECTS OF
DRUG USE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CURRICULA OF THE SCHOOLS OF
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. </p>

<p>The Commission recommends that schools of the health
professions include in their curricula courses on the social,
public health and therapeutic aspects of drug use as appropriate
to the educational purpose of the individual school. The National
Survey indicated that the public views the family physician as an
important source of information about drugs. Next to school
personnel, physicians were mentioned most often in this
connection. Persons involved in the health professions must be
provided with information about nonmedical as well as the medical
aspects of drug use. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Other Recommendations</b> </p>

<p><b>1. Reclassification of Cannabis</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT SEVERAL STATE
LEGISLATURES HAVE IMPROPERLY CLASSIFIED MARIHUANA AS A NARCOTIC,
AND RECOMMENDS THAT THEY NOW REDEFINE MARIHUANA ACCORDING TO THE
STANDARDS OF THE RECENTLY ADOPTED UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
LAW. </p>

<p>Scientific evidence has clearly demonstrated that marihuana is
not a narcotic drug, and the law should properly reflect this
fact. Congress so recognized in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970, as did The Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in the Uniform Controlled
Substances Law. </p>

<p>In those states where the Uniform Controlled Substances Law
has not yet been adopted, twelve of which continue to classify
marihuana as a &quot;narcotic&quot;, the Commission recommends
that the legislatures distinguish marihuana from the opiates and
list it in a separate category. The consequence of inappropriate
definition is that the public continues to associate marihuana
with the narcotics, such as heroin. The confusion resulting from
this improper classification helps to perpetuate prejudices and
misinformation about marihuana. </p>

<p><b>II. Information</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: A SINGLE FEDERAL AGENCY SOURCE SHOULD
DISSEMINATE INFORMATION AND MATERIALS RELATING TO MARIHUANA AND
OTHER DRUGS. THE NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR DRUG ABUSE
INFORMATION SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY. </p>

<p>A great proliferation of drug information materials has
occurred in recent years. These, materials are currently
distributed by a number of federal agencies. Some of these
materials conflict with each other. The result is a confusion and
uncertainty on the part of the, public about the accuracy of all
these statements. The public should have one federal source from
which to obtain drug information. The National Clearinghouse for
Drug Abuse Information appears best suited to perform this task. </p>

<p><b>III. Education</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE SPECIAL ACTION OFFICE FOR DRUG ABUSE
PREVENTION IN THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
COORDINATION, DEVELOPMENT AND CONTENT REVIEW OF ALL
FEDERALLY-SUPPORTED DRUG EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ANT) SHOULD ISSUE
A REPORT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, EVALUATING EXISTING DRUG EDUCATION
MATERIALS. </p>

<p>The Commission has studied many programs of drug education
throughout the country. Some are irrelevant, others are poorly
designed, still others are misleading, and a good many of them
are, of questionable value. A few are excellent. The Federal
Government must provide assistance to the states and school
districts in this matter, and should provide the leadership in
developing sample programs in cooperation with educational
systems. An evaluation of existing programs by The Special Action
Office for Drug Abuse Prevention of the White House could be very
helpful in improving the standards of drug education. </p>

<p><b>IV. Voluntary Sector Participation</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE COMMISSION NOTES THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE
PLAYED BY THE VOLUNTARY SEC TOR OF THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN
INFLUENCING THE SOCIAL, RELIGIOUS AND MORAL ATTITUDES OF OUR
NATION'S CITIZENS AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR BE
ENCOURAGED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN SUPPORT OF OUR RECOMMENDED
POLICY OF DISCOURAGING THE USE OF MARIHUANA. </p>

<p>Already very active in drug education and prevention
activities, the social agencies, service clubs, church groups,
and other non-governmental bodies have, been extremely helpful in
attending to the difficult problems of drug abuse. The local and
personal nature of such organizations gives them an advantage
over state and federal governments in the development of
attitudes by our citizens. </p>

<p>The policy which we here recommend, indeed any policy which
might be recommended, will inevitably encounter widespread and
earnest objections. The fullest efforts of all citizens of good
will be required to attend to the, massive problem of drug abuse
in a calm, just, responsible and effective manner. The help of
the voluntary agencies in working toward this end is earnestly
invited and urgently needed.<br>

<p>National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse </p>

<p>801 19th Street N.W. </p>

<p>Washington, D.C. 20006<br>
</p>

<p>March 22, 1972<br>
</p>

<p>To The President and Congress of the United States: </p>

<p>As Chairman of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse, I am pleased to submit to you our first year Report in
conformance with the mandate contained in Section 601 of Public
Law 91-513, The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
Act of 1970. </p>

<p>This Report &quot;Marihuana, A Signal of
Misunderstanding&quot; is an all-inclusive effort to present the
facts as they are known today, to demythologize the controversy
surrounding marihuana, and to place in proper perspective one of
the most emotional and explosive issues of our time. We on the
Commission sincerely hope it will play a significant role in
bringing uniformity and rationality to our marihuana laws, both
Federal and State, and that it will create a healthy climate for
further discussion, for further research and for a continuing
advance in the development of a public social policy beneficial
to all our citizens. </p>

<p>Whatever the facts are we have reported them. Wherever the
facts have logically led us, we have followed and used them in
reaching our recommendations. We hope this Report will be a
foundation upon which credibility in this area can be restored
and upon which a rational policy can be predicated. </p>

<p>By Direction of the Commission </p>

<p>Raymond P. Shafer </p>

<p>The President </p>

<p><b>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding</b> </p>

<p><b>The Technical Papers of the First Report of the National
Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse<br>
March, 1972</b> </p>

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congress created the Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse to
separate fact from fiction, reality from myth, and to achieve a
balanced judgment on the marihuana issue. The first report of the
Commission is an attempt to clarify the essential issues and
concerns of our society regarding marihuana and to extrapolate
our findings and conclusions into a reasonable societal response.
</p>

<p>In an effort to present these complex issues with a maximum of
clarity, comprehension, and readability, the Commission Report
does not include references. This Appendix, however, fully
documents the methodological and substantive, issues presented in
the Report. In addition to the technical data, the Appendix also
contains the historical and philosophical matrix of the Report. </p>

<p>The papers of the Appendix are divided into six major parts.
Part One deals with the biosocial aspects which relate to
marihuana's effect on individuals as well as to the larger
society. </p>

<p>It includes an historical survey of two types of marihuana
use, medicinal and intoxicant, which constitutes a review of
marihuana use in many parts of the world. An analysis of the
accepted sociocultural parameters helps to put the American
marihuana, user into perspective. </p>

<p>Part One also presents detailed and current reviews of the
botanical, psychopharmacologic, physiologic, and behavioral
effects of marihuana on man. </p>

<p>Part Two, the social aspects of marihuana use, discusses
patterns of the individual user as well as the relationship of
marihuana use to violent and non-violent crime. </p>

<p>One of the most controversial issues in the study of marihuana
is its relationship to other drugs. The second chapter of Part
Two deals specifically with this issue and explores, in depth and
with careful consideration, the hypothesis that marihuana use
leads to other drugs, especially heroin. </p>

<p>Part Three is concerned with the legal aspects of the
marihuana controversy. In order to place marihuana, a
psychoactive drug, in proper perspective, a history of the
control of marihuana, alcohol and tobacco is presented. </p>

<p>This section of the Appendix also reviews the current
marihuana laws at the international, federal and state levels
including statutes that require physicians to report drug
addiction. The section concludes with a description of
trafficking and distribution patterns of the drug. </p>

<p>Part Four, the response of the criminal justice system,
analyzes law enforcement behavior with respect to marihuana use.
The relationship between the opinions held by officials in the
criminal justice system and their behavior toward marihuana
offenders is also discussed. </p>

<p>Part Five presents the findings of the Commission-sponsored
National Survey of public attitudes and behavior toward
marihuana, other drug use and related social issues. </p>

<p>Part Six discusses the marihuana issue with respect to
sociolegal policy practices and decisions. Included in the
section is a discussion of the constitutional dimensions which
form the basis for alternative models for the control of
marihuana. A nationwide study of marihuana education presents
policies and programs on a state-by-state basis and includes
descriptions of ongoing marihuana education programs. <br>
</p>

<p>The Appendix concludes with a presentation of future research
recommendations as suggested guidelines for various agencies,
institutions and individuals engaged in research on marihuana. </p>

<p>Each of the papers contained herein represents the composite
effort of the Commission members and staff, consultants,
contractors and youth consultants. </p>

<p>Of necessity, space limitations precluded the publication in
full of many excellent papers; many works are presented either in
abridged form or integrated into the Commission's own
presentation. </p>

<p>A list of all papers submitted to the Commission is presented
at the conclusion of the Appendix. Should any reader wish to
obtain a copy of a particular work, the request should be sent
directly to the author and not to the Commission.<br>

<h1>History of Marihuana Use: Medical and Intoxicant </h1>

<p>From: <u>Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding</u>, the
Report of the US National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse,
1972</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The term &quot;marihuana&quot; is a word with indistinct
origins. Some believe it is derived from the Mexican words for
&quot;Mary Jane&quot;; others hold that &quot;marihuana&quot;
comes from. the Portuguese word marigu-ano which means
&quot;intoxicant&quot; (Geller and Boas, 1969: 14). This chapter
outlines the many and varied uses of marihuana through history,
and deals with its use in medicine and its use as an intoxicant. </p>

<p>The experience of the 1960's might lead one to surmise that
marihuana use spreads explosively. The chronicle of its 3,000
year history, however, shows that this &quot;explosion&quot; has
been characteristic only of the contemporary scene. The plant has
been grown for fiber and as a source of medicine for several
thousand years, but until 500 A.D. its use as a mind-altering
drug was almost solely confined in India. The drug and its uses
reached the Middle and Near East during the next several
centuries, and then moved across North Africa, appeared in Latin
America and the Caribbean, and finally entered the United States
in the early decades of this century (Snyder, 1970: 129). </p>

<p>Meanwhile it had been introduced into European medicine
shortly after the invasion of Egypt by Napoleon and had a minor
vogue as an intoxicant for a time in France.<br>
<br>
Regardless of which parts of the world are discussed, many of the
same problems and concerns about cannabis are common to all,
including the United States. Understanding its various uses
during many centuries in diverse countries and continents can
perhaps lead to a better understanding of marihuana in general.<br>
</p>

<h2>History of the Medical Use </h2>

<p>The history of cannabis products and their use has been long,
colorful and varied. &quot;To the agriculturist, cannabis is a
fiber crop; to the physician, it is an enigma; to the user, a
euphoriant; to the police, a menace; to the trafficker, a source
of profitable danger; to the convict or parolee and his family, a
source of sorrow&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969: 34). The fact is that
cannabis has been held simultaneously in high and low esteem at
various times throughout recorded history, particularly in our
own times. </p>

<p>The volume of information available on the medical application
of cannabis is considerable. Occasionally certain references have
been condensed or deleted, but this should not detract from the
completeness of the report. </p>

<p>This historical survey of the medical uses of marihuana is
introduced by abroad overview of its use, including brief notes
on current and projected research, and then considers specific
historical settings and circumstances in ancient China, moving on
to Egypt, India, Greece, Africa, and the Western World. </p>

<p>Cannabis sativa has been used therapeutically from the
earliest records, nearly 5,000 years ago, to the present day
(Mikuriya, 1969: 34) and its products have been widely noted for
their effects, both physiological and psychological, throughout
the world. Although the Chinese and Indian cultures knew about
the properties of this drug from very early times, this
information did not become general in the Near and Middle East
until after the fifth century A.D., when travelers, traders and
adventurers began to carry knowledge of the drug westward to
Persia and Arabia. </p>

<p>Historians claim that cannabis was first employed in these
countries as an antiseptic and analgesic. Other medical uses were
later developed and spread throughout the Middle East, Africa,
and Eastern Europe. </p>

<p>Several years after the return of Napoleon's army from Egypt,
cannabis became widely accepted by Western medical practitioners.
Previously, it had had limited use for such purposes as the
treatment of burns. The scientific members of Napoleon's forces
were interested in the drug's pain relieving and sedative
effects. It was used during, and to a greater extent, following
his rule in France, especially after 1840 when the work of such
physicians as O'Shaughnessy, Aubert-Roche, and Moreau de Tours
drew wide attention to this drug.<br>
</p>

<p>With the rise of the literary movement of the 1840-1860 period
in France (Gautier, Baudelaire, Dumas, etc.), cannabis became
somewhat popular as an intoxicant of the intellectual classes. <br>
</p>

<p>In the United States, medical interest in cannabis use was
evidenced in 1860 by the convening of a Committee on Cannabis
Indica of the Ohio State Medical Society, which reported on its
therapeutic applications (McMeens, 1860: 1). Between the period
1840-1890, Walton states that more than 100 articles were
published recommending cannabis for one disorder or another. </p>

<p>Concern about cannabis as an intoxicant led the government of
India to establish the India Hemp Commission of 1893-94 to
examine the entire question of cannabis use in India. </p>

<p>Paralleling the question over cannabis use in the latter half
of the 19th century was the growing medical use of other
medications superior to cannabis in their effects and more easily
controlled as to dose. Consequently, medical use of cannabis
declined and cannabis began to lose support of the medical
profession. </p>

<p>During the years between 1856-1937, cannabis lost its image as
a medicine and was left with a disreputable image as an
intoxicant. Strong public reaction coupled with a campaign in the
public press led to a federal anti-marihuana law in 1937. (The
drug was illegal in many states before 1937.) The issue of
medical use remained active, however, and Dr. William C.
Woodward, Legislative Counsel to the AMA, an opponent of cannabis
use and the only physician to be a witness at the Taxation of
Marihuana hearings, stated: <br>
</p>

<p>There are exceptions in treatment in which cannabis cannot
apparently be successfully subsituted for. The work of Pascal
seems to show that Indian Hemp has remarkable properties in
revealing the subconscious; hence, it can be used for
psychological, psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic research
(Hearings, House of Representatives, 1937: 91).<br>
</p>

<p>Although cannabis drugs are generally regarded as obsolete and
rarely used in &quot;western&quot; medicine today, cannabis is
&quot;still used extensively in the Ayruvedic, Unani and Tibbi
systems of medicine of the Indian-Pakastani subcontinent&quot;
(&quot;The Cannabis Problem, 1962: 27). The Pharmacopoeias of
India mention cannabis use in the recent past. Two preparations
of cannabis, a liquid extract and a tincture, are listed in the
1954 and 1966 Pharmacopoeias of India which contain descriptions
of cannabis and its extract and how it is made (Chopra &amp;
Chopra, 1957: 9).<br>
</p>

<p>A more recent source makes reference to the fact that &quot;in
contemporary India and Pakistan, there continues to be widespread
indigenous medical, 'quasi-medical,' and illicit use of both
opium and cannabis&quot; (Chopra &amp; Chopra, 1957: 12-13).
Bouquet notes that hemp resin is occasionally used in the native
medicines of the countries where it is collected. He points
especially to India where, &quot;the medical systems . . . make
much use of cannabis as a sedative, hypnotic, analgesic,
anti-spasmodic and anti-hemorrhoidal&quot; (Bulletin on
Narcotics, 1962:27). </p>

<p>According to the Canadian Commission of Inquiry into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs:<br>
</p>

<p>There is no currently accepted medical use of cannabis in
North America outside of an experimental context. Although
cannabis has been reported to produce an array of possibly useful
medical effects, these have either not been adequately
investigated, or can be replaced by using other more readily
available and convenient drugs. The natural product's variability
in potency and instability over time are among the factors which
have led to its disfavor in Western 20th century medicine....
cannabis has often been employed in the past, and is currently
used illicitly in North America, to reduce the secondary symptoms
and suffering caused by the flue and the common cold. These . . .
alleged therapeutic properties of cannabis have not been
adequately studied in a scientific context, and their general
medical potential remains a matter of conjecture (1970: 74).<br>
</p>

<p>Similar statements regarding cannabis are to be found in
Marijuana, edited by Erich Goode, and in the textbook
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics by Goodman and Gilman
(1970: 300). Concerning therapeutic uses, the latter states:<br>
</p>

<p>Although cannabis was once used for a wide variety of clinical
disorders and has even been demonstrated to have antibacterial
activity, there are at present no well substantiated indications
for its use. It is no longer an official drug. Preparations are
rarely available (cannabis preparation and synthetic THC are
obtainable only for research purposes), and prescriptions are
regulated by special tax laws.<br>
</p>

<p>Hollister (1971: 27) lists a few difficulties of the
therapeutic use of cannabis: <br>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The onset of the action of oral doses of THC is often
        rather slow, contrary to that of conventional
        sedative-hypnotics. </li>
    <li>Doses high enough to produce a marked hypnotic effect are
        almost always accompanied by some degree of
        psychotomimetic-like perceptual disorders, which many
        patients might find disagreeable. </li>
    <li>The fine titration of dose required to provide sedative
        effects is likely to be difficult. </li>
    <li>The drug does not have novel effects compared with other
        sedative-hypnotics. <br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The Department of Health, Education, and We] fare report to
Congress in 1971, Marihuana and Health, repeats the statement of
the Canadian Interim Report of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use
of Drugs, and states: &quot;There is no currently accepted
medical use of cannabis in the United States outside of an
experimental context&quot; (DHEW: 1971: 27). Allen Geller and
Maxwell Boas (1969: 4) think that cannabis' &quot;unsavory
reputation has largely stymied further research.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the many statements discounting cannabis' therapeutic
usefulness, some authorities maintain that its medical value
might be reborn through further research and/or use. David
Solomon, in his foreword to The Marihuana Papers (1968: xxi)
argues that: <br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marihuana should be accorded the medical status it once
    had in this country as a legitimate prescription item. After
    1937, with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act and
    subsequent federal and state legislation, it became virtually
    impossible for physicians to obtain or prescribe marihuana
    preparations for their patients. Thus, the medical profession
    was denied access to a versatile pharmaceutical tool with a
    history of therapeutic utility going back thousands of years.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a 1970 article, &quot;Pot Facing Stringent Scientific
Examination ,&quot; reference is made to Dr. Par who states that
there are three areas in which &quot;chemical and animal
experiments are under way:&quot; </p>

<p>(1) Analgesia-mood elevation plus analgesic power may make
useful drug. </p>

<p>(2) Blood pressure reduction-hypertension may be helped by new
drugs which lower the blood pressure by what seems to be action
on the central nervous system. </p>

<p>(3) Psychotherapeutic-new compounds are antidepressants and
antianxiety drugs (Culliton: 1970).<br>
</p>

<p>Mikuriya cites it studies concerning cannabis funded by the
National Institute of Mental Health in 1961. The studies were
&quot;either specialized animal experiments, part of an
observational sociologic study of a number of drugs, or
explorations of chemical detection methods&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969:
38). </p>

<p>Feinglass has pointed to four general categories into which
the clinical studies of marihuana could be divided (1968:
206-208). They are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Anticonvulsant effects-treatment of tetanus, convulsions
        of rabies, epilepsy, and infant convulsions. </li>
    <li>Psychotherapeutic actions - appetite-stimulation,
        treatment of depression, and as a sedative and hypnotic
        in reducing anxiety; treatment of addiction. </li>
    <li>Antibiotic properties. </li>
    <li>Pain-affecting power.<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Grinspoon suggests:<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Very little research attention has been given to the
    possibility that marihuana might protect some people from
    psychosis. Among users of the drug, the proportion of people
    with neuroses or personality disorders is usually higher than
    in the general population; one might therefore expect the
    incidence of psychoses also to be higher in this group. The
    fact that it is not suggests that for some mentally disturbed
    people, the escape provided by the drug may serve to prevent
    a psychotic breakdown (1969: 24).<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mikuriya lists many possible therapeutic uses of THC and
similar products in his paper &quot;Marihuana in Medicine: Past,
Present and Future.&quot; He includes:<br>
</p>

<p>Analgesic-hypnotic, appetite stimulant, antiepileptic,
antispasmodic, prophylactic and treatment of the neuralgias,
including migraine and tic douloureaux,
antidepressant-tranquillizer, anti-asthmatic, oxytocic,
anti-tussive, topical anesthetic, withdrawal agent for opiate and
alcohol addiction, child birth analgesic, and antibiotic (1968:
39).<br>
</p>

<p><b>China</b> </p>

<p>The oldest known therapeutic description Of cannabis was by
the Emperor Shen-Nung in the 28th century B.C. in China, where
the plant had long been grown for fiber. He prescribed cannabis
for beri-beri, constipation, &quot;female weakness,&quot; gout,
malaria, rheumatism and absentmindedness (Bloomquist, 1968: 19). </p>

<p><b>Egypt</b> </p>

<p>In Egypt, in the 20th century B.C., cannabis was used to treat
sore eyes. Additional medical usage was not reported until much
later. </p>

<p><b>India</b> </p>

<p>Prior to the 10th century B.C., bhang, a cannabis preparation,
was used as an anesthetic and antiphlegmatic in India. In the
second century A.D., a Chinese physician, Hoa-Tho, prescribed it
as an analgesic in surgical procedures (Mikuriya, 1969: 34). </p>

<p>From the 10th century B.C. up to 1945 (and even to the present
time), cannabis has been used in India to treat a wide variety of
human maladies. The drug is highly regarded by some medical
practitioners in that country. </p>

<p>The religious use of cannabis in India is thought to have
preceded its medical use (Blum and Associates, II, 1969: 73;
Snyder, 1970: 125). The religious use of cannabis is to help
&quot;the user to free his mind from worldly distractions and to
concentrate on the Supreme Being&quot; (Barber, 1970: 80). </p>

<p>Cannabis is used in Hindu and Sikh temples and at Mohammedan
shrines. Besides using the drug as an aid to meditation, it is
also used to overcome hunger and thirst by the religious
mendicants. In Nepal, it is distributed on certain feast days at
the temples of all Shiva followers (Blum &amp; Associates, 1969,
11: 63). </p>

<p>The Hindus spoke of the drug as the &quot;heavenly
guide,&quot; &quot;the soother of grief.&quot; Considered holy,
it was described as a sacred grass during the Vedic period (Fort,
1969: 15). A reference to cannabis in Hindu scriptures is the
following: </p>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in bhang
... Bhang is the joy giver, the sky filer, the heavenly guide,
the poor man's heaven, the soother of grief ... No god or man is
as good as the religious drinker of Mang. The students of the
scriptures of Benares are given bhang before they sit to study.
At Benares, Ujjain and other holy places, yogis take deep
draughts of Mang that they may center their thoughts on the
Eternal . . . By the help of Mang ascetics pass days without food
or drink. The supporting power of Mang has brought many a Hindu
family safe through the miseries of famine (Snyder, 1970: 125).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Greece</b> </p>

<p>In ancient Greece, cannabis was used as a remedy for earache,
edema, and inflammation (Robinson, 1946: 382-383).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Africa</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis was used in Africa to restore appetite and to relieve
pain of hemorrhoids, its antiseptic uses were also known to
certain African native tribes (O'Shaughnessy, 1842: 431). Various
other uses, in a number of countries, included the treatment of
tetanus, hydrophobia, delirium tremens, infantile convulsions,
neuralgia and other nervous disorders, cholera, menorrhagia,
rheumatism, hay fever, asthma, skin diseases, and protracted
labor during childbirth.<br>
</p>

<h3>The 19th Century </h3>

<p>Documents of the 19th century report on the use of cannabis to
control diarrhea in cholera and to stimulate appetite. In his
reports of the late 1830's and early 1840's, O'Shaughnessy (1842:
431) stated that tetanus could be arrested and cured when treated
with extra large doses of cannabis. </p>

<p>John Bell, M.D., Boston, reported enthusiastically in 1857,
about the effects of cannabis in the control of mental and
emotional disorders as opposed to the use of &quot;moral
discipline&quot; to restrain the mentally ill. Similarly, in
1858, Moureau. de Tours reported several case histories of manic
and depressive disorders treated with hashish (Walton, 1938: 3). </p>

<p>The Ohio State Medical Society's Committee on Cannabis Indica,
convened in 1860, reported that their respondents claimed
cannabis successfully treated neuralgic pain, dysmenorhea,
uterine hemorrhage, hysteria, delirium tremens, mania, palsy,
whooping cough, infantile convulsions, asthma, gonorrhea, nervous
rheumatism, chronic bronchitis, muscular spasms, tetanus,
epilepsy and appetite stimulation (McMeens, 1860: 1). </p>

<p>The India Hemp Commission (1894: 174) likewise was informed of
similar medicinal uses for cannabis. Specific reports included
the use of cannabis as an analgesic, a restorer of energy, a
hemostat, an ecbolic, and an antidiaretic. Cannabis was also
mentioned as an aid in treating hay fever, cholera, dysentery,
gonorrhea, diabetes, impotence, urinary incontinence, swelling of
the testicles, granulation of open sores, and chronic ulcers.
Other beneficial effects attributed to cannabis were prevention
of insomnia, relief of anxiety, protection against cholera,
alleviation of hunger and as an aid to concentration of
attention.<br>
</p>

<h3>MEDICAL USES IN THE 20TH CENTURY </h3>

<p>Despite the fact that marihuana was made illegal in the United
States in 1937, research has continued on the medical uses of
marihuana. The findings include various possible medical
applications of cannabis and its chemical derivatives. </p>

<p>One of the most recent and interesting findings (Frank, 1972)
concerns the effect of cannabis in reducing intraocular pressure.
It was found that as the dose of marihuana increased, the
pressure within the eye decreased by up to 30%. This occurred in
normal persons as well as in those with glaucoma, a disease of
the eye in which increased intraocular pressure may cause
blindness. Much more research is necessary in connection with
this experimental clinical finding before final judgment can be
passed on such a possible therapeutic value. </p>

<p>During the past 20 years in western medicine, marihuana has
been assigned antibiotic activity; as a result, several studies
relating to this possibility have been undertaken. H. B. M.
Murphy (1963: 20) reported investigations in Eastern Europe. He
stated that &quot;it is alleged to be active against gram
positive organisms at 1/100,000 dilution, but to be largely
inactivated by plasma, so that prospects for its use appear to
be, confined to E. N. T. (ear, nose and throat) and skin
infections.&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. J. Kabelikovi (1952: 500-503) and his coworkers carried
out tests on rats, which were similar to tests carried out with
penicillin in vitro. The alcohol extract of cannabis was
bacterially effective against many gram-positive and one
gram-negative microorganisms. It was also found that a paste form
of external application was successful. According to Kabelikovi,
&quot;from a study of 2,000 herbs by Czechoslovakian scientists
it was found that cannabis indica (the Indian Hemp) was the most
promising in the realm of antibiotics.&quot; </p>

<p>In a 1959 publication of Pharmacie, Krejci stated: &quot;From
the flowering tips and leaves of hemp, cannabis sativa var indica
bred in Middle Europe, were extracted a phenol and an acid
fraction. From the acid fraction, two acids were obtained, of
which one preserved its antibiotic properties&quot; (p. 349). In
another Czechoslovakian publication, Krejci (1961: 1351-1353)
referred to two additional samples with antibiotic activity. </p>

<p>Sample I in Fig. 1 has been sufficiently identified as
cannabidiolic acid and sample 9 as cannabidiol. Both fractions
show antibiotic activity. The results of tests lead us to
conclude that the antibacterial action of cannabis sativa is not
identical to the hashish effect found, for example, in
tetrahydrocannabinol. However, it was established that cannabis
sativa is effective as an antibiotic for local infections. </p>

<p>Kabelik, Krejci, and Santavy (1960: 13) include in
&quot;Cannabis as a Medicant&quot; the various microorganisms
against which cannabis is effective. </p>

<p>Proof could be furnished that the cannabis extracts produce a
very satisfactory antibacterial effect upon the following
microbes: staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, steptococcus alpha
haemolyticus, streptococcus beta haemolyticus, enterococcus,
diplococcus pneumonia, B. anthracis, and corynebacterium
diptheriae i.e., all of them gram-positive microorganisms.
Noteworthy is the effect upon staphylococcus aureaus strains,
which are resistant to penicillin and to other antibiotics. </p>

<p>These authors also mentioned that E. coli (gramnegative
bacteria) were tested and found to be resistant to the cannabis
extract. One of the conclusions was &quot;the possibility of
utilizing the antibiotics locally without any danger of producing
resistant strains to other antibiotics administered at the same
time throughout treatment&quot; (Kabelik, et al., 1960: 13). </p>

<p>Veliky and Genest in &quot;Suspension Culture of Cannabis
Sativa,&quot; (1970) reported that &quot;the ethanol extract of
cultured cells exhibited antibiotic activity against Bacillus
megatherium, staphlococcus aureaus and escherichia coli&quot; (p.
493). </p>

<p>Other reports said that &quot;a pronounced antibiotic effect
has been observed in South America, where fresh leaves, after
being ground, are used as a poultice for furuncles, and in folk
medicine in Europe for treatment of erysipelas&quot; (Kabelik, et
al., 1960: 8). </p>

<p>This section on the -antibiotic uses of cannabis concludes
with a summary of several reports from various countries. In
Pharmacopee Arabe: &quot;The ground-up seeds are mixed with bread
for people with tuberculosis&quot; (Andrews and Vinkenoog, 1967:
145). In Czechoslovakia: &quot;A preparation from seed pulp was .
. . introduced by Sirek to act as a roborant diet in treatment of
tuberculosis&quot; (Kabelik, 1960: 8). &quot;In Southern Rhodesia
the plant is used as an African remedy for malaria, anthrax,
sepsis, black water fever, dysentery, blood-poisoning, tropical
quinine-malarial haemoglobinuria, and a wart medicine&quot;
(Watt, 1961: 13). In Argentina: </p>

<p>Cannabis is considered a real panacea for tetanus, colic,
gastralgia, swelling of the liver, gonorrhoea, sterility,
impotency, abortion, tuberculosis of the lungs and asthma ...
even the root-bark has been collected in spring, and employed as
a febrifuge, tonic, for treatment of dysentery and gastralgia,
either pulverized or in form of decoctions. The root when ground
and applied to burns is said to relieve pain. Oil from the seeds
has been frequently used even in treatment of cancer . . .
(Kabelik, 1960: 8).<br>
</p>

<p>In 1949, Davis and Ramsey reported a study of the effect of
THC on epileptic children. &quot;The demonstration of
anticonvulsant activity of the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
congeners by laboratory tests (Loewe and Goodman, Federation
Proc., 6: 3521 1947) prompted clinical trial in five
institutionalized epileptic children&quot; (David and Ramsey,
1949: 284-285). Of these five children, all had severe
symptomatic grand mal epilepsy with mental retardation; three
also had cerebral palsy; and three had focal seizure activity.
The EEG tracings were reported to be grossly abnormal in all five
children. The results after treatment with homologues of THC,
were reported as follows: </p>

<p>Three children-responded at least as well as to previous
therapy. </p>

<p>Fourth child-almost completely seizure free. Fifth
child-entirely seizure free. </p>

<p>As a result of their study, David and Ramsey (1949: 284-285)
felt that &quot;the cannabinols herein reported deserve further
trial in non-institutionalized epileptics.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Vansim of Edgewood Arsenal has written in a recently
published book &quot;Psychotomimetic Drugs,&quot; that the
synthetic preparations of cannabis are of interest. There are
three areas where they may be of definite use in medicine (Efron,
1969: 333-334). One concerns the use of a cannabis analogue which
Dr. Walter S. Loewe reported very effective in preventing grand
mal seizures if given in small doses. </p>

<p>The second use refers to cannabis as an antidepressant. Straub
(Walton, 1938: 3), Adams (1942: 726-727), and Stockings (1947,
920-922) point to the possible use of cannabis and cannabis
analogues in relieving dysphoria in depressed patients. Other
authors (Parker and Wrigley, 1950: 278-279) had lesser success
but recommended further research in this field. </p>

<p>A report from London in 1968 suggests that cannabis treats the
symptoms and not the cause by focusing the user's attention on
his anxieties and pains without helping him to resolve them
(Report by the Advisory Committee, 1968: 11). </p>

<p>The third use is described by Douthwaite, who used hashish in
1947 &quot;for reducing of anxiety and tension in patients with
duodenal ulcer&quot; (Pond, 1948: 279). </p>

<p>A report in a 1965 issue of Medical News (&quot;Cardiac
Glycocides,&quot; p. 6) suggests cannabis as treatment for a
specific form of malignancy. </p>

<p>Cannabis is recognized as an appetite stimulant, which
suggests that the drug might be useful in the treatment of
pathological loss of appetite known as anorexia nervosa
(Grinspoon, 1969: 21). Similar symptoms exist in terminal cancer
patients who, when treated with cannabis over a short period of
time, demonstrated stimulation of appetite, euphoria, increased
sense of well-being, mild analgesia and an indifference to pain
which reduced the need for opiates (DHEW, 1971: 11). </p>

<p>Cannabis has been recently proposed as an adjunct in the
treatment of alcoholics and drug addicts. Roger Adams (1942:
726-727) and Todd Mikuriya (1970a: 187-191) noted that the
substitution of smoked cannabis for alcohol may have
rehabilitative value for certain alcoholics. </p>

<p>Regarding the use of cannabis analogue in the treatment of
drug, alcohol and depressive state withdrawal, Thompson and
Proctor (1953: 520523) report the following: </p>

<p>Depressive States: </p>

<p>20 cases of neurotic depression-4 improved (20%) </p>

<p>6 cases of psychotic depression-none improved (00%) </p>

<p>Post-Alcoholic Cases: </p>

<p>70 cases--59 reported clinical alleviation of symptoms (84%) </p>

<p>Drug Cases: </p>

<p>6 cases of barbiturate addiction-4 reported amelioration of
symptoms (66%) </p>

<p>4 cases of dilaudid addiction-3 reported alleviation (75%) </p>

<p>2 cases of pantopan and one paregoric addiction-all reported
smooth withdrawal (100%) </p>

<p>12 cases of Demerol addiction-10 withdrawals in one week (83%)
</p>

<p>6 cases of morphine addiction-2 withdrawals without unpleasant
symptoms (33%)<br>
</p>

<p>The doctors concluded that &quot;Pyrahexyl (a synthetic
cannabis-like drug) and related compounds are beneficial in the
treatment of withdrawal symptoms from the use of alcohol to a
marked degree, and in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms from
the use of opiates to a less marked, but still significant
degree&quot; (Thompson &amp; Proctor, 1953:520-523). </p>

<p>Drs. Allentuck and Bowman (1942) undertook a study of the use
of marihuana in the morphine abstinence syndrome. They stated: </p>

<p>A series of cases were selected from among drug addicts
undergoing treatment. . . . Comparative results were chartered
for the gradual withdrawal, total withdrawal, and marihuana
derivative substitution, as methods of treatment. . . . 49
subjects were studied. The results in general, although still
inconclusive, suggest that the marihuana substitution method
ameliorated or eliminated (the symptoms) sooner, the patient was
in a better frame of mind, his spirits elevated, his physical
condition was more rapidly rehabilitated, and he expressed a wish
to resume his occupation sooner (p. 250). <br>
</p>

<p>In his study of the medical application of cannabis for Mayor
LaGuardia's committee, Dr. Samuel Allentuck reported
&quot;favorable results in treating withdrawal of opiate addicts
with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a powerful purified product of
the hemp plants&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969: 38). </p>

<p>Roger Adams' detailed studies, as reported by Dr. C. K.
Himmelsbach in his 1944 article &quot;Treatment of the Morphine
Abstinence Syndrome with a Synthetic Cannabis-Like Compound&quot;
(1944:26), indicated that &quot;withdrawal manifestations were
considered to be mild. The reported therapeutic value of
marihuana was attributed to improved appetite, greater sleep,
euphoria, and a reduction of the intensity or elimination of
abstinence phenomena.&quot; Himmelsbach, however, had lesser
success when he studied the effect of a &quot;pyrahexyl&quot;
compound on the morphine abstinence syndrome, as noted by his
conclusions that: </p>

<p>(1) Pyrahexyl compound appears to possess considerable
cannabis-like effect when administered orally, but little or none
when given intramuscularly. </p>

<p>(2) When given by mouth In definitely effective amounts
pyrahexyl compound had no appreciable ameliorative effect on the
opiate abstinence syndrome (P. 29).<br>
</p>

<p>The New York City Mayor LaGuardia's Committee on Marihuana
(1944: 147-148) reported two possible therapeutic applications of
marihuana: </p>

<p>The first is the typical euphoria-producing action which might
be applicable in the treatment of various types of mental
depression; the second is the rather unique property which
results in the stimulation of appetite. In the light of this
evidence and in view of the fact that there is a lack of any
substantial Indication of dependence on the drug, It was reasoned
that marihuana might be useful in alleviating the withdrawal
symptoms in drug addicts. However, the studies here described
were not sufficiently complete to establish the value of such
treatment . . . . </p>

<p>A study was then undertaken at Riker's Island (N.Y.)
Penitentiary involving 56 morphine or heroin addicted inmates.
Two groups were equally matched according to age, physical
condition, length and intensity of habit, etc. One group received
no treatment or Magendie's solution, and the other received 15
mg. of THC and/or placebo. </p>

<p>&quot;The impression was gained that those who received
tetrahydrocannabinol had less severe withdrawal symptoms than
those who received no treatment or who were treated with
Magendie's solution&quot; the report stated. However, the report
further said that this alleged therapeutic use of marihuana
should be &quot;investigated under completely controlled
conditions&quot; before meaningful conclusions can be developed
(New York City Mayor, AU: 147-148). </p>

<p>Some reports indicate that cannabis helps relieve labor pains.
Such uses are reported among native tribes in South Africa and
Southern Rhodesia: &quot;The Suto tribe fumigates the parturient
woman to relieve pain;&quot;the Sotho women of Basutoland
&quot;are reported as smoking cannabis to stupefy themselves
during childbirth,&quot; and have also been known to
&quot;administer the ground-up achene with bread or mealiepap to
a child during weaning&quot; (Watt, 1962:13). </p>

<p>The use of cannabis in the treatment of leprosy has been
described in a 1939 dictionary of Malayan medicine: &quot;Seeds
of Hydnocarpus anthelmintim ... form the basis of the Tai Foon
Chee treatment of leprosy. After crushing and sieving, they are
mixed with cannabis indica in the proportion of two parts of the
seeds to one of Indian hemp&quot; (Andrews and Vinkenoog, 1967:
146). Likewise, Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk quote Pappe that
&quot;the early colonist employed a decoction in the treatment of
chronic cutaneous eruptions, possibly in leprosy (Andrews and
Vinkenoog, 1967: 146). </p>

<p>Kabelik, Krejci, and Santavy have reported favorable results
&quot;in stornatitis aphtosa, gingivitis, and in paradentoses
with a mouthwash of the following composition: Tinct. Cannabis
20.0, Tinct. Chamomillae, Tinct. jernmarum populi (or another tan
for example, Tinct. Gallarum) aa 10.0 to be applied in the form
of sprays or linaments to the inside of the mouth&quot; (Kabelik
et al., 1960: 13). </p>

<p>In reference to the use of cannabis, Chopra and Chopra (1957:
12-13) listed some preparations used in the practice of
indigenous medicine in India in 1957. They summarize their
article &quot;The Use of the Cannabis Drugs in India&quot; (1957:
12-13) by saying: </p>

<p>. . . with regard to the use of cannabis in Indian indigenous
medicine at the present time, it may be said that It was and
still is fairly extensively used in both the Ayurvedle (Hindu)
and Tibbi (Mohammedan) systems of medicine as an anodyne,
hypnotic, analgesic and antispasmodic, and as a remedy for
external application to piles. It is also used in the treatment
of dysmennorhoea, rheumatism, chronic diarrhoea of the sprue
type, gonorrhoea, malaria and mental diseases on the advice of
itinerant practitioners of Indigenous medicine as well as quacks
who roam about the country. For medicinal purposes the drug is
administered by mouth and hardly ever by smoking. </p>

<p>The use of cannabis drugs in indigenous medicine has greatly
declined during recent years for two reasons-firstly, because of
the rapid deterioration of the potency of cannabis drugs in
storage, the specimens available on the market being often Inert
and quite useless; secondly, because a number of potent and
effective drugs of the type used In western medicine are now
available on the market and are used quite extensively by the
practitioners of indigenous medicine in place of cannabis, for
the anodyne, sedative and hypnotic effects. In the rural areas of
India, however, the practitioners of indigenous medicine still
use cannabis quite extensively In their practice.<br>
</p>

<p>The same article lists a variety of uses in which cannabis is
employed therapeutically in veterinary medicine. </p>

<p>Dr. R. N. Chopra (1940: 361) reports the following medicinal
household uses of Indian Hemp:<br>
</p>

<p>The hemp drugs are popularly used as household remedies in the
amelioration of many minor ailments. A mild beverage made from
bhang leaves is believed to sharpen appetite and to help
digestion. Indian hemp Is commonly used as a smoke and as a drink
for its supposed prophylactic value against marihuana in
malarious tracts. Bhang beverages form one of the popular
household remedies for gonorrhoea and dysuria. On account of
their mild diuretic and sedative properties these drinks probably
give a certain amount of symptomatic relief. Likewise, the use of
bhang for dysmenorrhea, asthma, and other spasmodic conditions is
not uncommon. A poultice made from fresh leaves is a common
household remedy for painful affections of the eyes,
conjunctivitis, swollen joints, orchitis, and other acute
inflammatory conditions. <br>
Tuberculosis, anthrax, tetanus, and menstrual cramps are among
the miscellaneous medical uses of cannabis reported. Reports from
Mexico indicate the use of marihuana smoking &quot;to relax and
to endure heat and fatigue&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969: 37). </p>

<p>Kabelik et al. (1960: 13) also discuss other varied uses of
cannabis. <br>
</p>

<p>In human therapy the best results have been obtained with the
following medicaments combined with substances derived from
cannabis: dusting powder together with boric acid (otitis),
ointment (staphylococcus infected wounds, staphylodermia and so
on), ear drops (otitis chron.), alcohol solutions with glycerine
(treatment of rhagades on the nipples of nursing women-prevention
of staphylococcic mastitis,) aqueous emulsions (sinusitis),
dentin powder with the IRC (Isolated Resin from Cannabis)
(caries). The preparations mentioned above have been already
tested clinically, and will eventually be made available for
production. . . . the experiments made in clinical practice,
particularly in stomatology, otorhinolaryngology, gynecology,
dermatology, phisiology, with some pharmaceutical preparations
containing antibacterial substances from cannabis have been
reported. Attention has been drawn to the advantageous
utilization of the active substances from cannabis in veterinary
medicine, and particularly in preventive medicine for
anthropozoonoses.<br>
</p>

<p>Murphy (1963: 20) refers to an article by Lang,
&quot;Treatment of Acute Appendicitis with a Mixture of Ma
Jen,&quot; which says &quot;the drug has apparently been used in
China for the treatment of appendicitis.&quot; The Xosa tribe in
South Africa &quot;employs it for treatment of inflammation of
the feet&quot; (Kabelik et al., 1960: 7), while the Mfengu and
Hottentot use the plant as a snake-bite remedy (Watt, 1962: 13). </p>

<p>Other therapeutic uses attributed to marihuana are for the
treatment of migraine headaches, as an analgesic, and as a
hypnotic. Hollister (1971: 28) stated that &quot;other uses which
have been proposed for marihuana include the treatment of
epilepsy, as prophylaxis for attacks of migraine or facial
neuralgia, or as a sexual stimulant.&quot; <br>

<p><b>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding</b> </p>

<h1>History of the Intoxicant Use<br>
</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The preceding history of the medical use of marihuana has
provided an outline of how marihuana has been alleged to care
diseases and relieve pain. This section discusses the non-medical
use of cannabis. The survey includes a discussion of marihuana
use in India, the rest of Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United
States; and a concluding analysis of the intoxicant use in
contemporary times. </p>

<p>Assessing marihuana's use as an intoxicant is difficult
because for many people around the world, its importance as an
intoxicant has been secondary to its use as a folk medicine or a
ceremonial adjunct (Grinspoon, 1971: 173-174). Caffeine and
nicotine apart, cannabis is second in worldwide popularity only
to alcohol. </p>

<p><b>India</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana was probably first used as an intoxicant in India
around 1000 B.C., and soon became an integral part of Hindu
culture (Snyder, 1970: 125). In China, where the marihuana plant
had been used to make cloth and certain medicines for centuries,
it was not recorded as an intoxicant. Explanations are unclear as
to why marihuana was used as an intoxicant in India but not in
China. </p>

<p>Marihuana was also used as an intoxicant in other parts of the
world prior to 500 A.D. but was not as well documented as the use
of opium. The drug &quot;nepenthe&quot; in Homer's Odyssey is
believed by a number of scholars to have been a brew in which the
most active ingredient was hemp (Brotteaux, 1967: 10). Galen
wrote in the second century that it was customary to promote
hilarity and happiness at banquets by giving the guests hemp
(Reininger, 1967: 14-15). </p>

<p>Cannabis is used in three different preparations in India
(Snyder, 1970: 27). The first is called bhang, comparable in
potency to marihuana in the United States. It is made from the
leaves and stems of uncultivated plants and blended into a
pleasant tasting liquid concoction. The second is ganja, more
potent than bhang, made from the tops of cultivated plants. The
third and most potent preparation, charas, is similar to hashish
or &quot;hash&quot; and is obtained by scraping the resin from
the leaves of the cultivated plants. Hard blocks are pressed from
this material which are converted for smoking. </p>

<p>High-caste Hindus are not permitted to use alcohol. But they
are allowed bhang at religious ceremonials, and also employ it as
an intoxicant at marriage ceremonies and family festivals. Bhang
is used by laborers in India in much the same way as beer is used
in the United States (Barber, 1970: 80). </p>

<p>The lower classes of India use either a few pulls at a ganja
pipe or sip a glass of bhang at the end of the day to relieve
fatigue (Grinspoon, 1971: 173), to obtain a sense of well-being,
to stimulate appetite, and to enable them to bear more cheerfully
the &quot;strain and monotony of . . . daily routines&quot;
(Geller and Boas, 1969: 5). These types of users and objectives
are frequently the reverse of those in the United States where
marihuana users consider themselves an exclusive and advanced
&quot;in-group&quot; (Andrews and Vinkenoog, 1967: iii). A major
intoxicant use in India is for religious purposes. </p>

<p><b>Asia and the Middle East</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis spread from India to other parts of Asia, to the
Middle East and then to Africa and South America, although some
believe it may have originated independently in the latter two
continents (Fort, 1969: 15). Cultural values may have played a
part in determining its use. Opium and cannabis were equally
available in pre-Communist China; but cannabis had no vogue as an
intoxicant (Barber, 1970: 80). The Chinese spoke of the plant as
the &quot;Liberator of Sin.&quot; In India, it was called. the
&quot;Giver of Life&quot; (Fort, 1970: 15). One author proposed
that temperament may have also played a role in this
determination, suggesting that perhaps the placid, practical
Chinese did not appreciate the euphoria produced by cannabis
(Snyder, 1070: 125). </p>

<p>Additional evidence of mid-Asian use comes from cuneiform
tablet interpretations that ascribe use in Persia circa 700-600
B.C. and of the time of Ashurbanipal's Assyrian reign, 669-626
B.C. (Blum. and Associates, 1969, 1: 62). </p>

<p>The drug's popularity as an intoxicant spread to the Middle
East and thoroughly permeated Islamic culture within a few
centuries (Geller and Boas, 1969: 5). Because alcohol was
prohibited to the followers of Mohammed, cannabis was accepted as
a substitute. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The Myth of the Assassins</b> </p>

<p>Two Muslim myths, one from the 10th century A.D. and the other
from the 13th century A.D., have been the sources of some of the
contemporary attitudes about the drug. The first myth deals with
hashish as a magical eastern drug brought by the Arabs into Spain
in the 10th century. These invaders confined its use primarily to
themselves, taking it back to Africa when they left Spain.
Although it did not become a European habit, some beliefs about
the drug were left behind. </p>

<p>The existence of this &quot;magical eastern drug&quot; was
probably known to Marco Polo, the Venetian traveler of the 13th
century A.D. before he left on his journey to the East. Marco
Polo returned to Europe with his own tale of cannabis which, in
the potent form of hashish, was said to be used as an intoxicant
by Hasan-I-Sabbah to send his ruthless followers on missions of
murder. The word &quot;assassin&quot; was said to be derived from
the word &quot;hashish,&quot; or from Hasan (Geller and Boas,
1969: 6). Marco Polo had written about how this &quot;Old Man of
the Mountain&quot; sent his men out on their missions with all
the color and pageantry that Europeans associated with the East.
As Marco Polo described: </p>

<p><i>In the territory of the Assassins there were delicious
walled gardens in which one can find everything that can satisfy
the needs of the body and the caprices of the most exacting
sensuality. Great banks of gorgeous flowers and bushes covered
with fruit stand amongst crystal rivers of living water....
Trellises of roses and fragrant vines cover with their foliage
pavilions of jade and porcelain furnished with Persian carpets
and Grecian embroideries.</i> </p>

<p><i>Delicious drinks in vessels of gold or crystal are served
by young boys or girls, whose dark unfathomable eyes cause them
to resemble the Houris, divinities of that Paradise which the
Prophet promised to believers. The sound of harps mingles with
the cooing of doves, the murmur of soft voices blends with the
sighing of the reeds. All is joy, pleasure, voluptuousness and
enchantment.</i> </p>

<p><i>The Grand Master of the Assassins, whenever he discovers a
young man resolute enough to belong to his murderous legions . .
. invites the youth to his table and intoxicates him with the
plant &quot;hashish.&quot; Having been secretly transported to
the pleasure gardens the young man imagines that he has entered
the Paradise of Mahomet. The girls, lovely as Houris, contribute
to the illusion. After he has enjoyed to satiety all the joys
promised by the-Prophet to his elect, he falls back to the
presence of the Grand Master. Here he is informed that he can
enjoy perpetually the delights he has just tasted If he will take
part in the war of the Infidel as commanded by the Prophet </i>(Geller
and Boas, 1969: 6).<br>
</p>

<p>Another translation (Kitti, 1967: 24) begins the tale this
way: </p>

<p>Now no man was allowed to enter the Garden save those whom he
intended to be his ASHISHIN. </p>

<p>In reality, this was a religious situation and scholars have
long since exposed Marco Polo's tale as being a myth, at best an
imaginative embellishment of tales he had heard.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Africa</b> </p>

<p>Use of cannabis in most parts of Africa developed slowly, most
of it during the past 100 years (Blum and Associates, 1969, I:
73). A report from Africa in 1891 (Reininger, 1966: 141-142),
dealt with a tribe that used hemp as an intoxicant in their newly
formed religion and in preparation for battle. A similar use is
described in the Congo, when Simba warriors in 1964 were said to
use a cannabis-alcohol mixture in preparation for battle, to
rouse themselves for the battle and to magically guarantee
immunity from harm. </p>

<p>In Morocco, marihuana, called kif, has been used as an
intoxicant by adult males for centuries; that custom continues
today even though the drug is illegal (Mikuriya, 1970: 122-123). </p>

<p>Although moderate use appears to be tolerated in the areas of
India, North Africa and the Middle East, excessive use is
generally viewed as indicative of serious personality problems
(Geller and Boas, 1969: 7).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Europe</b> </p>

<p>One of the more suggestive parallels between 19th century
France and the United States today is the fact that the French
interest in cannabis at that time was aroused by the returning
French soldiers and scientists of Napoleon's army in Egypt, a
source of the drug. A similar interest occurred in the United
States after the Korean conflict, and has intensified since
Vietnam (Geller and Boas, 1969: 7). </p>

<p>During the 19th century, European interest in the drug was
aided by two scientific reports, the first by W. B. O'Shaughnessy
in 1839, and the second report by Queen Victoria's physician,
Russell Reynolds. Both men recommended its medical use for a
variety of ailments and as a mild euphoriant (Grinspoon, 1971:
56). Cannabis received highly laudatory testimonials from the
medical profession of that day and was readily available without
prescription (Snyder, 1970: 121). </p>

<p>Interest in cannabis was further kindled by popular writers
who used and spoke of hashish enthusiastically, including Charles
Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, and Pierre Gautier. Gautier and
Baudelaire, in fact, were members of the Club des Hachischins, in
which a number of writers and intellectuals gathered and
experimented with hashish (Geller and Boas, 1969: 13). </p>

<p>Although the public delighted to read of the French writers'
drug experiences, the public did not care to engage in the same
kind of activity; to them the experiences were frightening and
repugnant. &quot;As a result, the smoking of hashish remained the
sub-rosa province of a few European artists until the recent
trans-Atlantic phenomenon of the American drug culture&quot;
(Geller and Boas, 1969: 8).<br>
</p>

<p><b>United States </b></p>

<p>The, events surrounding the introduction of cannabis use to
the New World are entirely unclear. Some historians say the
Spaniards brought the plant with them in the 16th century, other
say marihuana smoking came in with the slave trade or with the
Asian Indian migration of the late 18th century. </p>

<p>The hemp plant was cultivated in the United States for
centuries, apparently without general knowledge of its
intoxicating properties (Grinspoon, 1971: 10). Cannabis was an
often used medicine in the United States in the 19th century. It
was easily available without a prescription and was also widely
prescribed by physicians (Snyder, 1970: 26). Hemp was used by the
pioneers to cover their wagons. The plant was a major crop in
Kentucky, Virginia, Wisconsin and Indiana, and was one of the
more important southern agricultural products, after cotton.. It
is still used to make rope, twine and textiles, while the seed is
used as bird food (Geller and Boas, 1969: 16). </p>

<p>Marihuana use as an intoxicant in the United States began
slowly in the early part of this century. Puerto Rican soldiers,
and then Americans who were stationed in the Panama Canal Zone,
are reported to have been using it by 1916. American soldiers
fighting Pancho Villa circa 1916 also learned to use it. This
follows the first reported use in Mexico in the 1880's (Blum and
Associates, 1969, 1: 69-70). Intoxicant use in the United States
is also traced to the large influx of Mexican laborers in the
1910's and 1920's (Geller and Boas, 1969: 14). </p>

<p>The 1933 Report of the &quot;Military Surgeon&quot; stated,
regarding marihuana use among the soldiers in the Canal Zone,
that: </p>

<p><i>Marihuana as grown and used on the Isthmus of Panama is a
mild stimulant and intoxicant. It is not a &quot;habit
forming&quot; drug in the sense that the derivatives of opium,
cocaine, and such drugs, are as there are no symptoms of
deprivation following its withdrawal.</i> </p>

<p><i>Delinquencies due to marihuana smoking which result in
trial by military court are negligible in number when compared
with delinquencies resulting from the use of alcohol drinks,
which is also classed as a stimulant and intoxicant </i>(Geller
and Boas, 1969: 147).<br>
</p>

<p>The report went on to say that marihuana presented no threat
to military discipline, and &quot;that no recommendations to
prevent the sale or use of marihuana are deemed advisable.&quot; </p>

<p>Cannabis has been rejected in various societies on ascetic
grounds. In such puritanical societies such as the Wahabil of
Arabis and the Senussis of Libya, no smoking of any kind was
tolerated, nor was coffee. In North Africa, social rank dictated
use: the aristocratic Moors scorned both hemp and tobacco
smoking, preferring instead, as compatible with high status,
opium eating (Blum and Associates, 1969, 1: 73). </p>

<p>One statement highlighting this kind of value conflict comes
from a Nigerian journalist (Davies, 1966: 299-300) attempting to
explain the 15-year prison sentences of foreign tourists for
growing and smoking marihuana: </p>

<p><i>There is a growing trend in the more economically advanced
countries to indulge at leisure in the exploration of the
personality. At a certain stage of development, there is less
need to produce and more time to spend consuming. This is
healthy. If used properly, marihuana could be helpful at this
stage of development. However, countries which are only beginning
to develop a more complex economic structure must channel all
their energies into creating a new system. This means that they
must sacrifice more of their pleasure. People who smoke hemp seem
on the whole to be less aggressive than people who drink alcohol.
Hemp smoking may have a positive value for certain social
functions....</i> </p>

<p><i>One of the first acts of the Military Government was to
issue a decree making it punishable by death to grow marihuana,
and by up to twenty years of prison for merely being in
possession of it . . . meantime, we Nigerian have to stop getting
high for a while and develop our country.<br>
</i></p>

<p>In the United States, the decade of the 1960's has seen a
spectacular and unprecedented spread of the use of marihuana,
chiefly among the youth. An estimated 24 million persons have
used marihuana and approximately 3.4 million are current users.
The numbers involved and the fact that use spans all age groups
and social classes in American life has produced marked public
reaction and a need for more information on the drug.<br>

<p> <b>II. Biological Effects of Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>Botanical and Chemical Considerations<br>
<img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</h1>

<p> Cannabis sativa is one of man's oldest and most widely used
drugs. The substance has been used in various ways as long as
medical history has been recorded and is currently used as a
multipurpose drug throughout the world (Adams, 1942; Adams,
1941-1942; Grinspoon, 1969; Indian Hemp, 1969; Walton, 1938). </p>

<p> During the past few years, a resurgence of the use of
marihuana by western society, its increased importance as a
social issue and the development of more precise compounds and
analytic techniques have sparked dormant scientific interest in
the substance. However, this effort has added little to what was
already known about the clinical syndrome produced by cannabis
(Hollister, 1971) and described by investigators during the last
100 years (Hollister, 1971; Beaudelaire, 1861; Moreau, 1845;
Lewin, 1964; Indian Hemp, 1969; Mayor's Committee, 1944). </p>

<p> Strongly held, diametrically opposed opinions exist about
whether the ultimate effects of cannabis use are harmful,
harmless, or beneficial to human functioning (Pillard, 1970). </p>

<p> Despite these conflicting opinions, from a scientific
perspective, the literature on marihuana is as clear, if not
clearer, than for many other botanical substances consumed by
man. Most of the older reports suffer from multiple scientific
defects such as biased sampling, lack of adequate controls,
unsophisticated techniques, and use of unstandardized marihuana
of unknown potency. Nevertheless, much is known about the use of
cannabis by man. Marihuana has a unique position in the multitude
of pharmaceuticals in that human experimentation has been greater
than laboratory animal experimentation. </p>

<p> The crucial experiments about social effects from chronic use
will be settled by close observation of those who use the drug.
The issues of potential therapeutic utility; mechanisms of mental
function alteration; and the relationship to mental illness will
require more extensive laboratory experimentation (Hollister,
1971).<br>
</p>

<h2>Botanical and Chemical Considerations</h2>

<p> In the past several years considerable progress has been made
in adding to the understanding of marihuana as a complex drug
containing botanical substance. Much important information has
been obtained from intensive investigation of marihuana of
worldwide origin cultivated under Government contract by the
University of Mississippi (Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Marihuana is a preparation derived from the hemp plant,
Cannabis sativa. This plant is an annual which either is
cultivated or grows freely as a weed around the world, including
most of the United States. When cultivated in temperate climates,
plantings are made in May to June. The seeds germinate in less
than a week. in moist soil. After thinning, the plants grow as
rapidly as two feet a week during the peak growing season. They
can reach a height of up to 18 feet at maturity, approximately
three to five months after planting. Growth is greatly inhibited
by inadequate light, water or soil nutrients. </p>

<p> Marihuana is produced by cutting the stem beneath the lowest
branches, air drying, and stripping seeds, bracts, flowers,
leaves and small stems from these plants. Stems and seeds are
variably removed using a mesh screen producing manicured
marihuana. Hashish is produced by scraping the thick resinous
material secreted by the flowers (Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Many morphological variations in branching and leaf structure
are observed among plants produced by different seed types. The
characteristic leaf is palmately-compound and contains an odd
number of coarsely serrated leaflets. Plants of a given seed type
generally grow at similar rates and resemble each other. Thus,
botanists believe, Cannabis sativa represents a single species
which has not stabilized and has many variations (Doorenbos et
al., 1971). </p>

<p> Cannabis Sativa is a dioecious species with separate male and
female plants, both producing flowers. Some monoecious variants
are reported. Pollination appears to be accomplished by air
currents. Bees are attracted by male flowers but not by female
flowers. Sex cannot be established until flowering begins and the
structure of the male and female flower is distinct. Male plants
begin shedding leaves shortly after flowering, shied their pollen
and die. Female plants lose their older leaves as the seed
matures. After shedding their seed, they die. Contrary to popular
belief, there is no significant difference in drug content
between male and female plants at equivalent states of maturity
(Fetterman et al., 1970; Ohlsson et al., 1971). Male plants
mature earlier than the females, shed their pollen and die while
the female plant is continuing to mature. </p>

<p> The drug content of the plant parts is variable. Generally,
the, drug content decreases in the following order: bracts,
flowers, leaves. Practically no cannabinoids are found in the
stems, roots and seeds. Obviously, fluctuations in pharmacologic
activity of a sample of Marihuana, depend on the mixture of these
plant parts which is determined by the manicuring process
(Fetterman et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Different variants of the plant contain different amounts of
psychoactive drug. Variants of cannabis Sativa cover a spectrum
of drug contents. Generally, they can be classified as either
drug or fiber genotype. Drug type is high in THC and low in
cannabidiol and the fiber type is the converse. This type is
determined genetically and transmitted by the seed. </p>

<p> Thus, seeds from different geographical areas produce plants
with a wide range of drug content. For example, when grown under
similar conditions, plants grown from seeds from Mexico may
contain 15 times more psychoactive drug than those grown from
seeds from Iowa. Of course, individual plants of the same variant
often contain greatly different drug content (Fetterman, et al.,
1970). </p>

<p> Environmental factors are not as important as heredity in
determining type, but they influence to some degree the drug
content. However, environmental factors, including type of soil,
water, growing space, temperature and light do play an important
role in determining the size and vitality of the plant (Doorenbos
et al., 1971; Ohlsson et al., 1971; Phillips et al., 1970). </p>

<p> This notorious variability of cannabis preparations causes
many disadvantages for detailed and reproducible biological work.
Consequently, much effort has been expended to provide a firm
chemical basis in order to provide pure and well-defined
substances for research. </p>

<p> The major naturally occurring active component of cannabis,
1-delta 9-trans tetrahydrocannabinol, was not isolated in a pure
form and its structure illucidated until 1964 (Gaoni and
Mechoulam, 1964; Mechoulam and Gaoni, 1967; Mechoulam et al.,
1970). In addition, the A' isomer, which is usually present in
small quantities in the natural product representing less than
10% of the combined THC content, has a similar spectrum of
activity (Hively et al., 1966). These two chemicals, available by
industrial synthesis (Fahrenholtz et al., 1967; Petrzilka and
Sikemeier, 1967) or by extraction from the natural plant, can
apparently reproduce fully the effects of the crude drug in
animals and man. More than 20 natural cannabinoids have been
identified in the plant (Figure 1) (Mechoulam, 1970; Shani and
Mechoulam, 1970; Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> All but Delta 11 and Delta 9 THC are inactive
psychopharmacologically and do not seem to exert potentiating or
other effects. However, new compounds, cannabinoids and
non-cannabinoids, are being isolated from the plant and require
further investigation. Several studies may indicate that some
material present in natural marihuana may act synergistically
with THC and potentiate its psychological effect Leniber (1972)
Paton and Pertwee (1971) suggest cannabidiol may play this role. </p>

<p> The chemical nomenclature of tetra-hydrocannabinols is in a
state of confusion due to the existence of two numbering systems.
The dibenzopyran or formal system treats the compound as
substituted dibenzopyrans ( Delta 9 THC) while the monoterpenoid
system considers them as substituted terpenes (Al THC). The
formal system will be used hereafter (Figure 2).<br>
</p>

<p> Many of the natural cannabinoids are present in the plant as
acids. These acids are believed to be psychopharmacologically
inactive. However, they are converted rapidly when heated, and
slowly when stored into their respective active neutral
components (Figure 3) (Waller, 1971). This conversion
(decarboxylation) does not apparently occur when the acids are
absorbed after oral consumption (Mechoulam, 1970). </p>

<p> The proposed biogenesis (Figure 4) of All THC appears to
proceed through cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis variates of the fiber
type apparently do not perform this conversion. Thus, cannabidiol
is the cannabinoid present in the largest percentage in the
non-drug variety (Phillips et al., 1970). Marihuana appears to
lose its potency over time due to conversion of THC to cannabinol
(CBN) (Mechoulam, 1970) and this also apparently occurs more
quickly for hashish implying the presence of a stabilizing
substance in the whole plant (Figure 5). </p>

<p> Recently, the n-propyl homologue, of Delta 9 THC has been
isolated from crude marihuana. It has about 20% of the activity
of Delta THC in mice, and probably makes only a small
contribution to the total marihuana effect (Gill, 1971). Merkus
(1971) and Vree et al. (1971) have recently identified propyl and
methyl cannabinol homologues in hashish in extremely small
quantities. </p>

<p> In addition, numerous other non-cannabinoids have been
identified in the natural material. Most of these have little or
no psychoactivity (Gill et al., 1970; Bercht et al., 1971).
Recently, waxes. starches, oils, terpenes and simple nitrogenous
compounds including muscarine, choline and trigonelline as well
as volatile low-molecular weight piperdines have been isolated. </p>

<p> Additionally, four more complex nitrogenous containing
compounds of the generally-accepted alkaloid type have been
reported in marihuana leaves in minute concentrations (average
0.002%). These produced decreased activity but no acute toxicity
in mice (Klein et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Another laboratory has isolated two steroids and triterpenes
from. marihuana as well as tyramine amide derivatives from the
roots (Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Analysis of the smoke obtained from marihuana has been
investigated. As in the case of any combustible plant, a gas and
particulate phase is produced. Both these phases are delivered to
the lung. Both the gas and particulate phase consist of compounds
present in approximately the same percentages as other burned
cellulose containing materials except for the cannabinoid
fraction. This includes carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
hydrogen cyanide gases. (Truitt et al. , 1970) </p>

<p> The remainder, the smoke condensate, consists of a complex
mixture of relatively non-volatile compounds. Included in this
mixture are the cannabinoids (16%), carbohydrates and alcohols
(8%), fatty and aromatic acids (11%), polybasic acids (7%),
aliphatic amines (1%), aromatic phenols (27%), aliphatic phenols
(6%), tannin (6%), unidentified compounds (18%) (Truitt et al.,
1970). </p>

<p> Another group of investigators (Magus and Harris, 1971)
compared the tar collected from combustion of marihuana
cigarettes with the tar yielded from tobacco cigarettes. They
reported that the total tar yield from marihuana was slightly
less than half that produced by an equal weight of tobacco. The
tar contained similar constituents based on typical changes
produced on skin of mice. </p>

<p> In addition, there a multitude of synthetic compounds related
to the naturally occurring Delta 9 THC derivatives and much more
potent (Figure 6). A large number of bomologues have been
prepared all with similar activity but differing widely in their
potency. </p>

<p> In general, the activity of these compounds increases
dramatically over that of A' THC by lengthening the 3 alkyl side
chain to 6 and 7 carbons, with additional branching in the alpha
and beta positions. The dimethylheptyl analogue (EA1476 or DMHP)
is the most active having 50 times the activity of A' THC. The
1-methyloctyl substitution (MOP, EA1465) is the next most potent,
compound. The 1,2-dimethylortyl substitution resulted in a 251
fold decreased activity from DMHP. (Domino et al., 1972; Sim and
Tucker, 1963) </p>

<p> Numerous variations of the basic structures in the
cyclohexene moeity of the molecule, as well as the replacement of
-both methyl groups-by-hydrogen resulted in partial and even
complete, loss of activity (Domino et al., 1972; Sim and Tucker,
1963). </p>

<p> Mechoulam. (1971) has summarized the investigations related
to the structure activity relationships of the cannabinoids as
follows: </p>

<p> (1) The pyran ring with a hydroxyl group at 1 position and an
alkyl group at the 3 position is an essential requirement for
psychotomimetic activity, eg., cannabidiol is inactive. </p>

<p> (2) The aromatic hydroxyl group has to be f reo or esterified
for activity. </p>

<p> (3) The presence of a carboxyl, acetyl or carbomethoxyl group
in position 2 or 4 renders the compound inactive. Substitution
with an alkyl ,group at position 2 retains activity. </p>

<p> (4) Dextrorotary (+) delta-9-THC is inactive whereas its
optical isomer levorotary (-) delta9-THC is active. </p>

<p> (5) Maximal activity is seen if the double bond is in the
delta-9 or delta-8 position. The delta,-6a, 10a-THC is relatively
inactive. 9 (6) The activity of the delta-6a, 10a-THC can be
increased by replacement of the pentyl side chain with a hexyl
side chain to form synhexyl which is an active compound.
Branching of the side chain may lead to considerable increase in
potency. The substitution of a dimethyllheptyl side chain for the
pentyl side chain in the delta-6a, 10a analogue of THC to form
DMHP or EA1476 results in a marked increase in pharmacologic
activity.<br>
</p>

<p> (7) Substituents at the 9 and 10 position have to be in the
plane of the ring (that is equatorial) in order that high
activity be retained. </p>

<p> More detailed information on materials, chemistry, bioassays,
analytical methods, and methodology for detecting THC or its
metabolites in biological fluids may be obtained from The
Metabolism of the Tetrahydrocannabinols (Lemberger, 1972) and The
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 1972 Report on
Marihuana and Health.<br>

Effect </title>

<h1>Factors Influencing Psychopharmacological Effect<br>
</h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> A renewed interest in marihuana studies has been prompted by
the recent clarification of the complexities of its chemistry,
new techniques to quantity the amounts of active drug in natural
materials, and the availability of purified
tetrahydrocannabinols. These advances allow more precise
scientific research on psychiopharmacological effect.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP<br>
</b> </p>

<p> A major advance has been a quantification of dose of THC in
relation to clinically observable phenomena. This has been
extensively studied over a wide dose range for marihuana (Rodin
and Domino, 1970; Melges et al., 1970; Tinklenberg et al., 197O;
Weil et al., 1968; Meyer et al., 1971; Clark and Nakashima, 1968;
Clark et al., 1970; Jones and Stone, 1970; Mayor's Committee,
1944; Manno et al., 1970) and Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol
(Isbell et al., 1967; Waskow et al., 1970; Hollister et al.,
1968; Perez-Reyes and Lipton, 1971; Lemberger et -al., 1971;
Dornbush and Freedman, 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> Investigations by Isbell et al. (1967), Kiplinger et al.
(1971) and Renault et al. (1971) have clearly demonstrated that
when reliable quantities of smoked marihuana or THC are delivered
to the subject, a reproducible linear dose-dependent effect
occurs on indices of physiologic, psychomotor, and mental
performance as well as on mood and subjective experiences over a
dose range of 12.50 to 200 micrograms of Delta 9 THC per kilogram
of body weight.<br>
</p>

<p> In a 154 pound man this is comparable to consuming 0.88 to
17.5 milligrams of Delta 9 THC or 88 to 150 milligrams of
marihuana containing one percent Delta 9 THC. It is generally
assumed that good quality marihuana available in the United
States contains 1% Delta 9 THC and an average marihuana cigarette
consists of 500 milligrams of marihuana; thus, 5 milligrams of
Delta 9 THC (Hollister, 1971). </p>

<p> As with most drugs, the larger the dose taken, the greater
the psychopharmacologic effect. Isbell et al. (1967) noted that
clinical syndromes vary from a mild euphoric feeling of
relaxation at low doses (25 micrograms per kilogram) to an
intensive hallucinogenic-like experience at high doses (250
micrograms per kilogram).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>DOSE-TIME RELATIONSHIP<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Similar time-action curves have been demonstrated for smoked
Delta 9 THC and equivalent quantities of smoked marihuana
(Hollister et al.,1968; Isbell et al., 1967 Renault et ai., 1971
Kiplinger et al., 1971). Symptoms began almost immediately after
smoking (2-3 minutes). At lower doses, the peak effect is seen at
10 to 20 minutes and the duration of effect is 90 minutes to two
hours. At higher doses, symptoms persist for three to four hours.
</p>

<p> Therefore, as with most drugs, the larger the dose taken, the
longer the action. The subjective symptoms experienced by the
subject appear to parallel in time the subjective effects and
some physiological indices such as pulse rate (Isbell et al.,
1967; Hollister, 1968 - Renault and Schuster, 1971; Kiplinger et
al., 1971; Galanter et al., 1972; Lemberger et al., 1971). Others
such as reddening of the eyes have a delayed peak response and
longer duration (Kiplinger et al., 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION<br>
</b> </p>

<p> A second factor which influences the effect experienced by
the user is the manner in which the substance is consumed. That
is, whether it is smoked, swallowed or injected. </p>

<p> Isbell et al. (1967) demonstrated that smoked material is two
and a half to three times as effective as orally consumed
marihuana in the form of a 95% ethanolic solution in producing
equivalent physiologic and subjective effects.<br>
</p>

<p> In addition, the oral time-action curve is extended with
onset of symptoms one-half to one hour after administration. A
peak effect is reached in two to three hours and the effect
persists for three to five hours at low doses and six to eight
hours at larger doses (Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell, et -al.,
1967; Lemberger et al., 1971; Perez-Reyes, and Lipton, 1971). </p>

<p> In general, the effects produced by ingested THC or ingested
marihuana extract are comparable to those produced by nearly
one-third the amount of smoked and inhaled THC or marihuana
(Hollister, 1971). </p>

<p> Recent work has been reported which clarifies these findings.
Lemberger et a]. (1971) studied absorption into the blood
utilizing radioactive labeled THC by three routes of
administration: smoked, ingested in 95% ethanolic solution in
cherry syrup, and intravenously injected. The first appearance of
the drug into the, blood was immediate intravenously; almost
immediate, by inhalation; and delayed for 15 to 30 minutes when
ingested. </p>

<p> Perez-Reyes and Lipton (1971) using labeled AO THC
demonstrated that rate of absorption by the gastrointestinal
tract, and the duration of action is greatly influenced by the
vehicle used to ingest the drug. Speed and completeness of
absorption varied when the THC was dissolved in 100% ethanol or
sesame oil or emulsified with a bile salt (sodium glycocholate),
and administered to a subject who had fasted 12 hours. With the
bile salt vehicle, the physiologic and subjective effects were
noted between 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and lasted two to
three hours. In contrast, the effects, with ethanol or sesame
oil, appeared after one ,hour and lasted four to six hours.<br>
</p>

<p> Hollister and Gillespie (1970) hypothesized that this delayed
gastrointestinal absorption of THC might be accounted for by the
nonpolar vehicle required to dissolve TUC or marihuana extracts. <br>
</p>

<p> Furthermore, Perez-Reyes and Lipton (1971) found that the
peak levels and duration of radioactivity in the plasma
paralleled the physiologic and subjective effects, although the
plasma levels remained high for a longer period of time than the
effect. Subjects receiving the drug emulsified in sodium
glycocholate or dissolved in sesame oil had three times higher
plasma levels of radioactivity with much less excreted in the
feces than those receiving the drug dissolved in ethanol. </p>

<p> These results indicate that the THC was poorly absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract when given in all alcoholic solution.
The sesame oil solution and the glycocholic acid preparation
allowed more complete absorption and the latter preparation was
much faster. It is of interest that the degree of subjective high
after ingestion of 37 milligrams Delta 9 THC also parallels the
plasma radioactivity. </p>

<p> Thus, the subjects reported their experience, as intense and
unpleasant both with the bile salt and the sesame oil, and as
moderate and entirely pleasant with ethanol. (Perez-Reyes and
Lipton, 1971) This correlates well with earlier findings of
Hollister et a]. (1968).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>QUANTIFICATION OF DOSE DELIVERED<br>
</b> </p>

<p> The problem in quantifying the THC dose delivered by
different routes of administration has been clarified by several
studies using radioactive compounds. However, until a method for
determining the THC blood concentration is developed, only
estimates oil amount delivered are possible. </p>

<p> Radioautographic studies clearly demonstrate that intravenous
injection gives the, most complete and consistent delivery
(Lemberger et a]., 1971; Me Isaac et M., 1971; Ho et a]., 1971;
Kennedy and Waddell, 1971; Idanpaan-Heikkila, 1971). These
investigators have demonstrated that THC is poorly absorbed from
the injection site after intraperitoneal or subcutaneous
injection. </p>

<p> As discussed earlier, the completeness of absorption ocurring
after oral administration of THC appears to depend upon the
vehicle. Judged by radioactivity levels, almost complete
absorption of the THC occurs with an oil or bile acid vehicle,
but absorption is incomplete with an alcohol vehicle.
(Perez-Reyes et al., 1971) <br>
</p>

<p> Recent animal studies performed for NIMH indicated that the
oral dose necessary to produce comparable gross behavioral
changes in lab animals is about three times higher than the
intravenous dose (Marihuana and Health. 1971: 171). Ferraro
(1971) demonstrated the comparability of effective oral doses of
THC in chimpanzees and humans. Furthermore, preliminary work
performed in the laboratories of M. Isaac (1971) and Harris
(1971) and Mechoulam (1971) appear to indicate that the
intravenously administered dose of Delta 9 THC necessary to
produce detectable behavioral changes in monkeys (20 to 50
microgram/ kg) on conditioned learning tasks is comparable to
that in man. (Kiplinger et a]., 1971; Lemberger et al., 1971). <br>
</p>

<p> The dose of THC absorbed from natural marihuana extracts
ingested orally is uncertain. THC is present as an acid in
variable quantities in natural marihuana. THC acid has not
presently been proven to be active. Claussen and Korte (1968)
reported that the THC carboxylic acid is converted to free THC
during the smoking process. Whether these, acids are active
themselves; are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or
converted there into THC; or are decarboxylated in the, body is
unknown presently.<br>
</p>

<p> Because inhalation is the most widely used route of
administration of marihuana, several laboratories have
investigated the effect of combustion and smoking oil marihuana.
Because techniques and conditions varied between laboratories,
precise quantification of the delivery to the smoker's lungs is
uncertain.<br>
</p>

<p> Manno, et al. (1970) calculated that about 50% of the THC
contained in a marihuana cigarette would be delivered to the
smoker's lungs for absorption if the entire cigarette were smoked
in 10 minutes and each inhalation was retained for 30 seconds
with no sidestream loss. Truitt (1971) and co-workers (Foltz et
al., 1971) found that 50%c of THC was pyrolyzed and 6% was lost
in the side stream while noting that almost 21% of the THC
remained in the butt when three-fourths of the cigarette is
consumed. </p>

<p> Agurell and Leander (1971) studied the transfer of THC using
actual smoking subjects where only the main stream smoke was
collected. They found that 14-29%% of the THC was transferred in
the mainstream smoke for a cigarette and 45% for a pipe. However,
they stated that this amount transferred would be comparable if
no butt was left. </p>

<p> Agurell and Leander found that the amount transferred was not
effected by depth of inhalation but that smokers using deep
inhalation retained 80% of the transferred THC while those using
superficial inhalation tended to exhale more than 20% of the
transferred THC. Mikes and Waser (1971) also found about 22% in
the mainstream smoke. </p>

<p> These divergent data appear to be comparable when corrected
for loss to sidestream and retention in the unsmoked portion.
Thus, the efficiency of delivery of THC by smoking and inhalation
using good techniques, and smoking the entire cigarette
approximates 40-50% of the original THC contained. A small
fraction is lost in the uninhaled sidestream smoke, about 50% is
destroyed during pyrolysis and a variable amount is exhaled from
the respiratory dead space. </p>

<p> In apparent confirmation, Lemberger et al. (1971, 1972),
using radiolabeled THC added to a marihuana cigarette, found that
the initial plasma level of radioactivity after smoking was about
onehalf the level after intravenous injection. Oral
administration of the same dose of THC in an alcohol vehicle
produced about one-half the peak level as smoking. However,
Galanter et al. (1972) noted marked variability in the amount of
THC absorbed using a standardized routine of inhaling,
breath-holding and finishing the cigarette within a set time
period.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>EFFECT OF PYROLYSIS ON THE CANNABINOIDS<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Several investigators have studied the effect of pyrolysis on
the cannabinoids. Most have concluded that only negligible
changes occur in the original cannabinoid fraction of marihuana
except for decarboxylation of the acids to the cannabinoids. No
evidence was found for isomerization of Delta 9 THC or Delta 8
THC nor the formation of any new pyrolysis products (Manno et
al., 1970; Coutselinis &amp; Miras, 1970; Claussen and Korte,
1968; Foltz et al., 1971; Agurell and Leander, 1971). Mikes and
Waser (1971) suggested that a small percentage of cannabidiol was
converted to Delta 9 THC, but this observation was not confirmed
by the other groups. </p>

<p> Coutselinis and Miras (1970) noted that less THC was
destroyed during smoking when Delta 9 THC was the only
cannabinoid present rather than when a resin or a mixture of
cannabinoids were present. This was believed to be at least
partially accounted for by the distribution of THC in the
cigarette. More destruction occurred when the THC was evenly
distributed in the cigarette than when it was present in a
well-defined lump.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>SET AND SETTING</b> </p>

<p> A most important variable encountered when evaluating the
effect of marihuana is the interaction of the drug with the
non-drug factors, set and setting. Set refers to the drug-taker's
biological make-up including personality, past drug experiences,
personal expectations of drug effect, and mood at the time of the
drug experience. Setting refers to the external surroundings and
social context in which the individual takes the drug. Set and
setting exert their largest effect on psychoactive drugs, like
marihuana, with subtle subjective mental effect and minimal
physiological effect. Set and setting exert a variable but often
marked influence on the potential drug effects (Waskow et al.,
1970; Wickler, 1970). </p>

<p> The results of a series of experiments by Jones (1971)
suggests the subjective state produced by &quot;a socially
relevant dose of smoked marihuana.... 9mg THC&quot; is determined
more by set and setting than by the THC content of the marihuana.
</p>

<p> In one experiment, a greater variety and more intense
pleasurable symptoms occurred in a fourman group allowing
unstructured interpersonal interaction than in unstructured
solitary test situations. Contrasting behavioral patterns were
observed by the investigator and reported subjectively by the
individuals. Subjects tested individually demonstrated a relaxed,
slightly drowsy, undramatic state as they read, listened to the
radio, or sit doing nothing. In the group setting there was
elation, euphoria, uncontrolled laughter, a marked lack of
sedation and much conversation. (Jones, 1971) </p>

<p> This strongly emphasizes the importance of setting in the
marihuana experience. The reason is apparent why marihuana is
usually used with other people. However, most investigators
studying its effects evaluate their subjects alone, in
well-controlled, sterile, scientific laboratories. </p>

<p> The importance of the placebo effect (the subject experiences
a drug effect from an inert material) to the &quot;social
high&quot; obtained from marihuana was studied in another
experiment (Jones and stone, 1970; Jones, 1971). Misjudgments of
the pharmacologic potency of both the smoked placebo (marihuana
without THC) and active marihuana were commonly made by the
subjects although physiologic and performance indices routinely
matched the distinction correctly. The smoking of a material that
smells and tastes like marihuana by individuals with marihuana
experience appeared to produce a mental state that is interpreted
as being high if combined with the expectation of becoming high. </p>

<p> The importance of learning to get high was demonstrated when
individuals who smoked marihuana less than twice a month were
compared with those who used marihuana at least seven times a
week. Although both groups rated the active marihuana equally
potent, the frequent users rated the placebo equally to the
active drug, while the infrequent users experienced significantly
less high from the placebo. </p>

<p> The infrequent users' experiences appears to reflect mainly
pharmacologic factors with moderate set-setting influence.
However, the frequent users' response to the placebo appears to
reflect mainly learned set-setting influence and minimal
pharmacologic factors. (Jones, 1971) </p>

<p> Smith and Mehl (1970) call learning to get high &quot;
reverse tolerance.&quot; During the early exposures to marihuana
the individual learns to appreciate the subtle drug effect with
repeated experience with the drug. Consequently, less drug may be
required to experience the desired high in the early stages of
marihuana use. </p>

<p> Further evidence for this is seen when the familiar smoking
route and smell and taste cues are made ineffective by giving the
active and inactive material by the oral route (Jones and Stone,
1970). Both groups of users can significantly distinguish the
intoxication produced by 25mg of active material. But the
frequent user rates this high significantly poorer than his
smoking high while the infrequent user rates them correctly.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>TOLERANCE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> The development of tolerance is another important factor that
may influence the psychophysiological effects of marihuana.
Although tolerance occurs with many drugs and the process has
been studied for over a century, the mechanism of this complex
phenomenon is not completely known. Kalant et a]., (1971) have
extensively discussed tolerance to the psychotropic drugs. </p>

<p> Tolerance has two different connotations. The first, termed
&quot;initial tolerance,&quot; is an expression of the dose of
the drug which the subject must receive at his first exposure to
produce a designated degree of effect. These authors state that a
variety of congenital and environmental factors contribute to the
wide range of differences in &quot;initial tolerance&quot;
observed among different individuals, sexes, species, age groups
and so on. </p>

<p> The second meaning of tolerance is that of an &quot;acquired
change in tolerance&quot; within the same individual as a result
of repeated drug exposures so that an increased drug dose is
required to produce the same specified degree of effect, or the
same dose produces less effect. In this chapter, tolerance will
be used synonymously with &quot;acquired increase in
tolerance.&quot; -Tolerance can only be discussed for each
specific drug action and not for all the actions of a given drug
on the body. That is, tolerance occurs at different rates for
some of the various effects of the same drug on the body and may
not occur for other effects of the same drug. The relationship
between &quot;initial tolerance&quot; and &quot;acquired change
in tolerance&quot; has not been clearly established. </p>

<p> There are two classes of tolerance based on possible
mechanisms. The first, dispositional tolerance refers to changes
in absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism which
produce a reduction in the intensity and duration of contact
between the drug and the target tissue on which it acts. </p>

<p> The second, functional tolerance includes changes in the
properties and functions of the target tissue making it less
sensitive to the same dose of the drug. Physiological tolerance
implies a, change in the target organ while psychological or
&quot;learned tolerance&quot; implies the acquisition of new
skills or functions to replace those changed in the target tissue
(Kalant et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Considerable evidence is accumulating which demonstrates that
tolerance does develop in numerous animal species (pigeons, rats,
dogs, monkeys, chimpanzees, mice) to the behavioral and
physiological effects of marihuana and THC in doses many times
larger (from 1 mg. to 500 mg./ kg/day) than the minimal active
dose (Carlini, 1968; Silva et al., 1968; McMillan et al., 1970,
1971; Frankenheim et al., 1971; Carlini et al., 1970; Thompson et
al., 1971; Pirch et al., 1972; Ferraro, 1971; Elsinore, 1970;
Cole et al., 1971). <br>
</p>

<p> Lipparini et al. (1969) were not able to demonstrate
tolerance in the rabbit. </p>

<p> Tolerance, appears to develop rapidly to high doses even when
injections are spaced up to about a week apart. Tolerance to high
doses appears to be long-lasting with little loss of tolerance
even after a month. But at low doses in the behavioral range,
tolerance appears to completely dissipate in a few days after a
single dose. The magnitude of tolerance development can be large.
After repeated exposure, a dose of over one hundred times the
original produces little effect (McMillan et al., 1971). </p>

<p> The development of tolerance to THC in animals occurs for
some effects but not for others (McMillan et al., 1971; Pirch et
al., 1972; Thompson et al., 1971 ). This differential development
of tolerance may explain why tolerance to certain effects studied
has not been demonstrated (Masur and Khazan, 1970; McMillan et
al., 1971; Barry and Kubena, 1971; Kubena et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Lomax (1971) and Thompson et al. (1971) have noted that the
development of tolerance to one effect of the drug (hypothermia
or sedation) may allow the expression of the opposite effect
(hyperthermia or stimulation) to which tolerance does not
develop. </p>

<p> Cross tolerance has been demonstrated between delta-9-THC,
delta-8-THC and its synthetic analogues. Cross tolerance, has not
been demonstrated between THC and lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD), mescaline or morphine (McMillan et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Preliminary work performed by McIsaac (1971) and Harris et
al., (1972) demonstrated a reduction in the duration and quality
of response on a conditioned learning task by monkeys on the
seeond intravenously administered dose of THC. Tolerance
developed extremely rapidly so that no effect on behavior was
seen after five days. After a. two-week period without THC, the
animals were retested and the same degree of tolerance had
persisted. The researchers believe these observations might
indicate a rapid behavioral adaption or &quot;learned&quot;
functional tolerance. </p>

<p> However, evidence indicates that dispositional tolerance
and/or physiological type of functional tolerance also plays a
role at least at higher doses. Tolerance develops to the central
nervous system depressant effects, hypotherma hypopnea (Thompson
et al., 1971) and the EEG effects (Pirch et al., 1971) of the
drug. McMillan et al., (1971) have demonstrated that tolerance to
the effects of THC on behavior can be blocked by the hepatic
microsomal enzyme inhibitor, SKF-525-A which has been shown to be
a potent inhibitor of THC metabolism (Dingell et al., 1971).
Methodological techniques must be, developed which will allow
microdistribution studies to be performed in tolerant animals
with low doses of THC before the mechanism of tolerance
development can be clarified. </p>

<p> Evidence for the development of marked tolerance by man has
been suggested by studies of heavy daily very long term users of
hashish, charas or ganja in foreign countries. Reports from the,
Eastern literature (Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Dhunjibhoy, 1930;
Ewans, 1904) and more recently from Greece (Miras, 1965; Fink et
al., 1971) and Afghanistan (Weiss, 1971) relate daily consumption
of enormous quantities of potent cannabis preparation estimated
to contain up to about one gram of THC per day. </p>

<p> Weiss (1971) has noted that daily charas smokers start with
small doses and then in order to achieve the same effect
gradually increase their daily dose about 5-6 times over a 20 to
30 year period. Generally, most reach their maximum dose by age
40 and then gradually decrease their daily dose by 50% usually
ceasing use by their 60's. Some smokers have been noted to raise
their original daily dose up to a maximum of 10 times within the
first two years. </p>

<p> Others have noted that moderate use for many years does not
necessitate increased doses (Sigg, 1963). </p>

<p> At least part of the increase in daily amount of drug used is
accounted for by the finding that the duration -of the
intoxication becomes shorter over the years so that the very
heavy smoker must consume the drug more frequently to remain
intoxicated. Additionally, smokers report that they have on
occasion discontinued use for days or months after which they
experienced similar effects at smaller doses (Weiss, 1971). </p>

<p> Fink et al. (1971) noted that as hashish users total daily
dose was decreased by more than half over the years, the
frequency of use per day declined correspondingly. </p>

<p> Rubin and Comitas (1972) noted that very long term Jamaican
ganja smokers generally consumed an average of seven spliffs
daily (a ganja cigarette several times the size of an American
marihuana cigarette) with a maximum of 24. </p>

<p> Further evidence for the development of tolerance, at least
to certain of the depressant effects, is that these very long
term smokers apparently tolerate the extremely high doses well
without dysphoria or decreased ability to perform their usual
activities (Weiss, 1971; Fink et al., 1971; Rubin and Comitas,
1972). </p>

<p> Smith and Mehl (1970) noted the, accumulating American
anecdotal evidence of mild tolerance development after heavy
daily use for a number of years. Jones (1971) and Meyer et a].
(1971) have suggested diminished effect on physiologic and
psyochomotor performance, that is, little or no impairment of
function in daily users compared with infrequent, intermittent
users of marihuana. Additionally, several investigators have
noted that frequent users had little or no impairment on
psychomotor performance tasks while marihuananaive individuals
given the same dose had impaired function. (Clark et al., 1968,
1970; Jones and Stone, 1970; Mayor's Committee, 1944; Weil et
al., 1968). </p>

<p> Subsequently (Mendelson et al., 1972) repetitive daily (free
access) use over a 21-day period by groups of long-term
intermittent (average 7.7 sessions per month) and moderate,
marihuana users (daily average, 33 smoking sessions per month)
was studied. The development, of tolerance was strongly suggested
to the physiological pulse rate and general depressant effect on
activity as well as psychological effects which impair recent
memory, time estimation and psychomotor coordination. </p>

<p> No tolerance development occurred to the subjective effects
of marihuana for experienced users over the 21-day period (global
&quot;highness&quot;, somatic, perceptual, awareness, feeling,
control, friendliness, ambivalence and altered thinking).
Furthermore, with the exception of a higher ambivalence rating
for the daily riser group, there were no differences in the
subjective reports of the daily users or intermittent users.
(Mendelson et al., 1972). The ambivalence score is believed (Katz
et al., 1968) to be the best measure of &quot;psychedelic ef
fects&quot; of hallucinogenic drugs. </p>

<p> In a prior study (Meyer et al., 1971) found that while the
heavy smokers experienced more profound subjective effects soon
after smoking, they were less intoxicated than the intermittent
users one hour later. </p>

<p> These findings suggest to the investigators that the quality
of the &quot;high&quot; may be different for heavy and
intermittent users and may change with heavy use. Tolerance, to
the subjective effects of marihuana may occur predominantly to
the depressant effects so that the stimulatory effects (or
hallucinatory-like) would be predominant in the heavy users. The
intermittent users who smoked marihuana several times daily in
the, current study showed no increase in the ambivalence, rating.
</p>

<p> The increased daily frequency of marihuana use by both groups
over time by shortening the interval between smoking sessions
appears consistent with earlier observations (Meyer et al., 1971)
that the duration of the desired &quot;high&quot; is shorter in
heavy users than in intermittent users. </p>

<p> Fink et al. (1971) confirmed several of these findings in a
study in which intermittent users smoked a fixed dose (14 mg. of
THC) of marihuana. They noted a suggestion of development of
tolerance to pulse rate, short-term memory, digit symbol
substitution but not to the subjective high or EEG changes.
However, the subjects did feel that the duration of the
intoxication shortened progressively during the second half of
the experiment. </p>

<p> Schuster and Renault (1971) administered twice daily fixed
doses of marihuana (smoke from 430 mg. of marihuana with 1.5% THC
content) to intermittent users over a 10-day period. A peak
tachycardia, of 20 to 30 beats per minute and a usual social high
were produced. Preliminary observations revealed the development
of tolerance to time estimation in a few days, but no evidence
for tolerance to the tachycardia, orthostatic blood pressure, or
rating of the high. </p>

<p> Hollister (1971), in preliminary studies found no significant
evidence of tolerance after five daily oral doses of 20 mg. of
THC. Clinical responses measured were subjective judgment of the
high, mood, pulse rate, reading comprehension or excretion of
urinary metabolites.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>REVERSE TOLERANCE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Smith and Mehl's (1970) clinical observations of many
marihuana smokers suggest a J-shaped time curve of tolerance to
marihuana. A novice marihuana smoker often reports feeling no
high or requiring considerably more drug to get high on his first
few trials with the drug than after he obtains more experience
with the drug. This phenomenon has been called &quot;reverse
tolerance.&quot; These clinicians believed this represented
&quot;learning to get high&quot; or acquiring the ability to
appreciate or become sensitive to the subtle aspects of the
intoxication.<br>
</p>

<p> Goode (1971) found that more frequent and term marihuana
smokers tend to require fewer &quot;joints&quot; to get high but
differences were not statistically significant. </p>

<p> Weil et al. (1968) reported that experienced users of
marihuana achieved a &quot;high&quot; after being given the same
dose as naive (non-users) persons who did not experience a high
but did demonstrate objective physiologic and psychomotor drug
effects. </p>

<p> Meyer et al. (1971) found that heavy marihuana, users (daily
for three years) were most sensitive to the &quot;high&quot; and
required less marihuana to achieve a social high than infrequent
intermittent users (use one to four times per month for less than
two years). </p>

<p> Phillips et al. (1971) reported an increase in severity of
symptoms after repeated administration of THC to rats. This
&quot;sensitization&quot; may be a correlate of reverse
tolerance. </p>

<p> Lemberger et al. (1971) supplied additional evidence for
reverse tolerance based on the intravenous administration of 0.5
mg of THC to experimental subjects. Naive subjects experienced no
effect from this small dose. However, daily marihuana users, who
were told they were receiving a non-pharmacologically active dose
of THC, reported a &quot;marihuana high,&quot; which lasted up to
90 minutes. </p>

<p> Lemberger et al. (1971, 1972) and Mechoulam (1970) suggested
the possibility that enzymes necessary to convert THC to a more
active compound require prior use of marihuana. </p>

<p> Reverse tolerance appears to be a complex phenomenon. Jones
(1971) presented evidence which stressed the importance of
expectation, setting and prior drug experience on learning to get
&quot;high.&quot; As the user gains more experience with
marihuana, the more the individual's mind is able to respond to
the expectation of the &quot;high&quot; by actually becoming high
when given an inert material which smells and looks like
marihuana. </p>

<p> Weil (1971) believes that the capacity to get
&quot;high&quot; is an inherent characteristic of each
individual's mind. He, believes that marihuana facilitates the
user's abilitv to achieve this altered state of consciousness,
that is, learn how to get high. </p>

<p> Mendelson et al. (1972) did not find evidence for reverse
tolerance. In fact, the daily users were more likely than the
intermittent users to smoke two cigarettes per occasion. Both
groups had had an average of five years of marihuana use. Several
other investigators did not obtain any evidence of reverse
tolerance after repetitive daily use in experienced subjects
(Hollister, 1971; Schuster and Renault, 1971; Fink et al., 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>METABOLISM<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Metabolism of the drug by the body exerts an important
influence on the psychopharmacologic effect of marihuana. Many
laboratories in many countries have been examining the
metabolism, of the cannabinoids using in vitro liver microsomal
enzyme preparations.<br>
</p>

<p> With the recent availability of radiolabeled Delta 9 and
Delta l THC, cannabinol and cannabidiol much activity has
occurred in vivo in animals. A comprehensive review of these
areas including studies of absorption, disposition, excretion,
metabolism and stimulation-inhibition of metabolism is beyond the
scope of this report. Readers interested in further details in
this area are referred to an excellent comprehensive review by
Lemberger (1972). <br>
</p>

<p> From animal and in vitro studies it appears that the liver
rapidly changes Delta 9 and Delta 11 THC in a similar manner by
hydroxylation to 11-OH THC. This compound appears to be as potent
or possibly more potent pharmacologically than the parent
compounds This metabolite appears to be, rapidly hydroxylated to
8-11 dihydroxy Delta 9 THC (7-11 dihydroxy All THC) which is
inactive. The 8-OH Delta THC appears to be a minor active
metabolite (Christensen et al., 1971; Burstein et 1970; Ben-Zvi
et al., 1970; Foltz et al., 1970; Wall et al., 1970,71; Nilsson
et al., 1970). </p>

<p> These metabolites are excreted primarily into the bile and
then to the feces. Some evidence exists for an enterohepatic
circulation returning the drug to the blood. (Miras and
Coutselinis, 1970; Klausner and Dingell, 1971) </p>

<p> Another metabolic pathway appears to be present resulting in
a series of acidic metabolites excreted primarily in the urine
(Agurell et al, I., 1970). Recently, Burstein and Rosenfeld
(1971) isolated and identified a majo r rabbit urinary
metabolite, 11-carboxy-2'-hydroxy-Delta 9 THC. They postulate
that other acidic metabolites might be esters or amides of this
compound (Figure 7). </p>

<p> Recently, Nakazawa and Costa (1971) demonstrated that A' THC
was metabolized by lung microsomes forming two unidentified
products not found in liver homogenates.<br>
</p>

<p> Lemberger et al. (1970, 1971, 1972) and Galanter et al.
(1972) have performed metabolic studies in mail using
intravenous, oral and smoked Delta 9 THC. These studies indicate
that the THC disappears from the plasma in two phases. </p>

<p> The initial rapid phase has two components and represents
metabolism by the liver and redistribution from the blood to the
tissues. The slower second phase represents tissue retention and
slow release and subsequent metabolism. </p>

<p> The plasma 1/2 life of THC was significantly shorter in daily
users than nonusers at both the first component of phase one (10
minutes versus 13 minutes) and phase two (27 hours versus 56
hours). Tissue distribution was similar in daily and nonuser (1/2
life 2 hours). </p>

<p> Therefore, immediate metabolism of THC and subsequent
metabolism is more rapid for daily user than the non-user
implying specific enzyme induction. THC persists in the plasma
for a considerable period of time, at least three days, with a
half life of 57 hours for nonusers and 28 hours for daily users. </p>

<p> The presence of 11-hydroxy THC and more polar metabolites in
the plasma of both users and nonusers within 10 minutes indicates
that the metabolite probably accounts for the pharmacological
activity of marihuana, not THC. </p>

<p> Further metabolism of the 11-hydroxy THC to more polar
inactive 8-11 dihydroxy A' THC metabolite occurs more rapidly in
users than nonusers. During the first few hours after injection,
unchanged THC, its polar metabolites and nonpolar metabolites in
the plasma, decline rapidly and then level off as they are
distributed to the tissues. THC persists in the plasma, for at
least three days, and both users and non-users excrete
metabolites in the urine and feces for more than a week.<br>
<br>
Delta-9-THC is extensively metabolized to more polar compounds
which were excreted in the urine and feces. Urinary excretion and
biliary excretion (reflected a day later in the feces) was
greatest during the initial 24 hours, then gradually tapered off.
All THC is metabolized since no unchanged THC was excreted in the
feces or urine. No difference in total cumulative excretion was
observed but a significantly larger percentage of the metabolites
were excreted in the urine of users than nonusers. About 40-45%
of the metabolites were collected in the feces in both groups in
one week. Urinary excretion in this period accounted for 30% in
daily users and 22% in nonusers. (Lemberger et al., 1970, 1971,
1972) </p>

<p> Perez-Reyes et al. (1971) found a similar pattern of
excretion of metabolites after oral administration. </p>

<p> Urine contained no Delta 9 THC, only a small quantity (3%) of
11-hydroxy THC and 90% more polar acidic compounds as yet
unidentified. (Lemberger, 1971). Preliminary studies by Burstein
and Rosenfeld ('1971) suggest that these human acidic urinary
metabolites are identical to the 11-carboxy-2' hydroxy THC found
in rabbits. </p>

<p> In man, Lemberger et al. (1971, 1972) found that 11-OH THC
and 8-11-OH THC were primarily excreted in the feces. Twenty-two
percent of the metabolites in the feces were unchanged 11-hydroxy
THC and slightly less were 8-11-dihyd-roxy THC. The remainder
were unidentified more polar compounds, perhaps conjugates of
these metabolites. </p>

<p> All user subjects (Lemberger et al., 1970, 1971, 1972) but no
non-user noted a high after intravenous injection of the 0.5 mg
dose of Delta 9 THC. This would be a dose range of 5 to 7
micrograms/kg. Highs have been noted by Kiplinger et al. (1971)
with smoking THC to deliver a dose of 6.25 micrograms/kg. The
high for some lasted up to 90 minutes. Thus, the plasma levels of
Delta 9 THC and its metabolites seen after intravenous injection
suggest that psychopharmacologic effects are seen in the first
component of the rapid phase and terminated by redistribution and
metabolism after the initial phase. The 11-hydroxy Delta 9 THC
would be present at this early phase and is probably responsible
for the activity of Delta 9 THC in marihuana. </p>

<p> Further evidence that the 11-OH Delta 9 THC is responsible
for marihuana's effect was seen in oral and inhalation studies.
By the oral route, blood levels of unchanged THC were relatively
low compared to the radioactivity levels of the metabolic
products at the time of peak subjective effect. While the blood
level of unchanged THC at the peak oral effect was identical to
that after intravenous injection of the 0.5 mg. dose, the
psychologic, effect was much more pronounced after oral
administration of the larger 20 mg. dose of THC. Again after
inhalation, the plasma levels of the metabolites correlate
temporally with the subjective effects but the plasma levels of
unchanged Delta 9 THC do not. (Lemberger, 1970, 1971, 1972;
Galanter, 1972)<br>
</p>

<p> <b>PATTERN OF USE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> The drug effect of marihuana can only be realistically
discussed within the context of who the user is, how long he has
used, how much and how frequently he uses and what is the social
context of the use. In general, for virtually any drug the
heavier the use pattern, that is the longer the duration, the
more frequently the use and the larger the quantity used on each
occasion, the greater the risk for either direct or indirect
damage. </p>

<p> Tolerance development is only one of a variety of occurrences
which are related to the repetitive use of marihuana. Any
discussion of drug effect must take into account the time period
over which the drug is used (duration of use). This is necessary
in order to detect cumulative effects or more subtle
gradually-occurring changes. Of course, the issue of causality is
quite complex because of the multitude of factors other than
marihuana use that have a direct or indirect effect on the
individual over a period of years. </p>

<p> For the purposes of this report, immediate or acute effects
will refer to those drug effects which occur during the drug
intoxication or shortly following it. Short-term or sub-acute
will arbitrarily refer to periods of less than two years;
long-term, from two to 10 years; and very long term (or chronic),
greater than 10 years. </p>

<p> Frequency of use, will arbitrarily be designated in the
following manner: experimental use refers to use of marihuana at
least one time but not more than once a month; intermittent use
refers to use more than once a month but not more than 10 times a
month (several times a week) ; moderate use refers to use of the
drug more than 10 times a month but not more than once a day;
heavy use designates use more than once, daily and very heart use
refers to use many times a day, usually with potent preparations
(high THC content), producing almost continual intoxication so
that the smoker's brain is rarely drug free.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>AMOUNT OF DRUG CONSUMED<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Relatively little actual data are available on the amount of
marihuana, smoked per occasion or per day by current users in the
United States. (McGlothlin, 1971, 1972). Estimates of the
quantity of THC consumed are difficult because of the variability
of potency as well as weight and size of the marihuana cigarette
(&quot;joint&quot;) and the degree of cleaning of stems and seeds
from the dried leaves manicuring&quot;). </p>

<p> The analytic data available indicates most of the marihuana
used in the United States is of Mexican origin and averages about
I % THC per dry cleaned weight of marihuana (Lerner and Zeffert,
1968; Jones, 1971). Subjective ratings by experienced marihuana
users appear to substantiate the data that marihuana containing
1% THC is of average quality (Jones and Stone, 1970; Weil et al.,
1968). </p>

<p> Marihuana cigarettes are estimated (McGlothlin, 1971, 1972)
to average about 0.5 g in weight and, therefore, contain about 5
mg of THC. Cigarettes used in the eastern states are generally
smaller than those, rolled in the west (McGlothlin, 1971; New
York Police Department, 1969, 1970) </p>

<p> Most data indicates that for the large majority of users
one-half to one cigarette (2.5 to 5 mg THC) is sufficient to
&quot;get high&quot; in intermittent moderate users, although
often two or more cigarettes were smoked to achieve additional
effect (Nisbet and Vakil, 1972; Shean and Fechtmann, 1971;
McGlothlin et al., 1970- McGlothlin, 1972; Jones, 1971; Goode,
1970). </p>

<p> Current American daily users appear to consume one to two
cigarettes per occasion (Jones, 1971) although some users
estimate they smoke three to five cigarettes per occasion
(McGlothlin et al., 1970). Goode (1971), however, found
practically no relationship between amount required to get high
and frequency of use (daily to less than monthly) or duration of
use (less than two years to six or more years). In fact, the
heavy and longer term users were less likely to require more
&quot;joints.&quot; </p>

<p> Thus, the estimated 15 mg THC for current daily users is
about one-half that estimated for confirmed regular users 30
years ago in the United States (Mayor's Committee, 1944; Charen
and Perelman, 1946) and one-third to one-fourth the median daily
consumption of daily users in North Africa and India. </p>

<p> The maximum daily consumption of 10 cigarettes (50 mg THC)
for current heavy U.S. marihuana smokers (Jones, 1971;
McGlothlin, 1972) is about the same as the average amount
consumed by daily chronic users in other countries, and about
one-fourth or less of the maximum in these countries (Soueif,
1967; Sigg, 1963; Indian Hemp Drug Commission's Report,
1893-1894; Chopra, 1940; Chopra and Chopra, 1939). </p>

<p> Studies of American military in Vietnam (U.S. Congress, 1971;
Colbach and Crowe, 1970; Forrest, 1970), and Germany (Tennant et
al., 1971) described the daily use of quantities of hashish or
potent marihuana comparable to amounts consumed by regular
chronic users in other countries. </p>

<p> Experimental data appear to confirm these estimates of
quantity of THC consumed. Isbell et al. (1967) and Jones (1971)
found that most subjects reported a normal &quot;high&quot; after
smoking 5-10 mg of THC. Meyer et al. (1971) found that a
&quot;very high&quot; state was attained by ad libitum smoking of
3.12 mg THC by daily users and 3.78 mg THC by intermittent users.<br>
</p>

<p> In experiments by Johnson and Domino (1971), subjects were
urged to smoke until they were as high as they had ever been on
marihuana and felt they could not smoke any more. These subjects
smoked from one to four cigarettes containing 8.7 mg of THC to
reach this level of intoxication. The range was from 8.7 to 30 mg
of THC with a mean of about 20 mg THC. </p>

<p> Intermittent and daily users were allowed to smoke marihuana
on a free choice basis over a 21day period in studies by
Mendelson et al. (1972). Each cigarette contained one gram of
marihuana of approximately 2% THC content, or about 20 mg of THC.
</p>

<p> Subjects were asked to rate their high on a 10 point scale
with 10 corresponding to highest ever; five as moderately high
and zero, no effect. Ratings for the daily user group ranged from
zero to nine with an average of about six for all cigarettes
rated. Individual means ranged f rom three to about seven. On
almost all occasions, subjects in both groups smoked the entire
cigarette. </p>

<p> Kiplinger et al. (1971) and Lemberger, et al. (1971) noted
that daily long-term users were able to detect effects of the
&quot;high&quot; at doses calculated to deliver as low as 5-7
micrograms/kg THC (equivalent to smoking about 100 mgs. of
marihuana containing 1 % THC). Perhaps this explains the finding
that many users are able to &quot;get high&quot; smoking US
wild-growing marihuana containing front near zero to 0.5% THC
(Lerner, 1969; Phillips et al., 1970; Fetterman et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Several ad libitum experiments were performed with marihuana
of unknown composition (Williams et al., 1946; Siler et al.,
1933) using &quot;confirmed regular marihuana users&quot;
confined over a 39 and six-day period. The users, who generally
consumed three cigarettes per day, under these rather artificial
conditions of the, experiment consumed means of 17 (range nine to
26) and five (range one to 20) cigarettes per day respectively. </p>

<p> Miras and Coutsilinis (1970) reported recent experimental
data on chronic Greek hashish users who routinely use, single
smoked doses of hashish containing 100 mg of THC. Under ad
libitum conditions, these users averaged 150-350 mg of THC per
day over a 30-day period. </p>

<p> The subjects studied during a 21-day period of free choice
Marihuana consumption by Mendelson et al. (1972) generally
consumed all of one cigarette containing 20 mg of THC per smoking
session. 'The subjects who were previously daily users were more
likely during the experiment to consumer more, than one,
cigarette per session than the, previously intermittent users. </p>

<p> Individual consumption by the intermittent users ranged from
an average of about one-half to<br>
six cigarettes per day (group mean three) while the daily users
consumed an average of three-anda-half to nine cigarettes per day
(group mean six-and-a-half). Reasons given by the subjects for
the dramatic shift in the frequency of marihuana use included
boredom, testing the limits of their endurance, demonstrating its
harmlessness to the research staff, and subtle social pressure. </p>

<p> <b>DURATION OF USE</b> </p>

<p> Very little American data exists on the duration of marihuana
use. Practically no data exists which demonstrates the extent
that persons who initiated marihuana use some 20-40 years ago
have continued its use. Robins and Murphy (1967) in a follow-up
study of St. Louis black males noted that 20% of those who had
tried marihuana by age 24 were still using it to some degree 15
years later. McGlothlin et a]. (1970, 1971) reported on a sample
of predominantly white adults who began using, marihuana in
adolescence and had continued infrequent use for more than 20
years. </p>

<p> In the case of Western and particularly middle class American
use of marihuana, the rapid climb to prominence of the phenomenon
since the midsixties raises the question of whether the entire
drug movement is transient or permanent. Certainly, the majority
of the youthful users and many of the adults have used the drug
less than 10 years and probably less than five years. </p>

<p> One 1970 survey (Lipp, 1970) revealed that 77% of those
students who initiated marihuana use four to five years earlier
were still using it to some degree. A recent study (Walters et
a]., 1972) indicates that students who first used marihuana
before entering college in September 1965 and had continued use
of marihuana in February 1969 (&quot;old user&quot;) differed
from the, vast majority of users who began their drug use in
college (&quot;new user&quot;). </p>

<p> The old user is more likely to experiment with a wide variety
of drugs, to be extremely active in radical political
organizations, to be alienated from American society, to be less
definite about career plans, and to have more heterosexual
activities. </p>

<p> The Commission-sponsored National Survey indicated that
marihuana use by both youth (12-17 years of age) and adults (18
and over) is experimental in approximately 75% of those who have
ever used marihuana. These individuals have, either stopped using
it (66% of adults and 57% of youth) or are, using, it once, a
month or less. In contrast, 13% of the ever used subsample (12%
adults, 16% youth) use marihuana once a week or more. </p>

<p> In other non-Western countries, cannabis use frequently
persists for long periods. Especially in the East, persons using
it for 20-40 years or more are not uncommon. In other cultures,
initiation is most common in adolescence. Once the habit is
established it is likely to continue on a daily basis for many
years and frequently continues as a lifetime practice (Weiss,
1971; Sigg, 1963; Soueif, 1967; Watt, 1936; Chopra and Chopra,
1939; Bouquet, 1951; VN, 1957). </p>

<p> Probably the duration of use will vary considerably depending
on cultural acceptance or rejection (McGlothlin, 1972). </p>

<p> <b>INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS</b> </p>

<p> Little experimental work has been done on the interaction
between marihuana and other drugs used socially or medically
although this will become an important area as usage increases. </p>

<p> Marihuana is often used with sweet wines to enhance its
effect. Some evidence for an additive effect of marihuana and
alcohol on motor and mental performance and subjective effect has
been seen experimentally (Manno et al., 1971; Jones and Stone,
1970). Some degree of additive effects would be expected with
barbiturates based on their similarity to alcohol. A more
complex, mixed pattern of effect might be expected with
amphetamines and hallucinogens. These latter combinations are
rarely used socially (Hollister, 1971).<br>

<p> <b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Acute Effects of Marihuana </h1>

<p> <b>(Delta 9 THC)</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> <b>SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS</b> </p>

<p> Descriptive accounts of marihuana intoxication have been
written by noted authors, Beaudelaire (1961), scientists, Moreau
(1945), and common users Tart, 1970, 1971; Isbell et al., 1967;
Report by Advisory Committee, 1968). Adequate description of the
state of mind produced by low doses is difficult because it is
not approximated in the usual states of consciousness or by other
commonly used drugs. The closest non-drug approximation may be
the altered state of consciousness experienced in the hypnotic
trance or transcendental meditation or the, transition zone
between waking and sleep (Weil, 1971). Due to the highly
subjective nature of the experience, there is much individual
variation in the effects described. </p>

<p> Tart (1970, 1971) studied the range of potential common
effects in an extensive survey of 150 users. Changes noted by
these studies at low doses (usually smoked dose about five mg.
THC) include euphoria, with restlessness and mild mental
confusion. Sensory perception of the external environment. is
altered. Users often perceive an overestimation or slowing of
elapsed time and expansion of space, enhanced sense of tactile,
olfactory, gustatory perceptions and often a feeling of hunger.
Visual alterations reported are more vivid imagery and seeing
forms and patterns in objects that are usually amorphous.
Increased awareness of subtle qualities of sound such as purity,
distinctness or rhythm are characteristically perceived by users.
A dreamy, relaxed state and disinhibition, with uncontrollable
laughter is reported and users often believe that interpersonal
relations are altered, and act to potentiate social interaction. </p>

<p> At moderate doses intensifications of changes experienced are
reported. Users' reports include disturbed associations, dulling
of attention, vivid visual imagery, fixed ideas, rapidly changing
positive and negative emotions, fragmentation of thought, flight
of ideas, impaired immediate memory, altered sense of identity,
increased suggestibility and a feeling of enhanced insight. At
higher doses, interpersonal relations are dulled and the user
feels less social and more withdrawn. </p>

<p> At larger doses psychotomimetic (hallucinogenic-like)
phenomena are experienced in a wavelike fashion. These include
distortion of body image, depersonalization, visual illusions and
distortions, synesthesia, dream-like fantasies and vivid
hallucinations.<br>
</p>

<p> Data from Isbell et a]. (1967) and Perez-Reyes et al. (1971)
have indicated that the hallucinogenic oral dose is in the range
of 0.4 to 0.5 mg./kg Delta 9 THC. Thus, the hallucinogenic dose
is 80 times larger than the delivered dose of smoked marihuana
producing minimal subjective effects (five micrograms/kg.) or
about 11 to 14 times larger than the usual smoked dose.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>LETHALITY</b> </p>

<p> There is no conclusive evidence that short-term marihuana use
alone directly results in any physical damage to man. A few
scattered fatalities associated with marihuana use are
occasionally reported. Most are from 19th century Indian
experiences with large oral doses of charas (Deakin, 1880;
Bouquet, 1951; Ewens, 1904, Walton, 1938; Indian Hemp Drugs,
1893). Brill et al. (1970) and Smith (1968) have noted that there
have not been any reliable reports of human fatalities
attributable purely to marihuana, although very high doses have
been administered by users. </p>

<p> A frequently cited recent report from Belgium by Heyndrickx
et al. (1970) describes an essentially negative pathological and
toxicological study of a 23-year-old man found dead in the
presence of marihuana, and hashish. A cannabinoid was detected in
his urine. However, this finding in no way inculpates marihuana
as the responsible agent. There are many possible causes of
sudden death which are not toxins and do not produce observable
pathology; e.g. anaphylactic reactions, insulin shock, cardiac
arhythmias, etc. </p>

<p> A case report (Nahas, 1971) of an attempted suicide by
smoking hashish, recently in France is even more anecdotal. An
individual was reported to have smoked consecutively ten pipes of
hashish containing approximately 200 mg of Delta 9 THC each
before losing consciousness. But recovery occurred after
supportive treatment. </p>

<p> Another case report (Hughes et al., 1970) relates severe
diabetic coma with ketoacidosis after the ingestion of huge
amounts of marihuana by a mental patient. However, it appears
that the pronounced vomiting secondary to the marihuana ingestion
caused a severe electrolyte imbalance and alkalosis. Possibly a
vulnerable glucose-regulating system responded to the severe
stress inappropriately. Retrospectively, there was no history of
diabetes noted previously but this was not confirmed or ruled out
by lab tests prior to the episode. </p>

<p> Several case reports (Henderson and Pugsley, 1968 King and
Cowen, 1970; King et al., 1970; Lundberg et al., 1971; Gary and
Keylon, 1970) noted acute severe, physiological disturbances and
acute collapse (shock, chills and fever) subsequent to
intravenous injection of suspensions of marihuana. These symptoms
may have been due to an allergic reaction to injected foreign
plant material, to a bacteremia and/or to the injection of
insoluble particles which are filtered by the organs. The
symptoms may be considered a complication of the mode of use,
rather than results of the drug. </p>

<p> Although a median lethal dose has not been established in man
(Brill et al., 1970), one has been found in laboratory animals.
Earlier reports (Lowe, 1946; Joachimoglu, 1965) used materials of
uncertain potency and composition. Recent studies utilized
carefully quantified materials. One group, Phillips et al.
(1971), utilizing THC extracted from marihuana, demonstrated the
following LD50 (the dose that causes death in 50% of the animals)
in units of mg/kg of Delta 9 THC from mice,/rats: oral 481.9/666,
intraperitoneal 454-9/ 372.9, intravenous 28.6/42.47. </p>

<p> Thompson et al. (1971) under contract to the National
Institute of Mental Health have recently carried out extensive
studies in rats, dogs and monkeys in order to define the range of
toxicity of the drug. The group used synthetic Delta 9 and A' THC
and a crude marihuana extract (CME) of carefully define
composition. Delta 9 THC was more potent than Al THC. CME was
less potent than a similar quantity of A' THC. </p>

<p> Acute toxicity was studied using intravenous, intraperitoneal
and oral routes of administration in rats. An LD50 similar to
that reported by Phillips et al. (1971) was found by the
intravenous route (20 mg/kg of THC) and intraperitoneal route
(400 mg/kg) but higher values were noted with oral administration
(1140 mg/kg). Interestingly, the LD50 for males was 1400 mg/kg
while for females it was 700 mg/kg by the oral route. The minimal
lethal dose orally was between 225 and 450 mg/kg. </p>

<p> An LD50 was not attainable in monkeys and dogs by the oral
route. Enormous dose levels (over 3000 mg/kg of Delta 9 THC) were
administered without lethality to most animals. A dose of about
1000 mg/kg THC was the lowest dose which caused death in any
animals The completeness of intestinal absorption of THC at these
high doses is unknown. Behavioral changes in the survivors
included sedation, huddled posture, muscle tremors,
hypersensitivity to sound and hypermobility. </p>

<p> The cause of death in the rats and mice subsequent to oral
THC was profound central nervous system depression leading to
dyspnea, prostration, weight loss, loss of Fighting reflex,
ataxia, and severe fall in body temperature which led to
cessation of respiration from 10 to 46 hours after single dose
oral administration. No consistent pathological changes were
observed in any organs. The cause of death when it rarely
occurred in the higher species did not appear to be related to
the same mechanism as in the rats. </p>

<p> Using intravenous administration, the acute one dose LD50 for
Delta 9 THC was 100 mg/kg in dogs and 15.6 to 62.5 mg/kg in
monkeys depending on concentration of the solution. The minimal
lethal intravenous dose for dogs, also depending upon
concentration, was 25 to 99 mg/kg and for monkeys 3.9 to 15.5
mg/kg. </p>

<p> In contrast to the delayed death observed in rats after oral
administration, lethality in rats, dogs and monkeys after
intravenous injection occurred within minutes after injection.
When sublethal amounts were injected, central nervous system
depression with concomitant behavioral changes similar to those
observed after oral doses were observed. However, their onset was
more rapid and the intensity of effect more severe with
anaesthesia, and convulsions noted after injection. The monkeys
and dogs that survived the intravenous injection of THC recovered
completely within five to nine days. </p>

<p> The only consistent pathological changes were noted in the
animals which succumbed. Pulmonary changes including hemorrhage,
edema, emphysema and generalized congestion were found and death
resulted from respiratory arrest and subsequent cardiac failure.
The investigators presumed one mechanism possibly accounting for
these findings was due to the concentration of the THC solution
and its insolubility in water. Presumably, when these highly
concentrated solutions mixed with the blood, the THC precipitated
out of solution. The precipitated foreign material then formed
aggregates (or emboli) that were filtered out in the lung
capillaries causing a physical blockage of pulmonary blood flow. </p>

<p> Subsequently, intravenous studies were repeated using Delta 9
THC emulsified in a sesame oil-Tween 80-saline vehicle at 15
mg/ml or 40 mg/ml. The emulsions were administered at a uniform
rate of 2 ml/15 sec. Doses administered were 1, 4, 16, 64,
92,128, 192 and 256 mg/kg. All monkeys injected with 92 mg/kg or
less survived and completely recovered from all effects with two
to four days. All monkeys injected with 128 mg/kg or more
succumbed within 30 minutes for all but one (180 minutes). </p>

<p> Histopathological changes found in the lungs of the deceased
monkeys were like those described after the, previous intravenous
experiment. All the monkeys that died exhibited severe
respiratory depression and bradycardia within five minutes after
the injection. Respiratory arrest and subsequent cardiac failure
occurred within minutes. Behavioral changes preceding death were
salivation, prostration, coma and tremors. </p>

<p> Behavioral and physiological changes described clinically in
the surviving monkeys followed a consistent developmental
sequence and were roughly dose related in severity and duration.
Onset was 15 minutes following injection and duration was up to
48 hours. Huddled posture and lethargy were the most persistent
changes. Constipation, anorexia and weight loss were noted.
Hypothermia, bradycardia and decreased respiratory rate generally
were maximal two to six hours post injection. Tremors with motion
but not at rest were believed to be caused by peripheral muscle
inadequacy. </p>

<p> In summary, enormous doses of Delta 9 THC, All THC and
concentrated marihuana extract ingested by mouth were unable to
produce death or organ pathology in large mammals but did produce
fatalities in smaller rodents due to profound central nervous
system depression. </p>

<p> The non-fatal consumption of 3000 mg/kg A THC by the dog and
monkey would be comparable to a 154-pound human eating
approximately 46 pounds (21 kilograms) of 1%-marihuana or 10
pounds of 5% hashish at one time. In addition, 92 mg/kg THC
intravenously produced no fatalities in monkeys. These doses
would be comparable to a 154-pound human smoking at one time
almost three pounds (1.28 kg) of 1%-marihuana or 250,000 times
the usual smoked dose and over a million times the minimal
effective dose assuming 50% destruction of the THC by smoking. </p>

<p> Thus, evidence from animal studies and human case reports
appears to indicate that the ratio of lethal dose to effective
dose is quite large. This ratio is much more favorable than that
of many other common psychoactive agents including alcohol and
barbiturates (Phillips et al. 1971, Brill et al. 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS</b> </p>

<p> Much research has been reported on the effect of single doses
of marihuana or THC on a wide variety of indices of physiologic
function in animals. Most animalt studies involved large doses
a-rid produced profound changes similar in nature but less in
magnitude than those described in the previous paragraphs. These
have been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere (Secretary HEW 1972,
Forney, 1971; Secretary HEW, 1971) and should be consulted if
more detailed information is required. </p>

<p> Similarly, much research has been done in man. As discussed
in the previous section on factors influencing the
psychopharmacological effect in man, an acute dose-response
relationship has been clearly defined over a dose range relevant
to human usage patterns for these effects. Thus, with increasing
dose, the larger the effect on the index being observed and the
longer the effect persists. However, there is a wide variation
between individuals' responses but each individual is quite
consistent. </p>

<p> The most consistent physiological sign is an increased pulse
rate (Mendelson et al., 1972; Johnson and Domino, 1971; Renault
et al., 1971; Galanter et al., 1972; Domino, 1970; Hollister et
al., 1968 Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's Committee 1944; Waskow et
al., 1970; Isbell and Jasinski, 1969; Meyer et al., 1971; Weil et
al., 1968; Jones and Stone, 1970; Clark and Nakashima, 1968).
This does not appear to be a direct drug effect on the heart
(Manno et al., 1970). Instead, the drug appears to cause complex
changes in the autonomic nerves regulating heart rate. Thus,
Kiplinger et al. (1971) demonstrated that the increase produced
by marihuana in heart rate is prevented by pretreatment with a
Beta-sympathetic nervous system blocking agent, propranolol. A
comparable increase rate was produced by treatment with
isoprotemol, a Beta-sympathetic like drug. One subject developed
an abnormal bigeminal rhythm after both marihuana and
isoproternol. </p>

<p> Renault et al. (1971) noted a consistent effect of marihuana
on the cardiac rhythm which also produced an increased heart
rate. The effect was the suppression of the normal sinus
arrhythmia usually produced by respiration. Respiration usually
produces a slowing of heart rate mediated by the vagal
parasympathetic nerve supply. This depression of normal vagal
tone was further evidenced by the absence of heart rate slowing
during forced expiration against a closed glotis (valsalva
maneuver). This effect seemed to wax and wane over several
minutes producing alternate periods of rapid and slowed heart
rate. </p>

<p> Both autonomic nervous systems seem to be affected by
marihuana; the sympathetic is stimulated while the
parasympathetic is inhibited. </p>

<p> Kiplinger et al. (1971) clearly demonstrated that the amount
of increase in _pulse rate was directly related to the dose of
THC administered as did Renault et al. (1971) and Johnson and
Domino (1971) over a wide range of doses. Both experienced and
inexperienced marihuana smokers demonstrated increases regardless
of the subjective state described. Tachycardia is noted rapidly
and reaches a peak about 15 to 20 minutes after finishing
smoking. The pulse rate returns to normal within one to
one-and-a-half hours. </p>

<p> Other than the one report of bigeminy (Kiplinger et al.,
1971), little or no alteration of normal heart rhythm were noted
by electrocardiogram (Isbell et al., 1967; Mayor's Committee,
1944) other than sinus tachycardia (Mendelson et al., 1972).
Johnson and Domino (1971) noted premature ventricular
contractions in a few of their subjects, but they felt this
effect was more likely produced by the smoking itself rather than
by the drug. </p>

<p> Conjunctival injection, reddening of the eyes due to
increased prominence of the conjunctival blood vessel and
dilation of the scleral vessels, (Hepler et al., 1971; Kiplinger,
et al., 1971) is another highly consistent occurrence (Mendelson
et al., 1972, Allentuck and Bowman, 1942; Ames, 1958; Hollister,
et al., 1968; Isbell et al., 1967; Manno et al., 1970; Waskow et
al., 1979; Weil et al., 1968) produced by orally ingested and
smoked al., 1968). This finding is produced by orally ingested
and smoked marihuana (or THC). And thus the effect must be a
direct drug effect and not caused by irritation from smoke
(Perez-Reyes and Lipton, 1971). Kiplinger et al. (1971) noted
that this finding was dose-related although it develops slowly
reaching a maximum about one hour after smoking. </p>

<p> Reported effects on blood pressure are inconsistent. Some
investigators find lowered pressure (Hollister et al., 1968;
Isbell et al., 1967; Waskow, et al., 1970) while others report a
slight increase (Johnson and Domino, 1971; Domino, 1970; Mayor's
Committee, 1944) and still others report increases and decreases
(Mendelson et al., 1972; Perez-Reyes et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Preliminary results of a carefully performed study of the
cardiovascular effects (Weiss, 1971) demonstrated orthostatic,
hypotension in the erect position and hypertension when supine. </p>

<p> Little or no effect has been demonstrated in humans on a wide
variety of parameters investigated. Body temperature is unchanged
(Mendelson et al., 1971; Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell et al.,
1967; Brooks, 1896) as is respiratory rate (Domino, 1970; Isbell
et al., 1967; Weil et al., 1968), lung vital capacity and acute
bronchospasni (Mendelson et O., 1972) and basal metabolism
(Mayor's Committee, 1944). </p>

<p> Several studies (Mendelson et al., 1972; Mayor's Committee,
1944; Personal Communication, 1970) have examined changes in
blood cells and blood chemistry. No acute effects were
demonstrated on red blood cell number, or structure; differential
and total white blood cell count; platelet count; reticulocyte,
count; serum electrolyte concentrations; calcium and phosphorous
serum levels; liver function tests; uric acid concentration; type
or quantity of serum proteins. Although increased frequency of
urination is often reported, increased urine volume has not been
demonstrated (Ames, 1958; Mayor's Committee, 1944) and no
alteration of kidney function identified (Personal Communication,
1970; Hollister et al., 1968; Mayor's Committee, 194-4; Mendelson
et al. 1972). </p>

<p> Reports of increased hunger, especially for sweets (Allentuck
and Bowman, 1942; Ames, 1958; Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's
Committee, 1944), have focused attention on blood sugar and food
intake. No consistent significant change in blood sugar has been
demonstrated (Dornbush and Freedman, 1971; Hollister, 1971;
Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell et al., 1967; Manno et -al., 1970;
Personal Communication, 1970; Weil et al., 1968) with some
investigators finding decreases (Beringer et al., 1932;
Lindemann, 1933-1934), others finding increases (Manno, 1970;
Mayor&quot;s Committee, 1944), still others finding both
increases and decreases (Miras, 1965). </p>

<p> Podolsky (1971) found that although fasting blood glucose was
unchanged by smoking marihuana, higher 30 and 60 minute glucose
levels were noted after a standard dose of glucose. No
corresponding alteration in insulin or growth hormone levels was
demonstrated. </p>

<p> Hollister and Gillespie (1970) found an increased total food
intake when the drug was administered after breakfast but not
after an overnight fast. Half the subjects reported subjective
increased hunger. Subjects' free fatty acid levels and blood
glucose remained unchanged while the placebo controls' free fatty
acid values decreased. Another study suggested increased appetite
and food intake but was without adequate controls (Personal
Communication, 1970). </p>

<p> An investigation of physiological parameters of stress after
marihuana (Hollister, 1969; Hollister et al., 1970) revealed only
a minimal increase in white blood cells and a minimal decrease in
cosinophils but no changes in serotonin, cortisol level and
urinary catecholamines. However, another investigator (Chopra,
1969) demonstrated increased catecholamine excretion especially
those from the adrenal medulla. <br>
</p>

<p> Hepler and Frank (1971) and Frank et, al(1971) have carefully
studied ophthalmological changes produced by marihuana. Swelling
of the eyelids (Ames, 1958), ptosis (Isbell et al., 1967),
photophobia and nystagmus (Allentuck and Bowman, 1942) and
dilated, sluggish reacting pupils (Mayer-Gross et al., 1960;
Mayor's Committee, 1944) were all mentioned in earlier
discussions but were not demonstrated (Hepler et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Findings which were quantifiable (Hepler et al., 1971) were a
slight pupillary constriction with normal responsiveness to light
and accommodation and an increase in glare recovery time. No
change was evident on near and far visual acuity, fundiscopic
exam, visual field acuity and depth and color perception.
However, a decrease in tear secretion and an increase in
conjunctival injection was demonstrated.<br>
</p>

<p> Hepler and Frank (1971) reported an average of about 25%
decrease in the intraocular pressure of most normal subjects
after smoking marihuana. A preliminary trial in one patient with
glaucoma demonstrated similar findings (Frank, 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> No objective impairment of improvement invisual acuity or
brightness perception (Caldwell et al., 1970; Caldwell et al.,
1969) nor effect on depth perception and duration of after image
(Clark and Nakashima, 1968) was noted in other studies.<br>
</p>

<p> Neurological examinations have consistently revealed no major
abnormalities during marihuana intoxication. (Mayor's Committee,
1944; Rodin and Domino, 1970; Rodin et al., 1970; Personal
Communication, 1970). Subjects often report muscle weakness.
Minimal decreased leg, hand and finger maximum muscle strength
have been demonstrated objectively (Fere, 1901; Hollister et al.,
1968; Mayor's Committee, 1944). However, electromyography was
reported to be normal (Personal Communication, 1970<br>
</p>

<p> A slightly increased briskness in the knee jerk has been
detected (Domino, 1971 - Rodin and Domino, 1970) while no change
in threshold or elicitation of deep tendon reflexes is usually,
reported (Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell et al., 1967). </p>

<p> Incoordination, fine tremor and ataxia are often experienced
by the user (Ames, 1958; Beringer et al., 1932; Clark et al.,
1970; Mayor's Committee, 1944). The presence of a fine tremor and
decrements in hand steadiness and static body equilibrium leave
been demonstrated with refined measuring devices when they are
not grossly observable (Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's Committee,
1944; Mendelson et al., 1972). Kiplinger et al. (1971) using
sensitive apparatus demonstrated these fine hand tremors and
changes in body equilibrium are also dose related.<br>
</p>

<p> Cranial nerve function and somatic sensation have not been
significantly impaired or improved. Subjective reports of
increased auditory sensitivity contributing to greater esthetic
appreciation of music (Winick, 1960) have been generally
unconfirmed in objective tests of auditory acuity and pitch,
frequency or intensity or threshold discrimination (Aldrich,
1944; Caldwell et al., 1970; Caldwell et al., 1969; Clark and
Nakashima 1968; Mayor's Committee, 1944; Meyers and Caldwell,
1969). Objective improvement in auditory acuity in several
subjects was noted (Walton, 1938; Williams et al., 1946).<br>
</p>

<p> Similarly, improvement in visual acuity and discrimination
and altered depth perception reported by users has been
unconfirmed objectively (Caldwell et al., 1970; Caldwell et al.,
1969; Clark and Nakashima, 1968; Mayor's Committee, 1944;
Hollister and Gillespie, 1970; Jones and Stone, 1970; Frank et
al., 1971). </p>

<p> A slight improvement in vibratory sensation (Rodin and
Domino, 1970), no change in touch or two-point discrimination
(Rodin and Domino, 1970; Williams et al., 1946) nor olfactory and
gustatory senses (Williams et al., 1946) have been demonstrated.
Decreased sensitivity to pain has been objectively demonstrated
(Personal Communication, 1970) which corroborates its past
therapeutic use as an analgesic. </p>

<p> One of the most frequently reported subjective effects of
marihuana intoxication is a distortion of time sense (Tart,
1971). Actual elapsed time is overestimated or perceived as being
longer than actual clock time. Thus, present events are perceived
as prolonged when intoxicated and isolated from the past and
future. They are in the &quot;hereand-now&quot; (Melges et al.,
1971). Many have confirmed this experimentally (Ames, 19,58;
Clark et al., 1970; Mendelson et al., 1972; Dornbush and Freeman,
1971; Hollister and Gillespie, 1970; Weil et al., 1968; Williams
et al., 1946). The over-estimate is much greater during periods
lit which the subject is performing a task than for unfilled
time, and the error is (greater as the time period is longer
(Clark et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Melges et al. (1971) have demonstrated that marihuana
intoxication induces temporal distortions with a greater
concentration on the present and a shortening of span of
awareness into the past and future. They believe that under the
drug's influence, as the, subject becomes less able to integrate
past, present and future, his awareness becomes more concentrated
on present events. These present events are experienced as
prolonged or timeless because they no longer appear to the
intoxicated individual as transitions from the past to the
future.<br>
</p>

<p> Melges and Bowlby (1969) have described habitual marihuana
smokers who specifically use the drug to achieve the
&quot;here-and-now&quot; orientation. These smokers claim this
focus on the present permits them to be more open to immediate
experience while being less troubled by past and future concerns.
This focus may also explain the belief that perceptions during
intoxications are both unexpected and never experienced
previously.<br>
</p>

<p> The effect of intoxication on the resting
electroencephalogram are still unclear but generally have been
minimal, inconsistent and within normal limits. In early studies
(Wikler and Lloyd, 1945; Williams et al., 1946) a decrease in
alpha activity was noted. More recently (Ames, 1958) noted a
delayed alpha increase with concomitant increases in beta and
theta activity. Rodin and Domino (1971) reported a slight shift
toward slower alpha frequencies. </p>

<p> Three other studies (Jones and Stone, 1970; Hollister et al.,
1971; Rickles et al., 1970), failed to find consistent changes
but noted increased alpha frequency, increased synchronization
and occasional paroxysmal activity. These effects were ascribed
to relaxation and drowsiness. </p>

<p> Two investigators (Chopra, 1935; Miras, 1969) reported
decreased fast activity and other variable effects. Most
recently, Volavka et al. (1971) and Fink et al. (1971), reported
a significant rapid onset effect occurring during the five-minute
smoking period and of short duration (less than 30 minutes) in
continuously alert individuals. The principal changes detected by
computer analysis were a dose related increase in percent alpha
time and an associated reduction in theta and beta hands.<br>
</p>

<p> Roth et al. (1972), demonstrated that auditory evoked
responses were decreased in amplitude by marihuana and THC
particularly during the first few minutes of stimulation. These
results may indicate that the intoxicated individual may receive
external auditory stimuli differently during the intoxication
period.<br>
</p>

<p> The prominent and frequently reported sedative effects of
marihuana and the dreamlike states occurring during intoxication
directed several investigators to study the effects of marihuana
on sleep. Fragmentary data from one sleep laboratory (Pivik et
al., 1969) indicated decreased rapideye-movement (REM) sleep
time. Another sleep lab (Rickles et al., 1970), in preliminary
work demonstrated an increase in REM sleep time. Fink et al.
(1971) noted that EEG defined sleep (stages one and two) were
dose dependent but THC did not act like a classical sedative. The
occurrence of EEG sleep was much more frequent in the placebo and
low dose (10 mg THC) conditions than in the high dose condition
(20 mg THC). <br>
</p>

<p> Mendelson et al. (1972) noticed an increased amount of total
sleep as well as an increase in discrete episodes of sleep
related to marihuana smoking. These findings correlate well with
questionnaire data (Tart, 1970) indicating that at moderate
doses, users found it easier to induce sleep and that sleep was
considered to be more refreshing, while at higher doses both
aspects were impaired. <br>
</p>

<p> In summary, marihuana containing Delta-9-THC is a
pharmacologically active drug with minimal acute physiological
effects at the low to moderate doses used by man.<br>
</p>

<p> Based on its few consistently observed physiological effects,
marihuana is a rather unexciting compound of negligible acute
physiological toxicity at the usual doses consumed by man. The
subjective state characteristically described by the intoxicated
user is far more interesting to both the user and the scientist
than the objective one observed by the investigator.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>EFFECTS ON MENTATION AND PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Characteristically, intoxication with psychoactive materials
effect psychomotor and mental functions. It is apparent from the
subjective assertions of users and a wide range of experimental
studies that marihuana is no exception (Clark and Nakashima ,
1968; Clark et al., 1970; Dornbush and Freedman, 1971; Hollister
and Gillespie, 1970; Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's Committee, 1944;
McGlothlin et al., 1971; Melges et al., 1970; Meyer et al., 1971;
Weil and Zinberg, 1969; Weil et al., 1968; Volavka et al., 1971;
Galanter et al., 1972; Kiplinger et al., 1971; Mendelson et al.,
1972; Dornbush et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Psychomotor tasks which have been tested include tapping
speed, handwriting and free-hand writing and free handdrawing,
simple and complex reaction time, pursuit rotor and tracking
tasks and continuous performance tests. Cognitive tasks
frequently tested are simple arithmetic problems, serial addition
or subtraction, fine judgment tasks, 'digit-symbol substitution
test, digit-code memory, reading comprehension, speech or verbal
out-put, forward and backward digit spans, goal directed complex
serial subtractions and additions to reach a set end sum, and
short-term or immediate memory functions.<br>
</p>

<p> In general, Kiplinger et al. (1971) have clearly demonstrated
that the degree of impairment is dose related and varies in
degree during the period of intoxication exerting its maximal
effect at the peak intoxication. </p>

<p> Naive subjects commonly demonstrate greater decrement in
performance than experienced users but report less subjective
effect (Weil et al., 1968). Experienced users appear to better
compensate to the effect of the drug especially for ordinary
performance at lower doses (Clark and Nakashima, 1968; Clark et
al., 1970; Crancer et al., 1969; Jones and Stone, 1970; Meyer et
al., 1971; Weil and Zinberg, 1969; Jones, 1971; Mendelson et al.,
1972). Performance of simple or familiar tasks (i.e. simple
reaction time) during intoxication is minimally effected.
However, on unfamiliar or complex tasks (i.e., complex reaction
time), performance decrements occur (Weil and Zinberg, 1969;
Dornbush et al., 1971; Moskowitz et al., 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> Performance decrements are further enhanced when verbal tasks
are performed during delayed auditory feedback (Kiplinger et al.,
1971). Also marked individual differences in performance are
noted between similar subjects. (Clark and Nakashima, 1968; Clark
et al., 1970; Manno et al., 1970; Kiplinger et al., 1971). A
cyclical waxing and waning of the intensity of the intoxication
and concomitant performance occurs periodically (Clark et al.,
1970; Melges et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Finally, when subjects concentrate on the task being
performed at &quot;normal social high,&quot; objective evidence
of intoxication is not apparent and the individual may perform
better than when drug free (Rodin and Domino, 1970; Mendelson et
al., 1972).<br>
</p>

<p> Obviously, these observations raise practical doubts
regarding the intoxicated individuals' ability to function at
jobs requiring memory, concentration, and organization of
thinking.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>THE INTOXICATED MENTAL STATE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Several investigators have suggested that shortterm memory is
the mental function most significantly affected by marihuana and
contributes to the subtle alterations of mental functioning
noted. Generally an impairment of recent or short term memory is
demonstrated (Abel, 1970,1971; Dornbush et al., 1971; Menges,
1970-71; Tinklenberg, 1970; Clark et al., 1970; Weil et al.,
1968). Thus, mental tasks requiring immediate information
acquisition (Abel, 1971) and/or retrieval (Weil et al., 1968) are
effected. </p>

<p> Abel (1971) recently showed that marihuana blocks the
acquisition process involved in the storage of new interferes
with the retrieval of already stored information. Decrements are
produced in decisions requiring recent memory or sustained
alertness (Clark et al., 1970) ; conversation (Well et al., 1968)
; calculations, or reading which requires retention, coordinating
and indexing sequential information termed temporal
disintegration (Melges et al., 1970, 1971). </p>

<p> Melges eta]. (1970, 1971) theorizes that episodic impairment
of immediate memory produces voids which are filled with
perceptions and thoughts extraneous to the organized mental
processes. He suggests that this leads to temporal disintegration
producing a fragmented and disorganized temporal experience in
which past and future time frames are blurred and the present is
experienced as prolonged or boundless. Thus, depersonalization
occurs as the individual experiences himself temporally in a
strange and unreal manner during marihuana intoxication. </p>

<p> <b>UNPLEASANT REACTIONS: &quot;TOO STONED&quot; AND
&quot;NOVICE-ANXIETY&quot; <br>
</b> </p>

<p> These substantial cognitive and psychomotor effects are
probably responsible for many of the acute adverse reactions to
marihuana. One, of the most common is the heavy, drugged feeling
where the individual feels mentally and physically sluggish so
that every motion and thought seems to require extreme effort
(Smith and Mehl, 1970). This probably reflects impaired cognitive
function and psychomotor retardation from getting &quot;too
stoned.&quot; This most frequently occurs after oral ingestion of
a large dose of drugs or in inexperienced smokers who have, not
learned to selftitrate their dose to achieve the desired high. </p>

<p> In these instances, depression, anxiety, fatigue, short-term
memory loss, dizziness, nausea, incoordination, palpitations are
experienced as generalized discomfort, and ill-being. </p>

<p> &quot;Novice anxiety reactions&quot; or panic reactions
account for a majority of acute toxic reactions to marihuana
(Baker and Lucas, 1969; Baker-Bates, 1935; Gaskill, 1945;
Grossman, 1969; Persyko, 1970; Bialos, 1970; Sonnenreich and
Goes, 1962; Sigg, 1963; Dally, 1967; Hamaker, 1891; Marten, 1969;
Smith and Mehl, 1970; Walton, 1938). </p>

<p> When dosage, set and setting are optimal the distortion of
self (depersonalization) and temporal disintegration
(timelessness of the present moment) common to marihuana
intoxication is recognized by the individual as time-limited and
drug-induced. It is usually experienced as pleasurable. But, if
dose, set and setting are not optimal the experience may cause
the intoxicated individual to fear that loss of his identify and
self control may not end or that he is dying or losing, his mind.
Acute, anxiety or panic results (Mel et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Non-drug factors of set and setting play a most important
role in these, reactions. Of course, the great variability of
individuals makes the effect of marihuana on any specific
individual rather unpredictable. </p>

<p> The large majority of these anxiety reactions occur in
novices who have intense underlying anxiety surrounding marihuana
use such as fears of arrest, of disruption of family and
occupational relations and of possible physical and mental
dangers. Also, individuals with relatively rigid personality
structures, whose values are more in line with those of the
&quot;straight&quot;society and have little desire for new and
different experiences, appear to experience these, anxiety
reactions much more frequently than those, individuals who are
members of the &quot;counterculture&quot; (Smith and Mehl, 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> In addition, simple episodes of neurotic depression may be
observed in these, same types of individuals during periods of
unusual psychological stress (Well, 1970). Both of these types of
reactions are transient and abate as the drug effects wear off
over a few hours. Treatment should consist of gentle but
authoritative. reassurance that nothing is seriously wrong and
that the drug effects will wear off and the individual will feel
normal&quot; again (Smith and Mehl, 1970; Well, 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>ACUTE PSYCHOSES<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Rare cases of full-blown acute psychotic episodes
precipitated by marihuana use are reported in individuals with
histories of mental disorder, with marginal psychological
adjustments or with poorly developed personality structures and
ego defenses (Talbott, 1968; Heiman, 1968; Kaplan, 1971; Pernot,
1969; Keeler, 1968; Defer and Diehl, 1968; Wurniser et al., 1969;
Allentuck and Bowman, 1942; Bromberg, 1939; Bromberg, 1934;
Curtis and Wolfe, 1939; Hughes et al., 1970; Isbell et al., 1967;
Keup , 1970; Keeler, 1967; Talbott and Teague, 1969 Mayor's
Committee, 1944). </p>

<p> Marihuana intoxication may hinder the ability of these,
individuals to maintain structural defenses to existing stresses,
or, alternatively produce a keener awareness of personality
problems or existing stresses (Smith, 1968). Psychotherapy and
antipsychotic medications are useful in controlling and
preventing this reaction (Weil, 1970). </p>

<p> Exceptionally rare reports from North America of nonspecific
toxic psychosis or actite brain syndrome have occurred after
extremely high drug dose consumption, although such reports are,
more common in the eastern countries. These conditions are
self-limited and clear spontaneously as the drug effect abates
(Weil et al., 1968; Bartolucei et al. 1969 Ames, 1958; Isbell et
al., 1967; Mayor's Committee, 1944; Williams et al., 1946). </p>

<p> Finally, marihuana intoxication may trigger delayed anxiety
reactions or psychotic episodes in a small percentage of persons
who have prior experience with hallucinogenic drugs (Ungerleider
et al., 1968; Ungerleider, 1969; Weil et al., 1968; Favazza and
Domino, 1969). </p>

<p> In summary, the acute psychomotor-cognitive effects of
marihuana intoxication are, interesting academically to gain
understanding of normal and abnormal mental function. Also, for
practically determining the danger-risk factor for the individual
including determination of his functional level personally,
vocationally and socially in this society. The effect on
personal-social-vocational function is highly individualized and
difficult to predict at present. </p>

<p> Although reports of anxiety attacks and psychotic episodes
are more frequent as marihuana use spreads, they are still
exceedingly rare and their incidence appears to be decreasing as
use becomes more acceptable to more diverse populations. For
example, during the nine-year period of 1961 to 1969, out of
701,057 admissions to Los Angeles County Hospital, located in a,
city with very high marihuana use, only three patients required
hospitalization for psychic sequelae of marihuana smoking
(Lundberg, et al., 1971). <br>
</p>

<p> In contrast, many cases are being seen in Vietnam soldiers
where a extremely potent material is available and daily stresses
are high, but, these probably represent only a small fraction of
marihuana, users (Talbott and Teague, 1969; Talbott, 1968;
Heiman, 1968). </p>

<p> During the, academic year 1968 and 1969, eight students were
seen in the mental hygiene division of a private Eastern
University student population (8,500) with acute anxiety
reactions (Bialos, 1970). The frequency of marihuana-associated
acute adverse, anxiety reactions requiring attention at Boston
University Student Health Service (student population 20,000) is
between five and seven yearly (Pillard, 1970). </p>

<p> In a recent survey of newly admitted patients to a large
mental hospital, marihuana was the direct cause of the
hospitalization in only 0.9 per thousand admissions (Keup, 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>PERSISTENT EFFECTS AFTER ACUTE DOSE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Investigators have not noted persistent effects after smoking
marihuana for periods of more than three to five hours (Fink et
al., 1971; Weil et al., 1968; Pillard, 1970). </p>

<p> Users report only minimal hangover effects (Mayor's
Committee, 1944; Haines and Green, 1970; McGlothlin et al., 1971)
after very heavy use. Feelings of lassitude and heaviness of the
head, lethargy, irritability, headaches and loss of concentration
are reported especially when associated with lack of sleep
(Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Indian Hemp, 1893). This may be related
to preliminary data (Rickles et al., 1970) suggesting a subtle
increase in REM sleep time primarily seen in the last one-third
of the night in individuals who smoked one to two cigarettes per
day usually at night for at least a year.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA USE ON CONCOMITANT BEHAVIOR<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Mendelson et al. (1972), under contract to the Commission,
analyzed the effects on behavior of acute marihuana intoxication
on an extensive variety of assessine nts including a simple
operant task, mood states, individual and group observations
before, during and after smoking and clinical psychological
evaluations. </p>

<p> Sleep-inducing properties were confirmed. Increased amounts
of total sleep were observed in both number and length of shorter
and longer blocks of consecutive hours of sleep related to
marihuana smoking.<br>
</p>

<p> Examination of mood assessments prior, during and after
marihuana smoking indicates that the acute effects were a
reduction of negative moods (anxiety, hostility, and guilt-shame)
and an increase in the positive moods (carefreeness and
friendliness). Examinations of the mood prior to smoking revealed
that the subjects tended to smoke marihuana when they reported
generally positive moods. The effect of the drug was to increase
this positive mood. One paradoxical finding was that the subjects
also reported feeling more depressed after smoking.<br>
</p>

<p> Acute effects of marihuana on cognitive and motor functions
were studied with a battery of tests sensitive to brain function
(Halstead Category Test, Tactile Performance Test, Seashore
Rhythm Test, Finger Tapping Test, Trail Making Test and the
Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale). No alterations in performance
as a result of acute intake of marihuana were noted in any of
these. </p>

<p> The acute effect of marihuana smoking on social behavior was
investigated, by observing the individual and his interaction in
small groups. The data indicated very strongly that marihuana
smoking, in addition to being a subjective drug experience, is
also a social activity around which verbal interaction and other
types of social behavior are centered. </p>

<p> Although marihuana smoking tended to be, a group activity,
subjects did not always engage in verbal communication while
smoking. Subjects often were observed withdrawing from the social
interaction and then participating in some type of
noncommunicative passive activity, such as watching television,
listening to music, reading or staring at objects or people. This
decrement in total interaction appeared to be a drug effect. </p>

<p> Heavy marihuana users tended to be more withdrawn than the
intermittent users, often listening to the stereo and focusing on
the personal effects of the drug. The intermittent users tended
to watch television which provided group entertainment, thus
enhancing the social effects of the drug. </p>

<p> Verbal interaction in formal task-oriented discussion groups
diminished when several group members were simultaneously
intoxicated. How-ever, groups engaged in problem-solving tasks
performed more efficiently because less suggestions and
discussion ensued before proposing a workable solution. The
groups tended to become more convivial and less task-oriented
although none failed to arrive, at the goal. Marihuana did not
appear to increase hostility during these sessions and
furthermore tended to change the nature of hostile communication
from direct criticism to indirect sarcasm. </p>

<p> Assessment of risk-taking behavior revealed that under the
influence of marihuana, users tend to become more conservative in
the decision making. </p>

<p> In summary, it appears that marihuana does exert subtle
effects on measurable components of social behavior and
interaction.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Effects of Short-Term or Subacute Use</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>ANIMAL STUDIES (PRECLINICAL)</b> </p>

<p>Studies have only begun in this area in the last 10 years.
Subacute toxicity studies in rats involving 30 daily
intraperitoneal injections of up to 30 mg/kg THC were recently
reported by Phillips et al. (1971). No fatalities were observed.
Total body and organ weight (rains were significantly retarded
over the period. However, no significant differences in organ
histology were detected although in a few animals there were
suggestions of change in liver and testicular cells. An
interesting phenomena also observed was a suggestion of increased
sensitivity to effects of Delta 9 THC occurring after two weeks
of daily treatment. </p>

<p>Thompson et al. (1971) under contract to NIMH studied the
toxicity in rats treated daily for seven, 28, 91 and then 119
days with oral Delta 9 THC, A&quot; THC and crude marihuana
extract at doses from 50 to 500 mg/kg. The findings were
generally similar for all three preparations although A&quot;
effect was greater than All THC which in turn was greater than
CME. </p>

<p>A bimodal pattern of behavorial toxicity was exhibited by the
cannabinoids for all time periods of dosing ranging from five to
119 days. Initially, a dose-related generalized central nervous
system depression was noted. This was characterized by huddled
posture, inactivity, drowsiness, slow movements, unkempt
appearance, loss of appetite, wide stance, constipation, weight
loss, depressed respiration and heart rate and fall in body
temperature. Tolerance gradually developed to the initial
depressant effects starting after two to five doses and continued
at different rates for different parameters. </p>

<p>Concomitant to the development of tolerance, rats exhibited
progressively more hyperactivity, manifesting increased
exploratory behavior, grooming and motor activity. The daily
duration of the altered behavior progressively shortened.
Tolerance to the hyperactivity was not seen in the rats. Later,
in the experimental period, the rats became hyper-irritable and
exhibited fighting behavior, especially at lower doses.
Additionally, tremors and later chronic convulsions occurred in
significant numbers of rats. </p>

<p>The onset and frequency of chronic convulsions were
dose-related and the severity increased as the duration of dosage
was extended. Cumulative toxicity, as evidenced by increased
mortality, was observed in the rats but most deaths and maximal
toxicity (central depression) occurred 36 to 72 hours following
first treatment. Drug dose-related histopathological changes in
all treated rats (in addition to decreased body and organ weight
gains) were hypocellularity of the spleen and bone marrow,
vacuolization of the adrenal gland and degeneration of the testes
(seminiferous tubules) or ovarian stronia. Extended doses from
five to119 days were not significantly more toxic except to the
adrenals. No evidence of abstinence syndromes were noted upon
abrupt cessation of these doses. </p>

<p>Similar behavorial and clinical findings were observed in
monkeys given 50-500 mg oral Delta 9 THC, All THC and equivalent
CME for up to 91 days. Cumulative toxicity was less severe and
all monkeys survived the initial moderately severe central
nervous system depression. Tolerance to the depression occurred
and the monkeys returned to their undrugged behavior. Mild
hyperactivity was noted only in several of the median dosed
animals. </p>

<p>Three of 28 monkeys studied became moribund on days 10, 14 and
16 respectively. These were sacrificed and the only
histopathology seen was severe hemorrhagic and probably
drug-related enterocolitis. The bone marrow and kidney changes
seen probably were due to severe electrolyte imbalance resulting
from the intestinal lesion. The thymus lesion is consistent with
stress due to this electrolyte imbalance. Pancreatic atrophy was
due to weight changes. Eight additional monkeys were sacrificed
at 28 days in fair-to-good condition and no histopathology was
demonstrable. Several other monkeys had bloody diarrhea, but
recovered spontaneously without demonstrable histopathology. </p>

<p>The remaining 17 monkeys were all in fair-to good condition at
28 days and hyperactivity was no longer observed. They were
treated at the same dose for an additional 63 days. Tolerance to
the central depression continued to develop so that the effects
lasted only one to two hours at 91 days. No additional monkey
fatalities were recorded -and the remaining 17 monkeys were
normal histopathological at autopsy. Urine and ophthalmological
examinations were all within normal limits. Hematological and
blood chemical changes after 28 and 91 days were minor and little
affected in the surviving monkeys. </p>

<p>Thus, a. minimal toxicity in monkeys, either physical or
behavorial, is evident after 91 daily doses orally of enormous
amounts of Delta 9 THC. However, significant cumulative toxicity,
primarily a generalized central nervous system depression, is
evident in the first few days but tolerance rapidly develops to
these effects. A dose-related hemorrhagic enterocolitis occurred
which may lead to electrolyte imbalance and death in a few
monkeys. This probably is a direct irritative phenomena. </p>

<p>Again, the enormous daily doses of THC that were administered
to these animals cannot, be compared to the daily doses used in
man even by the heaviest users. </p>

<p>The effects were observed of 28 daily administrations to
monkeys of intravenous Delta 9 THC in sesame oil-Tween 80-saline
vehicle at doses of 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg. Behavioral, clinical,
hematological and hemochemical changes were similar for monkeys
given single or repeated injections. However, the duration was
extended in the 28-day groups and tolerance gradually developed.
Delayed death indicative of cumulative toxicity occured on days
eight and 19 in two of four animals given the largest dose. </p>

<p>Histopathological changes, noted in the two animals which
succumbed and in one of the highdose monkeys, were acute
hemorrhagic pneumonia resembling the finding in the
single-intravenous studies at doses of 128 mg/kg or greater.
Additionally in the repeated dose study, edema, ulceration and
fibrosis at the injection sites probably contributed to minor
hematological and hemachemical alterations. </p>

<p>In summary, the 1972 Marihuana and Health Report to the
Congress from the Secretary of HEW noted that these doses were
employed in rodents and mammals to test the limits of toxicity.
The doses are much higher than those used by man and the routes
of administration substantially dif ferent. These studies have
shown that the margin of safety between the lethal dose and the
pharmacologically active doses of Delta 8 and All THC and crude
marihuana extract is large. Consequently, it has been determined
that these compounds could be safely administered to man for
Phase I and early Phase II clinical studies (Secretary of HEW,
Feb. 11, 1972, p. 158-160).<br>
</p>

<p><b>HUMAN EXPERIMENTS (CLINICAL)<br>
</b></p>

<p>Only a few investigators have studied the subacute
administration of marihuana to man. Marihuana cigarettes of
unknown potency were made available to 34 military prisoners in
Panama by Siler et al. (1933). The mean daily consumption was
five cigarettes (range one to 20). The usual behavior effects
associated with marihuana use were noted. No ill effects were
observed nor abstinence syndrome seen. </p>

<p>Williams et al. (1946) made available marihuana cigarettes of
unknown potency to six prisoner addicts who were experienced
marihuana users in the Public Health Service Lexington Hospital.
The subjects were permitted to freely consume the drug in any
quantity desired. The number of cigarettes consumed increased
only slightly over a 39-day period. The daily range was from nine
to 26 per day with a mean of 17. Only minimal evidence of
tolerance was seen. There was no evidence of physical dependence;
that is, no observable abstinence, syndrome was observed after
abrupt termination of the drug. </p>

<p>In general, the following observations were made on these
subjects: daily rectal temperature increased slightly; pulse,
rate increased for three weeks, then returned to normal; no
change was noted in respiratory rate, coordination, or rote
memory ; increase was noted in sleep and body weight while
caloric intake initially increased then progressively decreased;
mild confusion was observed; general intelligence tests were
slightly impaired while psychomotor tests were performed faster
but less accurately; EEG showed inconsistent changes but returned
to normal five days after cessation; and mood was euphoric for
several days followed by general lassisitude and indifference. </p>

<p>In a recent uncontrolled preliminary study (Personal
Communication, 1970), marihuana extract was administered daily to
eight terminal cancer patients from four to 13 days (mean 8.5
days). Daily doses were purposefully raised by the investigator
from 7.5 mg (mean daily dose 19.8 mg THC). The total dose per
individual patient averaged 168 mg with a range from 75-210 mgs. </p>

<p>Euphoria was experienced by all eight subjects and one had a
transient anxiety episode at a high dose. Three subjects
demonstrated decreased-opiate analgesic needs indicating an
analgesic-effect of the drug. Five subjects reported improved
appetite and five, of six tested, demonstrated objective
improvement in depression on Back scale. No new changes were seen
in physiological parameters, neurological status, blood cell and
chemistry values or urine examination. During the period of drug
effect, drowsiness was common but not lethargy, lassitude or
indifference. In fact, all became more active on the ward. No
evidence of abstinence symptoms were seen after abrupt
discontinuation of the drug.<br>
</p>

<p>Volavka et a]. (1971) in preliminary experiments administered
two marihuana cigarettes daily (13 mg Delta 9 THC) to four
detoxified heroin addicts. Pleasant effects peaked during the
second week and then leveled off. Prominent dysphoric effects and
depressive reactions with paranoid thoughts appeared during the
third to sixth days and persisted causing cessation of the study
by one subject after 10 days and after 17 days by another. The
other two subjects completed the entire planned 22 days. </p>

<p>Again no abstinence syndrome was seen and the dysphoric
symptoms disappeared within five days after the last dose.
Consistent electroencephalogram changes developed in three of
four subjects indicating increased synchronization. Their EEG
changes first appeared immediately after smoking.<br>
</p>

<p>In two of the f our subjects they were detectable, in the
presmoking records after days 12 and eight, and did not begin to
subside until 48 hours after the last dose in two subjects and
persisted for the entire 72 hours follow-up in a third subject. </p>

<p>Fink et al. (1971) subsequently studied five medical and
graduate students who had been almost daily marihuana smokers in
college and were currently weekend smokers. Each subject smoked
under laboratory conditions one marihuana cigarette containing 14
mg of THC each morning daily for 21 days. </p>

<p>No subject reported any adverse effects from smoking. The
subjects were generally able to conduct their usual daily
activities including jobs. However, they reported they did not
function completely up to par during the several hour duration of
the acute drug effect. There were no effects which persisted for
more than three to five hours and cumulative effects were not
noted day to day. No persistent decrements were seen in behavior,
mental status, EEG, heart, rate, short-term memory, or
psychomotor function tests. In sum, daily marihuana smoking for
21 days was well tolerated by well-adjusted graduate students. </p>

<p>Mendelson et al. (1972) performed a Commission-sponsored study
of the biological and behavioral concomitants of 21 days repeated
doses of marihuana. Subjects were individuals whose life style,
activities, values and attributes were more characteristic of the
unconventional youthful subculture than most of their peers in
the general population. Their mean age was 23. Based on I.Q.
testing they were superior intellectually although they had
completed, on the average, two-and-a half years of college. Their
job histories were rather erratic and characteristic of a pattern
of itinerant living. Their family background was a middle or
lower-middle socioeconomic status. In addition alcohol use was
infrequent while use of drugs, especially hallucinogens and
amphetamines, was significant. </p>

<p>Two groups of 10 subjects each were investigated over separate
31-day periods of confinement on a comfortably furnished research
ward equipped with an array of recreational materials. A large,
open yard was available for outdoor recreational activities. The
research period was divided into three periods: a pre-drug period
of five days during which the subjects were drug free; a,
subsequent 21-day period when marihuana, could be earned by
performing a, work-contingent operant task, then purchased and
smoked on a free-choice basis; and a five-day post-drug period
without access to marihuana. </p>

<p>All attempts were made to not interfere in any way with
performance of the operant task or free choice marihuana smoking
although the subjects were under constant observation. A vast
array of behavioral and biological assessments were made during
the experimental period to determine any effect of repeat doses
of marihuana over this time. </p>

<p>Two groups of subjects, studied separately, differed primarily
in the frequency of marihuana smoking over the past year. Both
groups had averaged about five years of marihuana use (range two
to 17 years). The first group studied, referred to as the
&quot;casual&quot; users by the authors, reported an average
frequency of marihuana use, of 7.7 occasions per month (range
three to 15 occasions). The second group studied, referred to as
the &quot;heavy&quot; users by the authors, reported almost daily
use of marihuana (average 33 sessions per month; range 20+ to 75,
including one substitute subject to fill the group who only
smoked about 10 times a month). <br>
</p>

<p>During the first 20 days of the smoking period, the casual
group's consumption averaged three cigarettes daily (individual
average was one-half to six) while that of the heavy users
averaged six-and-a-half cigarettes daily (individual average
three to eight-and-a-half). Both groups demonstrated a,
progressive trend toward increased daily consumption during the
experiment. Close examination of the consumption patterns for
individual subjects showed that the trend toward increased use
occurred in the subjects who were initially the heaviest users.
Several subjects who were initially the least frequent users did
not increase their use of marihuana over the course of the study.<br>
</p>

<p>Subjects in both groups tended to smoke practically all of
each cigarette including the butt. Each cigarette contained about
20 mg- Delta 9 THC. Therefore, the heavy users average daily
intake was 130 mg of THC or a total of almost, Joni- -grams of
THC over the 21-day period. The casual users average intake was
slightly less than half this amount.<br>
</p>

<p>No abstinence syndrome or physical dependence was observed
after abrupt termination of smoking. Signs of mild to moderate
psychological dependence. were possibly seen in the heavy group
but no evidence of psychological dependence was seen in the
casual users.<br>
</p>

<p>No consistent clinically significant physiological or
biochemical changes were demonstrated during or after the period
of repeated use of marihuana. </p>

<p>Urinalysis, complete blood counts, cell morphologies and
differentials, and blood chemistry determinations (calcium,
phosphorous, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid,
cholesterol, total protein, albumen, total bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and serum glutamic oxalacetic
transaminase) were unaffected. </p>

<p>Weight gain occurred in all but one subject. Maximal gain was
seen during the marihuana smoking period. The subjects were not
judged to be clinically malnourished prior to the experiment. </p>

<p>Normal body temperature was not altered. No significant
change, in pulmonary function (decreased. vital capacity or acute
broncho spasm) was observed during the marihuana smoking period.<br>
</p>

<p>Variable inconsistent changes in upright blood pressure were
noted. Effects on pulse rate were related only to acute drug
administration and were more pronounced during the initial
smoking phases. This suggests that tolerance developed to
drug-induced tachycardia. No significant electrocardiographic
changes were observed. Marihuana smoking had no apparent effect
on exercise related cardiac vascular function.<br>
</p>

<p>Physical examinations revealed only the development of
persistent conjunctival injection, lateral gaze nystagmus and
fine, finger tremors. These findings were believed to be acute
drug effects and of no clinical significance. No signs of
neurological abnormality were observed. No cumulative effect of
marihuana to cause, impairment of cognitive function was noted on
a battery of tests sensitive to organic brain function. </p>

<p>An increased amount of sleep in both shorter and longer blocks
of consecutive hours was observed. Also an increase in the number
of discrete episodes of sleep, especially one to three hour
episodes also occurred during the marihuana use period.
Reappearance of pre-drug pattern was seen during the post-drug
period. This reversion appeared to begin toward the end of the
drug period which may be indicative of tolerance, to the acute
depressant-like effects of marihuana. </p>

<p>Generally, performances on short-term memory, psychomotor
skills and time estimation suggests that repeated marihuana
smoking had no discernible effect on the ability to improve
performance with practice on these measures. Tolerance appeared
to develop to the acute decrement in performance on these
measures. On the time estimation task, a tendency appeared for
the subjects to increasingly overcompensate for the acute drug
effect with repeated testing in the nonintoxicated state.<br>
</p>

<p>Both casual and heavy users had a marked decrement in total
social interaction during the first portion of the marihuana
smoking period. Total interaction of the casual subjects
continued to diminish subsequently. Heavy users subsequently
tended to exceed presmoking levels of interaction indicating they
accommodated to the depressant effects of repeat doses of
marihuana. </p>

<p>Both groups became progressively more convivial and less
task-oriented in group discussions. They offered less suggestions
in problem-solving tasks but continued to efficiently solve the
problem. </p>

<p>Casual users reported general relative increases in negative
daily moods and decreases in positive daily moods during the
course of the study. The trend began with the onset of smoking
and persisted through the post-smoking period. This trend could
be a sequelae of repeated marihuana use or related to non-drug
variables (set and setting). </p>

<p>The heavy users did not evidence this trend toward relative
increases in dysphoric mood until the post-smoking period. Again
this may be related to repeated marihuana use, reflect
psychological dependence or be related to set and setting
variables, such as boredom and tension associated with the
prolonged study period. </p>

<p>Finally, repeated use of marihuana over the 21day period did
not decrease motivation to engage in a variety of social and
goal-directed behaviors. Almost without exception, every subject
earned the maximum number of points every day throughout all
non-drug and drug periods. No consistent alteration in pattern of
work could be related to repeated marihuana use. Subjects often
performed very high work output while they were smoking marihuana
and experiencing the maximum drug effects. </p>

<p>Repeated marihuana use, did not decrease subject's motivation
to complete the study. Nor was any noticeable effect observed on
interest and participation in a variety of personal activities,
such as, writing, reading literature, keeping up with current
national and world events, and participation in both athletic and
esthetic endeavors.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Effects of Long-Term Cannabis Use</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patterns of marihuana use in Western countries, particularly
the United States are primarily long term (two t o 10 years).
Additionally, Western investigators have been able to observe
those who use marihuana at most, daily and more often, moderately
or intermittently. Consequently, observed effects are rare.
Knowledge is incomplete but certain trends appear to be emerging
in regard to American usage patterns. </p>

<p>The relevance of Eastern reports of heavy hashish use is
uncertain. Nutrition, disease prevalence and quality of medical
care impose limits on transferring Eastern observations to
Western conditions of use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DEPENDENCE AND TOLERANCE</b> </p>

<p>Neither severe physical dependence, nor prominent withdrawal
symptoms after abrupt termination of very heavy usage is
suggested by some overseas experience (Charen and Perelman, 1946;
Fraser, 1949; Ludlow, 1857, Marcovitz and Myers, 1944; Siler et
al., 1933; Walton, 1938). Other studies, however, suggest marked
psychological dependence from heavy use producing compulsive drug
taking in very heavy users (Indian Hemp, 1893; Chopra and Chopra,
1957; Bouquet, 1944; Lambo, 1965). </p>

<p>Psychosomatic abstinence syndromes often reported were
physical weakness, intellectual apathy, loss of appetite,
flatulence, constipation, insomnia, fatigue, abdominal cramps and
nervousness, restlessness, and headache. For most heavy users the
syndrome of anxiety and restlessness seem to be comparable to
that observed when a, heavy tobacco smoking American attempts to
quit smoking. </p>

<p>However, the psychological dependence appears to be severe as
evidenced by the f act that one group of subjects were unable to
cease their habitual use although the frequency of use, was only
eight to 12 times per month (Soueif, 1967). This psychological
dependence may have made some users claim physical dependence so
that the government did not terminate dispensing them their drug.
Studies in the United States using must lower doses for shorter
periods of time have revealed little if any evidence of
psychological dependence (Bromberg, 1934 Mayors Committee, 1944;
Williams et al., 1946). </p>

<p>Tolerance to the subjective and depressant effects of the drug
(discussed in an earlier section) does probably occur in man,
with heavy use. Thus, increasingly larger and more frequent doses
become necessary to experience the desired effects. </p>

<p>Several investigators have recently studied the question of
physiological and psychological dependence to Delta 9 THC in
monkeys using intravenous self-injection techniques. </p>

<p>Deneau and Kaymakcalan (1971) demonstrated that no monkey
initiated self-administration over a three-week period when given
the opportunity to self-inject a behaviorly effective dose of 100
micrograms per kilogram of Delta 9 THC in a Tween solution. The
researchers subsequently administered to these monkeys this dose
every six hours. Tolerance developed to the behavioral effects
within a few days. Dose administered was progressively increased
up to 400 micrograms per kilogram over the course of a month.
When the injections were abruptly discontinued, all six monkeys
showed after twelve hours, behavioral and physiological changes
described by the researchers as mild abstinence signs. Two of the
six monkeys then initiated and maintained for several weeks the
self-administration of THC. </p>

<p>The investigators believe these findings are evidence for mild
psychological and physiological dependence on THC. However,
vehicle controls were not included in the research design. Thus,
the abstinence signs and subsequent behavior may possibly be
accounted for by the biological effects in of the Tween vehicle. </p>

<p>Harris et al. (1972) utilized several procedures to maximize
the possible conditions necessary for developing self-injection
in monkeys. These procedures included: spontaneous Delta 9 THC
self administration with no previous training to the technique;
self-administration of A' THC after training, with cocaine alone
and a mixture of cocaine and Delta 9 THC. Doses utilized ranged
from 20 to 500 micrograms per kilogram suspended in
polyvinylpyrrolidone. In all cases, monkeys failed to self
-administer Delta 9 THC. </p>

<p>The researchers conclude that A' THC lacks the reinforcing
effects of psychomotor stimulants and depressants which monkeys
readily self infuse with no auxiliary incentives. Also Delta 9
THC lacks a reinforcing function even for monkeys that are
well-trained with cocaine and have experienced several days of
rather large quantities of Delta 9 THC during the early pleases
of extinction of the cocaine reinforced response. </p>

<p>Finally, the results demonstrate that a two week period of
exposure to Al THC (in a mixed solution with cocaine) does not
result in the degree of homeostatic imbalance which occurs with
morphine, ethanol, barbiturates and sometimes the amphetamines
which accounts for the continued self-administration of these
drugs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Permanent congestion of the transverse ciliary vessels of the
eye and accompanying yellow discoloration is the only physical
effect firmly linked to long-term marihuana use (Ames, 1958;
Chopra, and Chopra, 1957; Dhunjibhoy, 1928). Although there are
several suspected or reported effects, none has been conclusively
demonstrated in a valid study. Some (Chopra and Chopra, 1939;
Indian Hemp, 1893) claim that bronchitis, asthma and other
respiratory problems may be produced by chronic and excessive use
of potent compounds in India. Eastern smoking, preparations are
often a mixture of tobacco and hashish. </p>

<p>Indian users reportedly exhibit digestive tract abnormalities,
weight loss and disturbed sleep (Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Soueif,
1967). However, the contributing factors of poor living
conditions, malnutrition and prevalence of communicable disease
could not easily be separated. </p>

<p>A high percentage of heavy Moroccan users have developed
obliterative arteritis of the lower extremities (Sterne, 1960)
possibly related to the occurrence of tropic foot ulcers (Ganja
-foot) (Miras, 1965). The progression of this abnormality is
claimed to parallel prolonged use of the drugs. </p>

<p>Mendelson et al. (1972) were unable to demonstrate clinically
significant abnormalities in the extensive battery of tests
performed which could be attributed purely to the subjects
long-term use of marihuana. No histories were obtained of
neurological, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, cardiac,
gastrointestinal, (renitourinary, or nutritional disorders. No
history of psychotic illness was given. </p>

<p>All subjects were Judged to be in normal mental, health by
psychiatric interview and psychological tests (MMPI and Edwards
Personality Preference Inventory). Three subjects were felt to be
neurotic. </p>

<p>Pre-drug complete physical exams, chest X-ray,
electrocardiogram, urinalysis, complete blood count and blood
chemistry profile did not demonstrate, any clinically significant
abnormalities. No subject showed evidence of poor nutrition. </p>

<p>Pulmonary vital capacity and one second forced expiratory
volume were reduced in 12 of the 20 subjects initially. These
changes were not correlated with either current cigarette smoking
or f requency or duration of marihuana smoking. Histories of past
cigarette use, past patterns of marihuana use and past or present
contact with environmental air pollutants were inadequate to
attempt to account for these pulmonary findings. </p>

<p>Many of the subjects were in fair to poor physical condition
as judged by a cardiac exercise tolerance test. </p>

<p>Four of the 20 subjects' initial performance on a battery of
cognitive functions tests was poorer than would have been
predicted by high average to superior I.Q. scores and educational
backgrounds. One of the casual subjects demonstrated improvement
with retesting consistent with good brain function. Thus,
behavioral impairment was present in three subjects.<br>
</p>

<p>Whether the impairment is related to prior drug histories,
particularly the excessive use of LSD by the two heavy users,
cannot be ascertained. For the casual users, nothing in the case
histories possibly elucidated the reason for relatively poor
performance based on the exceptionally high I.Q., 139 and 128. </p>

<p>Many Western investigators have suggested that smoking hashish
or marihuana may possibly cause bronchitis, asthma or
rhinopharyngitis (Bloomquist, 1967; Waldman, 1970; Tylden and
Wild, 1967; Schwartz, 1969). </p>

<p>Tenant et al. (1971) described bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma
and rhinopharyngitis in 22 American soldiers in Germany who
smoked daily enormous quantities (100 grams or more) of hashish
for six to 15 months. These conditions, believed to be caused by
irritation of the respiratory tract by hashish smoke, seemed to
improve, with diminished hashish use. </p>

<p>Twenty-one of the subjects were tobacco cigarette, smokers and
occasionally smoked hashish rolled in a tobacco cigarette. Nine
patients had symptomatic bronchitis. Five of these subjects
underwent pulmonary function tests while consuming their usual
daily amount of hashish and again three days after discontinuing
use. A mild obstructive pulmonary deficit was demonstrated which
was at least partially corrected with diminished hashish intake.
Hashish contributed to rbinopharyngitis in 12 of the patients and
this effect was not allergic in origin. Urticaria, acne, diarrhea
and gastrointestinal cramps were less frequent complaints.
Extensive hemotological and hentochemical studies including liver
function tests were performed and were within normal limits. </p>

<p>Mann et a]. (1970, 1971) and Finley (1971) studied the effect
of marihuana smoking on the pulmonary function of eight
non-cigarette smoking marihuana smokers (20-27 years old).
Marihuana smoking history was defined in marihuana
cigarette-years, that is, one marihuana cigarette daily for one
year or the equivalent over a longer or shorter period. The mean
marihuana cigarette years for the group was 11 and the range from
2.5 to 26. Three of the marihuana users also used hashish. Chest
X-ray, comprehensive spironietry deterinitiations, lung volumes
and carbon monoxide diffusion studies were observed and retested
with prednisone. Pulmonary functions were essentially normal for
all of the non-cigarette smoking marihuana smokers and
non-smoking controls.<br>
</p>

<p>These investigators were able to distinguish differences in
quantity and structure and function in pulmonary macrophages and
minor material between marihuana smokers and nonsmokers. In
tobacco smokers more marked changes were noted. These changes do
not indicate a diminution in defensive capacity of these cells. </p>

<p>Kew et al. (1969) has suggested a possible hepatotoxic effect
of marihuana. right persons who smoked marihuana for two to eight
years, at least six times a week, evidenced mild liver
dysfunction by liver function tests and liver biopsy. Several of
the patients admitted to the use of alcohol and oral amphetamines
but denied use of intravenous drugs. The authors concluded that
the findings were not unequivocally due to marihuana. </p>

<p>Hochman and Brill (1971) noted abnormal liver function tests
in 10 of 50 frequent marihuana users. However, all admitted to
long-term, regular and heavy use of alcohol. When these subjects
abstained from alcohol for one month but continued their usual
marihuana usage, evidence of disturbed liver function cleared in
nine out of 10 subjects. </p>

<p>Recently, Liskow et al. (1971) reported the appearance of an
anaphylactoid reaction in a 29year-old woman after smoking
marihuana for the first time. Skin tests were positive for an
allergy to marihuana, constituents. Allergy to marihuana,
especially in areas of the country where it grows wild, may be
more common than generally believed. </p>

<p>Campbell et al. (1971) presented evidence of ventricular
dilatation consistent with cerebral atrophy by air
encephalography in 10 young males (average age 22) with histories
of consistent marihuana use for three to 11 years as well as less
frequent use of LSD and amphetamines. The first four of the
patients had been referred originally for neurological
investigation of behavioral change, memory loss or headache. The
remaining six subjects were selected from patients tinder
treatment for drug abuse because of their long history of
marihuana use and concomitant neurological and behavioral
symptoms. </p>

<p>However, the patients showed personality behavioral and mental
disorders, as well as histories of head trauma and psychomotor or
grand mal epilepsy that are commonly associated with
ventriculographic changes. Also alcoholism can be associated with
these findings. Additionally, the authors compared their subjects
ventriculograms with those of normal young adults originally
referred for loss of consciousness, syncope and headache without
subsequent development of neurological illness. </p>

<p>Thus, the authors demonstrated dilation of the third
ventricle, of the frontal or temporal horn, or of the trigone of
the lateral ventricle. All of these are commonly associated with
personality and mental disorders such as these patients shelved.
However, whether these changes are caused by marihuana is not
proven because no specific neuropathological cause for the
cerebral atrophy was identified. Further carefully designed
studies are required to clarify this finding. </p>

<p>The LaGuardia Report (Mayor's Committee, 1944) indicated no
damage to the cardiovascular, digestive, respiratory and central
nervous system, nor the liver, kidney or blood in individuals who
had used from two to 18 cigarettes of unknown potency (average
seven) for a period of two-and a-half to 10 years (average
eight). However, this study was not up to modern standards as it
lacked double-blind precautions and placebo controls and adequate
statistical analysis of the data. Bias was present in reporting.
Small numbers of prisoners were used as subjects. </p>

<p>Another less comprehensive American study of 310 individuals
who used marihuana on the average of seven years was performed on
soldiers (Freedman &amp; Rockmore, 1946). It did not demonstrate
any evidence of physical or mental deterioration.<br>
</p>

<p>Another team of investigators (Meyer et al., 1971; Mirin et
al., 1970) examined a group of 10 male marihuana users (average
age 25) who had consumed the drug about 20 to 30 times a month
for all average of 4.4 years (one-half to five year range) and
had smoked daily for three of the 4.4 years. Heavy use was
correlated with psychological dependence, search for insight or
meaningful experience, multi-drug use, poor work adjustment,
diminished goal directed activity, decreased ability to master
new problems, poor social adjustment and poorly established
heterosexual relationship. No physical or neurological or
psychiatric abnormalities were noted in their work-up. </p>

<p>Indeed, numerous American investigators have not reported
abnormalities in baseline, examinations of their experimental
subjects who have various patterns of marihuana use from very
infrequent to many times a day.<br>
</p>

<p><b>GENETICS AND BIRTH DEFECTS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Much concern about possible effects on the unborn generations
has arisen because of marihuana's use by persons in their
reproductive years. Presently, most studies are preliminary.<br>
</p>

<p>There are three isolated case reports in man (Gelehrter, 1970;
Carakiishansky et al., 1969; Heelit et al., 1968) of birth
defects in mail in the offspring of parents who had used
marihuana and LSD. However, due to their complex gestational
histories and the high level of birth defects seen in a
&quot;normal&quot; population, a causal relationship cannot be
attributed to cannabis or anything else. At present, there is no
substantial evidence indicating that marihuana at the dose
commonly used is a teratogen in man. </p>

<p>Marihuana has been implicated as a teratogen in animals by
several groups at high doses. One study (Miras, 1965) showed
reduced fertility in rats impregnated after being fed a diet
containing marihuana extract for several months. However, the
offspring were normal. The reduced fertility may be related to
the finding of marked decrease rate of cellular division, but
without chromosomal damage, -when Delta 9 or All THC is added to
white blood cell cultures (Neu et al., 1969 Martin, 1969). </p>

<p>Dorrance et al. (1970) and Gilmore et al. (1970) detected no
significant difference in lymphocyte chromosomes in groups of
users and nonusers. No significant differences were, found in
lymphocyte chromosomes between heavy, long-term. Jamaican ganja
users and matched nonusers. (Rubin and Comitas, 1972) </p>

<p>Pregnant mice injected with cannabis resin on day six of
gestation caused stunted but not malformed offspring. Fetal
reabsorption occurred when the dose was given on days one to six
(Persand and Ellington, 1967). A second experiment using rats
injected on days one to six produced a high frequency of
malformed progeny. Another investigator (Geber, 1969; Geber and
Schramm, 1969) demonstrated congenital malformations in fetal
hamsters and rabbits after large multiple doses of cannabis
extract. </p>

<p>Another group (Pace et al., 1971) have administered a wide
range of dosages of Delta 8 and Delta 9 THC and marihuana extract
by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intravenous routes at
varying intervals pre- and post-conception to rats, hamsters and
rabbits. Delta 9 THC up to 200 mg/kg in variety of dose schedules
produced reduced average litter size and stunted pups at high
doses but no birth defects. A low incidence of abnormalities
occurred in rats and rabbits with marihuana extract, but a high
incidence of neonatal deaths was observed apparently due to
inadequate material lactation. </p>

<p>Studies with radioactive labeled THC (Idanpaaiini-Heikkila et
al., 1969) indicated that it did cross the placenta in high
concentrations early in gestation during the developmentally
labile phase. </p>

<p>These studies suggest that Delta 9 THC itself is not a
teratogen. Instead, perhaps some unidentified substance or
substances in the plant extract may be causing the teratogenic
effect noted by this group and others when injected. It is
uncertain whether this theoretical substance(s) volatilizes
during smoking or enters the pulmonary vasculature (Pace et al.,
1971).<br>
</p>

<p>Consequently, the following FDA label required of many
currently prescribed psychoactive drugs warning about use in
Pregnant women and women of childbearing age, appeals indicated.
&quot;Safe use of the drug during pregnancy and lactation has not
been established; therefore, in administering the drug to
Pregnant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing
potential, the potential benefits must be weighed against the
possible hazards. Animal reproduction studies have yielded
inconclusive results. . . . There have been clinical reports of
congenital malformation associated with the use of this drug, but
a causal relationship has not been confirmed.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>ORGANIC BRAIN DAMAGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Deterioration of mental functioning allegedly due to long-term
use of marihuana can be subdivided into four major categories:
organic brain damage, mental illness-psychosis, amotivational
syndrome, and recurrent-pnuenomenia. As with alcoholism, it is
quite often impossible to distinguish whether the described
effects result from drug use or represent personality traits or
changes which would have been present without the drug use. </p>

<p>When marihuana consumption was irregular, mental deterioration
was not evidenced (Freedman and Rockmore, 1946) in 310 users with
an average history of seven years of use. Sixty-seven heavy users
in New York showed no evidence of dementia attributable to drug
use although they did have underlying personality disorders.
Another investigation (Mayor's Committee, 1944) of individuals
who used a daily average of seven marihuana cigarettes (two to 18
range) for average of eight years (two-and-a-half to 16 range)
showed no evidence of brain damage or mental deterioration. </p>

<p>Reports from India (Chopra, 1935; Chopra, 1940; Chopra and
Chopra, 1939; Chopra, Chopra, and Chopra, 1942) relate minor
impairment of judgment and memory, limited self -neglect and
insomnia, when potent preparations are consumed regularly in
large amounts for many years. No evidence for mental
deterioration or brain damage has been noted.<br>
</p>

<p>Miras (1967) has described a Greek population of heavy hashish
smokers who appear as outcasts from the community after 15 to 20
years of heavy hashish use. They appear mentally sluggish and
depressed. They are reported to exhibit laziness, psychic
instability, amorality and apparent lack of drive and ambition.
Their speech and behavior has been described as -peculiar. Some
degree of responsibility is retained in that some do work to
cover their living and drug purchasing expenses. Some of them are
still quite intelligent. Memory is not deteriorated except during
the intoxication. They appear overly suspicious. Samples of their
electroencephalograms were believed to demonstrate abnormalities.
</p>

<p>However, Miras believes that this effect is related to the
quantity and frequency of hashish use. He describes three
categories of long-term hashish users. Type A uses low doses
intermittently and is socially and mentally unaffected. Type B1
uses low doses daily and no interference is caused in function.
Type B 2 uses high doses daily causing dependence and performance
decrements. Type C uses very high doses daily allegedly causing
mental deterioration and abnormal behavior described above. Fink
and Dornbush (1971) are currently intensively studying this
population. The results will be described in a later section. </p>

<p>Non-differentiated psychosis noted in foreign populations may
also be included within this diagnostic category. These will be
discussed with the psychosis.<br>
</p>

<p><b>PSYCHOSIS</b> </p>

<p>The alleged connection between mental illness and cannabis
derives from Africa, the Middle East and India. These areas are
currently developing economically and scientifically, but for
many years medical care and especially psychiatric care were
given low priority. Many chronic illnesses still persist in these
countries which may affect mental functioning. Furthermore,
well-trained psychiatrists and methodologists are very rare in
mental hospitals in these countries. Consequently, the findings
of earlier studies are questionable due to lack of controls,
biased sampling and poor data collection and failure to account
for variables like nutrition, living standard, cultural factors
and socioeconomic status. </p>

<p>India's mental institutions were widely quoted to support the,
connection between excessive cannabis consumption and insanity.
The Indian Hemp Commission performed a thorough and objective
investigation of this question, although methodologically it was
not up to modern standards. The Commission was unconvinced of the
reliability of hospital statistics, where often the diagnosis was
not made by a psychiatrist but by a referring policeman. </p>

<p>Therefore, the Commission examined all admissions to Indian
mental hospitals for one year. They found that cannabis rise
could not be considered a factor in more than seven to 13% of all
cases of both acute and chronic psychosis. </p>

<p>Chopra et al. (1942) carefully performed the same examination
of admission to Indian mental hospitals from 1928 through 1939
when cannabis use was extremely high. They found 600 cases of
acute and chronic psychosis which could be traced to cannabis
use. Other reports from India have produced varying estimates of
the incidence of cannabis psychosis (Peebles and Mann, 1914;
Chopra, 1971; Dhunjibhoy, 1930 Evens, 1904). In Egypt 27% to 33%
of mental hospital admissions were cannabis related (Ireland,
1893; Warnock, 1903). </p>

<p>Benabud (1957) reported that cannabis users comprised 68% of
all mental hospital admissions in Morocco but only 25% of these
admissions could be called cannabis psychosis. Watt (1936 and
1961) reported that 2% to 3% of mental hospital admissions in
South Africa were due to the use of dagga (cannabis). </p>

<p>Boroffka (1966) and Asuni (1964) reported that 14% of
psychiatric admissions in Nigeria used cannabis. Toxic psychosis
accounted for half of these and cannabis was felt to aggravate
underlying schizophrenia in the remainder. </p>

<p>Several statistical studies from other countries including
Jamaica, Colombia, Algeria, Panama and Tunisia support this type
of data (Prince et al., 1970; Beaubrun, 1971 Allentuck and
Bowman, 1942; Bouquet, 1951; Chevers, 1870; Defer and Dielil,
1968; Fraser, 1949; Freedman and Rockmore, 1946; Porst, 1942;
Siler et al., 1933; Reales-Aroyco, 1953; Medical Staff, 1938). </p>

<p>Very little information is available on the prevalence of
psychosis in the overall population of cannabis users. Chopra and
Chopra (1939) classified 2% of the ganja and charas smokers and
0.5% of the bhang drinkers in their sample of 1,200 as psychotic.
</p>

<p>Roland and Teste (1958) estimated that no more than 0.5% of
kif (cannabis) smokers in Morocco suffer from recurrent mental
conditions. </p>

<p>Prince et al. (1970), in a study in Jamaica, noted that about
20 patients per year are admitted to mental or general hospitals
with acute psychotic reactions allegedly precipitated by ganja.
In one general and one mental hospital the, ganja smokers
comprised 20% of the psychiatric admissions. Furthermore, the
percentage of heavy ganja smokers in the community was
significantly higher than 20%. Thus, a larger percentage of
psychiatric admissions were, derived from non-ganja smokers in a
comparable lower socioeconomic segment of the population. </p>

<p>This finding contrasts with the 68% prevalence of cannabis use
among psychiatric admissions reported by Roland and Teste (1958)
which is considerably higher than the prevalence of cannabis use
in the general population of Morocco. </p>

<p>Studies based on several hundred cases indicate that the large
majority of individuals hospitalized in mental institutions for
&quot;cannabis psychosis&quot; have suffered acute toxic
psychoses associated with a sharp toxic overdose or massive
excesses among habitual users. Occasional smokers and moderate
habitual users seldom had psychotic reactions and then only when
there were substantial predisposing factors. </p>

<p>The acute clinical picture seen in these delirium with
confusion, disorientation, terror, and subsequent amnesia is that
of a severe exogenous psychosis. It does not typically involve
the type of thought disorder characteristic of schizophrenia.
Short recovery times ranging from a few days to six weeks are
uniformly reported in sharp contrast to the lengthy recovery
period of functional psychoses (Chopra et al., 1942; Roland, and
Teste, 1958; Defer and Diehl, 1968; Beaubrun , 1971; Stringaris,
1939). </p>

<p>Consequently, the psychiatric literature on cannabis-induced
chronic psychosis is quite confused. In general, it appears that
cannabis use probably produces a specific psychosis, but this
must be quite rare, since the prevalence of psychosis in heavy
cannabis users, world-wide, is only doubtfully higher than the
prevalence in general populations (Murphy, 1963). However,
incidence and prevalence data for these countries on psychosis of
users and non-users of cannabis does not exist. </p>

<p>A Morroccan investigator, Christozov (1965), studied 140
chronic heavy hashish users hospitalized in a mental hospital.
Their behavior was characterized by a confusional state of
consciousness, an impulsivity, an irresponsible attitude, and an
instability of mood and character. The patients were often
psychotic with persistent hallucinations. Intellectual functions
were reduced in over half the cases although this was related to
a low intellect prior to drug use. Electroencephalography showed
no specific changes. In addition, it was noted that half of the
patients were also alcoholics. <br>
</p>

<p>The majority of the patients were, sedated and showed a rapid
improvement, allowing them to be discharged and be employed,
Although it appeared that these characteristics are reversible,
the patient often returned to heavy drug use again causing return
of the syndrome. </p>

<p>Thus, the existence of a more long lasting cannabis-related
psychosis is poorly defined. Some evidence indicates the
existence, of a, quite rare slow-recovery, residual
cannabis-psychosis following heavy chronic use. Patients often
exhibit schizophrenic-like withdrawal, mental confusion and mild
residual hallucinations; but there is little tendency for the,
symptoms to become organized or proliferate. The symptoms develop
gradually and then subside gradually before proceeding to
full-blown psychotic symptoms. These may produce gradual psychic
deterioration in the habitual excessive user after prolonged
periods of time. Several authors theorized that the chronic
psychosis consists of recurrent acute attacks with gradual
deterioration in habitual excessive users (Roland and Teste,
1958; Chopra, et al., 1942; Stringaris, 1939; Sigg , 1963).<br>
</p>

<p>Most investigators, therefore, find it exceedingly difficult
to distinguish a psychosis due to cannabis from other acute and
chronic psychoses because, few, if any symptoms, are uniquely
found in it and not observed in other psychoses. Often the
diagnosis of cannabis psychosis is made because of the history of
heavy marihuana or hashish use. Several have suggested that a
characteristic cannabis psychosis does not exist and that
marihuana will not produce a psychosis in a well-integrated,
stable person (Allentuck and Bowman, 1942; Reales-Aroyco, 1953). </p>

<p>In addition, alcohol often played a part in producing the
mental derangement (Medical Staff, 1938; Porst, 1942). Most data
refers to any form of psychosis in marihuana users; not
specifically cannabis psychosis. </p>

<p>Although it is fairly well-established that cannabis use
attracts the mentally unstable, the prevalence of major mental
disorder among cannabis users appears to be little if any higher
than that in the general population. Therefore, true cannabis
psychosis must be earlier, very rare or it must substitute for
other forms of psychosis. Perhaps, cannabis use alternatively is
protecting some less stable individuals from a psychosis (Murphy,
1963). </p>

<p>Because of these many difficulties, the role of cannabis use
in acute and especially chronic psychoses in these countries is
impossible to determine with certainty. </p>

<p>Finally, the Eastern literature often mentions the existence
of a characteristic psychic degeneration among older habitues
after prolonged excessive use (Chopra et al., 1942; Christozov,
1965; Indian Hemp Commission, 1893; Roland and Teste, 1958;
Stringaris, 1939; Warnock, 1903). They are frequently described
as showing a single minded, carefree state, such as
&quot;Kif-happy vagabonds.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>Soueif (1967) administered psychomotor and cognitive
performance tests to imprisoned hashish users and non-hashish
users in Egypt. Preliminary results indicate that, on most of the
tests, the hashish sample scored 10% to 20% below the control,
and differences were larger for those with higher educational
levels. These results do not necessarily indicate a causal
relationship. Assessment of the significance of these findings
must await further description of the samples utilized. </p>

<p>Experience in the U.S. and Western Europe has not involved a
level of marihuana use comparable to the above-mentioned
countries. Consequently, the associated chronic psychotic
disturbances have not been seen.<br>
<br>
In Western countries, Bromberg (1939) and Allentuck and Bowman
(1952) reported on acute psychotic episodes with clear-cut onset
during the marihuana intoxication. Most symptoms cleared within a
few days although several had a, prolonged illness. These rare
acute psychotic episodes, discussed earlier, have been described
recently by a variety of authors in scattered countries (Smith,
1968; Weil, 1970; Bialos, 1970; Keeler, 1967; Milman, 1971;
Pesyko, 1970 Kaplan, 1971; Prince et al., 1970; Baker and Lucas,
1969; Grossman, 1969; Beaubrim, 1971; Spencer, 1970). </p>

<p>Some of these reported cases are quite transient and clear
rapidly with support of others and may be more like acute panic
reaction than psychosis. Still others appear to fit the picture
of transient toxic psychosis. </p>

<p>A few cases of marihuana psychosis reported by Kaplan (1971)
recovered very slowly after extensive psychotherapy. However, the
high incidence of schizophrenia and borderline states described
in these patients and their families may indicate that marihuana
use merely aggravated or precipitated an underlying psychosis in
these individuals. </p>

<p>George (1970) reported a case in Britain in which an acute
episode of confusion, disorientation, hallucination, anxiety,
paranoia, agitation and memory loss related to cannabis use was
followed by a more chronic schizophrenic-like syndrome with
thought disorder, incongruous affect and hallucinations. This
individual was experiencing considerable financial and marital
stress prior to these two separate acute episodes. The chronic
condition eventually responded to psychotherapy.<br>
</p>

<p>Bernhardson. (1969) reported aggravation by cannabis of
schizophrenic conditions in several Scandinavian patients. Perna
(1969) reported a case in which marihuana appeared to aggravate
an extended psychosis for which the patient had required
psychiatric treatment prior to the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>Keup (1970) reported 14 cases of prolonged psychotic symptoms
requiring hospitalization associated with the use of marihuana.
He noted evidence for the existence of a, high level of
psychopathology in many of them which predated their marihuana
use.<br>
</p>

<p>Kolansky and Moore (1971) in a widely publicized report of
cases of individuals ages 13-to-24 has claimed profound adverse
psychological effects from smoking marihuana two or more times a
week. </p>

<p>Of 38 individuals reported, all had decompensated
personalities, eight had psychoses (four attempted suicide) and
13, according to the authors became sexually promiscuous due to
marihuana. These clinical impressions were, all based on, at
most, a few interviews with the, individuals who were referred to
these psychiatrists for consultation for problems (including
one-third by legal authorities after arrest for possession of
marihuana). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the authors made sweeping generalizations to
all young adolescent marihuana users from this biased and
non-representative sample. No attempt was made to interview other
young marihuana users who have not been referred for psychiatric
help, and the high prevalence of promiscuity and psychopathology
in comparable adolescent populations was totally disregarded. In
addition, case histories of previous mental health were obtained
introspectively from the patient, their families or the referral
source. </p>

<p>Thus, it is impossible, to state unequivocally, as the authors
do, that since marihuana use and psychiatric problems occurred at
the same time the former is causative of the latter. </p>

<p>Several authors have reported acute toxic psychosis following
marihuana use by soldiers in Vietnam (Talbott and Teague, 1969;
Colbach and Crowe, 1970, Bey and Zecchinelli, 1971). </p>

<p>All these cases represented transient reactions and cleared
rapidly with treatment. In many cases, personality disorders or
borderline personality states appeared to be predisposing factors
in the development of the psychotic state. Often revealed were
problems of identify diffusion, ego weakness, low self-esteem and
inability to form close interpersonal relationships. Also the
stressful conditions of the setting in which the drug was used
deserves emphasis. </p>

<p>Halikas et. al. (1971, 1972) performed intensive psychiatric
interviews on a population of 100 regular marihuana users and a
control group of 50 of their non-using or casually using friends.
Half of each group met the criteria for some psychiatric
diagnosis. Psychiatric illness and antisocial behavior most often
preceded marihuana use. </p>

<p>Some attempts have been made to estimate the incidence, of
psychosis and other adverse reactions to marihuana in Western
countries. Obviously, such estimates depend on how these
reactions are defined-one questionnaire study of 2,700
psychiatrists, psychologists, internists and general
practitioners in the Los Angeles area reported 1,887
&quot;adverse reactions&quot; to marihuana in an 18-month period
(Ungerleider et al., 1968). Adverse reactions were not defined by
the authors in the survey. Those reported ranged from mildly
unpleasant parental objections to use to severe anxiety or acute
psychosis. </p>

<p>Keeler (1967) reported on &quot;adverse reactions&quot; to
marihuana (paranoid feelings, etc.) which are limited to the
immediate period of intoxication. These phenomena occasionally
occur in such a light proportion of regular users that they are
of little interest in the present discussion, e.g., 80% of users
report they sometimes have paranoid reactions during the
marihuana intoxication (Tart, 1970). </p>

<p>Other estimates have been based on hospital admissions in
which marihuana use was the recognized precipitating cause.
Lundberg et al. (1971) reviewed the admission records for the Los
Angeles County General Hospital for the period 1961-1969 and
found marihuana use was listed as the reason for admission in
only nine out of 700,000 cases, and five of these were for
intravenous injections. </p>

<p>Keup (1970) reports that 0.9 per 1,000 of the 1968 admissions
to a Brooklyn psychiatric hospital were directly related to
cannabis use, and in another 1.9 per 1,000 it was found to be a
contributory factor. </p>

<p>In 1966, psychiatric hospitals in England listed 82 admissions
for which cannabis use was considered a factor (Baker and Lucas,
1969) in 1967, the number was 140 (George, 1970). For the 1966
data, further analysis revealed that eight of the 82 cases were
acute psychotic reactions to cannabis, 20 were related to
&quot;cannabis addiction as a way of life,&quot; and cannabis
could not be established as a definite factor in the remainder
(Baker and Lucas, 1969). </p>

<p>Colbach and Crowe (1971) estimate that among a population of
45,000 U.S. soldiers in Vietnam in 1969, some 40 to 50 per month
were hospitalized for psychiatric reasons and about five of these
were associated with (usually heavy) marihuana use. </p>

<p>Among college populations, Pillard (1970) estimates five to
seven marihuana-associated anxiety reactions are, seen per year
by the Boston University Health Service which cares for a student
population of 20,000; and Bialos (1970) reported 11 cases during
a one-year period (1968-1969) for a student population of 8,500. </p>

<p>If it is assumed that about one-third of the Vietnam and
college populations are using marihuana to some degree, the
annual incidence of hospitalized cases in Vietnam would be about
four per 1,000 users; the rate for student-health cases, 0.3 to
1.3 per 1,000 users. </p>

<p>The 1972 Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare's report
on Marihuana and Health prepared by the National Institute of
Mental Health noted in summary that marihuana can clearly
precipitate certain less serious adverse psychiatric reactions,
such as simple depression and panic, particularly in
inexperienced users. </p>

<p>In these reactions, non-drug factors may be the most important
determinants. Psychotic episodes may also be precipitated in
persons with a preexisting borderline personality or psychotic
disorder or those persons under excessively stressful conditions.
These acute psychoses appear to share considerable clinical
similarities with the acute toxic psychoses noted in the Eastern
literature. Both these psychoses resemble an acute brain syndrome
in that they occur primarily after heavier than usual usage and
are self-limited and short-lived after the drug is removed from
the body. </p>

<p>Some reports describing a prolonged psychotic course after an
initial acute episode cannot rule out the role of pre-existing
psychopathology. At the present time evidence that marihuana is a
suf ficient or contributory cause of chronic psychosis is weak
and rests primarily on temporal association. This issue may be
clarified by extensive epidemiological and controlled clinical
studies. (Secretary, HEW, 1972) </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME<br>
</b></p>

<p>Another type of possible mental deterioration or subtle
personality and behavioral changes associated with heavy
long-term cannabis use is the amotivational syndrome. </p>

<p>This syndrome has been described world-wide in its extreme
form when the most potent preparations are, used (Miras, 1967;
Chopra. and Chopra, 1957; Chopra et aL, 1942; Christozov, 1965;
Indian Hemp, 1893; Benabud, 1957; Warnock, 1903). Its most
extreme form depicts a loss of interest in virtually all
activities other than cannabis use. The resultant lethargy social
and personal deterioration and drug preoccupation may be
comparable to the skid row alcoholics' state. </p>

<p>Benabud (1957) describes the occurrence of this syndrome in
individuals chronically intoxicated with hashish. These
individuals are unlikely to show conventional levels of
motivation. Also the time required to obtain and consume enough
drug to maintain this state is not likely to leave much time for
other pursuits. The passive user tends to lose interest in work
and other long-term goals. </p>

<p>The question of whether there exists a significant causal as
opposed to an associative or correlational relationship, only
attracted attention when the traditionally achievement-oriented
Western youth adopted cannabis use. The traits of passivity or
amotivation are commonly described among heavy cannabis user
throughout the world. </p>

<p>A number of Eastern authors have expressed the opinion that
this is a result of organicity from chronic cannabis use in large
amounts, without objective studies being performed. </p>

<p>Recently the term has been used to describe the behavior of
numbers of young Americans who are for a variety of reasons
dropping out of school, refusing to prepare themselves for
traditional adult roles and smoking marihuana. </p>

<p>This type of social maladjustment is not comparable in
magnitude to that described in other cultures. However, the
individual may lose the desire to work, to compete, to face
challenges. Old interests and concerns are lost and the
individual's life, becomes centered around his compulsive drug
use. In addition, the individual may ignore personal hygiene,
experience loss of sex drive and avoid social interaction (Mirin
et al., 1970; Smith, 1968). </p>

<p>West (1970) and McGlothlin and West (1968) have described a
clinical syndrome as a result of observations of regular
marihuana users for four years. Their clinical impressions are
that these individuals show subtle changes in personality over
time which might represent an organic syndrome. These include
diminished drive, lessened ambitious decreased motivation,
apathy, shortened attention span, loss of effectiveness,
introversion, magical thinking, derealization and
depersonalization, decreased capacity to carry out complex plans
or prepare realistically for the future, a peculiar fragmentation
in flow of thought, and a progressive loss of insight. </p>

<p>Another psychiatrist, Powelson (1971), has also concluded on
the basis of over five years clinical experience with drug users
at the University of California, Berkeley, that the effects of
marihuana are cumulative. He, feels that after a period of
prolonged use a disorder of thinking characterized by a lack of
coherence and a pathological thinking process results. </p>

<p>These disturbing findings are being reported more frequently,
especially in adolescent and young-adult groups. Recently,
tentative and preliminary data (Francois et al., 1970; White et
al., 1970) has been presented on a group of 19 hospitalized
14-to-20-year-old patients with behavioral disorders who had used
marihuana and other drugs heavily. </p>

<p>In addition to &quot;amotivation,&quot; they showed primitive
and magical modes of thought and low frustration tolerance.
Subtle EEG patterns were detected although this finding is not
uncommon in adolescents with behavior problems. </p>

<p>The researchers are presently carrying out a study in
non-hospitalized adolescents without behavioral disorders who
have similar patterns of drug use in order to clarify their
findings. </p>

<p>Kornhaber (1971) believes that at least twice daily marihuana
use for a year, in a 13-to-18-yearold population, has a
deleterious effect upon the developing adolescent. The
intoxicated state facilitates a regression from
logical-mathematical thought processes to a more primitive
conceptual mode of fantasy and magical thinking and impairs
learning ability and judgment by decreasing attention and
concentration. Thus, the developing youth turns away from reality
toward fantasy and from structure and activity to passive
dependency. </p>

<p>Kornhaber suggests that marihuana facilitates the development
of normal adolescent turmoil into a pathological state. However,
he feels that the existence of the syndrome depends partially on
the individual's vulnerability to the drug influence. </p>

<p>A possibly milder variation of this syndrome has been
clinically observed by Scher (1970) in individuals in the
20-to-30 age group who have used marihuana daily for five years
while apparently functioning normally in society with good jobs,
often creative ones. These individuals begin to experience a
vague sense of functioning at reduced efficiency level. Thus, the
disabilities experienced are personal and internal ,and
constitute a vague neurotic depressive-like syndrome,. </p>

<p>In addition to the methodological problems of (Establishing
causative as opposed to associative relationships, it is also
very difficult to obtain a sample of heavy cannabis users in the
West who have not had substantial experience, with other drugs,
especially the strong hallucinogens. </p>

<p>Koridiaber (1971) has described a sample of 50 adolescent
psychiatric patients who used marihuana daily and also took other
drugs. He concluded that marihuana exercised a &quot;chronic,
tranquilizing, psychomotor-depressant effect&quot; among these
patients, and facilitated regression, fantasy and magical
thinking. School performance, participation in sports, and
personal hygiene also declined. He reported improvement in school
performance, mood and the underlying depressive symptoms for many
patients four to six weeks after discontinuing marihuana use. </p>

<p>Given there is a fairly strong tendency for heavy cannabis
users to be passive and apathetic, to emphasize the present over
the future, and to choose fantasy over rationality, there are
several ways by which this relationship might come about
(McGlothlin, 1972). </p>

<p>First,, persons who already exhibit these, traits may simply
be attracted to the use of cannabis. Sociologists tend to favor
this explanation, arguing that the relationship between cannabis
use and various behavioral indicators is not causal, but simply
one manifestation of a general pattern of youthful deviance or
rebellion (Goode, 1970). </p>

<p>Utilizing a large sample, Johnson (1971) found that marihuana
use is associated with impaired school performance and several
forms of deviance; however, other indicators such as premarital
sex and high school truancy predicted the dependent variable as
well or better. Tobacco and alcohol use were nearly as good
predictors as marihuana. </p>

<p>A second related explanation is that the illegal. context in
which the drug is taken forces the adoption of a nonconforming
life style. The users is thus further alienated from the dominant
culture through his close ties with the cannabis-using group. </p>

<p>Third, cannabis use and associated activities may largely
substitute for other interests. The individual may focus so much
of his time and energy on cannabis that he has little time for
other endeavors. </p>

<p>Fourth, heavy cannabis use may act pharmacologically to
produce a chronic tranquilized state. Although the acute phase of
intoxication is relatively short, there is some evidence of a
lethargic hangover effect (Haines &amp; Green, 1976). </p>

<p>Fifth, personality and behavior changes may result through the
routine process of learning via exposure. If an impressionable
youth spends a great deal of his time in the world of cannabis
intoxication, he may learn to think in a similar manner when not
intoxicated. In particular, he may learn to choose the drug
fantasy as an alternative to solving personal problems and facing
adult responsibility. </p>

<p>A related explanation is that cannabis acts as a catalyst,
creating a condition which facilitates change, providing other
necessary conditions are present. Cannabis, along with the strong
hallucinogens, produces a kind of mind-loosening effect in which
mechanisms providing structure and stability to perception of
self-image, environment, time sense,, etc., are temporarily
suspended. </p>

<p>The, more frequent users welcome this effect and report
utilizing the loosening effect of the drug to achieve further
personality change in the direction of less conformity and more
spontaneity, that is. the &quot;hang-loose ethic&quot; (Suchman,
1968; Simmons and Winograd, 1966). </p>

<p>In addition, the cannabis intoxication produces a heightened
suggestibility which likely makes the user more amenable to
adopting the attitudes and values of the subculture in which the
drug is taken. At a minimum, it may be concluded that the effects
of cannabis can reinforce and provide a rationalization for
previously existing tendencies. </p>

<p>Finally it is possible that chronic cannabis use can result in
organicity (Soueif, 1967). </p>

<p>In summary, if cannabis use produces personality and behavior
changes via one or more of the above mechanisms, the extent of
such changes is likely to be strongly related to the amount
consumed and the age of the user. According to evidence found in
Western literature, frequent use may be quite disruptive during
the formative years of adolescence. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the Eastern literature indicates that,
although the very heavy user (200 mg. THC or more per day) is
largely incapacitated, manual laborers often function adequately
while consuming amounts containing 30 to 50 mg. THC per day
(Roland and Teste, 1958; Chopra and Chopra, 1939). Similarly,
many musicians and entertainers in the United States have lived
productive lives while using marihuana (Winick, 1960). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>RECURRENT PHENOMENON</b> </p>

<p>Another poorly understood phenomenon is the spontaneous
recurrence of all or part of the drug intoxicated state (somatic
and visual sensations) when not under the influence of the drug.
This phenomenon has been called a &quot;flashback&quot; when it
occurs spontaneously or &quot;a contact high&quot; when it occurs
in the presence of others who are intoxicated. </p>

<p>Flashbacks have been reported with marihuana use alone.
However, these occurrences are apparently predominant in
marihuana users, who have taken hallucinogenic drugs previously.
These marihuana, users occasionally find that marihuana highs
change for them after their hallucinogenic. experiences. For
example, a simple hallucination experienced previously may
reoccur while high on marihuana. </p>

<p>These flashbacks may be interpreted as pleasant, even desired
experiences by some but unwelcome and disturbing to others. The
recurrences are benign in most individuals and tend to disappear
as the hallucinogenic experience recedes in time (Keeler, 1967;
Smith, 1968; Weil, 1970; Bialos, 1970; Blumenfield, 1970). </p>

<p>Truly vivid experiences which recapture most of the elements
of the original experience are extremely rare (Smith and Meld,
1970). More often they resemble an anxiety state occurring after
an unpleasant high or the recurrence of a new perceptual
awareness gained while high. It is difficult to differentiate
these recurrences from the not uncommon deja vu phenomenon in
which a person has the illusion that a perceived situation has
occurred before. These recurrences are intermittent and usually
occur within a few days to weeks following the use of marihuana.<br>

<h1>Investigations of Very Heavy, Very Long-Term Cannabis Users </h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Proving a causal relationship between the use of any substance
and an associated illness or condition is extremely difficult.
Ideally, prospective longitudinal studies on large populations of
both substance users and nonusers matched for socioeconomic and
psycho-cultural variables should be performed for many years in
order to detect subtle or cumulative effects. Unfortunately, the
enormous expenditures of research effort and finances that would
be required for a large scale investigation of this nature are
prohibitive. </p>

<p>Consequently, carefully designed and controlled, clinical and
epidemiological studies of very heavy, very long-term cannabis
users in foreign countries must be relied upon to provide
important data on possible effects because these populations are
not obtainable in the United States.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>GREECE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Preliminary results (Freedman and Fink 1971, Fink and Dornbush
1971, Fink 1971) from an intensive medical, neurological, and
psychiatric study of 31 male chronic hashish users in Greece,
performed under contract to the National Institute of Mental
Health, have revealed few abnormalities in these individuals.
Non-users matched for socioeconomic, and psycho-cultural factors
including life style, alcohol and tobacco consumption and
nutrition and general health have not been studied. </p>

<p>In collaboration with Professors Miras and Stefanis in Athens,
Fink and co-workers are studying a population of chronic hashish
users that Professor Miras has known for many years. The
population studied is composed of 31 male subjects ranging in age
from 26 to 69 years with a mean of 46 years. </p>

<p>The subjects report starting hashish use at 13 to 35 years of
age with a mean of 19. They have -used hashish from 10 to 49
years, with a median of 28 years. In the past they used an
average of eight grams of hashish daily with a range of 2 to 24:
grams daily. (The hashish it estimated to contain 4% THC on the
average. Therefore, average daily use was 320 mg. of THC). </p>

<p>In the past, 27 of the subjects were daily -users and four
used every other day. Frequently of hashish use per day was: once
per day-2 subjects, twice per day-6 subjects, three times per
day-14 subjects, four times per day-4 subjects, and five, or more
times per day-5 subjects. </p>

<p>The men reported a reduction in drug use with time ascribed to
increasing difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies due to
increased enforcement of the drug regulations. At present they
use an average of three grams of hashish daily (320 mg. of THC)
with a range of one to 10 grams daily. </p>

<p>Twelve now use hashish daily, eight use, every other day and
11 use less frequently. Frequency of daily hashish use is: once
per day-5 subjects, twice per day-12 subjects, three times per
day-10 subjects, four times per day-2 subjects, and gve(sic) or
more times per day-2 subjects. </p>

<p>The men are primarily hashish users. One has used opiates. Two
are heavy users of alcohol and six report occasional to frequent
use of alcohol at the present time. Tobacco is smoked by all
subjects averaging 40 cigarettes per day. </p>

<p>Twenty-three of the subjects report periods of abstinence from
hashish averaging ten months but up to three years. Hashish use
is primarily social by 20 subjects, and 15 subjects smoke in
solitude. </p>

<p>Pipes and cigarettes in which hashish is mixed with tobacco
are used interchangeably. The usual time of smoking is after work
(21 subjects) but 12 subjects smoke before work and five smoke
anytime. </p>

<p>In this population, the median education is three-and-a-half
years of school with a range of none to nine. Five of the men are
illiterate. Twenty-one of the men are married, one is cohabiting,
four are single and five are divorced or separated. </p>

<p>All of the married men are employed and support their
families. The subjects report changing their jobs frequently and
11 had periods of unemployment from three to 120 months. Ten were
classified as skilled workers and 21 as unskilled workers. Their
jobs include selling scrap metals, general labor, cartage,
messenger, maintenance assistants, etc. </p>

<p>Arrests are common and 19 report at least one non-hashish
related arrest. Eighteen have been in regular military service,
six were exempt because of hashish use and seven for other
reasons. </p>

<p>Interestingly, 10 of the 15 wives interviewed prefer the
behavior and attitudes of their husbands when they are using
hashish compared to when they are drug-free. </p>

<p>In regard to family and personal background 20 had refugee
parents, 13 had alcoholic or hashish using fathers, 26 had three
or more siblings, 19 had dominant mothers. Fifteen of 21 had
dominant wives. Seven reported broken homes under age 16. </p>

<p>Apparently, the subjects participation in society is
consistent with their lower socioeconomic background. No gross
behavioral deviation was detected I in this population. </p>

<p>Psychiatric status was evaluated by history and psychiatric
interview. Nine have had psychiatric hospitalization of which
three were in the military and related to hashish use. Two have,
had psychiatric outpatient treatment. Eight had histories of
neurotic traits during childhood. In their psychiatric
evaluation, three men are considered to have psychiatric
pathology. Two of these were considered sociopaths on the basis
of homosexuality and criminal behavior. The third was diagnosed
as a schizophrenic. No overt signs of any organic mental syndrome
were detected. None of the three men were believed to require
psychiatric intervention. The schizophrenic, although suspicious
and withdrawal, is a successful business man and lives with his
family on weekends. </p>

<p>Complete physical and neurological examination revealed three
prominent findings. All had very poor dentition which the men
ascribed to hashish smoking. Chronic bronchitis was detected in
14 of the men and emphysema in three others. This finding is not
surprising because all subjects were tobacco cigarette smokers
averaging 40 cigarettes per day, in addition to their very heavy
hashish consumption. Enlarged livers were also found in nine of
the 31 subjects. </p>

<p>Because no extensive psychological test battery has been
developed or standardized in Greece, American tests were used.
These tests are not culture-free, and it is possible that certain
items or subtests were inappropriate for the subjects because
they had not acquired the type of knowledge or skills required
due to their poor level of education. </p>

<p>The Wechsler-Bellevue I.Q. tests were translated into Greek
and administered. Because of these, factors, comparison of level
of performance between these subjects and white middle class
Americans is meaningless. </p>

<p>The mean I.Q. is 86 with a range of 69 to 109. The mean verbal
is 90.3 and the mean performance was 83.6. The group of subjects
performed lower than expected on digit symbol, digit span and
similarities but higher than expected on comprehension,
arithmetic, vocabulary and picture completion. The Ravens
Progression Matrices showed a similar pattern and mean I.Q. The
significance of these findings will depend on a comparison with a
matched nonuser population. </p>

<p>Resting electroencephalograms were obtained in 30 subjects and
evaluated independently by four experts. Twenty-five were within
normal limits. </p>

<p>Testing was incomplete in one record. One record in a subject
who had a head injury within the prior three months showed focal
slowing. </p>

<p>Two of the four experts judged the remaining three, records as
showing low degrees of average to low voltage theta activity
indicative of cerebral dysfunction. The remaining two experts
judged these records as within normal limits. </p>

<p>This medical and psychological data suggests some effects of
very long term, very heavy hashish use. Without a matched
comparison group, factors independent of hashish use, such as
age, socioeconomic conditions, or environmental conditions, may
account for the observed changes. </p>

<p>However, the researchers note that these men have survived
chronic hashish use in high doses without gross behavioral
deviation. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>JAMAICA<br>
</b></p>

<p>Another foreign investigation (Ruben et al., 1972) conducted
in Jamaica (under contract for the National Institute of Mental
Health) studied chronic cannabis users and matched nonuser
controls. Preliminary findings have shown little evidence of
significant differences between the two groups in the extensive
anthropological, medical, psychiatric and psychological
investigations. </p>

<p>Ganja use is widespread and endemic in the Jamaican lowest
socioeconomic strata, and in particular in a millenial-religious
sect known as the Rastafarians. More than 50% of all male
Jamaicans are estimated to use some form of cannabis, and
probably about 20% are regular heavy users of ganja. </p>

<p>The drug was brought to Jamaica from India over 130 years ago
by indentured East Indian laborers. However, presently the
heaviest ganja users are Afro-Jamaicans who comprise 90% of the
population. </p>

<p>The Rastafarian religious sect, founded by Marcus Garvey,
preach a &quot;Back to Africa&quot; destiny and claim Haile
Selassie to be God. The Rastafarians have always worn. long hair
and beards and dressed eccentrically. They believe that &quot;the
herb&quot; was given them by God to help them to understand his
wisdom exemplified in their greeting, &quot;Peace and Love.&quot;
</p>

<p>The Rastas reject the values of the dominant society and
regard the government as &quot;the powers of Babylon&quot;. They
have, chosen to opt out of conventional society and instead work
and live in a communal existence in poverty. They emphasize the
value of ganja in achieving a new level of meaning in this
existence. </p>

<p>The Rastafarians add ganja to their infant first bath and
start feeding the drug to their infants from the time of weaning
in an infusion known as ganja tea. They continue to smoke and
drink the drug throughout life. </p>

<p>They, like many other Jamaicans, believe in its medicinal
properties especially for asthma and indigestion and promotion of
healing; that it gives protection from evil spirits; that it
cleanses the skin and purifies the blood; that it promotes sexual
vigor; that it gives energy for work and relieves fatigue and
provides relaxation after work. </p>

<p>Extensive in-depth studies have been carried out by a team of
anthropologists from The Research Institute for the Study of Man
in conjunction with The Departments of Psychiatry, Pathology,
Physiology and Medicine, of the University of the West Indies.
Anthropology field workers lived for extensive periods of time in
five rural communities (including fishing, farming and cane
cutting areas) and two urban districts. </p>

<p>Over 2,000 people were observed and studied in these
communities. Overall life styles of the ganja users were not
notably different from nonusing individuals in the Jamaican
lowest socioeconomic strata. Users are working, maintaining
stable families and homes, and actively participating in their
society. No evidence was noted of crime or aggressive behavior or
drug use other than alcohol related to ganja use. No evidence of
physical dependence was demonstrated. Minimal psychological
dependence was observed but no drug craving was expressed. </p>

<p>Thirty long-term ganja smokers and 30 nonusers matched
demographically to control factors other than ganja use, were
chosen as representative of this functioning lower socioeconomic
population and selected for intensive hospital study in order to
determine, differences between the two groups. </p>

<p>The mean age of the subjects was 33 with a range of 23 to 51.
The primary occupation of one-third of the subjects was farming.
The next most common occupations were, fishing, skilled and
semiskilled laborers. Half practiced no formal religion, five
were Rastafarians and the remainder practiced a wide variety of
traditional religious. Almost three-fourths of the males had
stable &quot;marriages&quot; and the remaining single subjects
were predominantly the younger ones. </p>

<p>The subjects were divided into three groups. Twenty-three were
nonganja smokers, 28 were regular daily ganja smokers and 9 were
occasional ganja smokers using the drug several times a we or
less. Three types of regular ganja smokers were delineated: light
smokers using one to four spliffs daily moderate smokers using
four to seven spliffs daily; and heavy smokers using eight or
more spliffs per day. </p>

<p>Age of first use ranged from 8-36 years of age. Regular use of
ganja occurred at a median age of 16 years with a range of 9-25
years. All ganja smokers had used the drug at least 7 years and
some up to 37 years with a mean of 17.5 years. </p>

<p>The ganja users consumer on the average seven spliffs of ganja
daily with a range of one to 24 per day. The typical ganja
cigarette or cigar, termed a spliff is roughly a four-inch-long
paper cone and contains about two to three grams of ganja with a
delta 9 THC content of about 2.9% on the average (range of
0.7-10.3%) mixed with about half of a Tobacco cigarette. Also
many smoke ganja in a Chillum pipe using very deep inhalation to
fill their lungs with smoke. They consume 14 pipe fulls per week
on the average, with a range of 1-25 per week. </p>

<p>No significant differences in neurological abnormalities,
electroencephalographic abnormalities, hemochemical changes
including liver function, urinalysis, chest X-ray abnormalities
or chromosome damage in lymphocytes were found in the users or
controls. </p>

<p>One user had a long history of bronchial asthma and another
had a mild case of Jamaican neuropathy, but nothing suggests
these disabilities were in any way related to ganja use. Minor
electrocardiographic abnormalities were present in about
one-third of both users and controls. This may be related to a
syndrome of unknown etiology known as Jamaican cardiomiyopathy. </p>

<p>Thorough physical examination and hematological studies
revealed only minimal significant differences between ganja
smokers and non-ganja smoking controls. Comprehensive evaluation
of red blood cell indices revealed that the ganja smokers had
significantly higher hemoglobin levels and packed red cell
volumes (hematocrit) than the non-ganja smokers. </p>

<p>These hematologic findings are compatible with those reported
recently (Sangan and Balberzak, 1971) for heavy tobacco cigarette
smokers. The authors noted that cigarette smoking causes a
functional tissue hypoxia due to deficits in lung func tionwith
resultant arterial oxygen unsaturation. Thus, an increased demand
is placed on the bone marrow to provide more red blood cells to
increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. </p>

<p>In addition to the heavy smoking of ganja in spliffs and
pipes, 27 of the 30 ganja smokers were tobacco smokers, and
several have smoked tobacco cigarettes heavily. 19 of the 30
non-ganja smokers were tobacco cigarette smokers and tended to be
light tobacco cigarette smokers. </p>

<p>Thus, the data appears to suggest that a combination of
factors including number of years and quantity of cigarette
smoking, ganja spliff smoking and ganja chilum pipe smoking is
significantly correlated with the hematological changes
indicative of functional hypoxia. However, pulmonary function
studies did not demonstrate significant decrements correlated
with ganja or tobacco smoking. </p>

<p>No significant differences were found between groups by a
thorough psychiatric and psychological examination. All subjects
were judged to be in normal mental health. Subjects were
administered a battery of standardized reliable American
psychological tests known to be sensitive to impairment in brain
function. These tests were not culture free so that comparison of
performance, between Jamaicans and Americans is meaningless
Nineteen tests evaluating 47 variables were performed including
one personality test, three tests of intelligence and verbal
abilities, and 15 neuropsychological tests. </p>

<p>Two of 47 variables had statistically significant differences
between ganja smokers and non-smokers. The smokers scored higher
on the digit span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale and bad a more centralized personality organization on the
Lowenfeld Mosaic Test. </p>

<p>Non-smokers had the best performance on the number of edge
contacts with the non-dominant hand on the Holes Test. These few
significant differences were considered chance findings by the
investigators. </p>

<p>In general no consistent differences were found on these
psychological tests between ganja smokers and non-smokers. The
data clearly indicate that the long-term ganja use by these men
did not produce demonstrable intellectual or ability deficits
when they were without the drug for three days. No evidence in
these results suggest permanent brain damage. </p>

<p>The alleged role of ganja in producing personality change in
the direction of a loss of competitive striving and an
unwillingness to work, termed the amotivational syndrome was also
investigated. </p>

<p>Based on clinical impressions gained from careful sociological
and psychological techniques, the investigators noted that the
chronic ganja smoker differed little in work habits or record
from his matched control. No evidence of an amotivational
syndrome was found. In fact, the subjects believe ganja has a
functional value as a work adjunct. It provides energy for work
and helps them do arduous boring jobs. </p>

<p>In the Jamaican culture, ganja may produce a
&quot;motivational syndrome&quot;. In an objective videotape
evaluation of work energy output and ganja smoking, ganja use did
not lower productivity on simple repetitive tasks, such as
woodcutting which requires compulsive concentrated effort. </p>

<p>A study of cultivators points up the relationship of
population, land, and economic pressures to ganja use. In the
area studied land resources are scarce, farms small and
cultivation difficult on the hilly slopes. Market conditions
determine income from cash crops and restrictions on migration
maintain population pressures on limited resources. </p>

<p>For these farmers, the researchers suggest that ganja use,
decreases total cultivated acreage and consolidates production
while disruption of competition and social cohesiveness among the
farmers is avoided. </p>

<p>These data may indicate that heavy ganja use during
cultivation in farming situations with limited alternatives may
serve to maintain the status quo. However, it is possible that
the compulsive concentrated effort experienced by the cultivators
with heavy ganja use may be productive in areas with good soil
and climatic conditions where systematic weeding can increase
crop yields. </p>

<p>As a result of the extensive anthropological study, the
investigators believe that ganja use in Jamaica is a culturally
determined phenomenon. A &quot;ganja complex&quot; exists which
consists of closely related, learned patterns of behavior
manifested by the members of the society. </p>

<p>The ganja complex appears to be functional for the
working-class Jamaican. Various elements Of the complex including
economic, social and personal are interrelated in ways that
contribute to operation of the whole culture.<br>

<p><b>AFGHANISTAN<br>
</b></p>

<p>Dr. Salamuddin Weiss (1971) studied 1011 chronic hashish users
in Kabul in order to obtain a general picture of the charas habit
in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>Cannabis is cultivated in this tropical country. A
concentrated product, charas, the resin obtained from the
flowering tops of the female plant, is the preparation generally
used. The most common method of smoking charas is in a clay water
pipe called a Chelum. Next most commonly used is a pipe or needle
and straw. Infrequently, charas is smoked in tobacco cigars or
cigarettes. Chewing the leaves or drinking a charas mixture as a
confection is quite rare. </p>

<p>Although charas smokers are found throughout society, they are
predominantly found in certain groups. The ages of the subjects
studied ranged from 13 to 70 years old. More than 75% were,
married. Almost all were males. </p>

<p>Socioeconomic status was as follows: 70%, lower, 28% middle
and 2% upper. 82% are illiterate, 27% had a primary school
education and less than 1% had any higher education. </p>

<p>Most smoking occurs in groups of two to 20 friends in quiet
out of the way places. Most users smoke several times a day. The
longer one has smoked charas, the shorter the duration of the
high and the more often the individual can smoke each day. </p>

<p>Weakness, sexual difficulties and physical impotence are
commonly reported by smokers. Most report they have a good
appetite and eat more than normal, but malnutrition is common. </p>

<p>One hundred chronic smokers were selected at random and
examined medically: 93 were malnourished; no evidence of illness
was found in 79 subjects; 13 showed signs of respiratory illness
(bronchitis) ; 7 showed sleep disturbances and one had pulmonary
tuberculosis. No deaths have been reported from charas overdose.
One subject out of the 1,011 was known to be chronically
psychotic. </p>

<p>A review of over 150,000 outpatient and inpatient psychiatric
visits per year over the past 10 years revealed 20 short-term
psychotic episodes yearly involving charas alone and 16,
short-term psychotic episodes yearly involving both charas and
other drugs. An absence of chronic mental illness related to
charas use was noteworthy. </p>

<p>Most charas smokers commence use during their teens, gradually
increasing their use about five or six times until they reach
their highest dose between the ages of 20 to 40 years. </p>

<p>At the extreme, smokers have raised their daily dosage up to
10 times their starting dose within the first two years. They
then gradually decrease their daily requirement by about 50% upon
reaching their 60's. Generally, most smokers cease charas use
after their 60's, but some. use extremely low doses for the rest
of their lives. </p>

<p>I These patterns of use are consistent with the development of
tolerance. Additionally, chronic smokers note they are able to
use larger doses than they did when they began use without any
significant signs of intoxication. Also after stopping charas use
for a few days or months, the users report they restart use at
smaller doses to achieve the desired effect. </p>

<p>No physical dependence was noted. Marked psychological
dependence was present which makes it difficult to stop their
habitual use. Discontinuation of charas use produced mild
psychologic abstinence signs. These signs, generally include
restlessness loss of appetite, sleeplessness, nervousness,
headache, and gastrointestinal upset. </p>

<p>Most smokers after discontinuation of use are quite able to
live with their families and perform their jobs without
discomfort. Most chronic smokers return to charas use within days
or months. Out of a group of 100 randomly selected ex-smokers who
had used for eight to 22 years, 42 have not returned to charas
use, 16 use occasionally and 42 have returned to daily use within
one to 13 months. </p>

<p>Most common explanation given by the subjects for restarting
use were to continue close relationships with charas using
friends and lack of a busy job. </p>

<p>A group of 100 opium addicts were selected at random from the
community; 51 of these started their drug use with charas and
later substituted opium for charas. </p>

<p>Generally, charas smokers report that they become faster in
their daily jobs, but observation reveals a slowness in these
activities. The ability to perform a non-complicated job is
comparable to non-charas smokers. They tend to be cooperative but
lazy persons. They tend to be more theoretical than practical and
avoid making decisions. They do not demonstrate creativity or
contribute significantly to the improvement of their community. </p>

<p><b>Summary<br>
</b></p>

<p>Marihuana has been used by man in countries around the world
for many centuries. Scientifically, more is known about
marihuana's effects than many other botanical substances consumed
by man. </p>

<p>Marihuana is one of several preparations from the plant,
cannabis sativa. The plant contains many different chemicals, but
tetrahydrocannabinol appears to be the major active
psychopharmacologic ingredient. The potency of the preparation is
determined by the THC content, which varies according to the
origin of the seed, the conditions of cultivation, and the extent
of manicuring. </p>

<p>Several important factors exert significant influences on the
psychopharmacological effect. These include dose, method of use,
set and setting, and pattern of use including frequency and
duration of use. </p>

<p>The acute subjective experience is dose-dependent. At low
doses commonly used in this country a mild intoxication occurs,
but at higher doses psychotomimetic experiences can occur. Few
consistent physiological effects are noted. No pathologic bodily
changes have been conclusively demon, strafed from acute use.
Subtle effects on recent memory, psychomotor function, and social
behavior have been demonstrated. </p>

<p>The margins of safety between the effective dose and the toxic
dose is quite large. No human fatalities have been noted in this
country caused by marihuana. The most common adverse reactions
are becoming too intoxicated, and the acute anxiety panic
reaction. Both of these are transient and related to dose
consumed as well as set and setting factors. </p>

<p>Acute psychotic, reactions are quite rare. They usually last a
few days to weeks and occur in predisposed persons either with
preexisting mental disorders or borderline personalities
especially under stressful conditions. Transient acute brain
syndrome or toxic psychosis is possible at extremely large doses.
</p>

<p>Evidence has accumulated which indicates that differential
tolerance does develop at least, in persons who smoke large
amounts of marihuana several times a day. Development of
tolerance to the depressant effects on behavior appears to
precede development of tolerance to the intoxicant effect. </p>

<p>Physical dependence has not been demonstrated. Little, if any,
psychological dependence is present in most intermittent
marihuana users. Moderate psychological dependence occurs in
moderate to heavy users and marked psychological dependence has
been described in very heavy chronic users. </p>

<p>Some detrimental effects have been conclusively linked to
short- and long-term marihuana use for very heavy users. The most
frequently reported change in the heavy, long-term smokers of
large quantities of potent preparations is chronic bronchitis
comparable to that developed by a heavy, long-term tobacco
cigarette smoker. A chronic cannabis psychosis probably occurs
rarely in heavy chronic, hashish smokers in Eastern countries.
Most psychotic episodes are the acute variety and clear in a few
days to weeks. No objective evidence has been demonstrated that
even very heavy, long-term hashish use causes organic brain
damage. </p>

<p>Objective studies of chronic, heavy smokers of potent
preparations have not causally linked this drug with the
amotivational syndrome which has been described by many
clinicians. Almost all chronic, heavy hashish smokers are
indistinguishable from their peers in the lower socioeconomic
strata of their respective societies in social behavior, work
performance, mental status and overall life style.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>III. Marihuana and Public Safety</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The significant role of the law enforcement community and the
popular press in promoting the idea that marihuana use leads to
undesirable and antisocial behavior has been discussed in the
Report. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the genesis of
the, perceived problem and the theoretical basis for these
allegations. </p>

<p>The early campaigns against marihuana use can be viewed as an
extension of the temperance and moral reform movements which
swept the country during the 1920's. They were generally
spearheaded by persons who opposed the use of opiates, alcohol
and tobacco on the grounds that all such substances were
physically, mentally and morally debilitating. The presumed
dependence of the user on the drug, the loss of self-control and
the unhealthy preoccupation with pleasure-seeking activities
purportedly induced by these substances were seen as contrary to
the traditional values of our society. </p>

<p>Reiteration of these themes by practicing professionals,
respected members of officialdom and the popular press ultimately
gave rise, to what Lindesmith (rev. ed., 1968: 188-189) has
termed the &quot;evil causes evil&quot; fallacy, and which Goode
(1972) has de-scribed as follows: </p>

<p>The impetus behind public and even expert conceptions of drugs
and drug use is that a phenomenon so patently undesirable and
universally condemned as the use of narcotics or marihuana must,
inevitably, have both pathological causes as well as pathological
consequences. Thus, the task of science and medical research is
seen as &quot;discovering&quot; these negative concomitants of
illicit drug use. In this way, we can all feel better about
condemning the phenomenon itself because our moral and
ideological feelings can thereby be, backed up and verified by
the Indisputable data of positive science (p. 1). </p>

<p>This same philosophical leaning of persons who view marihuana
as a significant danger to both the individual and society
carries with it a corollary that use be prohibited and the user
punished. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most persistent controversy with respect to
marihuana use is the degree to which it poses a danger to public
safety. Public and professional opinion surveys have repeatedly
demonstrated the existence of a widespread belief that marihuana
use leads to the commission of deviant, delinquent, criminal and
violent acts. In addition, some persons have recently expressed
concern that marihuana impairs driving skills and performance
and, in this way, also constitutes a public safety hazards. </p>

<p>This chapter will review the evidence pertaining to the
effects of marihuana on criminal and violent behavior, deviant
and aggressive sexual behavior and driving skills and
performance. Then an effort will be made to assess both the
nature and strength of the purported relationships between
marihuana use and these behaviors.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Problems in Assessing the Effects of Marihuana<br>
</b></p>

<p>The degree to which marihuana constitutes a danger to public
safety is dependent, in large measure, upon the drug's
observable, effects on the behavior of the user. No drug,
including marihuana, produces the same effect at all times, under
all conditions and in all individuals. Rather, the quality (form
and intensity) and the quantity (extent and frequency) of the
perceived effects are determined by the complex interaction of
both pharmacological and extrapharmacological factors. As Goode
(1972) has noted: </p>

<p><i>We should bear this qualification in mind when looking at
the relationship between the ingestion of a drug and any
subsequent behavior-with the latter supposedly &quot;caused&quot;
by the effects of the drug. Drug effects vary, and, in addition,
even standard effects do not automatically translate into
specific forms of human behavior</i> (P. 18).<br>
</p>

<p>In a paper prepared for the Commission, Tinklenberg (1971 :
1-8) has enumerated some of the basic factors which should be
taken into consideration in evaluating the relationship between
marihuana and crime. They are equally relevant, however, for the
assessment of any behavioral effect presumably attributable to
marihuana, and for that reason they are summarized below. </p>

<p><b>Definition and Congeners</b>. The concentration of the
principal active chemicals in cannabis (THC and their
metabolites) in any given amount of marihuana varies widely
according to where the plant is grown, how it is cultivated,
harvested and cured. These variations permit a wide range of
pharmacological potencies and unknown variations in their effects
on behavior. </p>

<p><b>Drug-Drug Interactions.</b> Given the strong possibility of
intentional or inadvertent adulteration of marihuana with other
psychoactive drugs, it may be that behavioral changes attributed
to marihuana may actually derive from the adulterants or from the
interaction of THC and the adulterants (which may well be
occasioned by the deliberate rather than unknown simultaneous or
sequential use, of other psychoactive drugs). </p>

<p><b>Dose-Response Functions.</b> With respect to the question
of how drugs affect behavior, it is likely that marihuana
influences behavior in different ways and degrees, depending upon
dosage levels. Although it is common to infer that higher doses
of a given drug will induce more of a particular response and
lower doses less, such inferences may be inaccurate in that drug
effects can show a curvilinear dose-response relationship (as
seems to be the case with alcohol). </p>

<p><b>Time-Action Functions.</b> Time-action function describes
the changing effects of marihuana during the course of the drug
action. During the brief periods in which the drug effects are
most intense, there may be a more pronounced alteration in
behavior than during most of the points on the drug time-action
continuum. </p>

<p><b>Individual Variation.</b> Different individuals apparently
respond quite differently to the same dose-time factors of
marihuana as well as other drugs. In some laboratory studies,
where, high doses of marihuana induced considerable euphoria and
enhanced conviviality in most subjects, a few subjects who
received the same dosage in the same setting experienced
paranoia, excessive agitation and aggressive tendencies. </p>

<p><b>Cumulative Effects</b>. The effects of marihuana on
individual behavior have been shown to vary according to the
amount of previous experience with the drug. There is increasing
evidence that chronic users respond quite differently to
marihuana than do occasional users. The cumulative extent of
previous experience may have an important influence on subsequent
behavioral responses. </p>

<p><b>Psychological and Environmental Variables.</b> The
behavioral response to marihuana and to other drugs is at least
partially dependent upon such psychosocial variables as the
expectations of the user regarding its influence on his behavior.
These expectations are in turn derived from. the personalities of
the, individuals involved, recent events in their lives, and the
physical, interpersonal and social milieu in which the marihuana
use occurs. The behavioral responses to marihuana use are likely
to correlate with such psychological and environmental variables
quite independently of any pharmacological effects the drug may
exert. </p>

<p><b>Personality Factors</b>. A certain number of individuals in
any given population demonstrate characteristic and relatively
enduring patterns of antisocial behavior regardless of their
immediate circumstances, possible drug use and the like. These
individuals, variously described as antisocial, criminal or
emotionally unstable, typically manifest, from childhood on,
recurrent tendencies toward deviance in many areas of life. For
some of these people, those predisposed toward both criminality
and drug abuse, crime and drug use do coexist. However, the
assumption that the drug causes crime or vice versa is not
necessarily valid. One should not automatically conclude from
this that the use of drugs has no influence on their criminal
behavior. Drug use may possibly provide a form of reinforcement
which may increase or decrease the likelihood of a criminal act. </p>

<p><b>Crime Process Factors.</b> Crime process factors refer to
the complexities of criminal behavior and the possible influence
of marihuana on that behavior. A multifactored perspective of the
etiology of crime , including personal, social and situational
variables, allows for the possibility that at each step in the
chain of events leading to the commission of a criminal act,
marihuana use may contribute to enhance or diminish the
possibility of this outcome. <br>
</p>

<p>In short, any interpretation of the data to be presented below
which fails to take into account at least some of these variables
will likely result in a &quot;post hoc, ergo propter hoc&quot;
fallacy-that is, the invalid assumption that simply because one
event occurs later than another event (one commits a crime after
smoking marihuana) that the latter is caused by the former
(marihuana caused the crime).<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and Violence</h1>

<p>(The evidence to be presented here applies not only to
aggression and to violence but to marihuana's relationship to
crime in general, and is therefore equally relevant to a later
section on marihuana and non-violent crime. The effects of
marihuana on sexual behavior, including the commission of sexual
offenses will be treated in the following section on marihuana
and sexual behavior.) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The popular and professional literature contains numerous
unsupported and often emotionally charged accusations regarding
marihuana's contribution to violence. </p>

<p>In at least two dozen comparatively recent eases of murder or
degenerate sex attacks, marihuana proved to be a contributing
cause (Anslinger, 1937). </p>

<p>In a recent study of thirty-seven murders in New Orleans in a
year, seventeen were traced directly to marihuana. . . . Evil
marihuana is pock-marking this nation with murders, sex attacks,
suicides, and crimes in every category from bank stick-ups to
petty thievery . . . (LaRoe, 1940). </p>

<p>Marihuana, while giving the hallucinations of cocaine, adds
delusions of impending physical attack by one's best friend or
close relatives. In addition, marihuana is intrinsically and
inherently crime exciting. It has led to some of the most
revolting cases of sadistic rape and murder of modern times
(Rowell and Rowell, 1939: 67). </p>

<p>Even sex does not satisfy the abnormal urges induced by
marihuana. There is still the necessity for further excitement,
more emotional release. That is when the guns are grabbed, the
knives waved and the razors swung. And all that is a marihuana
user's idea of what is normal! (Williams, 1969). </p>

<p>To add greater credibility to their undocumented assertions,
some persons describe the manner in which the drug purportedly
leads to violence. </p>

<p>In the earliest stages of intoxication the willpower is
destroyed and inhibitions and restraints are released; the moral
barricades are broken down and often debauchery and sexuality
result. Where mental instability is inherent, the behavior is
generally violent. An egotist will enjoy delusions of grandeur,
the timid individual will suffer anxiety, and the aggressive one
often will resort to acts of violence and crime ... (Anslinger
and Tompkins, 1953: 22). </p>

<p>Smoking of the weed is habit-forming. It destroys willpower,
releases restraints, and promotes insane reactions ... Robberies,
thrill murders, sex crimes and other offenses result (New York
Daily Worker, 1940, in Solomon, 1968: 288). </p>

<p>Others simply deny these allegations or assert that there is
no evidence to support the thesis of an independent causal
relationship. </p>

<p>The fact that so many witnesses testified to the peaceable and
orderly character of the excessive consumers goes far to prove
that in this country experience shows that as a rule these (hemp)
drugs do not tend to violent crime and violence (Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission, 1969: 258). </p>

<p>A fair summary of the available evidence would be that very
rarely do major (particularly violent) crimes follow upon the use
of the drug, and that, in instances where they do, the
relationship is an indirect one (Ausubel, 1958: 103). </p>

<p>One likely hypothesis is that, given the accepted tendency of
marihuana to release inhibitions, the effect of the drug will
depend on the individual and the circumstances. It might, but
certainly will not necessarily or inevitably, lead to aggressive
behavior or crime (President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice, 1967: 13). </p>

<p>The relationship between marihuana use land the commission of
aggressive acts or violent crime such as murder, rape and assault
remains one of the most controversial issues relating to the
drug. Persons who believe that such a relationship exists often
argue that marihuana triggers the release of inhibitions and
restraints, destroys the will power and heightens aggressive
tendencies of the user, serving as a catalyst for the commission
of aggressive or violent acts. </p>

<p>This argument raises several fundamental questions: Are the
effects presumably induced by the drug commonly experienced by
marihuana users? Are these effects, to the extent that, they do
occur, generally or frequently translated into overt behavior?
And is the behavior which presumably manifests itself ordinarily
violent or aggressive? </p>

<p>The answers to these questions may be obtained from several
sources, including the results of laboratory experiments designed
to measure certain physiological and psychological reactions and
to identify observable behavioral effects; and retrospective
self-reports of effects purportedly experienced by marihuana
users. Additional clues may be gained from examination of the
criminal records of known marihuana users and the incidence of
marihuana. use among persons arrested for or convicted of violent
crimes. However, while these latter methods may reveal
statistical associations (which could prove to be spurious upon
further analysis), they should riot be interpreted to demonstrate
the existence of a causal connection between marihuana use and

<p><b>THE VIOLENT AND CRIMINOGENIC EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA</b> </p>

<p>The empirical evidence gathered to date lends no support to
the hypothesis that marihuana heightens aggressive tendencies in
the user or that its effects significantly increase the
likelihood of inciting the user to violence or crime. However,
those findings summarized below do not mean that marihuana cannot
be related to aggressive or violent behavior but merely suggest
that the effects of the drug and the behaviors in question may
operate independently. </p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944) studied the
psychomotor effects of marihuana on 72 prisoners, both users and
non-users. Marihuana was administered experimentally as both an
oral extract and as cigarettes. The data show that the degree of
the drug's effect on psychomotor activities is dependent upon the
complexity of the function and, in some cases, on the strength of
the dose administered. Although simple reaction time and tasks
were only slightly affected, more complex functions like static
equilibrium and body and hand steadiness were significantly and
adversely affected by both large (5 cc.) and small (2 cc.) doses
of the drug. </p>

<p>In contrast to the ability of amphetamines to enhance muscular
performance and to increase physical activity (Weiss and Laties,
1962; Tinklenberg and Stillman, 1970), marihuana has been found
to decrease the inclination toward physical activity and to
actually reduce both physical exertion and activity (Mayor's
Committee on Marihuana, 1944; Hollister, et. a]., 1968;
Hollister, 1971), thereby decreasing the probability of inciting
the user to assaultive behavior. </p>

<p>Although marihuana has been found to reduce inhibitions in
some persons, it has not been shown to exaggerate extant
aggressiveness to any appreciable degree; in some instances it
has, in fact, been shown to reduce aggressiveness, and to induce
timidity, fear and passivity in the user (Bromberg) 1934,1939;
Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Allentuck, 1942; Chopra, and Chopra,
1942; Charen and Perelman, 1946; Carstairs, 1954; Blumer, et.
al., 1967; National Institute of Mental Health, 1970, 1972). </p>

<p>In recent years, a number of studies have been conducted in
which marihuana users were asked to describe the effects they
experienced while under the influence of the drug. On the whole,
their findings are similar to those obtained from the results of
laboratory experiments. </p>

<p>Halikas, Goodwin and Guze (1971) found that the majority of
the users in their sample reported &quot;usually&quot; feeling
relaxed (79%) and peaceful (74%). </p>

<p>Tart (1971) administered a questionnaire to college students
in California, one item containing a list of 206 possible effects
of marihuana. Respondents were asked to indicate whether, within
the last six months, they had experienced the designated effects
never, rarely, sometimes, very often or usually. Of the 153
respondents, 69% gave one of the latter three responses to the
item: &quot;My inhibitions are lowered so that I do things I'm
normally inhibited to do.&quot; </p>

<p>To the item: &quot;I lose control of my actions and do
antisocial things (actions that harm other people) that I
normally wouldn't do,&quot; 22% said rarely, 1% said sometimes,
and the remaining 77% replied &quot;never.&quot; With respect to
other more specific effects, 23% of the users stated they
&quot;usually&quot; felt physically relaxed, and 49% said they
&quot;very often&quot; felt physically relaxed and did not want
to get up or move around when high on marihuana (pp. 703-704). </p>

<p>In a study by Brotman and Suffet (1970) of 74 users in New
York City (both students and nonstudents) no one mentioned any
hostile feelings or actions when asked to describe what happens
when they get high on marihuana (p. 264). </p>

<p>Goode (1970) asked 204 respondents to describe their
experiences when high on marihuana. Table 1 illustrates the
responses of the users to effects possibly related to aggression
or crime (pp. 53-54). </p>

<p>In a more recent, Commission-sponsored survey of 15 to 34 year
old male residents of Philadelphia, respondents were interviewed
about the extent and frequency of their marihuana use, the extent
to which marihuana figured in the commission of criminal or
delinquent acts and the effects they generally experienced while
under the influence of the drug (Goode, 1972). With respect to
the effects experienced, nearly all the marihuana users (about
75% of the total sample reported that they had tried marihuana at
one time or another) denied that the effects of marihuana on them
could be interpreted as criminogenic or violent in nature. Table
2 below presents the subjective effects of marihuana related to
crime and violence which were reported by the 559 respondents. <br>

<p>The data show that the overwhelming majority of the
respondents report &quot;never or almost never&quot; experiencing
effects which can be characterized as producing frustration,
anger, or aggression, and that they usually do Dot experience
effects which could be taken to indicate an increase in
suggestibility. On the other hand, substantial proportions of the
respondents reported feeling relaxed (72%), less angry (53%) and
drowsy or sleepy (47 %, ) at least half of the time. </p>

<p>In sum, these data suggest that marihuana does not commonly
produce effects which are likely to increase aggression or incite
the user to violence. Numerous studies designed to assess the
relationship more directly demonstrate, on the whole, that
marihuana does not play a significant role in the commission of
violent crimes. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>MARIHUANA AND VIOLENT CRIME: THE EVIDENCE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Over the years a number of approaches have been utilized in an
effort to assess the relationship between marihuana use and
violent crime. Perhaps the simplest approach is to compile a.
list of violent offenses allegedly committed by marihuana users
and to establish, retrospectively, the role of marihuana in the
commission of these offenses. </p>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission (1894), for example,
investigated 81 cases of violence allegedly caused by hemp drugs
in in effort to determine whether or not a causal relationship
existed. Of these 81 cases, 11 were too old to permit adequate
investigation. In 23 of the cases examined, however, 18 showed no
evidence of a connection between the crimes and the use of hemp
drugs. The Commission concluded that: </p>

<p><i>In respect to his relations with society, however, even the
excessive consumer of hemp drugs is ordinarily inoffensive,. His
excesses may indeed bring him to degraded poverty which may lead
him to dishonest practices; and occasionally, but apparently very
rarely indeed, excessive indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to
violent crime. But for all practical purposes it may be laid down
that there is little or no connection between the use of hemp
drugs and crime </i>(Indian Hemp Drugs Commission, 1893-1894,
reprinted 1969: 204). </p>

<p>Similarly, in 1938 the Foreign Policy Association published
the accounts of 10 marihuana crimes, including murder and
assault, &quot;culled at random from the files of the U.S. Bureau
of Narcotics&quot; (Merrill, 1938: 28). These cases were
presented in such a way as to imply that marihuana caused the
offenses. According to Grinspoon (1971: 302), they &quot;gave the
reader the distinct impression that the -user of marihuana was a
violent criminal who was given to rape, homicide, and
mayhem.&quot; Bromberg (1939), however, questions the validity of
the causal assumption. </p>

<p>It is difficult to evaluate these statements, because of their
uncritical nature.... Among the ten patients, the second, J. O.,
was described as having confessed how lie murdered a friend and
put his body in a trunk while under the influence of marihuana.
J. 0. was examined in this clinic (Bellevue Hospital) ; although
lie was a psychopathic liar and possibly homosexual, there was no
indication in the examination or history of the use of any drug.
The investigation by the probation department failed to indicate
use of the drug marihuana. The deceased, however, was addicted to
heroin (p. 9). </p>

<p>Based on retrospective case analyses, some observers have
attempted to specify more precisely. the nature of the purported
relationship or the situations in which aggressive behavior may
result from marihuana use. Bromberg (1939), for example,
suggested that aggressive or violent behavior may arise when a
naive subject develops a panic state in response to
marihuana-induced hallucinations. Allentuck and Bowman (1942)
believed that aggressive or antisocial behavior following use may
occur as a reaction to some unpleasant external stimulus during
the phase, of hypersensitivity and heightened psychomotor
activity. Others have suggested that antisocial conduct of an
aggressive or violent nature may occur when marihuana is used, as
alcohol often is, to release repressed feelings of hostility
(Siler, et al., 1933; Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Allentuck and
Bowman, 1942; Freedman and Rockmore, 1946; Murphy, 1963), and to
serve as a fortifier for aggressive or violent crimes (Ewens,
1904; South Africa Interdepartmental Committee on Abuse of Dagga,
1952; Ames, 1958; Watt, 1961; Blumer, et al., 1967; Miller,
1968). </p>

<p>The available evidence bearing on these issues, however,
suggests that panic reactions rarely occur; that psychomotor
activity is more often reduced than enhanced following use; that
aggression rarely follows use, but when it does, it generally
occurs among individuals with histories of maladjustment,
emotional instability or impulse disorders (Bromberg, 1934, 1939;
Charen and Perelman, 1946; Ausubel, 1958; Bloomquist, 1968;
Grinspoon, 1971; Kaplan, 1971; National Institute of Mental
Health, 1972). </p>

<p>After a series of studies of marihuana and crime, Chopra and
Chopra (1939) concluded that if any relationship existed between
marihuana use and violent crime, it was an indirect one. They
stated that: </p>

<p><i>So far as premeditated crime is concerned, especially that
of a violent nature, hemp drugs . . . may not only not lead to
it, but they actually act as deterrents.... One of the, important
actions of these drugs is to quieten and stupify the individual
so there is no tendency to violence. . . . The result of
continued and excessive use of these drugs in our opinion is to
make the individual timid rather than lead him to commit a crime
of a violent nature</i> (p. 92). </p>

<p>Over the years, the conclusion of the Chopras has received
increasing support from many quarters of the research community
(Mayor's Committee on Marihuana, 1944; Maurer and Vogel, 1962;
White House Conference on Narcotic Drug Abuse, 1962; Murphy,
1963; President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice, 1967; National Institute of Mental
Health, 1970, 1972). </p>

<p>In the absence of possibilities for addressing the issue more
directly, several researchers have relied on statistical studies
and have sought to establish the overall and comparative
incidence of detected violent crimes among cannabis users. One
method has been to compile lists of violent crimes committed
during specific periods of time and to determine the proportion
of these offenses committed by cannabis users. </p>

<p>Lambo (1965) compiled a list of crimes occurring in three West
African countries during a recent two-year period. He claimed
that users of cannabis had committed 51% of the 73 murders, 31%
of the 263 cases of assault and battery and 26% of the 472 cases
against women. </p>

<p>Some have preferred to base their statistical studies on
samples of offenders (rather than lists of offenses) drawn from
the arrest or conviction files of law enforcement agencies.
Several researchers adopting this method are content to identify
the marihuana users in their samples and then simply report the
number of users charged with violent crimes or the proportions of
the total number of violent crimes perpetrated by the users. </p>

<p>The District Attorney of New Orleans, for example, testified
before the House Ways and Means Committee that of the 450 men
convicted of major crimes in 1930, 125 were identified as regular
marihuana users. Approximately one-half of the murderers and
one-fifth of those charged with assault, robbery or larceny were
said to be regular marihuana users (U.S. House of
Representatives, 1937: 23-24). </p>

<p>Bromberg (1939) reviewed the records of 16,854 offenders in
the psychiatric clinic of New York County's Court of General
Sessions during the period 1932 to 1937. Of the 67 marihuana
users identified, only six had been charged with violent crimes.
He concluded that there was no causal relationship between
marihuana use and aggressive crime. </p>

<p>Others go one step further and attempt to compare the users'
rates of violence with those of other selected populations such
as non-marihuana using offenders, offenders using other drugs, or
all of fenders in a given file. </p>

<p>Bromberg and Rodgers (1946) studied the civilian and military
criminal records of 8,280 convicted offenders at the United
States Naval Prison in Portsmouth, Now Hampshire between January
1, 1943 and July 1, 1945. Of the total number of offenders
investigated, 40 or .0048% were identified as marihuana users (23
used to excess, 10 were moderate users and seven were described
as light users). Of these 40, only two reported being more
aggressive while under the influence of marihuana than they would
be under normal conditions and three had been charged with
violent crimes (assault or striking an officer) while in the
military. Comparison of the users' criminal records with those of
40 randomly selected non-using prisoners revealed that the
non-user group had committed more aggressive crimes than the
users. </p>

<p>In conclusion, the researchers stated that: </p>

<ol>
    <li><i>There is no positive relationship between aggressive
        crime and marihuana usage in the Naval service; . . . </i></li>
    <li><i>. . . there is no significant causal relationship
        between aggressive crime in civilian life (of the naval
        offenders studied) and the use of marihuana . . . . </i></li>
    <li><i>Marihuana usage is but an aspect of some type of
        mental disorder or personality abnormality </i>(p. 826). </li>
</ol>

<p>Maurer and Vogel (1962) have stated a similar conclusion. </p>

<p><i>&quot;It has not been our impression from contact with many
hundreds of marijuana users that these people are violent
criminals; ... While there may be occasional violent psychopaths
who have used marijuana, have committed crimes of violence, and
who have, in court, explained their actions as uncontrolled
violence resulting from the use of the drug, these are exceptions
to the general run of marijuana users.... Marijuana is not
possessed of any mysterious power to force people to commit acts
which they would not otherwise perform </i>(p. 281). </p>

<p>Blum (1969) reviewed the data provided in 1966 by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation as part of its Careers in Crime Project.
The data showed that marihuana users did not differ significantly
from either heroin users or from all offenders (drug and non-drug
users) in their rate of violent crime relative to their total
non-drug offenses (28%, 26% and 26%, respectively). </p>

<p>There have been several statistical studies, also using
offender populations, designed to assess the degree to which
persons arrested for cannabis use have previous or subsequent
arrests for violent crimes. </p>

<p>Bromberg and Rodgers (1946) found that of the 40 offenders in
their sample identified as marihuana users, 12 had been charged
with previous offenses, three of them for assault. </p>

<p>Gardikas (1950) reviewed the criminal records of 379 persons
arrested between 1919 and 1950 for publicly using hashish. Of
these, 117 (31%) reportedly progressed from hashish use to other
crimes, about one-third of these subsequent crimes involving
violence or weapons. Gardikas stated that one subgroup of these,
offenders accumulated 420 offenses of assault, woundings,
threats, robberies, and manslaughter (p. 5). </p>

<p>In sum, these statistical studies based on samples of violent
offenses, violent offenders or arrested marihuana law violators
indicate that some individuals identified as marihuana users do
commit violent crimes, have committed them in the past and go on
to commit them in the future. </p>

<p>Their numbers, however, are generally small, both absolutely
and relatively. These studies therefore suggest a very weak and
insignificant statistical association between marihuana use and
violent crime which may itself be completely attenuated when the
proper statistical controls are applied. </p>

<p>These studies do not establish a causal relationship between
cannabis use and violent crime; nor do they permit an affirmative
response to the crucial question of whether the use of marihuana
alters the progression to violent crime at a significantly
greater rate than that which might be expected from some other
criminal subgroups, more representative samples of cannabis
users, or samples drawn from the general population. They also
fail to address themselves to the external conditions and
circumstances which might serve to mitigate the observed
relationships. </p>

<p>Several recent and more sophisticated empirical investigations
have addressed some of the critical questions left unanswered by
statistical studies of offender populations. Namely, they set
about to determine whether marihuana users in the general
population commit acts of aggression or violence significantly
more frequently than do nonusers; and whether any observed
differences between users and non-users may be more directly
attributable to extra-pharmacological (social, cultural,
psychological) variables than to the use of marihuana itself or
to the pharmacological action of the drug per se. </p>

<p>In 1965, Robins and his associates (1970) conducted a survey
of 20 black men born in St. Louis between 1930 and 1934. The
marihuana users in the sample were then compared with the
nonusers relative to their ratings on a &quot;violence
syndrome&quot; constructed by the researchers. </p>

<p>Respondents were rated high on the violence syndrome if they
reported having participated or felt like participating in three
or more of the following items, one of which was a judgment by
the interviewer that the respondent demonstrated hostility during
the interview: </p>

<p>1. Getting hurt in a fight. </p>

<p>2. Ever feeling like killing someone. </p>

<p>3. Ever hitting people when angry. </p>

<p>4. Being quick to lose one's temper. </p>

<p>5. Throwing or breaking things when angry. </p>

<p>6. Ever hurting someone in a fight. </p>

<p>7. Ever fighting with a weapon. </p>

<p>8. Getting mean when drinking. </p>

<p>9. Interviewer's observation of respondent's hostility. </p>

<p>The researchers found that those who had used marihuana during
adolescence were more likely to score high on the violence
syndrome than were those who did not use the drug for the first
time until adulthood; 31% of the respondents who had used
marihuana and no other drug during adolescence exhibited three or
more of these measures, 24% of those who used marihuana only but
started as adults scored high, 16% of the non-users were
classified as high on the violence syndrome, and 45% of those who
used marihuana and other drugs were so classified. </p>

<p>The researchers also found that users were significantly more
likely to report the, commission of &quot; adult person or
property offenses&quot; than were nonusers; 32 % of the nonusers,
48 % of the marihuana only adult starters, 56% of the marihuana
only adolescent starters, and 77% of the multiple drug users
reported committing crimes against persons or property as adults.
</p>

<p>Based on these data, marihuana users were said to be
significantly more likely to have exhibited violent behavior than
were nonusers. This conclusion, however, seems somewhat
premature. </p>

<p>First, upon the application of three &quot;pathological&quot;
controls (dropping out of school, alcoholism and involvement in
juvenile delinquency), the original relationship was reduced to
some unspecified extent; the researchers reported only that these
controls &quot;failed to completely wipe out&quot; the
statistical correlation. Secondly, several of the items would not
appear to be sufficiently discriminating in that large numbers of
people, whether drug users or not, have probably been quick to
lose their temper, hit people when angry (most parents, for
example), or felt like killing someone in a moment of anger. The
subjective nature of the last item the interviewer's observation
of hostility has already been noted. </p>

<p>Thirdly, neither the drinkers nor those who were multiple drug
users were isolated in the analysis, making it impossible to
determine whether or not the apparent relationship between
marihuana use and violence may have been a. function of these
other drugs rather than the marihuana. </p>

<p>Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the researchers found
several other &quot;pathological&quot; variables correlated with
the use of marihuana in their sample: (a) low income, (b) low
status jobs, (c) unemployment, (d) receiving financial aid, (e)
failing to graduate from high school, (f) fathering illegitimate
children, (g) marrying women who had been married previously or
who had children, and (h) drinking &quot;heavily enough to
create, social or medical problems.&quot; </p>

<p>Because none of these variables was controlled in the data
analysis (despite the fact that most of them have been found to
be significantly related to delinquency and crime and
characteristic of persons involved in delinquent, criminal and
drug subcultures), it is impossible to determine whether or not
any or all of these variables played a mediating role in the
observed relationship between marihuana use and antisocial
behavior in the, sample. As Goode (1972) has noted, the fact that
the three controls which were applied did reduce the
relationship, makes it likely that &quot;additional controls
would reduce the relationship even more, indeed, reduce it to
zero, if applied simultaneously&quot; (p. 13). </p>

<p>As such, although this study represented a significant step
forward in investigating the relationship between marihuana and
crime or violent behavior, its methodological limitations
preclude generalizations of the findings to the larger universe. </p>

<p>In a study of drug use among lower class minority group youth,
Blumer and his associates (1967) found that marihuana users were
much less likely to commit aggressive or violent acts than were
those who used amphetamines or preferred alcohol, and that most
of the marihuana using youths deliberately shunned aggressive
behavior and adopted, instead, a &quot;cool,&quot; non-violent
style. The researchers did find a small group of youths (termed
&quot;the rowdy&quot;) who were oriented toward aggressiveness.
Generally, these youths preferred alcohol over other drugs and
were found, for the most part, to have been raised in an
aggressive and combative social milieu. The researchers point
out, however, that most marihuana users in the sample were not of
the rowdy type, even though it is this small group which often
forms the basis of the public and police image of the youthful
marihuana user. In commenting on the role of marihuana in the
passage of youth from rowdy to a cool style, the authors note,
that the passage from the rowdy type to a cool and mellow
youngster, as it relates to the use of drugs, involves chiefly a
shift to the smoking of marijuana. . . . [The youngsters']
accounts and discussions also stress that the use of marijuana
both produces and symbolizes a &quot;mellow&quot; mode of conduct
that is opposed to that associated with rowdy behavior. They
place great weight on the &quot;socializing&quot; effects of
marijuana use, declaring that its use not only leads youngsters
away from violence but has the effect of changing them into
social human beings (p. 30). </p>

<p>In a large scale, systematic survey (questionnaire and
interview) of more than 1300 students at five West Coast colleges
and universities, Blum and his associates (1969) found that 19%
of the total sample had used marihuana but that 94% had used
alcohol. One, percent of the marihuana users reported fights or
other criminal behavior which they attributed to the drug. Of
those who used alcohol, 8% reported fights and 2% reported
offenses while under the influence of this drug. The researchers
make particular note of the fact that despite the increase of
marihuana use on these campuses since the middle and late
sixties, there has been no comparable increase in assaultive
crimes. </p>

<p>In a Commission-sponsored household survey of 15 to 34
year-old male residents of West Philadelphia, Goode (1972) found
that not one of the violent crimes, including &quot;forcing
sexual intercourse,&quot; was significantly correlated with
marihuana use. Among the five offense types showing a very weak
relationship to the use of marihuana, the only so-called violent
offense, &quot;hurting someone in a minor way,&quot; showed the
weakest association. The author notes that &quot;the statistical
differences in rates of offenses between users and nonusers rest
on adding together a small number of weakly correlated offenses.
. . . [They do not indicate] massive differences, or differences
indicating higher rates of classic, violent crimes among
users&quot; (p. 32a). </p>

<p>These more rigorous studies of the relationship between
marihuana use and violent crime suggest that marihuana users in
the general population do not commit acts of aggression or
violence significantly more frequently than do nonusers; that
marihuana does not heighten aggressive tendencies in most users
and may, in some cases, serve to reduce aggressiveness; and that
much of the observed relationship between marihuana and violence
is probably a function of social, cultural or psychological
variables such as multiple drug use, set and setting and
involvement in a criminal or drug subculture. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that marihuana use will cause or
lead to the commission of aggressive or violent acts by the large
majority of psychologically and socially mature individuals in
the general population. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>OPINIONS ABOUT MARIHUANA AND AGGRESSIVENESS: THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES<br>
</b></p>

<p>Several references have already been made to anecdotal case
histories, to the claims made and to the opinions formerly held
by a number of law enforcement authorities relative to the
relationship between marihuana use and aggressive behavior or
violent crime. A few systematic efforts have been made to explore
the current opinions and attitudes of law enforcement and
criminal justice officials. </p>

<p>Probably the first detailed survey of the opinions of police
officers was that conducted by a Stanford University law student
in 1968. Part of this unpublished study has been summarized by
Kaplan (1971) and is reprinted below. </p>

<p>Law enforcement agencies have continuously supported the
existence of a strong causal relationship between the use of
marijuana and acts of aggression and violence. In order to
determine the nature and basis for this belief, sixteen law
enforcement and narcotics officers were interviewed. The officers
selected for the interview from each pollee department were those
who spent the largest percentage of their time actually working
with marijuana users. When the department had several officers
working full time on narcotics, the officer In charge was
interviewed, on the supposition that as chief officer, he would
have the longest and widest range of experience with marijuana
users. </p>

<p>Of those interviewed, seven spent 100% of their time on
narcotics problems; three spent 75% to 100%; I spent about 50%;
and the remaining five spent 10% to 25%. All emphasized that of
their narcotics work, a major proportion of the time is spent on
marijuana problems. </p>

<p>The context in which the officers observe individuals under
the influence of marijuana is an important factor in evaluating
their observations. Only three had done stakeout work where
conduct could be observed while under cover. The remaining
thirteen officers had only encountered marijuana users in either
arrest or questioning situations. In response to the question of
whether they had opportunities for informal contact with people
using marijuana while off duty or in a social situation, the
officers uniformly answered, &quot;no.&quot; </p>

<p>The specific subject of this project, i.e. marijuana and
aggression, was never mentioned to the officers. They were told
only that I was interested in the marijuana question. The first
question which I asked was to briefly characterize, from their
per8onal experience and observations, the behavior of individuals
while under the influence of marijuana. During this original
description, 10 of the officers mentioned violence or aggressive
behavior as a common characteristic. The six other officers
didn't mention aggression as a distinguishing characteristic in
their original description however, in the next question, when
specifically asked if marijuana does lead to aggressive behavior,
all said that it did. </p>

<p>Every one of the officers pointed out the wide range of
conduct which they see exhibited by those that are
&quot;high&quot; on marijuana. They emphasized that how a person
reacts depends on his particular personality. As one officer
commented, &quot;Some individuals are very happy and to them
everything is beautiful, while others are always looking for a
fight.&quot; Six (6) of the officers emphasized how quickly they
can see one mood change into the other-at one moment docile and
passive, at another extremely aggressive. </p>

<p>A few of the officers commented that along with the direct
influence of marijuana, another important factor in aggressive
behavior Is the arresting situation. One officer, Lieutenant A of
the B Police Department, who has done quite a bit of stake-out
work as well as undercover investigation, pointed out that this
change from &quot;silly, joking, funny and talkative&quot; moods
to apprehensive and often aggressive postures is many times
precipitated by the realization that a law enforcement officer is
present. </p>

<p>Sergeant C of the D Police Department also felt the
&quot;arresting situation&quot; was probably the primary factor
in aggressive behavior reports about marijuana users. Sergeant E
also mentioned &quot;the approach of a known policeman&quot; as a
factor in the aggressive behavior which they see. However,
Sergeant E also estimated that one fifth </p>

<p>of the males, when under the influence of [marijuana] and when
aware that they are being arrested, will break and run or resist.
This he feels is a much higher percentage than for other types of
arrests. Similarly most of the officers did maintain that even
considering all other factors such as arrest, the marijuana was
the force in most cases which was responsible for the aggression
and violence. </p>

<p>Mr. F of the G County Sheriff's Office, however, maintained
that in the last few years, those arrested for marijuana offenses
have tended to resist arrest less often than previously. He
stated, &quot;They now feel they don't have to fight the officers
because of the laws-because of legalizing attempts, they feel
they don't have to fight, for they will have their day in
court.&quot; </p>

<p>Sergeant H of the I Police Department stated that recently
(within the last year) he has seen no aggressive reaction to
marijuana because of the extremely weak grades of marijuana now
available. He felt that the determinative factor in how a person
reacts while &quot;high&quot; is the strength of the grass
smoked. He reported that the grass they have recently been
finding has a very low resin content and its effects are merely
&quot;a quick stimulant followed by a depressed mood.&quot;
However, in another part of the interview, when discussing the
type of personality prone to using marijuana, Sergeant H
distinguished between those now smoking and the &quot;old
grasshead.&quot; These latter were, only &quot;Spanish-American
or criminals.&quot; Now, however, &quot;people without criminal
records are joining the ranks of criminals.&quot; This major
shift in the personality type now using marijuana, it would seem,
would be another factor leading to Sergeant H's observation that
the problems with aggressive reactions have decreased. </p>

<p>While all stated their belief that marijuana does lead to
aggressive behavior, it was in most cases very difficult to
elicit from the officers any specific instances where they
personally had observed an aggressive reaction to the use of
marijuana. Four (4) officers stated that they had never
personally seen someone aggressive under marijuana. They all,
however, had heard reports of such instances from other officers.
It should be noted also, that these four officers are from small
police departments located chiefly in middle class residential
areas. </p>

<p>Me officers who did cite specific examples of aggressive
behavior from their personal observations cited such conduct as
individuals who possessed marijuana fighting among themselves,
cases of resisting arrest, a [man] picking a fight in a bar,
beating one's wife, sexual promiscuity, stealing, reckless
driving, and carrying knives and guns. While citing this type of
example most officers emphasized the real difficulty in telling
when someone is &quot;high.&quot; Except for a few symptoms such
as red or dilated eyes, they have to make the judgment from the
general actions of the subject. When the subject is acting
peculiar and there is no alcohol, or they find marijuana in his
possession, then they assume he is &quot;high.&quot; </p>

<p>It was also difficult to limit these discussions solely to
marijuana. When asked for personal case histories, they often
recounted incidents of individuals who had also been using other
drugs or alcohol in combination with marijuana. The officers tend
to group all of the drugs together, and discuss them together in
generalities applying to all. One officer, from J County,
recounted as one of his -personal experience histories with
aggression and marijuana, a boy who went &quot;berserk&quot; on
Christmas day, and who finally had to be shot by the police. On
checking newspaper accounts, it appears that LSD was also
involved in the episode. </p>

<p>The officers all indicated that they have personally seen many
aggressive reactions to the use of alcohol. Most, however, did
not feel they could compare the frequency with that of marijuana.
Most deal mainly with narcotic problems and thus spend most of
their time with marijuana problems. The alcohol problems, and
specifically the aggressive or belligerent drunk, are handled by
the &quot;beat&quot; cops. </p>

<p>It was also difficult to limit the discussion to personal
experiences of the officers themselves. Many of them, when asked
for specific examples, went immediately to their desks for
reports and articles issued by other law enforcement agencies.
This it seems is a problem which developed because of the sample
chosen to interview. Because they were usually the most
experienced and the chief narcotics officers, most of them are
called upon to give speeches before PTA's, church groups, school
classes, etc. They all, therefore, were familiar with the
literature distributed by law enforcement.... </p>

<p>Three of the officers cited as proof of marijuana's danger a
recent distribution which pointed out that the &quot;death
penalty&quot; Is now imposed on marijuana offenders in Nigeria. </p>

<p>When questioned on passive reactions to marijuana, all of the
officers could think of personal encounters with people who were
&quot;high&quot; and who were decidedly passive and docile. Yet
only four of the officers included this trait in their original
characterization of behavior under marijuana. Eight of the
officers, however, in their original description of behavior
while &quot;high&quot; described some persons as
&quot;happy,&quot; &quot;funny,&quot; or &quot;giggly.&quot; </p>

<p>One question asked of the officers was aimed at
differentiating the aggressiveness (chiefly in terms of frequency
of resisting arrest) between those &quot;high&quot; on marijuana
and those arrested for sale or for possession. As mentioned
previously, the officers indicated that generally they have a
very difficult time distinguishing those who are
&quot;high.&quot; The officers interviewed generally work on
[arresting] pushers, and dealers. Their attention is usually not
drawn to individuals because of the particular conduct they might
be exhibiting, but rather because the individual is dealing in
marijuana. When pot parties where everyone is high have been
[broken up], Sergeant 0 of D reported that the places raided have
usually been on the peaceful side. Another officer, K, on the
narcotics detail in D, felt that users are usually &quot;very
easy to arrest. With others, such as pushers, and sellers,
however, officers have to -be more careful.&quot; Captain L of M
disagreed, however, maintaining that those under the influence
must be watched more closely and are usually more aggressive and
violent because of a lessening of concern for the consequences
and a lack of ability to make sound judgments. Deputy Chief N of
the 0 Police Department pointed out that In 0 at any rate, there
is a certain &quot;show&quot; which those arrested feel they must
put on; &quot;it is hard to separate this show from the effects
of the marijuana,&quot; Lieutenant P of the 0 Police Department
said his experience indicated that those under the influence had
to be watched closely. He has arrested people, [when they were]
&quot;high&quot; three of four times without incident; the fifth
time, however, he felt they might go wild. </p>

<p>In response to a question of whether they felt that some
persons smoke pot before engaging in crimes against property,
such as robbery, ten of the officers replied that they did
believe that this occurred often. Seven of these could cite
specific examples of people who had been picked up for stickups,
car thefts, etc. and who reported using marijuana beforehand to
bolster their courage, or sharpen their senses. However, the
other three of the ten had only heard of such conduct. The
remaining six officers answered that they did not think this was
common, and had never seen any examples. . . . </p>

<p>None (of the officers) believed however that marijuana was
responsible for any long-term effects resulting in aggressive
behavior. The relationship between marijuana and aggression, they
feel, is limited strictly to the period of time during which the
user is under the influence. In terms of long-range effects of
marijuana on aggression, the reactions of the officers confirm
that, if anything, there is a negative correlation. That is,
marijuana leads to nonaggressive, non-competitive, passive
conduct, when viewed in the context of chronic use. </p>

<p>Whatever limitations and qualifications one can cite regarding
the conclusions drawn by law enforcement officers, one thing
remains certain: they do believe that the use of marijuana leads
in a significant number of cases to aggressive behavior (Kaplan,
1971, citing Schofield: 110-115). </p>

<p>In seeking to present to the public as much information about
marihuana and its effects, from as many different sources and
approaches as possible, the Commission sponsored the design and
execution of two opinion surveys of the criminal justice
Community. In addition to soliciting their current opinions about
the relationship of marihuana to aggressive or violent behavior,
and to infer from them the extent to which their professional
experience with marihuana users may have changed over the years,
the Commission sought to determine the extent to which current
opinions and attitudes of the criminal justice community reflect
the growing body of empirical evidence on the subject. </p>

<p>To these ends, nationally representative samples of
prosecuting attorneys, judges, probation officers and court
clinicians were surveyed by mail. The questionnaires mailed to
these officials contained items relative to the relationship
between marihuana use and aggressive or violent behavior. The
results of these surveys show that more than three fourths of the
781 judges, probation officers and court clinicians responding to
a mail survey (InTech, 1971) regarded as either questionable or
&quot; probably untrue&quot; the statement that &quot;most
aggressive acts or crimes of violence committed by persons who
are known users of marihuana occur when the offender is under the
influence of marihuana. More than 60% however, regard as equally
questionable or untrue the statement that most such aggressive
acts or crimes of violence occur when the offender is not tinder
the influence of the drug but is attempting to obtain it or the
money to buy it. Table 3 shows the percentage of each of the
three groups of respondents answering in this manner. (InTech,
1971). </p>

<p>These figures give the impression that neither judges,
probation officers nor court clinicians are certain of the role
of marihuana in the commission of violent crime. Their tendency
to deny both statements suggests that at the least, the
relationship, to the extent that it does exist, is a tenuous one.

<p>Total 32.1 37.0 23.2 </p>

<p>In its survey of state prosecuting attorneys, the Commission
likewise found a tendency for these officials to deny a causal
relationship between marihuana use and aggressive behavior; 52%
of the respondents stated that they either did not believe or
were uncertain about the proposition that use of marihuana causes
aggressive behavior. Of those who did believe in a causal
relationship, however, two-thirds of the respondents' beliefs
stemmed front other than personal observation of aggressive
behavior exhibited by marihuana users. </p>

<p>These opinion surveys reveal that at least these members of
the criminal justice community have begun to reexamine their
earlier beliefs. The data suggest that, in their professional
experience, they have not found marihuana users to be aggressive
or violent to such an extent as to elicit strong and consistent
opinions about the causal relationship between marihuana use and
violence. <br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and Sexual Behavior</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Since the mid-1930's, Americans have, at one time or another,
either acclaimed or decried marihuana as an aphrodisiac, lauded
its ability to intensify and enhance enjoyment of sexual
experiences and accused it of heightening sexual aggression and
inciting the commission of sexual offenses. Even today, there is
no consensus among Americans regarding what they consider to be
the effects of marihuana on sexual desire, arousal and
performance. Rather, what evidence exists on the subject
continues to reveal the existence of diverse and often
inconsistent beliefs and experiences. </p>

<p>Society's concern about the effects of marihuana on sexual
behavior, however, does not generally center on the drug's
inherent ability to produce or heighten sexual arousal per se but
on the relationship between sexual arousal and the likelihood of
sexual excess on the part of the user. The key question is the
extent to which and the conditions under which marihuana acts as
a catalyst to sexual aggression, profligacy, promiscuity and
other aberrant sexual behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>MARIHUANA AND PSYCHOSEXUAL STIMULATION</b> </p>

<p>The numerous medical and clinical observations, experimental
investigations and survey studies reviewed by the Commission show
that the belief regarding the stimulant effects of marihuana and
the use of hemp drugs to achieve sexual arousal, the improvement
of sexual powers and the prolongation of coition have existed for
centuries and have be-en documented (Chopra and Chopra, 1939;
Bouquet, 1950; Robinson, 1967; Grinspoon, 1971) ; The proportion
of the population actually aroused sexually by marihuana,
however, is difficult to assess. Relevant research findings are
based on widely divergent research procedures, differing criteria
of arousal, and variations in the amount of arousal experienced.
Nonetheless, it is fair to state that marihuana produces
heightened sexual interest, desire and arousal in substantial
proportions of both male and female users (Bromberg, 1934;
Allentuck, 1944; Johnson, 1968; Goode, 1969; Hochman and Brill,
1971). It is equally accurate to state, however, that marihuana
does not increase and in fact may decrease sexual desire or
stimulation in significant proportions of users (Walton, 1938;
Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Taylor, 1963; Brenner, Coles and
Meagher, 1970; Goode, in press). At best, the available evidence
is inconclusive. </p>

<p>In a study of regular marihuana users conducted by three
physicians, for example, &quot;heightened sexual feeling&quot;
and &quot;increased sexual arousal&quot; while under the
influence of the drug were reportedly experienced
&quot;usually&quot; by one-third of the subjects (34%, and 33%,
respectively) and each of these effects was experienced
&quot;occasionally&quot; by 59% of the sample (Halikas, Goodwin
and Guze, 1971). </p>

<p>In another more recent study by physicians, &quot;increased
sexual appetite&quot; was reported by 60% of the chronic users
and 43% of the occasional users of marihuana. Responses to a
similar question regarding &quot;decreased sexual appetite,&quot;
revealed that 75% of the chronic users and 70% of the occasional
users reported that this never occurred (Hochman and Brill,
1971). </p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944) likewise attempted
to assess the effects of marihuana on sexual interest and sexual
stimulation. Its clinical studies of 72 male prisoners conducted
at the Welfare Hospital in New York City revealed that
&quot;although there was an undeniable increase in overt sex
interest following the ingestion of marihuana, . . . This sex
interest seems to have been due primarily to the fact that these
men have been imprisoned for various periods and had not had
access to women&quot; (p. 130). With respect to marihuana's
effect on sexual stimulation the Committee indicated that
although &quot;some evidence of eroticism&quot; was reported (in
about 10% of the 150 instances in which marihuana was
administered), there was no &quot;frank expression of sexual
stimulation&quot; despite the presence of female nurses,
attendants and others associated with the experiment (p. 38). </p>

<p>More recently, Professor Goode published the results of an
informal survey of about 200 marihuana users in which he inquired
about the relationship of marihuana to both sexual desire and
sexual activity. To the question, &quot;Do you think that being
high on marihuana stimulates your sex interest, or not?&quot;,
38% said that their interest in sex while high was no different
in degree from their normal interest in sex; 5% stated that being
high on marihuana had a negative effect, i.e., that &quot;it
tended to turn them off sexually&quot;; 13% replied that the
effect depended on either their mood, their partner or both; and
44% (39% of the men and 50% of the women) reported that it
&quot;definitely increases their sexual desire&quot; (1970: 162).
</p>

<p>Perhaps the most conclusive and consistent finding to emerge
from studies of the effects of marihuana on psychosexual
stimulation is that the degree of sexual interest, desire and
arousal induced by marihuana is dependent on the characteristics
of the user and the extent to which he comes to expect or
anticipate such an effect. Research shows that women are more
likely to report heightened sexual desire than are men (Goode,
1969) ; that young people more frequently report arousal than do
older persons (Bloomquist, 1968; Brenner, Coles and Meagher,
1970) ; 2 that frequent users are more likely to report increased
sex interest than infrequent users (Goode, 1970) ; that persons
who are more sexually experienced are more likely to be sexually
aroused by marihuana than are those less sexually experienced
(Brenner, Coles and Meagher, 1970; Hochman and Brill, 1971; Goode
in press) and that those who expect to be sexually aroused by the
drug are more likely to be so aroused than those who do not
(Goode, 1969; Fort, 1970; Grinspoon, 1971). </p>

<p>There is nothing inherent in the drug itself which produces
heightened sexual interest, desire or arousal, nor is there any
physiological evidence to show that marihuana directly or
specifically acts on either the, sexual centers of the brain or
the sexual organs. As one observer has noted, marihuana &quot;is
not a sexual stimulant; that is, in the, sense that it will not
excite mindless, laboratory-located animal tissue&quot; (Goode,
1969: 20). In short, marihuana is not an aphrodisiac. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>HOW MARIHUANA INFLUENCES SEXUAL RESPONSE</b> </p>

<p>It has already been stated that marihuana is not, in itself,
an aphrodisiac although a substantial number of persons report
increased sexual interest, desire and arousal following use of
the drug. To what, then, are these effects attributable? Research
hearing on this question suggests that to the extent that
marihuana influences these respouses, it does so indirectly by
acting on the higher centers of the brain to relax inhibitions
and reduce, the usual restraints on behavior. By so doing, the
user is placed in the position of being freer to respond to his
sexual needs and desires (Walton, 1938; Allentuck and Bowman,
1942; Ausubel, 1958; Brown, 1961; McGothlin, 1966; Rosevear,
1967; Bloomquist, 1968; Oursler, 1968; Goode, 1969; Fort, 1970).
The extent to which these responses occur, however, are dependent
upon individual expectation and knowledge (Fort, 1970) and the
social situation (set and setting) in which the marihuana use
takes place (Goode, 1969). As Professor Goode has stated, Man's
somatic responses are often influenced more by what he thinks
than by biological and chemical imperatives; in fact, it can
happen that what he thinks actually becomes his biological and
chemical imperative (1969, p. 20). </p>

<p>In addition to its effects on sexual inhibition and restraints
(the extent and consequences of which will be examined later),
marihuana is also reported to intensity aesthetic experiences and
to enhance sensual activity. As one observer has noted, it is
perhaps the principal effect of marihuana to take one more
intensely into whatever experience - .&quot; (Trocchi, 1967:
108). </p>

<p>One observer points out, however, that most of the users of
marihuana in this country are youths between the ages of 14 and
25 and that &quot;this age span needs no aphrodisiac to stimulate
either interest or capacity to perform&quot; (Bloomquist, 1968:
183). </p>

<p>It is this fact (which probably explains why substantial
proportions of marihuana users characterize their sexual
experiences under the influence of the drug as particularly
intense, prolonged, sensuous and pleasurable (Johnson, 1968;
Goode, 1969; Brenner, Coles and Meagher, 1970; Hochman and Brill,
1971; Tart, 1971; Abelson, et al., 1972). </p>

<p>In one study of marihuana users conducted by a psychologist,
65% reported a heightened sense of touch, 55% stated that
&quot;touch takes on new qualities,&quot; and 56% replied that
&quot;sexual orgasm was very often or usually more exciting than
when &quot;straight&quot;' (Tart, 1971). Of the approximately 500
marihuana users surveyed by Goode, 68% (74% of the men and 62% of
the women) reported that marihuana &quot;Generally acted as a
pleasure enhancer (and) usually increased their sexual
enjoyment&quot; (Goode, in press, pp. 8-9). </p>

<p>In still another study of marihuana users, both occasional and
chronic, &quot;increased sexual pleasure&quot; was the second
most common response, by the chronic users and the eighth most
commonly reported effect by the occasional users; 83% of the
former and 50% of the latter reported that increased sexual
pleasure was often or always experienced after smoking
marihuana.' Interesting too, was the finding that 85% of the
chronic users and 78% of the occasional users reported never
experiencing &quot;decreased sexual pleasure&quot; following use
of the drug (Hochman and Brill, 1971:7). </p>

<p>In the Commission's National Survey, respondents were asked to
indicate whether or not they believed that marihuana increases
sexual pleasure. Of those adults admitting they had tried
marihuana at least once (15%), 52% thought that the drug does
increase sexual pleasure. Both adults and youth in general,
however, seem to be less certain of this effect. Only about
one-fourth of all respondents (24% of adults and 26% of youth)
indicated agreement with the statement while slightly tinder
one-half of those surveyed (48% of the adults and 49% of the
youth) expressed uncertainty about marihuana's ability to
increase sexual pleasure (Ableson, et al., 1972: 25-33). </p>

<p>3 The students were also asked to assess the degree of
importance attached to a number of possible motivations for using
marihuana. As might be expected from the findings regarding
marihuana and sexual enjoyment, significantly more of the users
than the nonusers attached at least some degree of importance to
marihuana's perceived ability to enhance sexual experiences. To
the item: &quot;for better sexual experiences,&quot; 12% of the
non-users, 40% of the occasional users and 70% of the chronic
users felt that it was of some importance or &quot;very&quot;
important in motivating use of the drug (Hochman and Brill,
1971). </p>

<p>The research bearing on the effects of marihuana on sexual
pleasure suggests that marihuana is not usually perceived by the
general public to increase sexual enjoyment, that users are
significantly more likely to believe that marihuana has this
effect than are non-users, that those who expect to receive
increased sexual pleasure are more likely to experience it than
those who do not, and that frequent or regular users are
significantly more likely to have actually experienced this
effect than are those who use the drug less frequently. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA ON OVERT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR<br>
</b></p>

<p>As noted at the beginning of this discussion, society in
general and policy makers in particular are primarily concerned
about the extent to which and the conditions tinder which
marihuana is likely to generate or increase, the likelihood of
sexually aberrant or aggressive behavior. Marihuana has already
been shown to increase psychosexual stimulation in substantial
proportions of users and to serve as a relaxer of inhibitions and
restraints. The questions as yet unresolved, however, relate to
(a) the importance of sexual arousal in generating sexual
activity-particularly deviant sexual acts, and (b) the extent to
which inhibitions and restraints, which normally serve to protect
the individual and society from sexual excess and abuse, are
lowered by marihuana to the point of being inoperative. </p>

<p>The available evidence suggests that (a) although marihuana
users are more sexually active and sexually permissive than are
nonusers, marihuana does not generally stimulate sexual activity,
appreciably alter established patterns of sexual behavior or
serve as a catalyst to sexual promiscuity; (b) the marihuana user
is rarely sexually aggressive; and (c) persons arrested for
marihuana law violations generally do not have previous or
subsequent criminal records for the commission of sexual offenses
(Walton, 1938; Brown, 1961; White House Conference on Narcotic
Drug Abuse, 1962; Blunt et al., 1969; Bremner, Coles and Meagher,
1970; Goode, 1972; Goode, in press). </p>

<p>Before summarizing the research forming, the basis of these
assertions, however, it should be noted that there, are several
contradictory research findings with respect to (a) above. In one
recent study, for example, two Philadelphia physicians
investigating the effects of marihuana on adolescents and young
adults reported that the drug was directly responsible for sexual
promiscuity in 13 of their female patients. In the words of these
clinicians: </p>

<p><i>This group is singled out because of the unusual degree of
sexual promiscuity, which ranged from sexual relations with
several individuals of both sexes, and, sometimes, individuals of
both sexes on the same evening. In histories of all of these
individuals, we were struck by the loss of sexual inhibitions
after short periods of marihuana smoking. Seven patients of this
group became pregnant (one on several occasions), and four
developed venereal diseases. . . . In no instance was there
sexual promiscuity prior to the beginning of marihuana smoking. .
. . We take these results to indicate marihuana's effects on
loosening the superego controls and altering superego ideals</i>
(Kolansky and Moore, 1971: 491). <br>
</p>

<p>During 1970, another researcher (Goode, in press) distributed
questionnaires on drug use to between 500 and 600 undergraduates
in a large lecture course at a State University. Four measures of
sexual activity were employed: (1) engagement in premarital
intercourse, (2) the respondent's total number of different
sexual partners, (3) the age of first intercourse and (4) the
average frequency of intercourse during the six months prior to
the study. The three indices of drug use employed were whether or
not the respondent had ever smoked marihuana, the frequency of
marihuana use during the six months prior to the survey, and the
total number of drugs or drug types ever used by the respondent.
The researcher found that &quot;all measures of sexual activity
correlated significantly -and powerfully with all measures of
drug use&quot; (p. 12). More specifically, marihuana users were
far more likely to have engaged in premarital intercourse (72%)
than were non-users (34%) ; the greater the frequency of
marihuana use and the greater the number of drugs ever tried, the
earlier was the first intercourse, the greater was the frequency
of intercourse and the greater was the number of sexual partners.
</p>

<p>As the researcher suggests, one might be tempted to conclude
from these findings that marihuana, as well as other drugs,
causes early sex, frequent sex and sex with a number of different
partners were it not for the fact that similar findings point to
a relationship in the opposite direction. That is, not only were
marihuana users and drug experimenters more likely to experience
sex early in their lives, but &quot;it is also the sexually
precocious who are more likely to use drugs, including
marihuana&quot; (p. 14). Of all respondents reporting intercourse
by age 16, for example, 7% stated that they had never tried any
illegal drug, but total absence of illicit drug use was found in
47% of the virgins (p. 14). </p>

<p>Professor Goode concludes that &quot;using marihuana or other
illegal drugs no more 'causes' sexual behavior than sexual
behavior 'causes' drug use&quot; (p. 14). Rather, he suggests, </p>

<p><i>Both sexual permissiveness and marihuana use as well as, to
some extent, experimentation with certain other illegal drugs-are
indicators of the young person's involvement in and with a
subculture which is tolerant toward a wide range of
nontraditional values and activities . . . Quite clearly,
marihuana use grows out of a specific life style, which is, in
turn, partly dependent on specific sociocultural background
factors and permissive sexual behavior (branded as
&quot;promiscuous&quot; by those who disapprove of it) is a part
of this life style</i> (pp. 14, 16). </p>

<p>Similar to Goode's findings are those obtained from a mail
survey of 1400 undergraduate students at UCLA (Hochman and Brill,
1971). The data show that marihuana users have their first sexual
experience earlier than do non-users (50% of the users and 30% of
the non-users had their first experience before age 18) ; have
more sexual experience than non-users; have a greater number of
sexual partners than do nonusers (twice as many users as
non-users had five or more sexual partners) ; and have more
liberal attitudes toward sex than do non-users. </p>

<p>One of the questions asked of the students was: &quot;In your
experience or opinion, do you think that marihuana usage over a
long period results in sexual promiscuity?&quot; Over half of the
non-users (54%) and almost three-fourths (73%) of the users
believed this happened rarely or not at all while 12% of the
nonusers, 3% of the occasional users and 2% of the chronic users
believed that extended use of marihuana frequently leads to
sexual promiscuity. </p>

<p>Although the users more often suffered from venereal disease
than did the nonusers (7% vs. 2%), there were no differences
between the groups in the average frequency of sexual
intercourse, the number of concurrent sexual partners, the number
of pregnancies, miscarriages and illegitimacies, or the incidence
of homosexuality. </p>

<p>A more middle-of-the-road position regarding the association
between use of marihuana and sexual promiscuity was revealed in a
Commission sponsored mail survey of 781 judges, probation
officers and court clinicians (InTech, 1971). In an effort to
develop a profile of the regular marihuana. user, respondents
were asked: &quot;In light of your professional experience, do
you, think all, most, some or just a, few of the people who
regularly use marihuana are sexually promiscuous?&quot; </p>

<p>Tabulation of the responses revealed, among all three groups,
considerable uncertainty and ambivalence as manifested in the
findings that 23% of the total sample either did not answer the
question or stated that they did not know, and that three-fifths
of those who responded (70%) would answer no more categorically
than to say that only some&quot; could be characterized in this
manner. The percentages of each of the three groups of
respondents stating that all or most, some and few or none of the
regular marihuana users are sexually promiscuous are shown in
Table 4. </p>

<p>The Commission has found several studies dating from 1939
which support the assertions that the marihuana user is rarely
sexually aggressive and that he rarely has a criminal record for
the commission of sexual offenses. </p>

<p>A survey of the criminal records of 379 Greek offenders either
sentenced or arrested for the public use of hashish between 1919
and 1950 (Gardikas, 1950) revealed no link between the use of
hashish and the commission of sexual offenses. </p>

<p>Lambo (1965) compiled a list of crimes which occurred during a
recent two-year period in three West African countries. Of the
472 &quot;offences against women&quot; committed during the
period of study, 26% were claimed to have been committed by users
of cannabis. </p>

<p>In a, study conducted by the Kinsey Institute for Sex
Research, 1500 incarcerated sex offenders were interviewed about
their sexual offenses. The researchers found that in marked
contrast to the role of alcohol in the commission of their
offenses, particularly aggressive sex crimes, marihuana was a
very insignificant factor. While the presence of alcohol was
reported in relation to 67% of all sexually aggressive acts
against children and 39% of such aggressive acts against adult
women, marihuana was mentioned in only eight sexual offenses out
of a total of 2,022 such offenses committed by the respondents
(Gebbard, Gagnon, Pomeroy and Christenson, 1967: 761-819). </p>

<p>Two recent systematic studies of rape cases recorded by the
police in Philadelphia (Amir, 1971) and Denver (MacDonald, 1971)
gave no indication that marihuana was specifically linked to
these offenses. It should be noted, however, that the involvement
of marihuana in these cases, unlike the involvement of alcohol,
was not specifically explored.<br>
</p>

<p>Total (N=701) 21.3 59.6 19.1<br>
</p>

<p>In two Commission-sponsored studies of the relationship
between marihuana and crime, no evidence was found to suggest
that marihuana is a significant factor in or contributor to the
commission of sexual offenses. A study of 1,776 youthful
offenders (16 to 21 years of age) arrested for marihuana law
violations in five New York counties between 1965 and 1969
revealed that none of the offenders had either a previous or
subsequent criminal record for the commission of sexual offenses
(Weitzner, et. al., 1971). </p>

<p>In another study sponsored by the Commission, interviews with
559 male residents (16 to 34 years of age) of West Philadelphia,
revealed that six respondents, or about one in 100, admitted to
having committed the offense of &quot;forcing sexual
intercourse,&quot; three having reportedly committed it more than
once but none having been apprehended for these offenses (Goode,
1972; 29a). </p>

<p>In an effort to assess the role of marihuana in these
offenses, respondents were asked whether or not they had used the
drug within the 24 hours preceding the commission of both their
first and most recent offenses. In contrast to alcohol, which was
reported to have been consumed within 24 hours prior to one-third
of the first and most recent offenses of forcing sexual
intercourse (two out of six and one out of three, respectively),
none of the offenders reported smoking marihuana within 24 hours
of either the first or most recent time they committed this
offense (Goode, 1972: 29a). </p>

<p>Research findings which are available lend little support to
the thesis that marihuana either causes or is a significant
factor in the heightening of sexual aggression or the commission
of sexual offenses.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and (Non-Violent) Crime</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much that has been said with respect to aggressive behavior
and violent crime also applies to the more general proposition
that marihuana causes or leads to (non-violent) crime and
delinquency. The popular and professional literature abounds with
claims and counter-claims. Public and professional opinion
surveys demonstrate a widespread belief in the existence of a
marihuana-crime relationship but also reveal considerable
uncertainty about the existence of such a relationship. </p>

<p>The empirical evidence is somewhat more consistent. Laboratory
studies provide no evidence that marihuana produces effects which
can be interpreted as criminogenic. Although some studies of
offender populations purport to demonstrate a causal relationship
between marihuana and crime, they reveal, at the most, a
significant statistical association. Closer examination of these
data or more sophisticated analysis, however, generally shows the
purported relationship to be spurious. The original relationship
is usually found to derive not from the chemical effects of the
drug but from the operation of social and cultural variables
unrelated to either the drug or its use. </p>

<p>In the following pages the available evidence bearing on the
relationship between marihuana. and crime will be reviewed in an
effort to determine whether marihuana itself or the use of the
drug plays a significant precipitating or contributory role in
the commission of criminal or delinquent acts. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>PUBLIC AND PROFESSIONAL OPINION</b> </p>

<p>The formulation and expression of strong opinions about the
relationship of marihuana to criminal and delinquent behavior
have persisted despite the inherent complexities of the issue,
the relative absence of conclusive empirical evidence and the
general lack of knowledge and understanding about the effects of
the drug. For the most part, however, neither public nor
professional opinion about marihuana and its impact on public
safety has been explored in any systematic fashion. As a
consequence, public policy with respect to the drug has been
shaped by the most vociferous advocates of one position or
another at any given time. </p>

<p>Probably the first official body to explore prevailing opinion
about the relationship between marihuana use and crime was the
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission of 1893-1894. The Commission spent
over a year in making field trips to 30 cities, in receiving
evidence from almost 1,200 expert witnesses (335 of whom were
medical practitioners) and in reviewing judicial proceedings and
the case files from India's mental hospitals. The Commission's
Report, reprinted in 1969, contains the following information
gathered with respect to the relationship of marihuana use to
crime. </p>

<p>First, the Commission found that the majority of hemp drug
consumers were moderate rather than excessive users, and that the
drug users were rarely regarded as offensive or potentially
dangerous by their neighbors (a few objected to the smell of the
smoke or the example set by the users for the neighborhood
children). </p>

<p>With respect to the drug's possible long-term or chronic
criminogenic effects (producing &quot;bad characters&quot;), the
Commission reported that two thirds of the witnesses did not
believe that marihuana would produce, over time, a large
proportion of &quot;bad characters&quot; among the moderate
users. A majority felt that even excessive use was unrelated to
the production of &quot;bad characters.&quot; When the possible
relationship was framed more precisely in terms of cause-effect
rather than statistical association, a ratio of 8 to 1 of the
witnesses held that moderate consumption of these drugs had no
connection with crime and a ratio of 4 to 1 denied a causal
connection between excessive consumption and being a &quot;bad
character.&quot; </p>

<p>With respect to the more acute effects of hemp drugs, the
Commission set out to determine whether criminals use the drug to
fortify their courage prior to the commission of their crimes,
whether the drugs were used by criminals &quot;to stupefy their
victims,&quot; and whether the drugs incited the user to commit
unpremeditated crimes. The Commission's conclusion regarding the
first question was that &quot;criminals like any other consumers
of these drugs go to them for that assistance when they feel they
require it&quot; (p. 256). </p>

<p>To the second question, the Commission responded that although
some persons had alleged the commission of &quot;thefts of
ornaments from children stupefied by sweet meats&quot; containing
marihuana, the fact of other readily available, more effective
and more disabling drugs, considerably more conducive to
surreptitious administration, cast doubt on the use of hemp drugs
by criminals for this purpose. </p>

<p>To the third question, the Commission said that the majority
of witnesses saw no connection between either the moderate or
excessive use of hemp drugs and the commission of unpremeditated
crimes, including crimes of violence. The Commission therefore
concluded that &quot;for all practical purposes it may be laid
down that there is little or no connection between the use of
hemp drugs and crime,&quot; (p. 264). </p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944) also interviewed law
enforcement officers (federal, state and local police) about the
purported link between marihuana and crime. The Committee
reported that: </p>

<p><i>In most instances [the police officers] unhesitatingly
stated that there is no proof that major crimes are associated
with the practice of smoking marihuana. They did state that many
marihuana smokers are guilty of petty crimes, but that the
criminal career usually existed prior to the time the individual
smoked his first marihuana cigarette</i> (Schoenfeld, 1944:
14-15). </p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the results of a small,
unpublished survey of the opinions of police officers about the
relationship of marihuana to aggression (Schofield, 1968), All of
the respondents reported observing a variety of conduct exhibited
by users under the influence of marihuana and emphasized that an
individual's reaction to the drug depends on his particular
personality and, in some instances, the strength of the dose.
Some, respondents observed a recent shift in the type of
individual or personality prone to using marihuana. </p>

<p>In response to a question regarding the use of marihuana prior
to engaging in property crimes, 10 out of the 16 officers
interviewed believed that this often occurred. Seven cited
specific examples of offenders who reported using marihuana
before committing their offenses to bolster their courage and
sharpen their senses; the views of three rested on hearsay
evidence; and the remaining six officers responded that they did
not believe this was a common practice and that they had never
personally observed such examples. </p>

<p>In the Commission-sponsored National Survey of a
representative sample of more than 3,000 American youth and
adults (Abelson, et al., 1972), respondents were asked to
indicate their agreement or disagreement with the statement that
&quot;many crimes are committed by persons who show that 56% of
the adults and 41% of the youth agree with the statement. The
extent of agreement, however, varies significantly according to
age, education, geographic location and the marihuana-using
experience of the respondent. Those who are early adolescents
(12-13 years), over 25 years of age, have not completed high
school, live in the South or North Central regions of the country
and have no experience with marihuana are, significantly more
likely to agree with the statement than are those who are between
14 and 25 years of age, are at least high school graduates, live
in the Northeast or West and have had experience with marihuana.
Table 5 below, shows the percentage of respondents agreeing to
the statement according to age, education, geographic location
and experience with marihuana. </p>

<p>The survey also showed the existence of considerable
uncertainty with respect to the proposition that many crimes are
committed by persons under the influence of marihuana; 25%, of
the youth and 17% of the adults were either unsure of its
relative truth or failed to respond to the question (p. 69).
Adults were considerably more certain, however, about the
relationship between alcohol and crime (youth were not asked the
question) ; 7% were either unsure or did not respond and 69%
agreed with the statement that many crimes are committed by
persons who were under the influence of liquor (pp. 28, 31). </p>

<p>The surveys of prosecuting attorneys, judges, probation
officers and court clinicians also revealed considerable doubt
about the existence of a causal connection between marihuana and
crime. Although the survey of prosecuting attorneys conducted by
the Commission staff asked only about aggressive behavior and
violent crime, the data showed that 52% of the respondents either
denied or were uncertain that marihuana causes such behavior. </p>

<p>The Commission-sponsored survey of nationally representative
samples of judges, probation officers and court clinicians,
however, posed several questions bearing on the more general
proposition that marihuana is related to crime and delinquency
(InTech, 1971). Respondents were first asked whether or not they
had witnessed an increase in the incidence of drug or
drug-related offenses in their caseloads during the past five
years. The large majority of all three groups (86%) responded
affirmatively and reported that marihuana was the type of drug
most often seen in this connection (83%). However, about two
thirds of the respondents reported that marihuana offenders
(those arrested for using or selling marihuana) constituted less
than 20% of their caseloads; 56% of the respondents reported that
those arrested for non-drug offenses but incidentally found to
possess marihuana comprised less than 10% of their caseloads; and
73% of the respondents reported that less than 10% of their
caseloads attributed their offenses to marihuana (pp. 31, 34). </p>

<p>To determine better the nature and direction of a possible
relationship between marihuana use and crime, respondents were
asked to indicate which -of four statements most reflected their
own professional experience. On the whole, the respondents were
more likely to postulate a statistical association (36.6%) rather
than a direct cause-effect relationship (26.9%) ; 18% of the
respondents thought that involvement in a criminal or delinquent
subculture caused or led to the use of marihuana (in contrast to
the. more prevalent belief that marihuana use, leads to crime)
and 9.1% believed there was absolutely no relationship between
marihuana use and other criminal or delinquent behavior. The
extent to which uncertainty prevails even among these practicing
professionals is reflected in the 9.3% no response category (p.
39). </p>

<p>Table 6 shows the responses of the judges, probation officers
and clinicians to each of the four propositions (InTech, 1971:
Appendix 1, Section II, Question 3). The data show that judges
are significantly more, likely to believe that marihuana causes
or leads to criminal and delinquent behavior and significantly
less likely to believe in either a statistical relationship or in
no relationship whatsoever than either the probation officers or
the clinicians. </p>

<p>The researchers also attempted to determine these,
professionals' opinions about crimes actually committed by
marihuana users. More specifically, did the respondents think
that most non-drug crimes committed by persons who were known
users of marihuana occurred when the individuals were, actually
under the influence of the drug or when they attempted to obtain
it? Again, the responses indicated considerable uncertainty in
all three, groups. One-third of the, respondents were either
unsure or did not respond to either proposition. About twice the
number of respondents thought that the crimes occurred while in
the attempt to obtain marihuana (31.0%) rather than while tinder
the influence of marihuana (16.8%). </p>

<p>Table 7 shows the percentage of respondents indicating the
probable truth and probable nontruth of the two propositions
(Appendix 1, Section 11, Questions 2a, 2b). </p>

<p>The data show that half of the respondents denied the
commission of non-drug crimes while under the influence of the
drug, suggesting that marihuana itself does not have the capacity
to produce criminogenic effects. About one-third of the
respondents, however, believed that these crimes occur when the
user is attempting to obtain the drug, suggesting an addiction
model; that is, that users commit crimes to support a
&quot;habit.&quot;` </p>

<p>This interpretation is corroborated by the significant
findings that 65% of the respondents either did not know (23%) or
thought that a few (21%), some (17%) or most (4.4%) of the
regular users were physically addicted to marihuana<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>The National Survey of the general public (Abelson, et al.,
1972) likewise showed that large segments of the population (65%
of all adults and 48% of all youth) regard marihuana as
addictive. Even among the users, 40% of adults and 21% of the
youth believed marihuana to be addicting (p. 22) </p>

<p>These findings, taken together, suggest that much of the
confusion regarding the relationship between marihuana and crime
may be predicated on public and professional misconceptions about
the drug's addiction potential. The Commission's National Survey
showed that, among those persons who believed marihuana to be
addicting, 67.5% of the adults and 52.3% of the youth believed
that many crimes are committed by persons under the influence of
marihuana. Among those who said that marihuana was not addicting,
34.6% of the adults and 30.2% of the youth agreed that many
crimes are committed by marihuana users. Table 8 below shows this
relationship (unpublished data, Abelson, et al., 1972). </p>

</p>

<p>To summarize, these opinion surveys demonstrate that there is
considerable uncertainty about the existence and the nature of a
relationship between marihuana use and crime and that this
uncertainty exists among youth and adults, practicing
professionals in the criminal justice community and the lay
public, marihuana users and non-users alike. The data suggest,
however, that the persistent and fairly widespread belief in a
cause-effect relationship between marihuana and crime may, at
least in part, be predicated on the erroneous but equally
prevalent belief that marihuana is physically addicting. To the
extent that the general public operates under this misconception,
they may be more likely to believe that, like the heroin user,
the marihuana &quot;addict&quot; commits crime in order to
support his &quot;habit&quot; and obtain the drug. </p>

<p>The logical extension of this belief is that marihuana users,
like heroin user-,, will be considered more likely to commit
their crimes in the attempt to obtain the drug than while under
the influence of the drug. Stated another way, persons who
believe that marihuana is physically addicting would be more
likely to base the purported causal relationship between
marihuana and crime not on the chemical effects of the drug per
se but on the user's physical need for the drug. As such, they
would be more likely to postulate that most crimes committed by
users occur not when the offender is under the influence of the
drug (which, like heroin, makes one passive, lethargic and
stuporous) but when the, &quot;addict&quot; needs a
&quot;fix&quot; and is desperately trying to obtain the drug or
the money to buy it. This interpretation is, indeed, supported by
the findings of the Commission-sponsored survey of judges,
probation officers and court clinicians and is suggested from the
findings of the National Survey. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>STUDIES OF OFFENDER POPULATIONS</b> </p>

<p>Over the years, numerous studies have relied on offender
populations and zero-order statistical correlations to
&quot;demonstrate&quot; a cause-effect relationship between
marihuana and crime. This method of &quot; proof by
enumeration&quot; has become probably the most common approach to
&quot;demonstrating&quot; the purported causal relationship. </p>

<p>As Goode (1970) has noted, however: </p>

<p><i>Not even marihuana's staunchest supporter would argue that
a crime has never been committed by a user while high. Yet,
incredible as it seems, the burden of many proofs of marihuana's
criminal effects has been precisely the simple fact that it is
possible to locate crimes committed in conjunction with smoking
marihuana. &quot;Proof&quot; by enumeration is no proof at all.
By examining an enumeration of crimes which were committed under
the influence of marihuana (even were this definitely known), it
is impossible to determine the &quot; cause&quot; of the event
taking place, in this ease the crime-or, indeed, that marihuana
has anything whatsoever to do with its commission</i> (pp.
215-216). </p>

<p>Even if these studies are taken at face value, their findings
do not generally support the thesis of a positive and significant
statistical association. In most instances, marihuana has not
been found to predispose one to commit crime or to serve as an
initiator of criminal careers; nor does the use of the drug
appear to alter the progression to other non-drug offenses among
those without prior criminal records or histories of
psychological maladjustment. Predictably, however </p>

<p>the data do indicate a greater rate, of progression among
marihuana-using offenders (both those arrested specifically for
their marihuana offenses and those charged with non-drug crimes)
than that which might be expected from similar, non-using
offenders or from the general population. </p>

<p>Because these studies do provide at least interesting insights
into the possible nature and direction of a relationship between
marihuana and crime or, conversely, a non-existent relationship,
several of these studies are summarized below. </p>

<p>Bromberg, 1939. Between 1932 and 1937, Bromberg and his team
of researchers reviewed all cases eventuating in conviction by
New York's Courts of General and Special Sessions; conducted
interviews with about 17,000 drug and non-drug-using offenders;
and analyzed the statistics from both courts. The report of this
work, published in 1939, yielded the following information. </p>

<p>Among the 16,854 offenders convicted of felonies in the court
of General Sessions, 67 (.005%) were identified as marihuana
users. Of these 67, 46 (697c) had been convicted on charges of
possession with intent to sell; 16 (24%) were charged with
burglary, robbery and grand larceny; two persons were charged
with assault and one each was charged with petty larceny, forgery
and murder. </p>

<p>The researcher points out that in only nine cases did the,
offenders' criminal records commence with a drug charge,
&quot;indicating that there was not in those cases a close
relationship between drugs and the beginning of a career in
crime&quot; (p. 10). </p>

<p>In a 25% random sample of offenders convicted in the Court of
Special Sessions (misdemeanors), 135 or 9% were charged with
possession of marihuana. Of these 135, 93 or 69% had no previous
record, 8 had been charged previously with drug violations only,
5 had mixed drug and non-drug charges and 29 (21%) had only
non-drug arrests. In summary, the researcher stated that: </p>

<p>As measured by the succession of arrests and convictions in
the Court of General Sessions (felonies) . . . , </p>

<p><i>it can be said that drugs generally do not initiate
criminal careers. Similarly, in the Court of Special Sessions
(misdemeanors), only 8% of the offenders had previous charges of
using drugs and 3.7% had previous charges of drugs and other
petty crimes. In the vast majority of cases . . . then, the
earlier use of marihuana apparently did not predispose to crime,
even that of using other drugs. . . . The expectancy of major
crimes following the use of cannabis in New York County is small,
according to these experiences </i>(p. 10). </p>

<p>Bromberg and Rodgers, 1946. A study of 8,280 naval and marine
prisoners at the U.S. Naval Prison in Portsmouth, New Hampshire
(1946) revealed that 40 or .0048% of the offenders were marihuana
users. The offenses they committed while in the service were:
AWOL or AOL (32, or 80%), assault or striking an officer (3),
theft (3), and narcotics violations (2). Their previous civilian
offenses included three each of assault, theft and traffic
violations and one each of gambling and narcotics violations,
drunkenness, draft dodging, and violation of the Mann Act.
Twenty-eight or 70% of the marihuana users had no previous
civilian criminal records (p. 825). </p>

<p>The preponderance of psychiatric disorders in the user group
over the non-users (40 randomly selected non-using naval
prisoners) led the researchers to conclude that &quot;marihuana
usage is but an aspect of some type of mental disorder or
personality abnormality&quot; (p. 826), a conclusion also reached
by Charen. and Perchan 1946), Ausubel (1958), Andrade (1964),
Lambo (1965), Bloomquist (1968), Simmons (1969) and Grinspoon
(1971). </p>

<p>Gardikas, 1950. The researcher reviewed the criminal records
of &quot;379 individuals either sentenced or arrested flagrante
delicto for using hashish publically&quot; between 1919 and 1950.
More than half (55%) of these individuals were already known to
law enforcement authorities prior to their use of hashish and an
additional 14% had no subsequent difficulties with the law except
for hashish and vagrancy offenses. The researcher notes, however,
that the remaining 117 offenders (31% of the original sample)
went on to become &quot; confirmed criminals after their first
hashish arrest.&quot; </p>

<p>Dividing this last subgroup of 117 into three approximately
equal parts, Gardikas. then described the subsequent criminality
of each group. The first group was given 332 more sentences
following their first sentence for using hashish; 142 (43%) were
additional hashish offenses, a similar number were for violent
crimes or crimes involving weapons, 18 were for
&quot;insults&quot; and two were for &quot;high treason.&quot; </p>

<p>In a critique of the Gardikas study, Kaplan were accumulated;
mostly for hashish offenses (42%) and thefts (20%). Although
there were a small number of violent crimes subsequently
committed by this group of offenders, most sentences subsequent
to their initial hashish sentence were for such relatively minor
offenses as illegal gambling, living on immoral earnings,
&quot;false statements of identity,&quot; and &quot;fishing with
dynamite,.&quot; </p>

<p>The, third group discussed by Gardikas, comprised of those
&quot;who after having, made use of hashish became
criminals,&quot; accumulated 332 additional sentences. Hashish
offenses were again responsible for 30% of these offenses and
most of the rest were for theft. Gardikas notes with respect to
this group that although not all of these individuals were
criminal before they used hashish, their use of hashish
&quot;turned [them] into habitual hashish smokers and habitual
criminals with a, strong propensity leading toward crime of
dishonesty and particularly theft and f rand. At least one-half
of them surely and undoubtedly are even to be characterized as
dangerous idle, vagrants&quot; (p. 203). </p>

<p>In a critique of the Gardikas study, Kaplan (1971) has stated
that: </p>

<p><i>The basic problem underlying Gardikas' paper is his
conclusion that hashish use caused his subsample of 117 arrests
to become criminals. This assumes, first. that they had not
engaged in crime before beginning to use hashish and, second,
that it was the hashish use and not something else that turned
-them toward crime. Neither of these assumptions is justified by
the data. . . . As for the first assumption . . . all we know is
that they had not been arrested or convicted for other crimes
first. . . . The second assumption . . . is also impossible to
justify. Even if the members of the subsample had not previously
been criminals, it may very well be difficult to distinguish the
criminogenic effects of hashish from those of conviction and
sentence to Greek jails.</i> </p>

<p><i>Even aside from any criminogenic effect of the Greek penal
system, the figures may indicate only that once somebody has been
arrested for hashish-and probably served a term in jail as
well-lie is more likely to be picked up by the police when
further crimes are committed. Finally, the years from 1919
through 1950 . . . were a period of enormous social dislocation
[in Greece] . . . . It is obviously an almost impossible task to
sort out how much of the subsequent criminality in the subsample
was due to hashish use and how much to the social chaos that
prevailed in Greece </i>(pp. 103-104).<br>
</p>

<p>Andrade, 1964. The researcher retrospectively reviewed the
examinations of 120 patients sentenced between 1951 and 1960 by a
Brazilian Court to Heitor Carrilho insane asylum. Sentencing in
all cases was based on the allegation that cannabis was directly
responsible for their crimes. The researcher concluded that: </p>

<p><i>In the 120 patients examined, we did; not find any
criminogenic action that could be attributed to cannabis; ... In
the majority of cases examined (83), we found patients with
psychotic disturbances. . . . In the cases in which we did not
find mental disturbances, a total of 37, the crime attributed to
them was that of carrying or selling marihuana.... In the study
of the dynamics of the crimes of all the others, we saw that
there was a link between the crime and the illness, independent
of the use of cannabis</i> (Tinklenberg, 1971: 12). </p>

<p>Lambo, 1965. The researcher compiled lists of crimes occurring
over a, two year period in three West African nations and
recorded the number of offenders perpetrating these crimes. He
found that approximately one-fourth of the offenders had previous
convictions. Forty-seven percent of the 863 offenders convicted
for false pretenses, 61% of the 2,880 convicted burglars and 54%
of those convicted on charges of &quot;culpable driving&quot;
were said to have histories of cannabis use. Many of these users,
however, were also shown to have long histories of psychological
maladjustment (p. 10). The researcher suggests that &quot;the use
of cannabis enhances suggestibility in certain individuals, and
this may be a factor in the commission of crime, by these chronic
abusers&quot; (p. 11). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARIHUANA AND CRIME:</b> </p>

<p><b>AN EXPLANATION</b> </p>

<p>As indicated at the outset, enumerative studies of the crimes
committed by apprehended marihuana, law violators and non-drug
offenders identified as marihuana users cannot, by their very
nature, either prove or disprove a causal connection between the
use of cannabis and the commission of crimes; nor can their rates
of crime be projected onto the larger universe of marihuana
users. </p>

<p>As several researchers have pointed out, those individuals
apprehended for marihuana offenses represent only a. tiny
fraction of all marihuana users (Kaplan, 1971; Weitzner, et al.,
1971) ; likewise, those in other offender samples who are
identified as marihuana users represent only a small proportion
of the offender populations of which they are a part (Bromberg,
1939; Bromberg and Rodgers, 1946; Kaplan, 1971). </p>

<p>Although the data do indicate that some individuals identified
as marihuana users are subsequently involved in crime, both
drug-specific and non-drug offenses, they do not provide support
for the thesis that cannabis was the determining factor in their
criminal careers. Likewise, they fail to indicate that the rate
of progression to other crimes manifested by these offenders was
significantly greater than that which might be expected in either
a non-using criminal subgroup or the general population. </p>

<p>As Tinklenberg (1971) has stated: </p>

<p><i>The important issue is that unless one has systematic data
on the proclivities toward crime of the various subgroups of
marihuana users, one cannot answer the crucial question of
whether the use of marihuana alters the actual rate of crime
among these various subgroups over the criminality which would be
expected. At this time, it is unknown whether individuals with
these characteristics seek the use of marihuana or whether the
use of marihuana in any way contributes to the development of
these traits</i> (P. 24). </p>

<p>By reading between the lines of these enumerative studies,
however, one would be tempted to postulate that individuals with
certain psychological, social and cultural characteristics are
more likely to seek the use of marihuana, than is marihuana
likely to contribute to the development of delinquent or criminal
behavior patterns. </p>

<p>The number of researchers pointing to individuals with long
histories of psychological maladjustment or disturbances has
already been noted. Others have alluded to persons involved,
prior to cannabis use, in criminal or delinquent subcultures
(Blumer, 1967; Robins, et al., 1970; Kaplan, 1971; Weitzner, et
al., 1971). Still others suggest that marihuana use is more
likely to develop among persons living in underprivileged
communities or within a social structure that limits achievement
and advancement (Asuni, 1964; Blumer, 1967; Goode, 1972). </p>

<p>In recent years, considerable evidence has been gathered to
suggest that the use of other drugs and association with
drug-using friends are also likely to enhance the probability of
marihuana use (Hochman and Brill, 1971; Goode, 1972; Abelson, et
al., 1972). </p>

<p>Because many of these characteristics are likely' to be
associated with both criminal or delinquent behavior and
marihuana, use, some individuals have mistakenly concluded a.
cause-effect relationship rather than a statistical correlation. </p>

<p>The studies reviewed in the following pages axe probably the
most methodologically adequate assessments of the. purported
relationship between marihuana and crime undertaken to date. The
data show that the seemingly significant statistical correlation
often observed between marihuana, use and crime is spurious; it
is dependent not on the chemical effects of the drug but upon the
operation of several extra-pharmacological variables which have
little or nothing to do with the use of marihuana. per se. </p>

<p>The first of these studies (Goode, 1970) is based on a sample
of marihuana users. Because it, like the study by Robins and his
colleagues (1967, 1970) referred to earlier, involves a selected
population, the extent to which its findings can be applied to
the general population remains speculative. </p>

<p>The second study presented, a Commission sponsored survey of
young male urban dwellers, is probably the most adequate
assessment to date of the relationship between marihuana use and
crime. The results are based on a representative sample of the
general population of males, 15 to 34 years of age, the self
reports of criminal behavior have been cross-checked with
Philadelphia Police Department files; and numerous statistical
controls have been applied to the data. The study therefore
provides at least tentative answers to the following questions: </p>

<p>-Do young, male marihuana users and nonusers in the general
population differ significantly in the nature and extent of their
criminal activities? </p>

<p>-Is marihuana use, in and of itself, the principal determinant
of any observed differences? -If not, what are the variables
which explain a statistical correlation between marihuana use and
crime? </p>

<p>Goode, 1970. Between February and September of 1967,
face-to-face interviews were held with 204 marihuana users
residing in the New York City Metropolitan Area. The sample,
admittedly nonrepresentative, was drawn front membership lists of
drug-related organizations and also included friends and
acquaintances of the researcher. </p>

<p>The sample, suspected of differing to some unknown extent from
a random sample of marihuana users, can be characterized -as
primarily male (53%), young (median age 22 years), white (89.5%),
single (78%), middle class urban dwellers, including students,
dropouts, business people, housewives and the unemployed (p.
316). </p>

<p>All of the respondents, by virtue of their marihuana use,
possession or sale, had engaged in law violative behavior, but,
only nine marihuana arrests were reported. This finding indicates
that persons who are arrested for marihuana related activities
constitute only a small fraction of total marihuana users. </p>

<p>Because of their marihuana-related criminal activity, one
would expect that persons in this sample would have a higher
probability of being arrested than would the &quot;average&quot;
person from the general population. To determine if, in fact,
this might be the case, the researcher computed the rate of
arrest for his sample and compared it with the national rate of
arrest provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the
year 1965. Despite the fact that the rates are not strictly
comparable (the sample rate is based on arrests ever experienced;
the national rate is based on the number of arrests recorded for
one year), the similarity is striking. The national rate was
given as 3.7 per 100; the sample rate was computed to be 3.9 per
100 per year, 4.5 if one adds the marihuana arrests (p. 236). </p>

<p>Although the arrest, rates of the users and the general
population were found to be roughly similar, the types of crimes
committed by the users differed significantly from those crimes
recorded for the population as a whole. In contrast to the
majority of drunkenness and disorderly conduct charges noted for
the general population, the offenses of the users most often
resulting in arrest involved participation in political
demonstrations (19 out of the 55 arrests). No other single
offense attracted more, than a few arrests (p. 2335). </p>

<p>In addition to examining arrest rates and the types of
offenses committed, the researcher also investigated the
relationship between the amount of marihuana smoked and the
criminal behavior of the user. If it were true that marihuana did
produce a dangerous and criminogenic state in the user, the
greater would be his likelihood of committing crimes and of being
arrested. </p>

<p>The data, however, show no relationship; excluding the
&quot;political crimes&quot; (which were most common among the
least frequent smokers and least common among the most frequent
smokers), the &quot;serious&quot; crimes committed by 15
respondents (non-marihuana narcotics possession, disorderly
conduct, drunkenness, burglary, theft, assault, auto theft,
serving liquor to a minor and larceny) resulted in a total of 21
arrests. The heavy smokers did not commit these crimes
significantly more frequently than did the light smokers. </p>

<p>Similarly, there was no relationship found between the
frequency of use and the likelihood of arrest; three of the daily
smokers, three of those who smoked three to six times per week,
three who smoked one or two times weekly, one who smoked four
times monthly and three who were less than monthly smokers were
arrested for committing these &quot;serious&quot; crimes (pp.
237-38). </p>

<p>The researcher concludes that: </p>

<p><i>Although these numbers are extremely small, the fact of
their perfect dispersal is perhaps indicative of the lack of a
crime-inducing effect of the drug. It is, at any rate, a
proposition which ought to be tested more systematically in the
future with more complete data. For the moment, there are
indications that point to the fact that the marijuana smoker is
no more criminal than the rest of the population </i>(p. 238). </p>

<p>Goode, 1972. The Commission-sponsored Philadelphia survey set
out to resolve these issues. Goode (1972) analyzed the data
collected during August of 1971 from an interview survey of 559
15-to-34-year-old residents of West Philadelphia. </p>

<p>That part of the report devoted specifically to the analysis
of the data is presented in its entirety below. The only
deletions made were the author' references to previous studies
bearing on the issues addressed, the findings of which have been
presented earlier in this chapter. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Excerpts From </b></p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA USE AND CRIME* </b></p>

<p><b>PREFACE</b> </p>

<p>*Prepared by Professor Erich Goode for the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, January 15, 1972. The data on which
this report is based were obtained from a survey conducted by the
Institute of Survey Research of Temple University. All tables
referred to in Professor Goode's text are found at the end of
these excerpts. 'The interview schedule was developed and
executed and the data processed for the Commission by Temple
University's Institute for Survey Research, in Philadelphia.<br>
</p>

<p>The data analyzed in this report were gathered in August 1971
by the Institute for Survey Research of Temple University In
Philadelphia; the author of this report did not have a hand in
any phase of the data gathering, including constructing the
interview schedule, although he is solely responsible for the
data analysis. The sample consists in toto of males age 15
through 34 living in households located in a section of West
Philadelphia. Each respondent was interviewed; a total sample
size of 559 was collected. (The refusal rate was 10%, which is
typical for house-to-house surveys of this type.) The area in
which the sample was drawn is composed mainly of two
heterogeneous populations: lower-middle and working-class, high
school educated blacks, and college-associated whites-students
and professionals associated with [Drexel University and] the
University of Pennsylvania. About four respondents in ten in this
survey are black, and just over half are white. (The number of
Orientals and Puerto Ricans or Mexicans is too small to permit a
meaningful statistical analysis, so that when race is discussed
in this report, only the black-white comparison will be made.)
The racial composition is roughly equivalent to the census
figures for the sample area although no attempt was made, through
a weighting of cases, to &quot;correct&quot; any discrepancies
which might have prevailed in population composition. More
detailed information is available from the Institute for Survey
Research. </p>

<p>A quarter of the sample (23%) had never smoked marijuana; in
17 cases (3%), no information on marijuana use was given by the
respondent. Of the marijuana users the question asked about
frequency of use during the respondent's most recent year of
use-about 1 in 10 smoked marijuana daily or more, about 1 in 5
smoked approximately once or twice a week, 1 in 4 smoked once or
twice per month, on the average, and about 4 in 10 smoked
marijuana several times a year. (The study also asked how often
the respondent smoked marijuana in his first year of use a
variable which I have not made use of in this report.) Questions
were also asked concerning the respondent's use of other
drugs-&quot;stimulants or uppers, such as bennies, speed, or
dex,&quot; &quot;sedatives or downers, such as sleeping pills,
amytal or blues, or nembutal, or yellow jackets,&quot;
&quot;hallucinatory drugs, such as LSD, mescaline, or STP,&quot;
and &quot;hard drugs, such as heroin, morphine, demerol, cocaine,
or codeine.&quot; In addition, questions on one's friends' drug
use-both marijuana and these other drugs--were asked. </p>

<p>The commission of various offenses formed another segnient of
the questionnaire. There were 16 of them, and ranged from those
which would not be considered crimes in most instances-such as
&quot;disturbing people&quot;-to those which would be considered
felonies, drawing long prison sentences such :as rape, armed
robbery, and assault. As would be expected], the serious offenses
were committed (or admitted to) by very, very few respondents-and
thus, any comparison between users and non-users has to be made
mainly on the basis of committing trivial offenses.... </p>

<hr>

<p><b>III. THE EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA</b> </p>

<p>At this point, I will introduce the data from the Philadelphia
marijuana use and crime study, specifically mandated by the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. This survey's
data will form the bulk of the factual evidence on the
marijuana-crime connection in the report which follows. </p>

<p>The question of marijuana's relationship to crime and
aggressive behavior is obviously closely related to the drug's
effects. One of the most fundamental generalizations in
psychopharmacology to be obtained from thousands of recent
research efforts is that the same drug does not have standard and
invariant &quot;effects,&quot; but that effects are sensitive to
a number of extra-pharmacological variables, including the
personality of the user, the social setting in which drug, use
takes place, the user's past experience with the drug, his
expectations, and so on. Thus, it is elliptical and somewhat
artificial, and incomplete, to speak of any drug's
&quot;effects,&quot; as if they occurred under any and all
conditions, in all users. We should bear this qualification in
mind when looking at the relationship between the ingestion of a
drug and any subsequent behavior-with the latter supposedly
&quot;,Caused&quot; by the effects of the drug. Drug effects
vary, and, in addition, even standard effects do not
automatically translate into specific forms of human behavior.
Even opposite forms of behavior could follow the same effects,
given different individuals taking the drug, different settings
in which the drug is used, different definitions of the drug and
its use and so on.... </p>

<p>The data collected by the Philadelphia survey on the
subjective effects of marijuana dovetail precisely with those of
earlier studies. The effects agreed to by the users in the sample
are clearly inconsistent with aggressive behavior. This does not
mean that marijuana cannot be related to the commission of
criminal or aggressive acts-but it does suggest that the effects
of marijuana, per se, may have nothing to do with the commission
of crimes, especially violent crimes. Table 1 summarizes the
results from this survey's question on marijuana's effects, which
was: &quot;I am going to read to you some of the ways using
marijuana may affect people. For each could you tell me whether
marijuana had this effect on you almost every time, more than
half the time, less than half the time, or never or almost never,
when using marijuana.&quot; The effects asked about were related
to feelings generally thought of as criminogenic either in a
positive or a negative direction. Those that are generally
considered to be related to crimes deal with anger and
frustration, or with derangement, or with suggestibility. Those
inversely related to the commission of crimes and aggressive acts
dealt with relaxation and sleepiness. </p>

<p>As can be readily seen from Table 1, users overwhelmingly deny
that marijuana has effects on them which could be interpreted as
criminogenic or violent in nature. Nearly all respondents
specifically denied that aggressive feelings came over them
during the marijuana intoxication. When asked whether, under the
influence of marijuana, they had a feeling of wanting to hurt
someone, 96% said that this occurred never or almost never. When
asked whether they had feelings of wanting to do something
violent, 95% said never or almost never. Almost nine in 10 (88%)
said that they never or almost never felt more angry when high.
And almost eight in 10 (78%) said that they never or almost never
felt frustrated when tinder the influence. Thus, the
frustration-anger-aggressive impulse syndrome seems to be an
extremely rare phenomenon associated with the marijuana
intoxication. Likewise, the suggestibility syndrome does not
appear to be characteristic, although it seems to be somewhat
more common than aggressive feelings. About six in 10 (or 59%) of
the respondents said that they had a feeling of &quot;being more
willing to follow other people's suggestions,&quot; never or
almost never. And about three-quarters (77%) said that they had a
&quot;feeling of being able to do anything,&quot; never or almost
never. Those sensations, however, which would be seen as
inhibiting criminal and aggressive im pulses and acts were
decidedly more common, Exactly half of the respondents said that
they felt &quot;a feeling of relaxation&quot; almost all the
time. About a third (31%) said that they felt less angry than
usual almost all the time. About a fifth (22%) felt drowsy and
sleepy almost all the time-and another quarter (25%) felt this
more than half the time. </p>

<p>These data suggest-but do not demonstrate-that the effects of
marijuana per se are probably not related in any meaningful or
causal manner to aggressive or criminal acts. They give us a
clue, but do not prove, that in and of itself, marijuana use does
not &quot;cause&quot; the commission of criminal acts. In fact,
if we were to look at the subjective effects of marijuana
themselves, they appear to point in exactly the opposite
direction-they would seem to inhibit crime, indeed, activity of
all kinds. The effect of marijuana would be more in the direction
of reducing than stimulating aggressive, criminal or violent
activity. </p>

<p>Two final qualifications would appear to be in order before I
explore the marijuana-crime link more systematically and fully.
One has to do with the length of time that the marijuana
Intoxication lasts. Two facts bear on this issue. First, each
episode of use generally produces an intoxication which lasts
roughly three or four hours, at the most. Marijuana's effects
wear off about three hours or so after the user smokes the drug.
Secondly, from previous studies ... as well as the survey whose
data I am analyzing In this report, it is clear that the average,
or median, level of marijuana use Is roughly once a week. This
means that the typical marijuana user is under the influence
about three or four hours per week, or roughly 3% or so of his
waking hours, and under a &quot;normal&quot; state of mind the
remaining 97%. Now, it is possible that this tiny segment of time
would influence some users in some significant way, but the fact
of its briefness of duration ought to be kept in mind when
reasoning about the impact of the drug on the lives of users. The
daily user comprises roughly one marijuana user out of 10, and
the individual who is high all, or nearly all, of his waking
hours, probably constitutes about I or 2% of all marijuana
smokers. These facts cannot be ignored in our exploration of the
causal connection between the effects of marijuana and criminal
activities. </p>

<p>And the last issue I will raise in the marijuana effects topic
has to do with the truthfulness of the answers given by users. A
plausible objection to taking the word of users concerning the
effects of the drug on them would be that they are
untrustworthy-that they have a motive for lyIng, for portraying
the drug and their experiences in a positive light. Actually,
what nearly all researchers have found in an interview situation
with drug users is that they very rarely lie; in fact, their
honesty about themselves and their activities and experiences
appears to be the rule, overwhelmingly. . . . </p>

<p>The overall picture that we receive from . . . various studies
is that, like most interview subjects, marijuana users may
occasionally lie or hide the truth, but their answers will, in
general, be truthful. This does not mean that everything they say
must be taken at face value-as with any other group of
interviewees, anything which the researcher is capable of
checking independently, and which we have data on, we should
corroborate with what we learn in the interview situation. At the
same time, we would be as fallacious in assuming that everything
that marijuana smoker-, said to be true is suspect as if we
accepted everything they said to be true in all respects. What
all of this means is that we must reason with caution from
self-reported data, use them whenever we must, and check them
whenever we can. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>IV. CRIMES UNDER THE INFLUENCE<br>
</b></p>

<p>The Philadelphia survey on marijuana use and crime asked
several questions concerning 16 different offenses. The questions
began as follows: &quot;'Many people in every community commit
acts which others consider offenses, delinquent acts, and
violations. Here is a list of these acts.&quot; The specific
questions dealt with whether the respondent had ever committed
each one, how often, how old lie was when the offense occurred,
whether lie was caught by the police, and whether the respondent
had been drinking, or was under the influence of marijuana, 24
hours or less before committing the act-as well as whether the
respondent thought that using marijuana influenced him to commit
the act; these questions were asked about the first as well as
the most recent such of. fense, if they occurred. The offenses
were: hurting someone in a minor way, hurting someone badly,
carrying a knife. stealing a car, disturbing people, threatening
to hurt someone, taking money, stealing from a store, making an
obscene telephone call, forcing sexual intercourse with a woman,
breaking into a house or store, damaging property, buying stolen
property, setting off an alarm, carrying a gun, and using a
weapon to steal. From these facts, it might be interesting to
find out what proportion of acts involved some drug use occurring
within 24 hours-and whether that drug is alcohol or marijuana. I
will explain after the data are presented what these facts can
and cannot tell us. We must not be too hasty in reading too much
into any given set of data. </p>

<p>Table 2 presents summary information from this set of
questions. I have presented figures for only six offenses:
stealing from a store, damaging property, hurting someone in a
minor way, breaking into a house or store, stealing a ear, and
hurting someone badly. Some of the crimes asked about were
committed by so few respondents (such as forcing sexual
intercourse) that any statistical analysis would be completely
meaningless. Other offenses seem to be unrelated to the
aggressive syndrome associated with marijuana use-such as buying
stolen property. The six I have chosen are, in any case,
representative. Tile first three are relatively minor, and would
usually be classified by the law as misdemeanors; the second two
are considerably more serious, and would often be classified as
felonies. Table 2 presents the proportion who drank alcohol, and
smoked marijuana 24 hours or fewer before the crime was
committed; the figures in the first two columns are for the first
time the respondent committed the offense, and the second two
columns are for the most recent time, if it occurred more than
once. </p>

<p>What generalizations may we make front Table 2? </p>

<p>First of all, committing these crimes is atypical. Not one
these six offenses was committed by a majority of the sample.
Secondly the more serious the offense, the less likely it was to
be committed. Minor offenses were committed at least once by
between four and five out of every 10 respondents, but major
offenses had been committed at least once by something like one
respondent in 25. (And two of the offenses not in the table were
rarer still; forcing sexual intercourse was admitted to by six
respondents, or about one in 100, and using a weapon to steal was
reported by only three respondents, or one out of 200.) </p>

<p>What about drugs and crime? Compared with not being under the
influence, drugs tend to be atypical in the commission of crimes.
For none of these categories, whether first offense or most
recent, was being under the influence of either alcohol or
marijuana characteristic of over a quarter of all offenses, and
most are considerably below this. Most crimes here were committed
when the offender was not under the influence of any drug,
marijuana, or alcohol, when lie was in a &quot;normal&quot; state
of mind pharmacologically.* Secondly, in terms of absolute
incidence, alcohol is involved in the commission of crime
considerably more often than marijuana. Adding together all of
the offenses committed 24 hours before each drug was used,
alcohol had been used in conjunction with first offenses a total
of 47 times, and marijuana only five times-a ratio of not quite
ten to one. For the most recent offenses, alcohol was involved a
total of 66 times, and marihuana 19--a ratio of about three to
one. </p>

<p>In conjunction with this point, it should be stressed that the
classic, aggressive, violent crimes traditionally and
historically associated with the marijuana intoxication are very,
very rarely committed-by anyone, high or normal, user or non-user
alike. Six men in this survey admitted to forcing a woman to have
intercourse with him as a first offense, and three admitted to
rape more than the first time. In two out of the six first-time
cases, the offender said that he had been drinking 24 hours
before, and in one out of the three most recent-time cases,
drinking was involved as well. But in none of the six first time
cases, and in none of the three recent-time cases, had anyone
smoked marijuana 24 hours before. (None of the men had been
apprehended for this offense, incidentally.) Only three of the
men in the survey said that they had used a weapon to steal as a
first offense, and two admitted this offense more than the one
time-and none said that lie had either drunk or smoked 24 hours
before the offense. </p>

<p>*Several facts should he born in mind when considering this
generalization. First of all, the survey asked about the use of
each drug 24 hours before the offense was committed or less-and
hence, the respondent was not necessarily under the influence
when the offense was committed, although certainly many
respondents were under the influence at that time. Secondly,
anyone who uses marijuana is far more likely to become
intoxicated with each episode of use than is true of each episode
of alcohol use. </p>

<p>Considering the fact that the typical marijuana smoker in this
study had been intoxicated several hundred times for a total of
well over a thousand hours, and therefore in a state of mind
which, if the &quot;causal&quot; theory is correct, is aggressive
and criminogenic, then this almost total absence of violent and
aggressive crimes committed by users should be puzzling. This
fact indicates that the &quot;causal&quot; theory may be
inadequate and erroneous. </p>

<p>However, it is not possible to tell from Table 2 whether the
commission of crimes is more frequent for alcohol or marijuana on
a relative basis during the period of intoxication. That is, if
anyone wanted to know whether a thousand hours of a marijuana or
an alcohol intoxication was more like to result in the commission
of various crimes, this table would not convey this information.
Unfortunately, this survey did not ask a question on the
frequency with which the respondents drank alcohol or, indeed,
whether they drank at all so that an alcohol -marijuana
comparison cannot be more systematically made. It is entirely
possible that alcohol-related crimes are far more frequent than
marijuana-related crimes. simply because alcohol is still, even
in this sample, probably the drug of choice among young people,
and is more often used than marijuana (just as not being under
tile influence of any drug is more frequently involved with
crimes than being under the influence, simply because most
people, most of the time, are not intoxicated). As to which drug
is more &quot;criminogenic&quot; in the sense of what proportion
of the time under the influence of marijuana vs. alcohol one
commits various crimes cannot be determined from the data from
this study. However, in absolute terms, alcohol is considerably
more often used before crimes than marijuana. </p>

<p>Another generalization that may be made from Table 2 is that
the contribution of marijuana from first offense to most recent
offense grows somewhat relative to alcohol. That is, for the
first offense, alcohol is used before it about 10 times as
frequently as is marijuana, but for most recent offense, alcohol
is only three times as frequent. This probably is a reflection of
the following two trends: (1) Marijuana smoking is considerably
more frequent today (i.e., closest in time when the most recent
offense occurred) titan a few years ago (i.e., closest in time
when the first offense occurred), and hence, its frequency
relative to alcohol would be greater in conjunction with any
activity-criminal or non-criminal as well-simply because its use
is more common ; (2) Marijuana smoking is more common among young
adults (the age group most closely represented by the age when
last offense was committed) than among adolescents and
preadolescents (the age group most closely represented by the age
when first offense was committed) and, moreover, as age rises,
marijuana use rises faster than alcohol use rises, at least up,
until early adulthood. . . . </p>

<p>It is possible that, as marijuana usage increases, the number
of crimes committed under the influence of this drug may increase
as well. However, the question as to marijuana's direct
contribution to the commission of crimes, especially aggressive
crimes, is ail independent issue, and one in need of exploration.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>V. WHO COMMITS CRIMES AND WHO DOESN'T?<br>
</b></p>

<p>In this section, it is our job to explore two basic issues: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Do marijuana users commit crimes and offenses any more
        frequently titan non-users do? </li>
    <li>Are any variables with which marijuana use is strongly
        related also correlated with criminality? </li>
</ol>

<p>In the next section I will deal with a third question, and one
which is probably the most crucial one in this report: Can the
marijuana-crime connection be explained mainly by the use of
marijuana in and of itself, or is use itself dependent on third
variables which themselves explain the commission of offenses? </p>

<p>As the principal measure of committing crimes, this study has
employed the number of different types of offenses admitted to in
the 16 categories asked about. Naturally, there are many other
crimes not asked about, and, in addition, some of these crimes
would not correspond to the image most people would have of
&quot;classic&quot; aggressive offenses-such as &quot;disturbing
people,&quot; or receiving stolen goods. However, as a general
index or overall measure of criminality of different groups or
categories of individuals, this one is as good as any others that
have been employed, and is probably adequate for our purposes.
(The survey, it must be noted, did not ask questions about any
white collar crimes, which must be reckoned into an adequate
measure of output of criminal behavior-but these crimes do not
correspond with the public's image of aggressive crimes committed
under the influence of marijuana, and so their absence is less
relevant than would appear at first glance.) Throughout the
remainder of this report, the number of crimes and offenses will
be employed as the dependent variable-the outcome to be
explained. And throughout, I will be examining the
marijuana-crime connection-as well as other relationships-insofar
as it bears on file basic issue. </p>

<p>Before the analysis proceeds, it should be pointed out that of
the 16 offenses, not one of the violent crimes correlated with
marijuana use in any meaningful way at all, and a very weak
relationship was evidenced with only five of the
offenses-stealing from a store, buying stolen property,
disturbing people, damaging property, and hurting someone in a
minor way (the last of which showing the weakest association of
all). The statistical differences in rates of offenses between
users and non-users rest on adding together a small number of
weakly correlated offenses. When offense differences are
discussed, the reader should not hold the mistaken impression
that they indicate massive differences, or differences indicating
a higher rate of classic, violent crimes among users. With that
warning in mind, we may now proceed to user/non-user differences
in offenses. </p>

<p>The first relationship to be presented, then, is whether
marijuana users as a whole commit offenses any more frequently
than non-users as a whole. The answer is yes. I have employed two
indicators of marijuana use; one is frequency of marijuana use
during the period of most recent use (which may have been in the
past, or may be at present), and whether or not the respondent
has ever, or has never, used marijuana. Both indicators of
marijuana use correlate very powerfully with committing offenses.
For both tables, the differences are significant beyond the .001
level, employing Chi-square as a test of significance, which
means that the differences observed could occur at random only
one chance in a thousand. This is considered extremely
significant. There is a regular and step-wise relationship
between frequency of use and committing offenses; the more that a
given respondent smokes marijuana, the greater is the likelihood
that lie will have committed four or more offenses, and the lower
is his likelihood of committing no offenses at all. Over a third
(38%) of those who have never smoked marijuana said that they
committed none of the 16 offenses asked about-but this was true
of only one respondent in eight (or 12%) of the regular smokers.
At the other end, there was a 17% difference between non-users
and regular users (24% vs. 41%) in admitting to four or more of
these offenses. Tables 3 and 4 present these data in detail. </p>

<p>We would be remiss in our duties as sensitive and acute social
analysts if we ended the analysis there. The simple correlation
between marijuana use and offenses may very well mask important
and even more basic relationships buried beneath it. Marijuana is
correlated in a simple manner with the commission of crimes,, but
does it remain correlated when controls are applied? In other
words, is it a spurious relationship, or one which will remain
when crucial variables are held constant' Which-factors are also
related to the commission of offenses-which might actually
themselves explain the simple marijuana-crime connection? There
are several such variables-race, age, education, the use of other
drugs, and the respondent's involvement in the drug subculture.
Blacks are significantly less likely to use marijuana (64% of the
blacks in the survey said that they had tried marijuana, but 86%
of the whites said that they had done so), but slightly more
likely to admit to the commission of offenses--41% of all blacks
said that they committed four or more offenses but this was true
of only 25 ) % of all whites (see Tables 23 and 25). Does the
marijuana-crime correlation hold up for blacks and whites
separately? Age was also related to both offenses and marijuana.
The oldest respondents (age 29-34) were least likely to have
tried marijuana (61%), the youngest (15-20) were next least
(73%), and the intermediate age groups (21-23 and 24-28) were
most likely to have tried marijuana (82% and 80%). There was a
linear relationship between age and offenses, however. The
youngest group was least likely to have committed no offenses
(20%), and most likely to have committed four or more (42%) ; the
oldest group was most likely to, have committed no offenses
(35%), and least likely to have committed four or more (22%) (see
Tables 29-31). Thus, we would want to know whether marijuana and
crime still correlate in each age group separately. The same
thing can be said for education (Tables 26-28), the use of drugs
other than marijuana (Tables 11-16), and having friends who use
drugs (Tables 17-22)-the relationship between marijuana use and
crime could be mitigated or even transformed altogether if these
third variables are considered. One possibility is that the
marijuana-crime relationship is wiped out altogether with the
application of these controls-that is, that the relationship is
completely spurious. A second possibility is that the
marijuana-crime connection may be specific to some groups or
categories, but not others. And the third possibility is that the
same original relationship remains basically unaltered, or even
is strengthened, by the application of these controls. </p>

<p>Special attention ought to be paid to the drug-related
variables. There is a powerful and significant association
between the use of marijuana and the use of other drugs. Although
recent studies have presented evidence that this basic
relationship is probably not due to the effects of marijuana per
se, but to friendships and associations made in conjunction with
marihuana use . . . , the simple relationship between marihuana
and other drugs is a statistical fact. There is, in addition, a
strong and marked association with using drugs other than
marijuana and the commission of crimes. Thus, a legitimate
question to be explored is whether &quot;marijuana only&quot;
users have a greater crime rate than non-users, whether the
higher rate of the commission of offenses cannot be attributed
largely or solely to using drugs other than marijuana. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>VI. MARIJUANA USE AND CRIME: CAUSAL OR SPURIOUS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Our first clue as to the nature of the underlying relationship
between marijuana use and crime is obtained by examining Table 5,
which documents the association between number of offenses and
marijuana use, taking into account the use of other drugs as
well. Table 5 shows that &quot;marijuana only&quot; marijuana
users are only very slightly more likely to commit crimes than
non-users. Tire original nine percentage point difference between
users and non-users in committing four or more offenses has
shrunk to only two percentage points (in fact, only one
percentage point--we are comparing 24.4% with 25.5%, and the
original 19 percentage point difference between users and
non-users in committing no offenses has been reduced to 13
percentage points. In fact, the &quot;marijuana only&quot; user
is far more similar to the non-user in number of offenses
committed than he is to the user of marijuana plus two or more
other drugs. The application of the control involving other drugs
clearly attenuates the marijuana-crime relationship, and much of
the user-non-user differences in offenses committed can be traced
to the fact that marijuana users are significantly more likely to
use other drugs, rather than the use of marijuana per se.* </p>

<p>*The exploration of the &quot;escalation&quot; hypothesis-the
question of whether or not marijuana &quot;leads to&quot; the use
of other more dangerous drugs-would take us far afield in this
report. The issue is dealt with in a separate report by the
author prepared for the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse, however. </p>

<p>Our confidence in the lack of basic association between
marijuana use itself and offenses--and our ability to attribute
the simple original relationship to the use of drugs other than
marijuana-is strengthened when we examine the relationship
between frequency of use and offenses, holding the use of other
drugs constant. Table 5A presents these data. Among
&quot;marijuana only&quot; users, there is no statistically
significant correlation between frequency of use and the
commission of crimes--the differences are small, insignificant,
and in no consistent direction. Among users of one other drug,
likewise, frequency of marijuana use is extremely loosely
associated with committing offenses-the differences which are
observed are small, statistically insignificant, and point in no
particular direction. And lastly, among users of two or more
other drugs aside from marijuana, the association between
frequency of marijuana use and the commission of the offenses
described earlier is loose and not at all significant. Table 5A
very strongly indicates the validity of the &quot;spurious&quot;
model. </p>

<p>Closely related to the use of other drugs is a control which
should be explored: the respondent's involvement with a
drug-using subculture-with others who also use drugs. Naturally,
as we saw in the last section, individuals who use marijuana tend
to have friends who also use marijuana. What we would like to
know is whether the social patterns they exhibit can be traced to
their use of the drug. or to the fact that they have friends who
use drugs. Thus, we should be very interested in looking at the
individual who uses marijuana, but who does riot have drug-using
friends, as well as the individual who does riot rise marijuana,
but has drug-using friends. If interesting changes take place in
the original marijuana-crime correlation, then we have
indications that it is the individual's social relations, and not
his rise of marijuana, per se, that determine marijuana use's
correlation with crime. Tables 6 and 7 deal with this issue; they
should be examined in conjunction with one another. </p>

<p>Among respondents with no marijuana-using friends (out of
their 10 closest friends). as well as those with no drug-using
friends at all. almost an identical relationship between
marijuana use and crime obtains as in the original Table 3.
Marijuana users are, significantly (but not strikingly) more
likely to commit four or more offenses, and significantly less
likely to commit none. The percentage differences in Tables 6 and
7 are almost the same (even slightly more) as those in Table.
3-about 25% at the &quot;none&quot; end vs. 19% for the original
table, and about 18% at the &quot;four or more&quot; end vs. 9%
for the original table (Table 3). If we were to rely only on
these segments of the table, we would be led to the, inference
that marijuana is meaningfully related to the commission of
crimes. </p>

<p>However, an extraordinary thing happens to the other segments
of the table: among those with drug-using friends, there is no
relationship at all between marijuana use and committing
offenses. The differences are so small as to be statistically
insignificant. (And they are actually in the opposite
direction-non-users are slightly more likely to commit four or
more offenses than users are.) In other words the marijuana-crime
relationship is completely wiped out by the application of
controls-in this case, integration into the drug-using
subculture. We are led overwhelmingly to the conclusion that
marijuana users tend to be somewhat more likely to commit crimes
solely because they are part of a drug-using subculture; the
actual properties of marijuana appear to be completely
unassociated with criminal behavior. Anyone (whether he uses
marijuana or not) who makes friends and becomes involved with
others who use drugs-especially others who use drugs in addition
to and aside from marijuana stands a higher likelihood of
committing offenses, simply because this segment of the
population tends to be more lax about obeying the law. It is
merely because marijuana users tend to associate with others who
are part of this subculture that their crime rate is somewhat
higher. In other words, the marijuana-crime relationship-in terms
of the causal or effects model is completely spurious. </p>

<p>What of the marijuana-using isolate? What of those who use
marijuana but who have no friends who use drugs-either marijuana
or other drugs? How can we explain the fact that the original
difference in offense rate between users and non-users were not
wiped out among those without drug-using friends-in contrast to
being wiped out among those who had drug-using friends? Looking
back at Tables 6 and 7, we are struck by the fact that the
offense rate of the marijuana-using group without drug-using
friends is as high as the groups with drug using friends. What
does this indicate? First of all, involvement with a drug-rising
subculture is clearly not the only determinant of a high rate of
committing offenses. Probably something else is at work. The fact
that the offense differences wash out among those involved with
the drug subculture indicates that rise by itself (i.e., being
high) cannot be a factor in the original marijuana-crime
relationships difference cannot explain two things that are
similar. The using isolate, however, is probably a (Qualitatively
different social being from those who either do not rise, or
those who use and have friends who also use. The isolate is
probably deviant in a variety of ways crime being one of them.
The fact that he uses in spite of having no friends who use
(although lie may have friends who do not use) means that he uses
most of the time alone. has not integrated his activities into a
social life or a subculture, and probably pursues some activities
which the dominant society would judge to be eccentric and
unusual. In other words, it is possible that his involvement with
crime is related to his social isolation from a group which
pursues drug activities similar to his own, rather than his use
of marijuana. However, these remarks must be regarded as
speculation, since more complete information is not available. </p>

<p>A related process occurs when race is employed as the control
variable. Among blacks, the original relationship remains intact;
marijuana users are significantly (although not markedly) more
likely to commit four or more offenses, and less likely to commit
none, than is true of non-users. (The relationship is significant
at the .004 level, using Chi-square.) However, among whites, the
original relationship is completely washed out; users are not at
all more likely to commit offenses. Table 8 presents these data.
The minor differences can be completely accounted for by random
fluctuations; the relationship is not significant at any level. </p>

<p>When education is treated as the control variable in this
relationship, the marijuana-crime connection follows a pattern
parallel to the two previous explorations-that is, it is
completely washed out for some groups, but remains for others. In
Table 9, we see that marijuana users who have at least attended
college, but not graduate school, are not any more likely to
commit offenses than college non-users. The percentages
committing four or more crimes, and those committing none, are
almost identical for users and non-users alike. (The differences
are insignificant, and due to random fluctuation.) However, among
respondents with only a high school education, the same basic
relationship produced in Table 3 is upheld: marijuana users are
significantly more likely to have committed offenses than
non-users. However, at least two variables are compounded here,
since most respondents with a college education are white. Thus,
the retainment of the original marijuana-crime correlation among
high school education respondents, and its wash-out among college
educated respondents, should not come as any surprise. However,
among respondents with at least some graduate school education,
the original relationship asserts itself; users are more likely
to commit offenses than non-users. (The differences observed are
significant at the .05 level; in other words, the differences
have a one in 20 chance of occurring purely at random.) Table 9
presents the marijuana-crime relationship, holding education
constant. </p>

<p>Using age as a control variable also produces mixed results.
Among the two youngest age groups (15--20 and 21-23), the
differences obtaining between users and nonusers are
statistically insignificant, and could have occurred by chance
alone; in the youngest of these two groups, the non-user is
slightly more likely to have committed four or more offenses, and
in the next to youngest of these groups, the user is slightly
more so--but in both, the differences are too small to be
meaningful. In the 24-to-28-year-old group, the differences
approach statistical significance, but they are not substantial
(.07 level of significance, using Chi-square). However, among the
oldest group (age 29 to 34), the same basic difference in
offenses as obtained in the original relationship holds up here;
users are about twice as likely to have committed four or more
offenses as non-users (28% vs. 13%), and less than half as likely
to have committed no offenses (21% vs. 58&amp;). These data
appear in Table 10. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>The central effort in this report has been to determine
whether marijuana use, in and of itself, is meaningfully and
causally related to the commission of crime. Two models have been
used in the past to answer this issue: the causal model, which
holds that using marijuana, being under the influence of the
drug, actually does stimulate the will to commit antisocial acts,
and the spurious model, which holds that marijuana use is merely
a reflection of independent and more powerful forces, and that in
itself, marijuana use is unrelated to criminal and aggressive
behavior. Some small amount of research has been conducted in the
past on this issue, but no consistent findings have been turned
up; . . . It is because of these factual lacunae that the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse mandated a study
of marijuana use and crime, which culminated in the Philadelphia
survey, as well as this report. </p>

<p>The findings from this study strongly support the view that
marijuana, use by itself is not related in any meaningful or
systematic fashion to criminal behavior, that marijuana use
probably does not &quot;cause criminiality. The
&quot;spurious&quot; model appears to be a far more accurate
description of the marijuana-crime connection than does the
&quot;causal&quot; model. The use of marijuana per se is probably
completely unrelated to criminal and aggressive behavior. The
drug does not &quot;cause&quot; any significant number of users
to commit crimes, or aggressive or violent behavior. The effects
of the drug seem to be, from what can be gathered from the
available data on the question, without criminogenic causality.
This does not mean that it is not possible to commit crimes,
including aggressive crimes, under the influence of marijuana-but
that being high does not increase one's probability of doing so,
that on an hour-for-hour, crime-for-crime basis, there are
probably no significant differences between being intoxicated on
marijuana and being &quot;normal,&quot; not under the influence
of any drug. </p>

<p>A wide variety of data have been brought to bear on the
marijuana-crime issue. </p>

<p>First of all, regarding the subjective self-reported effects
of marijuana, all indications are that the effects classically
described as being related to aggressive behavior and the
commissions crimes-feeling angry, frustrated, wanting to -hurt
someone, being willing to follow any and all suggestions of
others, being deranged, wanting to do something violent-have no
empirical support whatsoever; users consistently describe these
&quot;effects&quot; as non-existent or as extremely rare and
atypical, no different from normally. In fact, precisely the
opposite is the case: if anything, the effects of marijuana would
have far more to do with reducing the criminal
&quot;impulse,&quot; whatever that might be, due to the fact that
they tend to be in the direction of relaxation, feeling calm, of
not wanting to move about, feeling somewhat drowsy, sleepy.
Activity of any sort tends to be inhibited by the marijuana
intoxication. </p>

<p>Secondly, the Philadelphia survey asked the respondents about
using marijuana and/or alcohol 24 hours or less before various
crimes were committed. Marijuana very rarely figured into the
commission of crimes in any way. For only a tiny minority of all
crimes committed was the respondent under the influence. This was
especially the case for serious and aggressive crimes. Alcohol
was far more likely to be used soon before criminal activity than
marijuana. - </p>

<p>The third type of information brought to bear on the
marijuana-crime question was the self-admitted offense rate of
users versus non-users. The total number of different types of
crimes which respondents said that they had committed was
compared. The simple relationship between using marijuana and
committing offenses was positive and statistically significant,
and there was also a high correlation between frequency of
smoking marijuana and committing offenses. However, a wide range
of other variables, themselves related to both crime and to
marijuana use, were also correlated-race, education, age, the use
of other drugs, and having drug-using friends. Thus, the issue
became: is it the causal connection with these third variables
which produces the marijuana crime simple correlation, or does
the correlation hold up even when these factors are controlled?
In other words, which is right, the causal or tile, spurious
model? Is marijuana use merely dependent itself on larger,
broader, more potent factors-or does it exert an independent
power? Do users commit crimes more frequently than nonusers
because they use marijuana or because they happen to be the kinds
of people who, would have a higher crime rate, marijuana or no
marijuana. </p>

<p>The evidence from these three-variable tests support the
&quot;spurious&quot; model. The control tables show that the
differences in crime rate between users and non-users is, in most
cases, dependent not on marijuana use per se, but on these larger
factors. The fact that the relationship disappears, or is wiped
out, when some controls are applied shows that the
marijuana-crime connection is dependent on sociological
variables, and not chemical effects. When the use of other drugs
was held constant, the marijuana-crime correlation was severely
attenuated, and in some cases, washed out entirely. When the
variable of having friends who use other drugs-both marijuana as
well as stimulants, sedatives, hallucinogens and &quot;hard
drugs&quot; was applied, the relationship disappeared among those
with drug-using friends, but not those who had no drug-using
friends. When race was held constant, the marijuana-crime
connection was wiped out completely among whites, but not blacks;
among white marijuana users, their crime rate was not
statistically different from non-users, but black users did have
a higher crime rate than non-using blacks-similar in magnitude to
the original relationship. When education was used as a control
variable, we saw that among college-educated respondents, the
marijuana-crime correlation was nonexistent, but it remained
among respondents with a high school education, and for those who
had attended graduate school. And lastly, age was applied as a
control. Among the youngest groups, the marijuana-crime
relationship was attenuated, but it remained somewhat strong
among the two oldest age categories. </p>

<p>If there were truly a causal relationship between marijuana
use and crime, these disappearing correlations would not occur.
The application of sociological variables cannot wash out a
chemical reaction in the user. The enormous variability dependent
on social factors indicates that marijuana effects do not
inherently produce behavior of a criminal nature. The kinds of
people who use the drug tend to follow Patterns of behavior
regardless of whether or not they use marijuana. By itself,
marijuana, use is not a potent producer of behavior, and
certainly not criminal behavior. Individuals who commit criminal
acts are those who would do so with or without the use of
marijuana. </p>

<p>The data from this study support-the conclusion, almost
without qualification, that marijuana use does not cause criminal
behavior.* </p>

<p>*A subsequent regression analysis with the six variables used
independently as controls showed that when all six variables are
applied simultaneously, the use of marijuana in and of itself
accounts for less than 1% of the variance in committing offenses
(personal communication by the author, 24 January 1972).<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Summary and Conclusions: Marihuana and Crime</h1>

<hr>

<p>The Commission's review of the available evidence bearing on
the relationship between marihuana use and criminal, aggressive
and delinquent behavior has yielded the following information. </p>

<p>The once prevalent belief among the general public and the
professional law enforcement, criminal justice and research
communities that marihuana causes crime, violence, aggression and
delinquency has moderated appreciably over the years. Recent
evidence indicates that increased attention has been devoted,
instead, to a possible statistical correlation rather than a
cause-effect relationship. </p>

<p>At present, however, considerable confusion and uncertainty
exists among both the general and professional publics, among
youth and adults, and among marihuana users and non-users about
the relationship between marihuana and criminal, aggressive or
delinquent behavior. The confusion and uncertainty stem from a
general lack of knowledge and understanding about the effects of
the drug, including its potential for physical addiction. Many
persons are still under the misapprehension that marihuana is
addicting and that crimes are committed in order to support a
drug &quot;habit.&quot; </p>

<p>In general, recent changes in public and professional opinion
have corresponded with and reflected the increased use of
marihuana, particularly within the middle class segment of
society; more direct observation of and professional experience
with the marihuana user; new and more enlightened information
about the drug and its effects; and concomitant changes in the
public image of the user. </p>

<p>There is no systematic empirical evidence, at least that drawn
from the American experience, to support the thesis that the use
of marihuana either inevitably or generally causes, leads to or
precipitates criminal, violent, aggressive or delinquent behavior
of a sexual or nonsexual nature. </p>

<p>Laboratory studies of effects have revealed no evidence to
show that marihuana's chemical properties are, by themselves,
capable of producing effects which can be interpreted as
criminogenic; that is, that marihuana is an independent cause of
criminal or aggressive behavior. If anything, the effects
observed suggest that marihuana may be more likely to neutralize
criminal behavior and to militate against the commission of
aggressive acts. </p>

<p>The research community has recently gathered considerable
evidence to show that marihuana and criminal, aggressive and
delinquent behavior are statistically and significantly
correlated when measured together in isolation from variables
which are related to marihuana use and other forms of antisocial
behavior. The data also show, however, that this statistical
association either attenuates significantly or disappears
completely when the proper statistical controls are applied. </p>

<p>In other words, the observed relationship between the, use of
marihuana and criminal, violent, aggressive and delinquent
behavior is spurious. It is dependent on such
extra-pharmacological factors as the age, race and education of
the user; the type of community in which he lives; his past
history of psychosocial maladjustment; and his involvement in a
criminal or delinquent subculture (use of other drugs; drug
buying and selling activities; associations with friends who also
use, buy and sell cannabis or other drugs). </p>

<p>To reiterate what Professor Goode has so cogently stated, </p>

<p><i>If there were truly a causal relationship between marihuana
use and crime, these disappearing correlations would not occur.
The application of sociological variables cannot wash out a
chemical reaction in the user</i> (1972:52). </p>

<p>To put it still another way, to believe that marihuana causes
criminal, violent, aggressive or delinquent behavior is to
confuse the effects of the drug with the people who use it. </p>

<p>From the perspective of marihuana's relationship to antisocial
behavior of a criminal or violent nature, the drug cannot be said
to constitute a significant threat to the public safety. If its
use, therefore, is to be discouraged, it must be discouraged on
grounds other than its role in the commission of criminal or
violent or delinquent acts. </p>

<p>The enormous increases in marihuana arrests over the past
several years are ample evidence that the police have taken
seriously their role of maintaining law and order with respect to
marihuana use and that they have responded to public pressure and
concern about the increase in marihuana use. Yet, in their
experience with the marihuana user they have been placed in the
unenviable position of having to enforce a law either disregarded
or discredited by large segments of the population they serve. </p>

<p>Over and over again they have seen their efforts in this
respect negated by the de jure or de facto modification, if not
nullification, of the laws against possession by prosecutors,
judges and even legislators. Their increasing frustration and
demoralization, therefore, at least with respect to the marihuana
user, is quite, understandable. </p>

<p>These other officials, however, are likewise placed in a
difficult position; for they, too, must enforce and apply the
criminal law, and they, too, must respond to public pressures and
concerns. In some instances, they have demonstrated particular
resistance to criminalizing the user and subjecting him to
criminal penalties which are deemed to be unwarranted if not
unwise. </p>

<p>In the case of marihuana, recent changes in law enforcement
practices with respect to the user have, in fact, reflected the
increased use and public tolerance of marihuana. The statutory
changes now taking place at the state and local levels are
further evidence of the trend toward greater public acceptance of
the user. In these instances, the laws and their enforcement were
altered because they no longer performed the symbolic function of
expressing society's disapproval of marihuana use.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and Driving</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States Department of Transportation has estimated
that in 1970, more than 111 million Americans were licensed
drivers and that there were approximately 109 million vehicles
registered and regularly traversing America's streets and
highways. The Commission-sponsored National Survey (Abelson, et
al., 1972) has revealed that approximately 21 million or 15% of
all American adults 18 years and over have tried marihuana and
that about 6.9 million adults currently use the drug. </p>

<p>At the present time, there is no reliable estimate of the
proportion of marihuana users who drive while &quot;high,&quot;
but America's tragic experience with highway accidents and
fatalities involving persons driving under the influence of
alcohol raises serious questions about the extent to which
marihuana impairs driving skills and performance and thereby
constitutes a public safety hazard on this nation's
thoroughfares. </p>

<p>In recent years, public safety experts, along with the medical
and scientific communities, have devoted increasing attention to
the effects of any mind-altering drug on driving, but there is as
yet little evidence to inform discussion. As part of its more
general concern with the impact of marihuana on public safety,
the Commission has reviewed the available research and has
concluded that the evidence which presently exists is, at best,
inconclusive. </p>

<p>In view of this finding and prior to a rather brief summary of
the knowledge we now have, the Commission feels compelled to urge
the public to consider these findings as only tentative, to adopt
an extremely cautious attitude about the effects of marihuana on
driving skill and performance, and perhaps most importantly, to
avoid driving at all while under the influence of any
mind-altering drug or intoxicant. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE </b></p>

<p>The literature on drugs and driving contains several
references to the role of drugs, including marihuana, in traffic
violations, accidents and fatalities. They differ considerably,
however, in the nature and extent to which they influence or
affect driving behavior (Waller, 1965; Chetta, 1967, Commission
on Narcotic Drugs, 1968; Third Triannual Congress on Traffic
Accidents, 1969; Waller, 1970; Klein, Davis and Blackbourne, 1971
National Institute of Mental Health, 1972). </p>

<p>The studies examine the relationship between marihuana and
driving and tend to be either statistical and enumerative with
regard to traffic accidents or experimental with respect to the
physiological and psychological effects of marihuana use deemed
to be related to driving skill and performance. All of them
suffer to one degree or another from an overabundance or dearth
of extraneous variables and have, therefore, precluded
generalization of the results and the production of conclusive,
and valid findings. </p>

<p>The difficulty in interpreting the data gathered from
statistical or enumerative studies of traffic accidents derives
primarily from the inability to isolate precise cause. There are
no tissue, urine or blood analysis methods currently and
systematically in use outside the laboratory, similar to those
available for alcohol, for determining the presence of marihuana
in the bodily fluids of drivers. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Statistical Studies</b> </p>

<p>The statistical or enumerative studies generally can be
characterized as two types. In the first type, samples of
arrested marihuana, or other drug law violators are selected and
their traffic violations or accident rates are compared with
those in the general population. In the second type, samples are
drawn initially from lists of persons known to have committed
traffic violations or been involved in traffic accidents. The
samples are then divided into persons who in some way are
identified as marihuana users and those who are not and the
incidence of traffic violations or accidents in the two groups is
then compared.5 </p>

<p>5 Dr. E. J. Woodhouse, a chemist, is now in the process of
developing a marihuana testing method. At the present time he
reports being able to detect the presence of marihuana by
analyzing urine samples (Polak, 1971). </p>

<p>Waller (1965), compared the crash rates per unit miles of
driving of known marihuana users with those of other drivers of
similar age distribution. He found that the crash risk was not
increased by the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>A similar study yielding similar results was performed in the
State of Washington (Crancer and Quiring, 1968). There were no
significant differences in the crash rates per 100 drivers
between those who did use marihuana and those who did not. The
researchers compared the driving records of persons arrested for
illegal drug use (100 narcotics users, 123 dangerous drug users
and 79 marihuana users) with those of 687,228 licensed drivers
living in the same general driving environment (King's County,
Washington). Comparisons were made of the number of accidents,
the number of violations and the type of violations accumulated
between January 1, 1961 and October 1, 1967. </p>

<p>All three drug using groups had significantly higher accident
and violation rates than did the comparison group matched for age
and sex; the accident rate for the marihuana users was 39%
higher; for the narcotics users, 29% higher; and for the
dangerous drug users, 57% higher. The violation rates were 180 %
higher, 149 % higher and 16% higher, respectively. </p>

<p>Table 9 below shows the percentage of marihuana users and
county drivers, by sex, with none and 10 or more traffic
violations and accidents between January 1, 1961 and October 1,
1967. </p>

<p>Since the majority of the users were first arrested for their
illegal drug use in 1964, the researchers compared their
violation rates before and after that time. The data show a
violation rate of 1.78 per marihuana driver prior to 1964
(January 1, 1961 to June 30, 1964) ; the rate increased to 3.44
per driver between July 1, 1964 and October 1, 1967. For the same
time periods, the county group's violation rate per driver
increased from 0.4-4 to 0.53. </p>

<p>The violation rates for both reckless and hit-and run driving
were significantly higher for the marihuana users than for the
county comparison group. </p>

<p>In short, these data suggest that marihuana users are much
more likely to have many violations and accidents and are much
less likely to have clear accident and violation records than are
a comparison group of drivers drawn from the same general
population. Them findings are difficult to interpret more
precisely, however, because Such variables as the number of miles
driven and overall driving experience were not taken into
account. </p>

</p>

<p>A survey of 12,453 Virginia high school students was conducted
during 1970 by the Virginia Highway Safety Division (Ferguson and
Howard, 1971). The objectives of the survey were to determine the
extent of drug use in the Virginia high school population and to
assess the number of traffic crashes which could be caused by
drug-impaired drivers. </p>

<p>The data, show that 2.9% of the sample reported experiencing,
either as a passenger or driver, at least one traffic crash in
which drug use &quot;could have been a causal factor.&quot; The
data also show that the students were more likely to attribute
the crashes to marihuana (54%) than to other drugs (46%). Use of
marihuana was found to be slightly more common than was the use
of other drugs among drivers involved in non-fatal collisions but
was used with equal frequency in those drivers involved in fatal
crashes (p. 31). </p>

<p>The researchers suggest as an explanation for their findings
the fact that marihuana. usage was greater among this population
(12.3%) than was the use of other drugs (7.7%). This explanation
is not completely adequate, however, in that the survey ignores
both the possible presence of alcohol along with marihuana and
other drugs, either separately or in combination. As such, it
cannot be said that marihuana causes more accidents than do other
drugs, including alcohol. </p>

<p>Klein, Davis and Blackbourne (1971) surveyed students at four
academic institutions in Florida in an effort to assess the role
of marihuana in traffic involvements. Respondents were divided
into five groups of marihuana users: (a) non-users, (b) previous
users, (c) using less than four times a month, (d) using four to
eight times per month, and (e) using more than eight times per
month. For each group information was obtained relative to the
frequency of alcohol and tobacco use; respondents' ability to
judge speed, time and reaction time; traffic involvements; and
license revocations. In addition, respondents were asked their
opinion about whether or not persons under the influence of
marihuana should be permitted to operate aircraft and various
other vehicles, including taxis and private automobiles. </p>

<p>With respect to traffic involvements, the data show that 18%
of the infrequent users and 53% of the frequent users reported
having been stopped by the police while under the influence of
marihuana. The data also show that as the frequency of use
increases, so too does the number of license revocations. </p>

<p>As Nichols (1971) has pointed out, however: </p>

<p><i>Apparently no attempt was made to compare the number of
times they were stopped while under the influence of marihuana as
opposed to the number of times they were stopped while not under
the influence. Thus, the data do not give any indication of
whether the violations were due to the effects of marihuana or
whether they were the result of poor driving habits in the first
place</i> (pp. 28-29). </p>

<p>Both experimental and quasi-experimental approaches to
assessing the effects of marihuana on driving suffer from
methodological shortcominogs and inconsistent results. The
primary deficiency in the experimental investigations lies in
their inability to hold constant the numerous external variables
which actually affect driving behavior and which, therefore,
precludes valid comparisons of actual driving performance with
that simulated in a controlled but unrealistic environment. In
the quasi-experimental studies using interviewing techniques, the
accuracy of self-reports becomes a question which must be raised
with respect to the, effects of marihuana on driving skills and
performance. </p>

<p>The data derived front these studies, however, suggest that
marihuana does interfere, at least in some users, with the
ability to judge time, speed and distance ; with reaction time;
and with the ability to control the vehicle and respond to an
emergency situation (Zinberg and Well, 1969; James, 1970- Hochman
and Brill, 1971; Klein, et al., 1971). </p>

<p>Data from a survey of 10% of the undergraduate students at
UCLA (Hochman and Brill, 1971) show that one-third of all
marihuana users drive, occasionally while &quot;high.&quot; Of
the chronic users, 42% drive frequently while high and 10% always
drive while &quot;stoned&quot; (p. 22). </p>

<p>According to the researchers, &quot;both (marihuana) users and
non-users were universally of the opinion that (marihuana)
'intoxication' affected driving, but users thought, that they
compensated by being more cautious, driving more slowly, and
concentrating on the driving,&quot; (p. 22). The researchers also
report that as usage of marihuana becomes more chronic,
&quot;fear&quot; and avoidance of driving while intoxicated
decreases and the ability to compensate for the drug's effects
increases. </p>

<p>With respect to traffic violations, the data show that 4% of
occasional and chronic marihuana users had received traffic
tickets when they were intoxicated by the drug but that none had
been discovered to be intoxicated at the time. </p>

<p>These findings corroborate those, from an earlier study
(Zinberg and Weil, 1969) in which the researchers stated that
&quot;users appear to be able to compensate 100% for the
nonspecific effects of ordinary doses of marihuana on ordinary
psychological performance&quot; (p. 39). In another report Weil
(1969) wrote that &quot;it appears that once a person becomes
accustomed to the effects of cannabis, he, can compensate fully
for the drug's influence on performance of tasks of ordinary
complexity.&quot; (p. 6). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Experimental Studies </b></p>

<p>Controlled laboratory experiments have attempted to measure
these and other effects on driving with greater specificity.
Manno and his associates (1970) found that there are significant
impairments of motor and mental performance attributable to
marihuana. </p>

<p>In an experiment conducted by Frank and his colleagues (1971),
marihuana smokers demonstrated &quot;a marked and very consistent
increase in the amount of time required to recover from glare . .
. This ranged up to four times as long with a mean peak of almost
twice as long (171%) after smoking marihuana. . . . Furthermore,
this increase in glare recovery time persisted for several
hours&quot; (p. 9) and did not seem to be dose related. </p>

<p>These researchers did not find significant differences between
marihuana users and nonusers, however, in pulse, rate, time
estimation or dilation of the pupils. </p>

<p>With respect to marihuana's effect on emotional reactions, Dr.
S. E. Miller (1959) suggested that &quot;these drugs (Including
marihuana) have similar abilities for changing normal emotional
reactions, even causing individuals to become oblivious or
indifferent to their surroundings&quot; (p. 864). Klein and his
colleagues (1971), however, urge against generalizing these
findings from the laboratory situation to the complex task of
actual driving. </p>

<p>Crancer and his coworkers (1969) conducted a study designed to
determine the effects of a &quot;normal social marihuana
high&quot; on simulated driving performance among 36 experienced
marihuana smokers and compared the effects they discovered with
those occasioned by alcohol use. </p>

<p>The researchers found that experienced marihuana users under
conditions of a &quot;normal social marihuana high&quot; (from
two cigarettes totalling 1.7 grams of THC) accumulated
significantly more speedometer errors than under control
conditions. No significant differences were found, however,
relative to accelerator, brake, signal, steering or total errors
in simulator scores. </p>

<p>Comparing the effects of alcohol (at a blood level of
0.10%-the legal limit of intoxication) and marihuana intoxication
(1.7 grams THC), the researchers concluded that moderate
intoxication by marihuana was less detrimental to simulated
driving performance than was the presence of alcohol at the 0.10%
blood level. The mean error scores were 84.46 for the control
group, 84.49 for the marihuana group and 97.44 for the alcohol
group (p. 6). </p>

<p>There have been several criticisms leveled at this study,
however, and several researchers have cited contradictory
findings. Frank and his associates (1971) have pointed out the
fact that the subjects did not have, complete control over their
simulated drive. </p>

<p>Kalant (1969) noted that &quot;it does not follow
automatically that lack of effect of a drug on the simulated task
will correlate with lack of effect on the actual task&quot; (p.
640). He also criticized the use of dissimilar doses of marihuana
and alcohol for the comparison and in this regard stated that
&quot;the finding that a heavy dose of alcohol caused more
impairment than a mild dose of marihuana is neither surprising
nor helpful in assessing the relative effects of the two drugs in
the relative doses in which they are normally used&quot; (p.
640). </p>

<p>Lastly, Kalant pointed out that Crancer and his colleagues
failed to indicate if any measures were actually taken to ensure
effective absorption of the doses by the experimental subjects.
This may be important, if the findings of dose dependent
impairments observed by Dagirmanjian and Boyd (1962) and Isbell
and his associates (1967) are valid. </p>

<p>Although Crancer and his fellow researchers did not feel that
the impairments found were related to either dosage level or
experience with the drug, this latter finding is also subject to
question in view of the earlier findings of the Mayor's Committee
on Marihuana (1944) and Weil and his colleagues (1968) that the
performance of drug-naive subject, was more impaired than was
that of experienced marihuana users. </p>

<p>In a more recent simulator study, attention was directed to
the effects of marihuana on risk acceptance (Dott, 1971). The
experimental situation involved the placement of 12 experienced
marihuana users under four conditions (non-smoking, placebo, low
dose, and high dose) in order to compare subjects' reactions to
various passing situations, some of which required an immediate
response to an emergency. </p>

<p>The data show that even though more accidents occurred under
the two marihuana conditions than under the placebo (and normal)
condition, the differences were not significant. Significant
differences were found in the number of passes completed and in
the time needed to make pass decisions. Not only did the
marihuana smokers complete fewer passes (174 in placebo
condition, 153 in low dose condition, and 133 in the high dose
condition), but they took more time to make the pass decisions
while under the influence of the drug. The researcher concluded
that &quot;marihuana appears to make the subject less willing to
accept risk, and it delays elective decision reaction time.
Effects were most noted in situations which did not have a high
attention demanding value. . . . In those situations which were
of an emergency nature and which demanded immediate attention and
response . . . . no drug effects were noted&quot; (p. 28). </p>

<p>Dott also found, in contrast to Frank and his associates
(1971) that pulse rate did seem to be affected by marihuana
intoxication. </p>

<p>Based upon a comparison with the same experiment performed
years before in relation to alcohol (Light and Kelper, 1969),
Dott stated that &quot;the effects of marihuana on driving
behavior are more subtle and less hazardous than the effects of
alcohol.&quot; </p>

<p>McGlothlin (1971) is presently conducting another simulator
study and is attempting to measure the effects of marihuana,
methadone and alcohol on simulated driving, attention,
information processing abilities and other measures related to
driving efficiency such is peripheral vision, depth perception
and glare recovery. At this time, five experiments have been
conducted and the researcher has stated that: </p>

<p><i>concentrated and divided attention for both auditory and
visual modalities are significantly impaired by smoked marihuana
containing 15 mg. THC.... In general, where impairment was found
for the marihuana treatments, it appears to be equivalent to that
resulting from a blood alcohol level of about 0.01%. Frequent
marihuana users (one or two times per week) typically showed less
impairment than those using less frequently </i>(p. 22.). </p>

<p>The inconclusive and controversial nature of the research to
date suggests that there is enough of a potential risk involved
to both the individual and the public safety to recommend
strongly against driving while intoxicated-no matter what the
intoxicant. Although marihuana does not seem to produce serious
impairments of driving skills or performance, to say that the
drug does not at all adversely affect driving behavior or that it
may not be a factor in traffic violations or accidents is to
misrepresent the current state of knowledge. As the National
Institute of Mental Health (1972) has noted, &quot;obviously,
more research is needed in elucidating the role of various drugs
on highway accidents . . .&quot; (p. 220). </p>

<p><b>I. Control of Marihuana, Alcohol and Tobacco</b> </p>

<h1>History of Marihuana Legislation*</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This chapter traces the legislative histories of marihuana,
alcohol, and tobacco. </p>

<p>In the first section, &quot;History of Marihuana
Legislation,&quot; the origins of the intoxicant use of cannabis
in this country during the early 20th century are noted along
with the subsequent state and federal statutes enacted
prohibiting use, distribution, production and sale. </p>

<p>Proscriptions began appearing on the books after about 1914
and continued through 1971, which brings the reader to the point
subsequently covered by the rest of this Appendix. </p>

<p>Early colonial laws regarding alcohol are described in the
beginning of the next section, &quot;History of Alcohol
Prohibition.&quot; From that point in history, the national
movements which spread over the next two centuries, culminating
in the enactment of National Prohibition from 1920 to 1933, are
described. </p>

<p>The various state modes of control which appeared after Repeal
are then briefly enumerated along with a discussion of the
present state controls over production, distribution, and sale of
intoxicating beverages. </p>

<p>The introduction of tobacco cultivation in 1613 in the colony
of Virginia opens the third section, &quot;History of Tobacco
Regulation.&quot; The widespread use of tobacco in the latter
1800's into the first half of the 20th century is traced along
with the increasing pressure from groups fearful of tobacco's
deleterious effects on health. </p>

<p>Federal sumptuary regulations are outlined along, with a
discussion of the impact further federal controls might have on
the tobacco economy. </p>

<h2>History of Marihuana Legislation*<br>
</h2>

<p><i>*This section is drawn from the manuscript of The Marihuana
Consensus: A History of American Marihuana Prohibition, in press
1972, by Professors Charles H. Whitebread, 11, and Richard J.
Bonnie of the University of Virginia Law School.<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Marihuana&quot; or Indian hemp, labeled Cannabis Sativa
L. by Linneas in 1753, has been used for centuries in Asia and
Africa for its intoxicant properties. It was cultivated as a
source of fiber in North America in the early 17th century. Yet,
cannabis was not used as an intoxicant in North America until the
late 19th century, and in the United States until the early 20th.
</p>

<p>Cannabis use was prevalent in Mexico by 1898. Widely
cultivated and growing wild, the drug was readily available for
eating, drinking, or smoking, the latter being by far the most
common method of ingestion. Soldiers in Pancho Villa's army are
reputed to have used the drug freely. The path of the
introduction of marihuana smoking for pleasure into the United
States was not via Europe, which transmitted the fiber, oil, and
medicinal uses of hemp, but via Mexico and the West Indies. </p>

<p>The plant and its intoxicant use in the United States in the
first decades of the 20th century encountered a political and
social climate which was not particularly conducive to hearty
growth. Gradually criminal prohibitions appeared on the statute
books of nearly every state where the drug was used. </p>

<p>Well into the thirties, however, marihuana smoking attracted
little attention from the national policy and opinion apparatus
which was deeply ensnared in drug matters of much wider social
impact than the limited, regional use of this new drug. </p>

<p>The &quot;villain&quot; theory of American marihuana
prohibition - attributing the drug's illegal status to the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and its longtime head, Harry J.
Anslinger - has been particularly popular in recent years. </p>

<p>Although the federal narcotics bureaucracy, with Commissioner
Anslinger at the helm, was to become marihuana's leading
antagonist in the mid-thirties, a restrictive, public policy
toward the drug was well-rooted locally before that time. During
the &quot;local&quot; phase of marihuana prohibition, lasting
roughly from 1914 to 1931, practically every state west of the
Mississippi, except for two, had prohibited use of the drug for
non-medical purposes.<br>
</p>

<p>The real story of marihuana policy in the United States begins
as a series of distinctly local tales.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>STATE PROHIBITION: 1914-1930</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana use was a familiar phenomenon in the border towns of
Texas and New Mexico after 1910. First to note the use of the
drug were El Paso law enforcement officials who quickly secured a
local ordinance in 1914 banning sale and possession of the drug.
El Paso officials and local representatives of the Customs and
Agriculture Departments of the Federal Government agitated for
state and federal legislation to combat the &quot;killer
weed.&quot; </p>

<p>After an official request by the Secretary of Agriculture, the
Secretary of the Treasury issued a decision under the Food and
Drug Act prohibiting importation of cannabis after 1915 for other
than medical purposes. </p>

<p>On the state level in Texas, legislation was slow in coming.
Marihuana use was still a local problem in the 'border towns and
it attracted little statewide interest. The Texas Legislature
included marihuana when it passed a general narcotics statute in
1919, prohibiting transfer of listed narcotics except for medical
purposes (Texas, 1919: 278). In 1923, the statute was tightened
to prohibit possession with intent to sell (Texas, 1923:
156-157). The legislature's failure to prohibit simple possession
or use reflected an objection to interfering with private
conduct. </p>

<p>The degree of public interest in narcotics and marihuana is
well-illustrated by the limited newspaper coverage. In its only
direct reference to the 1923 marihuana legislation, the Austin
Texas Statesman, which had given the legislature extensive
coverage, stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The McMillan Senate Bill amended the anti-narcotic law so
as to make unlawful the possession for the purpose of sale of
marihuana or other drugs. Marihuana is a Mexican herb and is said
to be sold on the Texas-Mexican border</i> (Austin Texas
Statesman, 1923). <br>
</p>

<p>Even more surprising is the fact that the El Paso Times did
not mention the McMillan bill before or after its passage. </p>

<p>New Mexico in the same year prohibited sale, cultivation and
importation of cannabis. Mere possession was not expressly
prohibited but anyone found in possession was presumed to have
imported the marihuana illegally (New Mexico, 1923: 58-59). The
Santa Fe New Mexican, hometown newspaper of the bill's sponsors
paid scant attention, noting only that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The Santa Fe representative, however, had better luck with
his bill to prevent sale of marihuana, cannabis indica, Indian
hemp or hashish as it is variously known. This bill was passed
without any opposition. Marihuana was brought into local
prominence at the penitentiary board's investigation last summer
when a convict testified he could get marihuana cigarettes
anytime he had a dollar. The drug produces intoxication when
chewed or smoked. Marihuana is the name commonly used in the
Southwest and Mexico </i>(Santa Fe New Mexican, 1923).<br>
</p>

<p>In addition to coming in via Mexico, marihuana was being
smuggled in by sailors from Cuba and other points in the Indies
via New Orleans. Dr. Frank Gomila, Commissioner of Public Safety
of New Orleans, began his campaign for federal legislation which
would later bear fruit. He observed that the traffic was quite
organized amounting to thousands of kilograms a year:<br>
</p>

<p><i>... [T]he custom was to keep [marihuana] In warehouses or
storerooms for further distribution. It was sold by the
wholesaler to the retailer who In turn put the 'weed' through a
process known as 'sweating.' The dried leaves and stems were
soaked in sugar water and dried on butcher's brown papers </i>(Gomila
and Lambow, 1938: 29).<br>
</p>

<p>According to Dr. Gomila and the newspapers, the demand in New
Orleans in the mid-twenties was so great that the
&quot;peddlers&quot; were able to become exceptionally prosperous
by dividing the market. One had exclusive jurisdiction over the
blacks unloading the fruit boats, another over the lobby in a
certain hotel, and so forth. It should be noted that marihuana
was also available at the local pharmacy without a prescription
before 1923 in Texas and 1921 in Louisiana. After that marihuana
had to be bought on the street unless the user could successfully
forge a prescription. </p>

<p>Different pictures emerge, of the marihuana user in El Paso
and San Antonio on the one hand and New Orleans and Galveston on
the other. In the border towns, he was a Mexican laborer,
indolent to some, volatile to others. Local authorities were, by
and large, unable to generate any significant public or political
interest, although there were no political objections to making
the Mexican weed illegal. </p>

<p>In the port cities, however, the marihuana user was a
&quot;dope fiend,&quot; the basest element of American society.
He was a narcotics addict, a pimp, or a gambler; she was a
prostitute. In New Orleans, marihuana was simply another narcotic
in a city with a major narcotic problem. It was always open to
sensationalism. </p>

<p>Even before public attention was excited, however, the
prevalence of marihuana use came to the attention of the
President of the Louisiana State Board of Health, Dr. Oscar
Dowling. On August 21, 1920, he advised the Governor of the
increasing availability of marihuana, a &quot;powerful narcotic,
causing exhilaration, intoxication, delirious hallucinations, and
its subsequent action, drowsiness and stupor. . .&quot; (Jones,
1920). </p>

<p>At the same time, Dr. Dowling wrote to the Surgeon General of
the United States, Dr. Hugh Cummings, to advise him of the
increasing traffic in morphine, opium, and marihuana, and to seek
federal cooperation. </p>

<p>An interesting sidelight of this request for assistance from
Washington is that four months later Dr. Dowling was to become
embroiled in a bitter battle with the Federal Government over an
order to close his pet project, the New Orleans morphine clinics
(Dowling, 1920). Ultimately he would lose, and one of the
earliest attempts to deal with narcotics addiction would be
suppressed for a half century (Lindesmith, 1967: 135-161). </p>

<p>Very little, however, was done about the marihuana issue until
the press seized upon it. In the fall of 1926, the New Orleans
Item dispatched an army of reporters among the smoking and
selling population. </p>

<p>A series of articles published by the more widely circulated
Morning Tribune (both the Item and the Tribune were owned by the
same publishing company) exposed the immense profits being made
and commented upon the volatile effects of the drug upon its
&quot;addicts.&quot; It was reported that marihuana: </p>

<p><i>Numbs the sense, creates wild fancies and has a hypnotic
effect upon the user, making his will easily subordinated to that
of others.<br>
</i></p>

<p>What emerged from these articles, however, was not a vision of
addicts on the streets and pushers on the docks but rather
peddlers who lurked on playgrounds seeking to entrap young minds.
&quot;Over two hundred children under fourteen are believed to be
addicted to the marihuana habit,&quot; the paper reported, and
&quot;at least 44 schools were definitely being infected&quot;
(Gomila and Lambow, 1938: 29-31). </p>

<p>Local policy-makers wasted no time. The New Orleans Police
Department immediately launched a round-up. They arrested more
than 150 persons for violation of a law which had lain dormant
for two years (Gomila and Lambow, 1938: 29-31; WCTIT, 1928). </p>

<p>Dr. Dowling soon circulated &quot;a warning to parents,
guardians, and teachers of children against this menace&quot;
(WCTIT, 1928: 1). The Women's Christian Temperance Union jumped
on the bandwagon, focusing its attacks on the &quot;soft
drink&quot; bars which had sprung up all over New Orleans during
Prohibition: </p>

<p><i>The soft drink stand and the corner drug store have taken
the place of the saloon as a social meeting place. Here is where
marihuana and liquors can sometimes be bought </i>(WCTU, 1928:
3). <br>
</p>

<p>Beyond these immediate effects, a more substantial impact of
the local policy reaction in New Orleans was the formation of a
tightly knit coterie of New Orleans law enforcement, public
health, and social welfare officials who would carry their
campaign to Washington, with ultimate success. </p>

<p>The drug and the practice of smoking it spread during the
mid-twenties from the Gulf Coast and border town points-of-entry
in two directions north and west from the border together with
its ethnic identity and north and east from New Orleans with its
identity as a narcotic and enslaver of youth. </p>

<p>Practically every state west of the Mississippi River
prohibited the possession or sale of marihuana during the period
1915 to 1930. Most of them acted by 1930: California (1915), Iowa
(1921), Nevada (1923), Washington (1923), Arkansas (1923),
Nebraska, (1927), and Wyoming (1929). </p>

<p>The Bureau of Immigration records the entry of 590,765
Mexicans during this period, two-thirds of them remaining in
Texas, the others settling in states in the Rocky Mountain area,
most of them as farm laborers (U.S. Bureau of Immigration, 1915
to 1930). </p>

<p>Whether motivated by outright ethnic prejudice or by simple
discriminatory disinterest, the proceedings before state
legislatures resembled those in Texas in 1923. There was little,
if any, public attention and no debate. Pointed references were
made to the drug's Mexican origins and sometimes to the criminal
conduct which inevitably followed when Mexicans ingested the
&quot;killer weed.,&quot; </p>

<p>The Colorado Legislature first prohibited possession,
cultivation and sale of the drug in 1927, the year after the use
of marihuana noticeably increased (Colorado, 1927: 309). At that
time., according to a subsequent newspaper report, the drug was
&quot; used almost exclusively . . . by the Mexican population
employed in the beet fields&quot; (Rocky Mountain News, 1931). </p>

<p>Similarly, in 1929, the Montana Legislature amended its
general narcotic law to marihuana, prohibiting use, sale or
possession without a prescription (Montana, 1929: 5). On seven
different days from June 24 to February 10, the date of the
bill's passage, the Montana Standard succinctly noted the
progress of the bill through the legislature. The legislature's
attitude was characterized in the January 27 issue:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There was fun in the House Health Committee during the week
when the marihuana bill came up for consideration. Marihuana is
Mexican opium, a plant used by Mexicans and cultivated for sale
by Indians. &quot;When some beet field peon takes a few rares of
this stuff,&quot; explained Dr. Fred Fulsher of Mineral County,
&quot;he thinks he has just been elected President of Mexico so
he starts out to execute all his Political enemies. I understand
that over in Butte where the mexicans often go for the winter
they stage imaginary bullfights in the 'Bower of Roses' or put on
tournaments for the favor of 'Spanish Rose' after a couple of
whiffs of marihuana. The Silver Bow and Yellowstone delegations
both deplore these international complications.&quot; Everybody
laughed and the bill was recommended for passage </i>(Montana
Standard, 1929: 3).<br>
</p>

<p>About the same time, Mexican laborers bad begun to appear in
Idaho and the mayor of Boise remarked:<br>
</p>

<p><i>'The Mexican beet field workers have introduced a new
problem-the smoking in cigarettes or pipes of marihuana or grifo.
its use is as demoralizing as the use of narcotics. Smoking grifo
is quite prevalent along the Oregon Short Line Railroad; and
Idaho has no law to cope with the use and spread of this
dangerous drug </i>(WCTU, 1928: 3).<br>
</p>

<p>Idaho passed a law in 1927 (Idaho, 1927: 98). </p>

<p>By 1931, the Texas Legislature finally got around to
prohibiting possession of marihuana. By now alcohol prohibition
had withdrawn any philosophical barrier to making possession
illegal. The San Antonio Light reported that: </p>

<p><i>At last the state legislature has taken a definite step
toward suppression of traffic in a dangerous and
insanity-producing narcotic easily compounded of a weed
(marihuana) indigenous to this section. This newspaper has urged
the passage of prohibitory legislation and is gratified that the
solons at Austin have acted, even if tardily, in the suppression
of traffic in a drug which makes, the addict [read Mexican]
frequently a dangerous or homicidal maniac</i> (San Antonio
Light, 1931).<br>
</p>

<p>In the East, appearance of the practice was not a necessary
prerequisite for prohibition. That Maine (1913), Massachusetts
(1914), Vermont (1915), and Rhode Island (1918) barred the sale
of cannabis without a prescription before 1920 does not indicate
that marihuana smoking had appeared there on any significant
scale. Rather, in the course of anticipating and implementing the
national anti-narcotics policy declared by the Harrison Act in
1914, medical representatives on the drafting committees
recommended the inclusion of &quot;another narcotic&quot; to
which addicts could resort once the other opiates became
difficult to obtain. </p>

<p>The New York Times in 1914 described cannabis as a
&quot;narcotic [having] practically the same effect. as morphine
and cocaine,&quot; (New York Times, 1914: 6) and it noted in an
editorial that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>[T]he inclusion of cannabis indica among the drugs to be
sold only on prescription is only common sense. Devotees of
hashish are now hardly numerous enough here to count, but they
are likely to increase as other narcotics become harder to obtain
</i>(New York Times, 1914: 8).<br>
</p>

<p>By 1923, the New York Times referred to marihuana as the
city's &quot;latest habit-forming drug&quot; when reporting its
exhibition at a Women's Club meeting (New York Times, 1923: 24).
Finally, in 1927, whether responding to an increase in use or to
the substitution admonition, the legislature included marihuana
in its definition of &quot;habit forming drugs&quot; in a
comprehensive narcotics bill (New York, 1927: 1695). </p>

<p>The situation in Chicago paralleled that in New York until
1927. Large Mexican communities developed in Chicago and Gary,
Indiana, during the twenties and marihuana smoking became common
in these areas and among journeymen musicians as well. As in New
York, there was little public concern. The New Orleans pattern
took over around 1927, however, when the attention of local law
enforcement officials was suddenly drawn to the Mexicans and
their &quot;muggles.&quot; One law enforcement official reported
that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There are about 7,000 Mexicans in Gary, 10,000 in Indiana
Harbor and 8,000 in South Chicago.... The Mexicans depend on the
steel mills, railroads, and construction gangs for employment.
Many are drifters when slack labor conditions prevail....
[T]wenty-five percent of these Mexicans smoke marihuana. In fact,
many of them make their living by raising and peddling the drug </i>(Paul,
1929: 4).<br>
</p>

<p>A situation perceived to be so widespread was naturally
considered likely to infect the rest of the community. As in New
Orleans, reports started to appear that high school students were
smoking the weed (Paul, 1929: 1; Chicago Tribune, June 3, 1929). </p>

<p>Since there was then neither state nor federal legislation
prohibiting sale of marihuana, the local United States attorney
declared war armed with an Internal Revenue statute prohibiting
production and transfer of &quot;a cigarette substitute&quot; on
which tax had not been paid. In June 1929, he raided wholesale
houses &quot;believed to have disposed of large quantities of
marihuana cigarettes, sold to school pupils and other youthful
thrill seekers.&quot; He arrested nine men &quot;most of them
Mexicans&quot; (Chicago Examiner, June 22, 1929). At the same
time, local officials began to use a statute which prohibited
transfer of &quot;any cigarette containing any substance
deleterious to health&quot; (Chicago Examiner, June 19, 1929). </p>

<p>The Chicago Tribune, lobbying heavily for anti-marihuana
legislation then pending before the Illinois Legislature,
reported that day-to-day progress of the enforcement activity
(Chicago Tribune, July and October, 1929). Every stall in the
legislature earned a banner headline such as: </p>

<p>BAN ON HASHISH BLOCKED DESPITE RAVAGES OF DRUG </p>

<p>In an article appearing in June, 1929, the paper noted: </p>

<p><i>The number of addicts is growing alarmingly according to
authorities, because of the ease with which [marihuana] can be
obtained. The habit was introduced a dozen years ago by Mexican
laborers . . . but it has become widespread among American youths
and girls even among school children.</i> </p>

<p>The legislation, however, was killed. </p>

<p>Marihuana prohibition had become widespread. In states where
either Mexicans or the drug had appeared, its use was quickly
suppressed. </p>

<p>Soon after being apprised of its presence, local lawmakers
invoked the criminal law. In New Orleans, Denver, and Chicago the
spectre of a doped school population was the cornerstone of the
prohibitory effort. </p>

<p>And, during alcohol prohibition, paralleled by the local phase
of marihuana prohibition, it was naturally imperative to suppress
a drug which frustrated alcohol users might substitute, for their
customary intoxicant.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE UNIFORM NARCOTIC DRUG ACT</b> </p>

<p>Following the ad hoc local phase of marihuana legislation in
the United States was the nationalization phase. During this
period marihuana became integrated at both the state and federal
levels with the nation's narcotics policy which had been
manifested forcefully in Congress' adoption of the Harrison
Narcotics Act in 1914. </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, a taxing measure, required registration and
payment of an occupational tax by all persons who imported,
produced, dealt in, sold or gave away opium, cocaine or their
derivatives. The Act required all legitimate handlers of these
narcotics to file returns setting forth in detail their use of
the drugs. </p>

<p>Since the Act also provided that only legitimate users could
register and no one but a registered user could obtain the
specified form, any transfer by an illegitimate user was a
violation of the Act. For those failing to comply with its
registration requirements, the original Harrison Act provided
penalties of not more than $2,000 in fines or more than five
years imprisonment, or both. </p>

<p>Drafted as a tax law rather than an outright criminal statute,
the Act was intended to do indirectly what Congress believed it
could not do directly: regulate possession and sale of the
opiates. However, because the Act essentially was a
revenue-raising measure imposing a tax on transfers of narcotics,
it could not effectively prohibit the possession of drugs. </p>

<p>This indirect regulation of narcotics traffic had a number of
significant consequences. First, since the Act could not penalize
users of addiction directly, there was an immediate need for
complementary residual state legislation in order to deal
effectively with the drug problem. </p>

<p>Second, the enforcement of the Act was as signed to the
Internal Revenue Service in the Treasury Department. The first
enforcement agency for the Harrison Act was the Narcotics
Division of the Prohibition Unit of the Internal Revenue Service
created in 1920 (Schmeckebier, 1929: 143). This division was
incorporated in the Prohibition Bureau which was created in 1927
(Act, 1927:1381). </p>

<p>In 1930, the enforcement of the narcotics laws was severed
from the Bureau of Prohibition and established as the separate
Bureau of Narcotics in the Treasury Department (Act, 1930: 585).
The existence of this separate, agency has done as much as any
single factor to influence the course of drug regulation from
1930 to 1970 (King, 1953: 736). </p>

<p>Although the impact of the Bureau on the passage of the
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and the Marihuana Tax Act will be
explained in detail in subsequent sections, it is important here
to note that the existence of a separate bureau having
responsibility only for narcotics enforcement and for educating
the public on drug problems inevitably led to a particularly
prosecutorial view of narcotics addiction and the use and abuse
of all drugs. </p>

<p>After the passage of the Harrison Act in 1914, there remained
a considerable lack of uniformity regarding the offenses
prohibited and the penalties imposed by the several states. </p>

<p>In 1919, the American Medical Association asked the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue to call a conference, to
consider better control of traffic in narcotic drugs. The
profession was uncertain of its obligations in the matter because
they were faced with an amalgam of conflicting laws. The A.M.A.
asked that the wholesale, retail, and manufacturing drug
interests be among those attending, along with delegates from the
medical profession in each state. The proposal received no
official or unofficial response either from the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue or the Bureau of Prohibition. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the American Medical Association, through its
own Council on Health and Public Instruction, did hold a
conference in early 1922 during which a uniform state narcotic
control law was presented. At the November meeting of that
conference, there were present 15 representatives of 10
pharmaceutical organizations and two representatives of the
medical profession. </p>

<p>The draft of a uniform law was approved unanimously by all
present. The American Medical Association set out to codify the
draft and to send it for approval to each of the constituent
organizations (White, August 3, 1932; Woodward, August 6, 1932).
After securing approval, all the associations agreed to pursue
enactment first in New York.<br>
</p>

<p>The general lack of uniformity in anti-narcotics legislation,
the weakness of state enforcement procedures, and the growing
hysteria about dope fiends and criminality converged in several
requests outside the medical community for a uniform state
narcotic law (Anslinger and Tompkins, 1953: 159).<br>
</p>

<p>The drafting of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act must also be
viewed against the background of two larger movements: (1) the
trend toward the creation and dissemination of uniform state laws
by the National Commissioners on Uniform State laws, a group to
which each state sent two representatives appointed by the
governor; and (2) the general concern in the late 1920's and
early 1930's with interstate crime, manifested , for example, by
the creation in 1930 of the nearly autonomous Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Because the concept of states' rights and narrowly
construed federal power was then so powerful, an appeal to the
National Commissioners was the inevitable recourse for those
pressing for uniform anti-narcotic regulation. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DRAFTING THE UNIFORM ACT<br>
</b></p>

<p>By 1924, the Commissioners had appointed Committee to draft a
uniform narcotic drug act At the 1925 meeting of Commissioners,
the chair man of the Committee reported that he himself had
prepared a first tentative draft based on the New York Act, the
Washington state legislation, the Harrison Act, and a bill then
before the New York Legislature. Presumably this was the on
drafted by the A.M.A. Conference after its 192 meeting. </p>

<p>The chairman noted, however, that Dr. William Woodward, head
of the A.M.A.'s Bureau of Legal Medicine and Legislation, with
whom he had only recently conferred, had made &quot;some very
valuable suggestions.&quot; Because the tentative draft had
already been printed before these suggestions, he requested that
it &quot;not be read but be re-committed to the Committee&quot;
(1925 Handbook: 977-985). This first draft included cannabis in
the list of &quot;habit-forming drugs,&quot; although all such
drugs could be distributed and used for medical purposes (1925
Handbook: 978). </p>

<p>A second tentative draft was presented in 1928 and again the
draft was not discussed at the conference but recommitted for
further study. The second draft was essentially an exact copy of
the 1927 New York Statute. It also included cannabis in the class
of habit-forming drugs (1928 Handbook: 75-78,323-333). </p>

<p>There was a lack of concern on the part of the Commissioners
themselves with the whole narcotics problem between 1924 and
1928. The President of the Conference, introducing Dr. Woodward,
said:<br>
</p>

<p><i>In view of the importance of the act I think it would not
be amiss to listen to the Doctor for a few minutes, that he may
point out to us why it is important. In some of the states we do
not recognize the importance because it has not been called to
our attention </i>(1928 Handbook: 76-77).<br>
</p>

<p>Nor was the Bureau of Prohibition particularly concerned at
this time with the cannabis provision. Lack of official concern
and interest continued to be the Bureau's attitude toward the
second tentative draft (Nutt, June 13,1929). </p>

<p>Since neither the Commissioners nor federal narcotics
officials were particularly concerned about state and local
control of narcotics generally and marihuana in particular, it
seems clear that neither was responsible for the inclusion of
marihuana in the category of &quot;habit-forming drugs. Rather,
it would appear that it was included in the first draft because
that had been drawn from the 1923 Washington statute which had
listed cannabis. </p>

<p>Insofar as the second draft was a copy of the 1927 New York
Act, inclusion of cannabis in this draft is not unusual. Few, if
any, of the persons involved in the drafting were concerned about
marihuana smoking or even aware of its use. </p>

<p>Two third drafts were submitted, the first in 1929 and the
second in 1930. The initial one closely resembled the second
tentative draft, and once again it included cannabis in the
category of &quot;habit-forming drugs.` Again, the growth,
distribution, and possession of cannabis was prohibited except
for medical purposes. </p>

<p>The nascent Congressional interest in marihuana in 1929 and
the Bureau of Prohibition's subsequent resistance to amending,
and thereby endangering, the Harrison and Export and Import Acts,
caused the Bureau to take full notice of this 1929 third draft.
Like its predecessors, however, the initial third draft was
recommitted for further study (1929 Handbook : 43, 332-346). </p>

<p>The second third tentative draft, submitted in 1930, was the
first to remove cannabis from the definition of
&quot;habit-forming drugs&quot; and to include only a
supplemental provision for dealing with the drug (1930 Handbook:
485,97). </p>

<p>When the Conference of Commissioners met to consider the
second third tentative draft, Judge Deering, the Chairman of the
Committee on the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, recommended its
recommission for further study because the Committee had not yet
had an opportunity to consult the newly created Bureau of
Narcotics. </p>

<p>At the time of this conference, August 14, 1930, no one had
yet been appointed Commissioner of the Bureau, although Harry J.
Anslinger was Acting Commissioner (1930 Handbook: 126-127). The
Senate confirmed Anslinger's appointment as Commissioner on
December 18, 1930. </p>

<p>The Bureau of Narcotics their became actively involved in the
drafting process. Commissioner Anslinger was pressing for
inclusion of the cannabis provision. He stated that he felt the
limited medical use for cannabis was far outweighed by the need
to control potential cannabis addiction (Anslinger, July
28,1930). </p>

<p>Dr. Woodward and the pharmaceutical industry advocated
optional inclusion of marihuana on the one hand, and federal
narcotics representatives urged not only inclusion but
elimination of medical use, on the other. </p>

<p>The fourth tentative draft retained the optional cannabis
provision. At a session before the convening of the full
Conference of Commissioners from September 9-12, 1931,
Commissioner Anslinger and A. L. Tennyson of the Bureau met with
Judge Deering to discuss the Bureau's feelings about the fourth
tentative draft. </p>

<p>At this time Commissioner Anslinger stated that the Bureau
felt strongly that inclusion of cannabis in the state law ought
to be mandatory. Moreover, the Bureau urged that the only
successful way to deal with the marihuana drug traffic, because
of its domestic nature and the easy availability of the weed, was
to prohibit the cultivation of the plant altogether and to find
some substitute for the limited medical use (Tennyson, September
16, 1931). However, the fourth tentative draft presented to the
Conference of Commissioners included the optional marihuana
provision. And, the Conference tentatively approved the fourth
tentative draft and directed the Committee to prepare a final
draft (1931 Handbook: 127-128, 390-402). </p>

<p>The American Medical Association played a key role in the
drafting process prior to 1931. Their efforts had been largely
responsible for consideration of the Uniform Drug Act in the
first place. From the beginning in 1925, Dr. William Woodward,
the Director of the A.M.A.'s Bureau of Legal Medicine and
Legislation, actively assisted in the drafting of the Act and
widely circulated the drafts to interested persons for their
comments. </p>

<p>It appears, however, that Dr. Woodward's personal style and
the preeminent position of the American Medical Association in
the drafting process were resented by the two remaining interest
groups-the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the retail and
wholesale pharmaceutical associations. The Bureau had been
commenting on drafts only after they had been drawn by the A.M.A.
and did not feel it was playing an active role in the drafting
process. The pharmaceutical industry felt that their interests
were considered only peripherally and that they had been excluded
from the heart of tire, drafting process. </p>

<p>As a result of the dissent, a conference of interested parties
was scheduled before the final draft was to be presented to the
Conference of Commissioners. </p>

<p>Present at this preliminary conference on September 15, 1932,
were representatives of the Drug Committee the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics, the Department of State, the Public Health Service,
the American Medical Association, and delegates from the drug
industry and other medically related industries and
organizations. The final version of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act
was hammered out at this session. The Bureau was central to the
drafting process and Commissioner Anslinger made a major effort
to involve the drug manufacturers and the wholesale and retail
drug trade in it to protect the Act from possible subsequent
political disagreement (Anslinger, August 1, 1932): Finally, the
conference agreed on a draft to be presented to the National
Conference. </p>

<p>The manufacturers of drug products were strongly opposed to
the inclusion of cannabis under any criminal regulatory scheme.
Representatives of the industry opposed a mandatory cannabis
provision. The final conclusion reached by all the parties
present was:<br>
</p>

<p><i>After considerable comment, it was decided to eliminate
Section 12 (Cannabis) and leave it to the Conference of
Commissioners as to whether it should be included under the
general provisions of the Act </i>(Report of Preliminary
Conference, 1932: 23).<br>
</p>

<p>The Bureau was no longer insisting on the mandatory inclusion
of in absolute marihuana prohibition; it did not want to risk the
opposition of the drug industry to the, entire Act. </p>

<p>The fifth tentative draft did, however, include a significant
change in form which would have important consequences in the
decades to come. Although the marihuana provision remained
supplemental to the main body of the Act, any state wishing to
regulate the sale and possession of marihuana was instructed,
simply, to add cannabis to the definition of &quot;narcotic
drugs.&quot; All the, other provisions of the, Act would their
apply to marihuana as well as to the opiates and cocaine. The
Commissioners adopted this form as it had been prepared at the
September 15, 1932, preliminary Conference. </p>

<p>The only recorded opposition to the adoption of the final
draft came from some Commissioners who objected to tying the
Uniform State Law to the terms of the federal Harrison Act. This
last obstacle was over-come by the argument that a number of
states already had passed such legislation so that the states'
rights problem need not stand in the way. The Act was adopted 26
to 3 (1932 Handbook: 107).<br>
</p>

<p><b>ENACTMENT OF THE UNIFORM ACT BY THE STATES</b> </p>

<p>After final acceptance of the Uniform Act, the Bureau set to
work at once to secure state enactment-including an adequate
marihuana provision. A comprehensive campaign was undertaken in
the press, in legislative chambers, and in any other forum to
gain public support for the Uniform Act. </p>

<p>In addition, perceiving the absence of public awareness of
marihuana and needing to encourage positive action to overcome
the drug's optional status, the Bureau also sought to arouse
public interest in marihuana through &quot;an educational
campaign describing the drug, its identifications and its evil
effects&quot; (Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1937 : 59). </p>

<p>That there was little general knowledge about cannabis is
illustrated by the fact that as late as 1934, it was necessary to
show marihuana to the New York police so that they could
recognize it growing or in dried, smokable form (New York Times
1934: 6). </p>

<p>The Bureau's district supervisors and local agents were
campaigning actively in the legislatures before which the Act was
pending. A press campaign was conducted across the country to
gain the support of civic groups and other interested parties.
Mr. Anslinger sought editorial support in newspapers (Anslinger,
October 22, 1936) and assisted in the, drafting of articles for
popular magazines (Anslinger, December 23, 1936). To mobilize the
Bar, Bureau officials wrote an article for law journals
explaining the need for the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act (Anslinger,
1932: 52; Tennyson, 1932: 55). </p>

<p>Despite these efforts, it appears that the Uniform Act had a
rough time in state legislatures during its early life. By April
26, 1933, only two states had enacted it in full. As late as
March 1935, only 10 states had enacted the Uniform Law. </p>

<p>A number of significant objections had emerged in the state
legislatures considering the passage of the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act. First among these was the potential cost to the state of
enforcing the Act. Second, there was concern over the number of
registrants who would have to be licensed due to the belief that
the Uniform Act would require special licensing of doctors,
dentists, and veterinarians. Third, the limit on the amount of
exempt preparations which could be sold caused a great deal of
technical difficulty with the Act. Fourth, many criticized the
right of the court to revoke or suspend the license to practice
medicine or pharmacy. And finally, there seemed to be widespread
misunderstanding of the record-keeping requirements of the Act. </p>

<p>Although these objections were largely administrative, they
nevertheless posed what appeared to be serious stumbling blocks
to the successful passage of the Uniform Law in all the states. </p>

<p>The combination of public apathy and administrative resistance
necessitated a new approach in generating public interest.
Beginning in late 1934, Commissioner Anslinger gradually shifted
the focus of the FBN's educational campaign away from the
liability of federal law enforcement agencies to deal effectively
with the local drug problems to the need to cope with the new
drug menace-marihuana. </p>

<p>The clearest reflection of the, change in Bureau policy is
found in two official statements of Commissioner Anslinger, one
made in 1933 and the other in 1936. </p>

<p>One 1933 statement explains the need for a Uniform Narcotic
Drug Law and emphasizes United States international obligations,
the need for more effective coordination in law enforcement, and
the impact the law will have on the dangers of morphine, cocaine,
and opium addiction (FBN Paper, July 1933). In the later
statement, however, more than half of the time is devoted to a
discussion of the &quot;worst evil of all&quot; the marihuana
problem. </p>

<p>To aid the new approach's objective, Commissioner Anslinger
made speeches and contributed articles to journals. The most
influential of his efforts was &quot;Marihuana Assassin of
Youth&quot; which appeared in the widely circulated American
Magazine in July 1937 (Anslinger and Cooper,1937). </p>

<p>The FBN files contain more than 50 letters addressed to the
Commissioner which say: &quot;Your article was the first time I
ever heard of marihuana.&quot; </p>

<p>Among the most effective proponents of the Uniform Act was the
Hearst newspaper chain. These papers began editorializing in
favor of enactment within days after the Act had been approved in
1932. </p>

<p>The Hearst chain was not alone. A Birmingham, Alabama, paper
on August 22, 1935, emphasized the need to control marihuana as a
reason for adopting the Act (Birmingham Age Herald, August 22,
1935). A Washington Post columnist in September, 1934, devoted
three quarters of his article to marihuana with quotes from
Anslinger and Stanley urging adoption of the Uniform Act
(Washington Post, September 29, 1934).<br>
</p>

<p>Other large-city newspapers such as the Cleveland Plain,
Dealer and the St. Louis Star Times kept a steady, if
intermittent, stream of anti-marihuana articles flowing in the,
period just before the passage of the Uniform Act in those areas.
In Missouri, especially, local concern generated by the extensive
coverage in the Star Times speedily pushed the legislature to
adopt the Uniform Act. </p>

<p>Often it has been supposed on the basis of this increased
coverage that the use of marihuana increased around 1935. Since
there was some larger design involved, however, a firm conclusion
is unwarranted. At the same time, it is possible that use, did
spread after the publicity campaigns, especially among the young.
</p>

<p>Judging from the tremendous expansion in coverage by the New
York Times beginning in 1935, the evidence supplied by the
LaGuardia Commission in its 1944 Report and the, leap in
enforcement activity, marihuana, finally came to New York City in
the 1930's, though then probably on a smaller scale than in
Denver land the, border towns of Texas. </p>

<p>Apart from the press, another influential participant in the
marihuana campaign, especially after the Repeal of Prohibition,
was the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Although the WCTU had
distributed a pamphlet on marihuana as early as 1927, their
publication, the Union Signal, does not reflect any significant
interest either in the Uniform Act or marihuana, until 1934.
Before that year the &quot;narcotic&quot; receiving the most
attention was nicotine. Beginning in 1936, however, the Union
Signal had a direct line to the FBN national office, and from
then on every issue contained material on marihuana (WCTU bound
volumes, yearly). </p>

<p>The World Narcotic Defense Association and its head, Richmond
P. Hopson, were also involved in the drive for state enactment.
They were continually in postal contact with almost every state
legislator in the country (WNDA, 1937). The most well-financed
group in the campaign, the Association underwrote national
broadcasts and distributed a lengthy pamphlet on marihuana, in
1936. </p>

<p>The General Federation of Women's Clubs also contributed
energetically. The Federation educated its membership about the
need for the Uniform Act and about the evils of marihuana in
particular. The Chairman of the Federation's department of
legislation noted: <br>
</p>

<p><i>The situation concerning club women particularly is the
accessibility of the frightening degenerating marihuana weed,
which is rolled in cigarettes ... and has been playing such havoc
with young high school boys and girls</i> (WCTU, 1936: 285).<br>
</p>

<p>The state and local clubs immediately began to unite local
legislators and to conduct educational campaigns for parents,
teachers and children (WCTU, 1937: 36; Wood, January 13, 1936).
An FBN agent appeared at a New York meeting of the local
Federation with two marihuana plants. They were exhibited at a
local flower show: </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>Marihuana Plant exhibit at Flower Show</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>of Katrina Trask Garden Club</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Tomorrow, 3 P.M. on at the Casino</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>This plant is the cause of a dread menace
which in being fought by the State Department of Health.</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Public Invited to Show-25 cents (Saratogian,
1936: 5)<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>Other groups such as the YWCA , the National PTA and the
National Councils of Catholic Men and Women were all in touch
with the Bureau and were made, aware of the Bureau's dual aims of
&quot;influencing and creating public opinion in favor of the
passage of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and awakening the
parents of the country to the increasing danger of the use of
marihuana.&quot; (Anslinger, March 28, 1935). </p>

<p>However, arousing public opinion alone was not the ultimate
goal of the campaign. The FBN was interested in the enactment of
the Uniform Act along with prohibitory marihuana legislation in
all the states. </p>

<p>By early 1935, only 10 states had adopted the Uniform Act.
And, three of these states had not included marihuana (Anslinger,
March 1, 1935). The Bureau embarked upon its marihuana strategy
in 1935, the turning point in state enactment. Whether or not
public interest actually existed, public opinion-makers
influenced legislative opinion and created a &quot;felt
need&quot; for legislation. </p>

<p>Within the next year, 18 more states adopted the Act and every
one of them which did not have previous legislation included
marihuana (Anslinger, January 13, 1936; WCTU, 1937: 75).<br>
</p>

<p><b>ENACTMENT OF THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT<br>
</b></p>

<p>Despite the public opinion campaign conducted in the early
1930's the general public was largely unaware of the drug, its
use, or its alleged effects; only regional interest was aroused. </p>

<p>A change seems to have occurred after 1935. The increased
national awareness played a significant role in the decision of
the Treasury Department to seek federal legislation. On April 14,
1937, the &quot;Secretary of the Treasury, on behalf of the
Commissioner of Narcotics,&quot; submitted the
&quot;administration proposal to Congress to impose an excise and
transfer tax on dealings in marihuana&quot; (Schaller, 1970: 70).
</p>

<p>The scheme of the Marihuana Tax Act was threefold: a
requirement that all manufacturers, importers, dealers, and
practitioners register and pay a special occupational tax; a
requirement that all transactions be accomplished through use of
written order forms; and the imposition of a tax on all transfers
in the amount of $1 per ounce for transfer to registered persons
and a prohibitive $100 per ounce for transfers to unregistered
persons. </p>

<p>The key departure of the marihuana tax scheme from that of the
Harrison Act is the notion of the prohibitive tax. Under the
Harrison Act, a person not required to register, that is, a
non-medical user, could not legitimately buy or possess
narcotics. To the dissenters in the Supreme Court decisions
upholding the Act, this clearly demonstrated that Congress'
motive was to prohibit conduct rather than to raise revenue. </p>

<p>The seemingly bizarre legal formulation of this tax measure
was precipitated by the recognized need for the Federal
Government to take action forbidden to it under prevailing
constitutional doctrine. </p>

<p>Hearings on the proposed marihuana taxation were held before
the House Ways and Means Committee. During five mornings of
testimony by FBN officials, government witnesses, and industry
representatives, the Bureau presented the following four-fold
argument: (1) marihuana was a disastrous drug; (2) its use was
increasing alarmingly and had generated public hysteria; (3)
state legislation was incapable of meeting the threat posed by
the drug, thus, federal action was required; and (4) the
government might best act through separate legislation rather
than through an amendment to the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>No definite scientific study of the effects of marihuana was
presented to substantiate the position that marihuana was a
dangerous drug. No synthesis of available scientific information
was submitted nor was there any statement by the Public Health
Service. Neither of the government's own public health experts,
Assistant Surgeon General, Dr. Walter Treadway, and Dr. Lawrence
Kolb, testified, nor did Drs. Walter Bromberg or J. F. Siler who
had recently published scientific articles on the effects of
cannabis in humans (Siler, et. al., 1933: 269-280; Bromberg,
1934). </p>

<p>Instead, the scientific aspects were presented by a law
enforcement agency, the FBN:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Despite the fact that medical men and scientists have
disagreed upon the properties of marihuana, and some are inclined
to minimize the harmfulness of this drug, the records offer ample
evidence that it has a disastrous effect upon many of its users.
Recently we have received many reports showing crimes of violence
committed by persons while under the influence of marihuana. </i></p>

<p><i>The deleterious, even vicious, qualities of the drug render
it highly dangerous to the mind and body upon which it operates
to destroy the will, cause one to lose the power of connected
thought, producing imaginary delectable situations and gradually
weakening the physical powers. Its use frequently leads to
insanity. <br>
</i></p>

<p><i>I have a statement here, giving an outline of cases
reported to the Bureau or in the press, wherein the use of
marihuana is connected with revolting crimes</i> (U.S. Congress,
1937: 30). <br>
</p>

<p>Instead of having one of the few researchers who had done any
significant research into the effects of cannabis on humans, the
Bureau chose a Temple University pharmacologist, Dr. James Munch,
whose experience was confined to experimentation of the effects
of cannabis on dogs. </p>

<p>The second component of the Bureau's case was the contention
that marihuana use had spread alarmingly in recent years,
provoking a public outcry. To demonstrate this, the Bureau
submitted, for the record, the Gomila article cited earlier, and
a 1936 letter from the city editor of the Alamoosa Daily Courier
(U.S. Congress, 1937: 32-37). The letter described an attack by a
Mexican-American, allegedly under the influence of marihuana, on
a girl of his region.: <br>
</p>

<p><i>I wish I could show you what a small marihuana cigarette
can do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents.
That's why our problem is so great; the greatest percentage of
our population is composed of Spanish speaking persons most of
whom are low mentally, because of social and racial conditions </i>(Baskette,
September 4, 1936).<br>
</p>

<p>The third component of the Bureau's case was that even though
every state now had marihuana legislation, local authorities
could not cope with the marihuana menace. To support this
proposition editorial pleas from the Washington newspapers were
offered along with Bureau testimony that officials of several
states had requested federal help. </p>

<p>Senator Brown asked Commissioner Anslinger &quot;to make clear
the need for Federal legislation.&quot; He continued: </p>

<p><i>You say the states have asked you to do that. I presume it
is because of the freedom of interstate traffic that the states
require the legislation. </i></p>

<p>Anslinger agreed: </p>

<p><i>[W]e have had requests from the states to step in because
they claimed it was not growing in that state, but that it was
coming in from another state </i>(U.S. Congress, 1937:16).<br>
</p>

<p>Nothing was presented to support that statement; no letters
from local authorities and no investigative reports by FBN agents
describing the trafficking apparatus. </p>

<p>The congressmen and senators participating in the hearings
accepted the Bureau's argument. In fact, Senator Brown, Chairman
of the subcommittee which considered the legislation in the
Senate, and Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee,
had been thoroughly briefed by the Bureau in advance of the
hearings. There was no probing of the Government witnesses. In
fact, the Government made its case in the House in one session,
and the next three sessions were devoted to countering the
technical objections of the oilseed, birdseed, and hemp
industries (U.S. Congress, 1937:59-65 67-86 .<br>
</p>

<p>On the last morning of scheduled hearings, Dr. William C.
Woodward appeared on behalf of the AMA to oppose the bill. Dr.
Woodward objected to H.R. 6385 because he believed that its
ultimate effect would be to so restrict medical use by red tape
that any medical use would be impossible. He admitted that there
were currently few therapeutic applications but he observed that
the bill inhibited further research which might bear fruit. He
went even further to imply that the bill was designed with this
objective in mind. He noted that if federal legislation was
considered necessary, it could be achieved without sacrificing
medical usage by simply amending the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>Dr. Woodward's most pointed attack was directed against the
assumption that federal legislation was needed to control the
marihuana habit. He argued that existing state legislation was
more than sufficient if properly enforced and that if lack of
coordination was the problem, that was the FBN's fault. </p>

<p>Noting that the FBN already had the authority to &quot;arrange
for the exchange of information concerning the use and abuse of
narcotic drugs in [the] states and for cooperation in the
institution and prosecution of suits . . .,&quot; he asserted
that the Bureau had not done its job:<br>
</p>

<p><i>If there is at the present time any weakness in our state
laws relating to cannabis or to marihuana, a fair share of the
blame, if not all of it, rests on the Secretary of the Treasury
and his assistants who have had this duty imposed upon them for 6
and more years</i> (U.S. Congress, 1937: 93).<br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Woodward also contended that the law would be a useless
expense to the medical profession and unenforcible. He noted:
&quot;Since marihuana grows so freely, and every landowner was a
potential producer, whether wittingly or unwittingly, full
enforcement would require inspection of the entire land area of
the country, a task which would be unseemly for the Federal
Government to undertake&quot; (U.S. Congress, 1937: 94-95). </p>

<p>Finally, Dr. Woodward wondered why, if federal legislation was
considered necessary, the Congress did not simply amend the
Harrison Act. To the Bureau's argument that such a course would
be unconstitutional, he inquired how Treasury's counsel could
argue that the present bill was constitutional since the
technique was identical. Dr. Woodward's own view was that the
amendment of the Harrison Act would be constitutional and that
such a course would dispel the professional objections which he
raised (U.S. Congress, 1937:97). </p>

<p>After accusing Dr. Woodward of obstructionism, evasiveness,
and bad faith, the Committee did not even thank him for his
testimony (U.S. Congress, 1937: 121). When the Senate Finance
Committee conducted hearings on the bill, now styled H.R. 6906,
two months later, Dr. Woodward submitted instead a short letter
which stated the AMA's reasons for opposing the bill (U.S.
Congress, 1937: 33-34). </p>

<p>Both Committees reported the bill favorably despite Woodward's
objections. The Ways and Means Report stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Under the influence of this drug the will is destroyed and
all power of directing and controlling thought is lost.
Inhibitions are released. As a result of these effects, it
appeared from testimony produced at the hearings that many
violent crimes have been and are being committed by persons under
the influence of the drug Not only is marihuana used by hardened
criminals to steel them to commit violent crimes, but it is also
being placed in the hands of high-school children in the form of
marihuana cigarettes by unscrupulous peddlers. Cases were cited
at the hearings of school children who have been driven to crime
and insanity through the use of the drug. Its continued use
results many times in impotency and insanity </i>(U.S. Congress,
1937: 1-2).<br>
</p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act passed the House of Representatives very
late in the afternoon of a long session on June 14, 1937; the
only opposition came from congressmen who had no idea what
marihuana was and desired further information before voting
(Congressional Record, 1937: 5575, 5689). Instead of a detailed
analysis they received a statement of one of the members of the
Ways and Means Committee, which repeated uncritically the lurid
criminal acts attributed to marihuana users at the hearings.
After less than two pages of debate, the Act passed without a
roll call (Congressional Record, 1937: 5575).<br>
</p>

<p><b>TIGHTENING THE LAW<br>
</b></p>

<p>After the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act, the FBN began with
a four-pronged enforcement policy:<br>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Control of cultivation of the plant for legitimate
        purposes and eradication of wild growth; </li>
    <li>Pacification of marihuana-sensationalism in the press; </li>
    <li>Education of the federal judiciary toward strict
        application of the law; and </li>
    <li>Allocation of federal enforcement resources toward major
        trafficking rather than petty possession offenses.<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The scope of the plant's growth, the transportability of the
seeds, the dormancy of the seeds, and the lack of a highly
efficient herbicide militated against a comprehensive eradication
program. The cost of such a program would have been substantial
even if success were assured. No active effort was undertaken to
conduct an acre-by-acre survey of the United States. </p>

<p>The eradication &quot;program&quot; became simply a matter of
reaction to routine information-letters from farmers who had
identified the plant and discoveries of acreage by law
enforcement agents. </p>

<p>As the Bureau's interest in marihuana subsided during the
1940's, so did the effort to eradicate the wild growth. In fact,
the Federal Government encouraged the cultivation of hemp during
the war, even though an inactive strain had not been developed,
because sources of sisal rope had been severed by Japan's
occupation of the Philippines. All over the United States, the
weed remained plentiful and largely undetected. </p>

<p>After passage of the Act, Commissioner Anslinger directed his
agents to discourage local officials from playing up any alleged
involvement of marihuana with crime to the press. On April 11,
1938, the Commissioner told his New York District Supervisor
that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>Our present policy is to discourage undue emphasis on
marihuana for the reason that in some sections of the country
recently press reports have been so exaggerated that interest in
the subject has become almost hysterical and we are therefore
trying to mold public opinion along more conservative and saner
lines </i>(Anslinger, April 11, 1938).<br>
</p>

<p>Immediately following passage of the Act, the FBN also
directed an &quot;educational&quot; effort toward the federal
judiciary to emphasize the need for severe sentences for
marihuana offenders. The Bureau also concentrated on the stifling
of suppliers, large interstate traffickers, and smugglers. Small
possession cases were to be left to local authorities. </p>

<p>Several factors, however, served to frustrate this policy.
First, marihuana traffic was highly disorganized and there was no
national or regional network as such (New York City, 1945).
Second, use was still concentrated geographically and
socioeconomically and was not a major enterprise. Finally, during
the war years, the Bureau abandoned responsibility for most
marihuana law enforcement to the states, where the disorganized
traffic and regional use could be most effectively controlled.
The FBN chose instead to concentrate on the opiates. </p>

<p>After the relative quiet of the war years there was apparently
a significant increase in narcotic drug abuse in the late, 1940's
and the public began to be concerned with the spread of narcotic
addiction, particularly among young persons. Congressional furor
was aroused by the assertion that the use of marihuana inevitably
led to the use of these harder drugs, particularly heroin.<br>
</p>

<p>The new legislation came in two waves. In 1951, Congress
passed the Boggs Act (Boggs Act, November 2, 1951: 767) which
increased penalties for all drug violators. For the first time in
federal drug legislation marihuana and the narcotic drugs were
lumped together, since the Act provided uniform penalties for the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (Boggs Act, November 2,
1951: 767) and the Marihuana Tax Act (21 USC 1964). The states
followed the federal lead. Then, in 1956, Congress passed the
Narcotic Control Act, escalating the penalties still further.
Once again the states responded in kind. </p>

<p>The hearings before the Subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee and the floor debate indicate that the Boggs Act
was motivated by a. perceived increase in narcotic use in the
period 1948 to 1951 (Kefauver Committee Hearings, 1951: 240-241;
New York Times, 1951). </p>

<p>Representative Boggs, speaking during the Congressional debate
on his bill, enunciated a concern which was reflected in many
other quarters. After noting that there had been a 24% increase
in arrests for narcotic violations between 1949 and 1950 and a
70% increase between 1948 and 1950, Representative Boggs stated: <br>
</p>

<p><i>The most shocking part about these figures is the fact that
there has been an alarming increase in drug addiction among
younger persons. In the first six months of 1946, the average age
of addicted persons committed . . . at Lexington, Kentucky, was
37.5 years. Only three patients were under the age of 21. During
the first six months of 1950, only four years later, the average
had dropped to 26.7 years and 766 patients were under the age of
21... </i>(Congressional Record, 1951: 8197).<br>
</p>

<p>Representative Boggs and others supported the mandatory
minimum sentences for drug peddlers because they felt that some
federal judges had been lax in enforcing the narcotic laws
(Congressional Record, 1951: 8197, 8207, 821 1). Public opinion
was overwhelming that harsh sentences, including the death
penalty for peddling narcotics to minors, would strangle the drug
monster then stalking the American youth (Kefauver Committee
Hearings, 1951: 430-431). </p>

<p>The Boggs Act was directed in large part at the federal
judiciary since a key provision removed judicial discretion in
sentencing by providing that upon conviction for a second or
subsequent offense the imposition or execution of the sentence
could not be suspended nor probation granted. </p>

<p>There had been no concerted lobbying effort by the judicial
community during the legislative process; however, James V.
Bennett, Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, aroused the
judges in the Fifth U.S. Circuit District into eventually
recommending the amendment of the law to remove provisions for
mandatory minimum sentences (Yew Orleans Statesman, May 28, 1954;
New Orleans Times-Picayune, May 28, 1954). </p>

<p>Even while the Boggs Act was still pending in Congress, the
Bureau of Narcotics encouraged the states to modify their
existing narcotic and marihuana legislation to enact
&quot;penalties similar to those provided in the Boggs Bill
[which] would be of material assistance in the fight against the
narcotic traffic&quot; (Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1950: 6). </p>

<p>Seventeen states and the territory of Alaska responded by
passing &quot;little Boggs Acts&quot; by 1953 and 11 other states
increased their penalties by 1956. Two of the latter group, Ohio
and Louisiana, enacted penalty provisions which were
substantially more severe than those passed previously in any
jurisdiction (Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1956: 28). </p>

<p>The Ohio law, approved June 16,1955, provided a 20 to 40 year
sentence for the sale of narcotic drugs. The Louisiana measure,
adopted the following year, provided severe prison sentences
without parole, probation, or suspension for the illegal sale,
possession, or administration of a narcotic drug. The sentences
ranged from a five-year minimum to a 99-year maximum (Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, 1951: 8). </p>

<p>Underlying the inclusion of marihuana in the scheme of
increased penalties was the progression theory. In the Boggs
hearings many witnesses testified to the link between marihuana
use and ultimate heroin addiction. Commissioner Anslinger, for
example, testified: <br>
</p>

<p><i>The danger is this: Over 50 percent of these young addicts
started on marihuana smoking. They started there and graduated to
heroin; they took the needle when the thrill of marihuana was
gone </i>(Boggs Act Hearings, 1951: 206).<br>
</p>

<p>Representative Boggs himself summed up the stepping-stone
thesis in House floor debate:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Our younger people usually start on the road which leads to
drug addiction by smoking marihuana. They then graduate into
narcotic drugs-cocaine, morphine, and heroin. When these younger
persons become addicted to the drugs, heroin, for example, which
costs from $8 to $15 per day, they very often must embark on
careers of crime ... and prostitution ... in order to buy the
supply which they need</i> (Congressional Record, 1951:
8197-8198).<br>
</p>

<p>The stepping-stone theory thus supplanted the older hypotheses
which had linked marihuana to addiction, insanity and violent
crime. </p>

<p>In a paper filed as an exhibit to the hearings on the Boggs
Act, Dr. Harris Isbell, Director of Research at the Public Health
Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, stated that marihuana
was not physically addictive, although he paid lip service to the
psychological dependence hypothesis (Boggs Act Hearings, 1951:
147-148). </p>

<p>Acknowledging the possibility of &quot;temporary
psychosis&quot; in &quot;predisposed individuals,&quot; Isbell
otherwise disputed the crime and insanity thesis. Before the
Kefauver Committee in the Senate he testified that: </p>

<p><i>[M]arihuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated,
giggle, laugh, bother no one, and have a good time. They do not
stagger or fall, and ordinarily will not attempt to harm anyone. </i></p>

<p><i>It has not been proved that smoking marihuana leads to
crimes of violence or to crimes of a sexual nature. Smoking
marihuana has no unpleasant after-effects, no dependence is
developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped at
any time. In fact, it is probably easier to stop smoking
marihuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes </i>(Kefauver
Committee Hearings, 1951: 119). <br>
</p>

<p>Some observers felt that the narcotics problem had disappeared
almost entirely from the national scene after the Boggs Act was
passed. Nevertheless, state and federal law enforcement
authorities, armed with data suggesting that the strengthening of
the drug laws had at least halted the increase in drug use,
pressed for further increases in penalties in order to root out
the drug menace entirely (Federal Bureau of Narcotics. 1956: 28).
Without extended debate or widened public interest, Congress
passed the Narcotic Control Drug Act in 1956 (Daniel Committee
Hearings, 1955: 57). </p>

<p>There was less attention paid to marihuana during
Congressional debate in 1956 than had been the case in 1951. But,
the established precedent of classifying marihuana with hard
narcotics continued and resulted in a proliferation of marihuana
offenses and a, further increase in penalties based on the theory
that the end of the American narcotics experience could thereby
be assured. </p>

<p>However, efficacy of still higher penalties was not uniformly
accepted among law enforcement officials; the Deputy Commissioner
of the FBN suggested that more severe penalties might press grand
juries not to indict and the petty juries not to convict in drug
cases. Others rejected this view and felt strongly that more
severe penalties were imperative if society was to be rid of its
present peddlers and if new entrants into the narcotics business
were to be deterred (Good, July 31, 1954). </p>

<p>Among congressmen considering the Bill, there was no dissent
from the proposition that harsher penalties were the means to
eliminate the illicit use and sale of all drugs (Congressional
Record. 1956: 10689). </p>

<p>In addition to facilitating enforcement of narcotics laws
through a number of ancillary provisions, the Narcotics Control
Act of 1956 established the following penalties:<br>
</p>

    </tr>
</table>

<p>Parole or probation were made unavailable to all except first
offenders in the possession category (26 TTSC, 1964). </p>

<p>The Act also created a new offense by prohibiting illegal
importation of marihuana. Simple possession was by statute
sufficient to convict the possessor of knowingly receiving
illegally imported marihuana (21 USC, 1964). </p>

<p>Few legislators recognized that marihuana was in any way
different from the physically addictive narcotics. The House
Subcommittee on Narcotics, which produced what became the
essentials of the 1956 Act, had inserted a footnote to the major
heading &quot;Narcotics&quot; which stated in fine print that the
term narcotics included marihuana (U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News,
1956: 3294). Only once during the Congressional debates on the
House and Senate versions of the Bill was the subject of
marihuana as a separate substance even raised. </p>

<p>Moreover, in a statement reflecting the general acceptance of
the stepping-stone concept, Senator Daniel, Chairman of the
Senate Subcommittee that investigated the drug problem, described
marihuana: <br>
</p>

<p><i>That is a drug which starts most addicts In the use of
drugs, Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to some of
the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted to the
habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin habit and then to
the final destruction of the persons addicted </i>(U.S. Code
Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 1956: 3294).<br>
</p>

<p>By the fifties, marihuana had been fully integrated into the
narcotics legislation of every state in the Union and of the
national government. Possession of the drug, even for one's own
use, was a felony everywhere, and the user was subject to long
periods of incarceration as punishment for his indulgence.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1960-1970: NEW LEGISLATIVE APPROACH</b> </p>

<p>From the mid-fifties to the mid-sixties, federal activity in
marihuana and narcotic law enforcement was relatively stable. The
number of offenders apprehended and convicted in both areas
remained constant (U.S. Courts, 1956-1964). </p>

<p>However, in the early and mid-sixties a new phenomenon was
occurring. Drug abuse began to spread. It no longer confined
itself to the ghettos and certain socioeconomic and ethnic
groups; the new users were the sons and daughters of the middle
class. It began striking home at the average American and became
a national, major issue of concern (Rosevear, 1967: 117-131; U.S.
Bureau of Narcotics, 1966: 40). </p>

<p>The new middle class use of marihuana induced significant
medical inquiry into the nature of the drug and spurred a new
legislative approach. One commentator stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Nobody cared when it was a ghetto problem. Marihuana-well,
it was used by jazz musicians or the lower class, so you didn't
care if they got 2 to 20 years. But when a nice, middle-class
girl or boy in college gets busted for the same thing, then the
whole community sits up and takes notice. And that's the name of
the game today. The problem has begun to come home to roost-in
all strata of society, in suburbia, in middle-class homes, in the
colleges. Suddenly, the punitive, vindictive approach was
touching all classes of society. And now the most exciting thing
that's really happening is the change in attitude by the people.
Now we have a willingness to examine the problem as to whether
it's an experimentation, or an illness rather than 'an evil' </i>(New
York Times, Feb. 5, 1970: 14).<br>
</p>

<p>Congress initially acted by passage of the Drug Abuse Control
Amendments of 1965 (Public Law 89-74,1965). This legislation
established a Bureau of Drug Abuse Control within the Food and
Drug Administration and created criminal, misdemeanor penalties
for the illegal manufacture and sale of depressant and stimulant
drugs and hallucinogens. </p>

<p>The dramatic increase in the use of marihuana and other drugs
during the latter 1960's was a matter of high public visibility.
In response, President Johnson offered Reorganization Plan No. 1
of 1968 (H. Doe. No. 249,1968). This reorganization was effective
on April 8, 1968 and placed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (of
Treasury) and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (of FDA) in the
Department of Justice and designated it the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs. </p>

<p>What had been obvious with the passage of the 1965 Drug
Amendments became glaring with this reorganization, that is, the
tremendous disparity in penalties for violations involving
dangerous drugs as opposed to narcotics and marihuana. As a
result of increased medical and scientific inquiry, LSD and
several other drugs 'were acknowledged as being more powerful
hallucinogens than marihuana. </p>

<p>To compound the disparity, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
major active ingredient in marihuana, was placed under controls
whereby someone in unauthorized possession of THC was subject to
no penalty, but someone in possession of marihuana was subject to
a minimum mandatory penalty of two years imprisonment (Federal
Register, 1968: 14880). Congress then changed the possession
penalty, tinder the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, to a
misdemeanor and increased the penalties for sale or manufacture
of LSD and the other controlled drugs to up to five years (Public
Law 90-639, 1968). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, a great disparity regarding penalties for these
substances still existed. The atmosphere for change was ripe.
Adding pressure to the situation was the criminalization of
increasing numbers of young persons whose sole crime was
possession of marihuana for their own use. </p>

<p>In late 1968, the newly formed Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs drafted legislation which would nationalize
control of the drugs under the Bureau's jurisdiction. The
proposed law vested on the commerce clause rather than on the
taxing powers. </p>

<p>The change in authority was prophetic because the Leary
decision, which was handed down by the Supreme Court on May 19,
1969, held that the order form procedure necessary to meet the
requirements of the Marihuana Tax Laws, forced an individual to
incriminate himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment (Leary v.
U.S., 1969). Ostensibly, this decision left BNDD with no
marihuana possession law and was another factor in evidence of
the need for a revision of the law. </p>

<p>This new bill , H.R. 13742, covered the regulation of narcotic
drugs, &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; and marihuana. It was
transmitted by President Nixon on July 14, 1969. </p>

<p>Emerging from this legislation was an overall balanced scheme
of criminal penalties. Minimum mandatory offenses were
essentially abolished and the offense of possession of a
controlled substance for one's own use was made a misdemeanor.
Further, in first-offense, simple possession cases, the court was
given the discretion to place a defendant on probation, for up to
one year. If, at the end of the probation period, the defendant
bad not violated any of the conditions of the probation, his
conviction could be expunged. </p>

<p>The same misdemeanor penalty and opportunity for first
offender treatment was provided for the distribution of a small
amount of marihuana for either: (1) no remuneration; or (2) the
cost of the drug. </p>

<p>This provision was included in recognition of the large number
of such transactions which take place among youth and in
recognition of a phenomenon which surfaced as a substantial
challenge to the traditional picture of the national marihuana
trade. Legislators had formerly stereotyped the
&quot;seller&quot; as the vicious criminal pushing his wares for
high profit and felt that extraordinarily harsh penalties were
justified for sellers (Narcotics Legislation Hearings, 1969: 4). </p>

<p>But several studies showed that the structure of marihuana
traffic bore little or no relation to the traditional stereotype.
One survey of 204 users found that 44% had sold to friends at
least once. Many casual users sold to leave themselves enough
profit to cover the amount of their own use (Goode, 1969: 7).
Under the new Act, they would not be punished as distributors. </p>

<p>The new legislation also made a distinction between marihuana
and narcotic drugs. Marihuana was placed in a category with
hallucinogenic drugs and their difference from narcotics was
emphasized by the difference in penalties as follows:<br>

<p>* Distribution of small amounts of marihuana for no
remuneration is treated the same as simple possession.<br>
</p>

<p>The bill was passed by Congress (and signed into law by
President Nixon) on October 27, 1970, as the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. </p>

<p>In conjunction with this new federal law, a uniform state act
was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws and approved by them as the Uniform Controlled
Substances Act at their annual conference August 1-7, 1970. </p>

<p>The following statement in the preface of the Act explains its
purpose:<br>
</p>

<p>This Uniform Act was drafted to achieve uniformity between the
laws of the several states and those of the Federal Government.
it has been designed to complement the new federal narcotic and
dangerous drug legislation and Provide and interlocking trellis
of Federal and state law to enable government at all levels to
control more effectively the drug abuse problem. </p>

<p>The Uniform Act does not recommend penalties except with
respect to possession for one's own use. For such offenses, the
Conference recommended that it be treated as a misdemeanor. </p>

<p>To date, 26 states and three territories have adopted the Act
in its entirety or in a varied form. Currently, 10 to 15 states
are considering it. </p>

<p>The most recent chapter in the legal history of marihuana
appears in other pages of this Appendix. The appointment of the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse and the issuance
of its Report are themselves significant events from an
historical point of view.<br>

<p><b>National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>History of Alcohol Prohibition*</h1>

<p><b>*This section is based in large part on a paper prepared
for the Commission by Jane Lang McGrew, an attorney from
Washington, D.C. <br>
</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1920, the national policy of Prohibition began. The 18th
Amendment to the Constitution had been officially ratified:<br>
</p>

<p><i>It sought, by law, to make the whole Nation into enforced
teetotalers and to put an end to all evils associated with
drinking. It sought to eradicate a taste deeply rooted in the
habits and customs of a large part of the population through
outlawing the business that ministered to its satisfaction</i>
(Hu, 1950: 48).<br>
</p>

<p><b>1650-1750: THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS<br>
</b></p>

<p>In fact, it started earlier. &quot;Ministers shall not give
themselves to excess in drinkinge, or riott, or spending their
tyme idellye day or night,&quot; ruled the Virginia Colonial
Assembly in 1629 (Cherrington, 1920:16). </p>

<p>Massachusetts ordered that no person shall remain in any
tavern &quot;longer than necessary occasions&quot; in 1637, while
Plymouth Colony in 1633 prohibited the sale of spirits &quot;more
than 2 pence worth to anyone but strangers just arrived&quot;
(Cherrington, 1920: 18). </p>

<p>This sampling of the earliest colonial laws is representative
of the attempt, continued since those times, to control excessive
consumption. Excessive drinking, it was considered, produced
behavior unseemly in some, such as ministers, and dangerous in
others, such as Indians. </p>

<p>But drinking per se was not frowned upon. Indeed, when the
Puritans set sail to Massachusetts, they had taken care to carry
with them 42 tons of beer (in contrast with 14 tons of water) and
10,000 gallons of wine (Lee, 1963: 15). </p>

<p>The regulation of liquor consumption was a matter of
considerable concern in certain colonies. Thus, for a time,
Massachusetts went so far as to prohibit the drinking of healths
in 1638 (Lee, 1963: 19). The law was soon abandoned for reasons
obvious, albeit unrecorded. It rapidly became clear, however,
that liquor laws could do more and perhaps better, than control
consumption: they could provide a source of revenue. By the turn
of the 18th century, the regulatory impulse was concentrated on
fines, excise taxes and license fees. </p>

<p>Fines were imposed for drunken behavior, unlawful sales to a
drunken tippler or to Indians, and for selling without a license.
Court records indicate that these laws were enforced with
reasonable regularity (Krout 1967: 29-30). Licenses often carried
their own fees, and excise taxes were levied upon distilled
spirits as well as beer and fermented drink in many cases. </p>

<p>Until the 18th century, however, there was no attempt to
prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale, or consumption of
alcoholic beverages. Quite the contrary, at least one
individual-in some cases a reluctant individual-was required in
many towns to run the local inn or public house for visitors and
travelers. </p>

<p>Although colonial statutes made it clear that tipplers and
idlers were unwelcome, the diary of a colonial traveler, Sarah
Kemble Knight, suggests that such laws were unsuccessful in
containing the ribaldry which took place in many such houses.
Madam Knight complained:<br>
</p>

<p><i>I could get no sleep, because of the Clamor of some of the
Town Tope-ers in the next room.... I heartily fretted &amp;
wish't 'am tongue tyed.... They kept calling for Tother Gill, Wch
while they were swallowing, was some Intermission, But presently,
like Oyle to fire, encreased the flame </i>(Miller, Johnson,
eds., 1963: 430-431).<br>
</p>

<p>Persons other than Madam Knight were to become more outspoken
about their concern for the use of spirits. The, most significant
premonition was the Colony of Georgia's action in 1735 when the
first prohibitory statute against the importation of &quot;ardent
spirits&quot; was enacted. At the same time, however, the
consumption of beer was encouraged (Grant, 1932: 1). The time for
temperance had not yet arrived.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1750-1825: TEMPERANCE STIRRINGS<br>
</b></p>

<p>As the evils of intemperance began to attract the attention of
the ministry, John Wesley denounced the sin of distilling -and
declared for its Prohibition in 1773 (Cherrington, 1920: 37-38). </p>

<p>On his heels came the publication of a pamphlet entitled
&quot;The Mighty Destroyer Displayed and Some Account of the
Dreadful Havoc Made by the Mistaken Use, As Well As the Abuse, of
Distilled Spiritous Liquors,&quot; by Anthony Benezet, a member
of the Society of Friends, advising against the use of any drink
&quot;which is liable to steal away a man's senses and render him
foolish, irrascible, uncontrollable, and dangerous&quot;
(Cherrington, 1920: 38). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, typical of the century's ambivalence, the first
master at Harvard was fired when it was found that Harvard
students had been left &quot;wanting beer betwixt brewings a week
and a week and a half together&quot; (Lee, 1963: 16). </p>

<p>Concern for the effect of liquor upon the public weal was
expressed by John Adams who noted in his diary on February 29,
1760, that the taverns were &quot;becoming the eternal haunt of
loose, disorderly people . . .&quot; (Cherrington, 1920: 37).
Worst of all he continued: <br>
</p>

<p><i>... These houses are become the nurseries of our
legislators. An artful man, who has neither sense nor sentiments,
may, by gaining a little sway among the rabble of the town,
multiply taverns and dram shops and thereby secure the votes of
taverner and retailer and of all; and the multiplication of
taverns will make many, who may be induced to flip and rum, to
vote for any man whatever </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 215).<br>
</p>

<p>The health argument in behalf of temperance was first made by
Nathaniel Ames, in the 1752 edition of his Almanack, who wrote
that </p>

<p><i>Strong Waters were formerly used only by the Direction of
Physicians; but now Mechanicks and low-li'd Labourers drink Rum
like Fountain-Water, and they can infinitely better endure it
than the idle. unactive and sedentary Part of Mankind, but DEATH
is in the bottom of the cup of every one </i>(Lee, 1963: 22).<br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Benjamin Rush shared his concern, publishing in 1785 his
now famous &quot;Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon
the Human Body and Mind.&quot; Enumerating the diseases of the
body and mind which plague the drinker of distilled liquors, Dr.
Rush outlined the symptoms, including &quot;unusual garrulity,
unusual silence, captiousness ... an insipid simpering ...
profane swearing ... certain immodest actions&quot; and
&quot;certain extravagant acts which indicate a temporary fit of
madness&quot; (Rush, 1943: 323, 325-326). </p>

<p>Although the rumblings of the temperance movement were thus
perceptible in the late 18th century, there is no evidence that
its effects were felt. In 1766, it is recorded that the repeal of
the Stamp Act was greeted in Providence, Rhode Island with
&quot;32 of the most loyal, patriotic and constitutional
toasts&quot; (Lee, 1963: 18). Notwithstanding this evidence of
devotion to His Majesty. it was often thereafter the tavern which
provided the meeting places for the most defiant revolutionaries.
</p>

<p>Subsequently, when the colonial period disappeared into the
post-Revolutionary era, Alexander Hamilton adopted the idea
earlier effected by the individual colonies, to tax distilled
liquors for revenue purposes. In 1791 , the tax was enacted as
part of the Revenue Act. The following year, the Second Congress
of the United States added license fees for distilleries and
taxes on liquors distilled from imported materials. </p>

<p>Incensed by this federal action, farmers in Western
Pennsylvania mobbed revenue collectors and armed to resist this
intrusion by the new Federal Government. It required 15,000
militia to bring the so-called Whiskey Rebellion to an end
(Peterson, 1969: 119-120). Such was the first indication that the
liquor industry in the United States would be a force with which
the government would have to reckon. </p>

<p>Toward the end of the 18th century, a temperance movement, as
such, became discernible. The Methodist Church took a staunch
position against the sale or imbibing of ardent spirits
&quot;unless in cases of extreme necessity.&quot; Five years
later, in 1789, even the exception was excised (Cherrington,
1920: 50). A similar platform was adopted by the Presbyterian
Synod of Pennsylvania and by the Yearly Meeting of Friends of New
England (Cherrington, 1920: 51, 58). </p>

<p>On a non-clerical level, the movement began to organize.
Although there is some dispute as to the identity of the original
temperance society, it appears that as early as 1778, there was
an organization calling itself the Free African Society which
excluded men of drinking habits, followed soon thereafter by the
Organization of Brethren, and the Litchfield, Connecticut
Association of &quot;the most respectable farmers&quot; in
Connecticut determined to discourage the use of spirits
(Cherrington, 1920: 49, 58). </p>

<p>The turn of the century saw the vitalization of the temperance
spirit. Religious leaders, including Cotton Mather, Dr. Lyman
Beecher, John Wesley and Reverend Andrew Elliott inveighed
against the consumption of liquors. Temperance activity figured
prominently in the concerns of the Presbyterian, Methodist,
Universalist, Baptist, and Friends churches. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Had. the temperance reform in America awaited for a
non-church or a non-Christian leadership,&quot;</i> theorizes one
historian, </p>

<p><i>... the temperance revolution of the past century would yet
remain to be accomplished.... Every successful temperance
movement of the last century has been merely the instrument-the
machinery and equipment through which the fundamental principles
of the Christian religion have expressed themselves in terms of
life and action</i> (Cherrington, 1920:92).<br>
</p>

<p>Whatever the Christian input , however, it is also apparent
that a desire to reform was aroused in the country, very much
like that which was to be experienced a century later during the
Progressive Movement. Thus, Massachusetts Society for the
Suppression of Intemperance of 1813, damned not only rum, but all
of the &quot;kindred vices, profaneness and gambling&quot; and
beseeched members to &quot;discourage... by ... example and
influence, every kind of..... immorality&quot; (Lee, 1963: 23).
Mingling with the potential temperance leaders during this period
were the future spokesmen of abolitionism, feminism, and
utopianism. </p>

<p>In the meantime, the industry was able to report triumphantly
that the federal taxes on distilling and importing spirits were
repealed in 1802. From 1813 until 1817, the retailers' and
distillers' licenses bore a federal tax, but beginning in 1818
the industry enjoyed a tax-free era which was to last until 1862.
Thomas Jefferson rejoiced-&quot;as a moralist&quot;-explaining
that: </p>

<p><i>It is an error to view a tax on that liquor as merely a tax
on the rich. It is a prohibition of its use in the middling class
of our citizens, and a condemnation of them to the poison of
whisky, which is desolating their houses. No nation is drunken
where wine is cheap; and none sober, where the only antidote is
the bane of whisky </i>(Peterson, 1969: 122-123).<br>
</p>

<p>Future prohibitionists would likewise castigate the government
for drawing its revenues from the liquor industry and
participating in the profits of evil thereby.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1825-1870: THE PLEDGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Temperance was not always equated with teetotalism. Beer and
usually wine were initially exempt from denunciation in both
sermons and treatises. There developed in the mid-19th century,
however, the conviction that all brews, be they &quot;ardent
spirits,&quot; beer, ale, or wine, were anathema. </p>

<p>The, new temper of the movement was epitomized by the travels
of Father Theobald Matthew of Ireland who toured the United
States from 1849 to 1851, administering the pledge of total
abstinence to some 600,000 persons in 25 states. A White House
dinner and a Senate reception stamped official approval upon his
sojourns (Furnas, 1968: 80). Thus did temperance drift into a new
phase, with its ardent spokesman, Congressman Gerrit Smith,
crying that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>I would that no person were able to drink intoxicating
liquors without immediately becoming a drunkard. For, who, then
would . . . drink the poison that always kills, or jump into the
fire that always burns?</i> (Furnas, 1968: 15).<br>
</p>

<p>It was in this atmosphere that the first prohibition
experiments were undertaken on a statewide basis. &quot;Until the
liquor traffic is abolished . . . all efforts at moral reform
must languish,&quot; judged one of the earliest prohibitionists. </p>

<p>In &quot;Grappling with the Monster,&quot; T. S. Arthur
stated, &quot;The CURSE is upon us, and there is but one CURE:
Total Abstinence, by the help of God, for the Individual, and
Prohibition for the State&quot; (Furnas, 1968: 15). </p>

<p>In 1847, the first such cure was enacted for the state of
Maine (Cherrington, 1920: 134). (Actually, the first Prohibition
law went into effect in 1843 in the territory of Oregon. This was
repealed five years later.) </p>

<p>A wave of prohibition statutes followed. Delaware, on the
heels of Maine, passed its first prohibition law only to have it
declared unconstitutional the following year. Similar laws were
enacted in Ohio, Illinois, Rhode Island, Minnesota,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York during the
next few years. They met with varying fates, including veto by
the governors, repeal by the legislatures and invalidation by the
state supreme courts. </p>

<p>The evaluations by several historians of these early trials
were to he heard again in the 20th century: the enactments lacked
support from a large portion of the population, making
enforcement exceedingly difficult. Ultimately, all but one of the
states repealed the prohibition statutes of the 19th century
(Grant, 1932: 5; Peterson, 1969: 123). </p>

<p>Notwithstanding this record, prohibitionists took heart.
&quot;This thing is of God,&quot; cried Lyman Beecher from the
pulpit. &quot;That glorious Maine law was a square and grand blow
right between the horns of the Devil&quot; (Furnas, 1968: 167).
Temperance societies, established in all but three states by 1832
and destined to proliferate, began to consolidate as well. </p>

<p>The American Temperance Society, later to become the American
Temperance Union, was organized in 1826. It quickly begat
auxiliaries, so that by 1835, 8,000 locals existed (Cherrington,
1920: 92-93). </p>

<p>As the years passed, they witnessed the founding of more
temperance, organizations of a general and national character
than during any other period in the United States' history. The
Washingtonian movement, organized in the City of Baltimore in
1840, was followed by the Martha Washington movement in 1841. </p>

<p>The Sons of Temperance came into existence in 1842, at, the
same time the Order of Rechabites was organized, and the
Congressional Temperance Society of 1833 was revived on the basis
of total abstinence. They took heart at their early state,
successes and fought against the defeats of repeal. </p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the United States government, which
had heaped honors upon Father Matthew, concluded a treaty with
King Kamehameha III of Hawaii in 1850 permitting the introduction
and sale of liquor on his island. </p>

<p>As further evidence of the national dichotomy, Chicagoans in
the 1850's fought virulently against the enforcement of Sunday
closing laws. To protest, an armed mob burst into the business
district of the city, to be met by police. Fortunately, the mob
was dispersed before the mayor found it necessary to use the
cannon he had hurriedly planted around City Hall (Peterson, 1969:
120). </p>

<p>It was the time when patent medicines, 40 proof and more,
began to develop their clientele. And although the Demon Rum
might threaten their health and life, Lydia Pinkham's Compound
offered a cure for any and all ails and aches. </p>

<p>By the time of the Civil War, both the assimilative and
coercive traditions of the temperance movement had crystallized:
that is, temperance proponents were determined to save the weak
and to destroy the recalcitrant (Gusfield, 1963: 69-70). The
hardening of positions was accompanied by the development of
political consciousness in the movement and recognition of
political objectives. These processes were only temporarily
blunted by the Civil War in the 1860's and the diversion of
interest to the abolitionist cause. </p>

<p>Part of the heritage of the Civil War was the tax on liquor
and beer imposed in 1862. Rates were increased several times
between 1863 and 1868, so that the tax imposed at the rate of 20
cents per gallon rose to $2 per gallon. </p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon was noted by the Federal Government:
as the rates increased, the revenue did not. In fact, the number
of gallons reported actually declined. As the decade went on,
attempts were made to enforce the tax laws and in 1868, $25,000
was actually appropriated to detect violators. Fraud continued
almost unabated. Stockpiling of liquor was popular to hedge
against future, increases, for they were not applicable to liquor
on hand. </p>

<p>The infamous Whiskey Ring was active in these days and was not
finally broken up until 1875, when, in a peak of nerve, members
established a corruption fund in the District of Columbia to halt
the prosecution of 321 persons charged with violations of the
revenue laws. Before then, however, Congress apparently had
second thoughts about the implications of the revenue collections
and reduced the tax from the high of $2 per gallon to 50 cents in
1869. The happy result was to see a rise in collections from
$13.5 million in 1868, to $45 million in 1869, and $55 million
the following year. Taking further precautions, the government
stipulated that new stamps be developed to preclude
counterfeiting and tampering (History of the Alcohol 14-20;
Cherrington, 1920: 156162). </p>

<p>Congress did not escape unscathed by criticism and reaction.
It came from both sides of the temperance issue. Temperance
advocates such as Senator Wilson of Massachusetts and Senator
Pomeroy of Kansas decried the fact that federal revenues would be
drawn from the liquor industry. </p>

<p>At the same, time, however, the industry revolted, leading to
mass tax evasion schemes and devices and the organization of
their first industry lobby, the United States Brewers
Association. The Association rapidly launched a, legislative
campaign and succeeded in 1863 in reducing the tax rate of beer
from $1 to 60 cents (Cherrington, 1920:157). </p>

<p>By 1870, the Civil War dust had cleared and the temperance
battle lines were drawn, already tested by the skirmishes of the
1840's and 1850's. The most interesting feature of their war
strategy was soon to become apparent: women and children were
welcomed at the battlements.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1870-1913: TOWARD A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE </b></p>

<p>A series of &quot;isms&quot; was aroused in this era:
feminism, unionism, socialism, and progressivism. Prohibition
absorbed elements of them all, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The feminist movement originated early in the 1800's. Until
the 1870's, however, feminine involvement in the temperance
effort was largely peripheral. The Women's Crusade of 1873 and
the organization of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in
1874 marked the formal entrance of women into the temperance
movement.<br>
</p>

<p>The WCTU was devotedly headed by Frances E. Willard, a lady
equally committed to the principle of equality of the sexes.
Temperance was to bridge the gap, she believed:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Drink and tobacco are the great separatists [sic] between
men and women. Once they used these things together, but woman's
evolution has carried her beyond them; man will climb to the same
level . . . but meanwhile ... the fact that he permits himself
fleshly indulgence that he would deprecate in her, makes their
planes different, giving her an instinct of revulsion </i>(Furnas,
1968: 281).<br>
</p>

<p>Although the WCTU was organized initially around the
temperance issue, it was not long before Miss Willard's
leadership expanded its conscience. </p>

<p>A statement of principles was adopted in its early years: </p>

<p><i>We believe in a living wage; in an 8-hour day; in courts of
conciliation and arbitration, in justice as opposed to greed in
gain; in &quot;Peace on Earth and Good Will to Men&quot;</i>
(Gusfield, 1963: 76).<br>
</p>

<p>Within three years of its inception, the WCTU reported that
its concerns included &quot;a better Indian policy&quot; and
&quot;wiser civil service reform&quot; (Gusfield, 1963: 77).
There were those in the Union who felt that their interests
should be limited to temperance. But, forecasting the mood of
Progressivism, Miss Willard steered the organization along the
broader lines to social reform. </p>

<p>The WCTU was responsible for part of the early campaign to
educate the public about temperance. Children were recruited to
sing praises of &quot;the true and the brave&quot; who signed the
abstinence pledge. They were assisted in this effort by
McGuffey's Readers which denounced the licensing of liquor stores
and saloons:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Licensed-to do thy neighbor harm,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to kindle hire and strife,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to nerve the robber's arm,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-to whet the murderer's knife,</i> </p>

<p><i>Licensed-like spider for a fly,</i> </p>

<p><i>To spread thy nets for man, thy prey,</i> </p>

<p><i>To mock his struggles, crush his soul,</i> </p>

<p><i>Then cast his worthless form away </i>(Lee, 1963: 34-35).<br>
</p>

<p>Whiskey makes &quot;the happy miserable&quot; and impoverishes
the rich, the, McGuffey books concluded. And the word spread. By
1902, the temperance campaign had permeated the public school
systems: every state but Arizona had introduced compulsory
temperance education. Their texts teemed with both facts and
misinformation such as &quot;Alcohol sometimes causes the coats
of the blood vessels to grow thin. They are then liable at any
time to cause death by bursting.&quot; (Sinclair, 1962: 43). </p>

<p>The WCTU was not carrying the burden of reform alone, however.
In 1869, the National Prohibition Party was born. Three years
later, the first party ticket was put forth in the presidential
campaign of 1872, headed by John Black, who received 5,607 votes
for President. Success at the polls ultimately peaked in 1892
when John Dedwell, the Prohibition presidential candidate,
received a total of 270,710 votes. Thereafter, its partisans
declined in number, having failed to break voters away from their
traditional affiliations (Cherrington, 1920: 165-169). </p>

<p>As a rule, the WCTU eschewed partisanship. Their objectives
were far broader and more practical than those contemplated by
the Prohibition Party. Only once it supported the Prohibition
Party in the notorious election of 1884. </p>

<p>The election of 1884 carried a variety of implications for
future candidates on the temperance issue. In New York City
alone, 1,007 primaries and conventions reportedly were held by
the various parties. Of these, over 60% took place in saloons
(Peterson, 1969: 123), recalling to mind the complaint of John
Adams a century before (Cherrington, 1920: 37; Dobyns, 1940:
215). The meeting places were indicative of the fact that at this
time neither party could afford to adopt a dry plank in its
platform, for New York would be a pivotal state in the race
between Republican James G. Blaine and Democrat Grover Cleveland.
</p>

<p>Blaine campaigned hard, trying to overcome the defection of
several thousand dry Republicans to the Prohibition Party.
Speaking in behalf of Blaine at a New York City rally,
Presbyterian minister Samuel Burchard denounced the Democrats as
the party of &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.&quot; Needless
to say, the Catholic vote, as well as the wet vote, quickly
swelled the Democratic totals. Blaine, having thus alienated both
wets and drys, lost the state--and the election-by a tiny margin
(Furnas, 1968: 273; Lee, 1963: 29-30). </p>

<p>In case the lesson that temperance was an issue to be reckoned
with in national politics was lost on the parties after 1884, the
events of the decade culminating in the birth of the Anti-Saloon
League in 1895, dramatized the point. A second wave of state
prohibition laws was experienced between 1880 and 1890. The
results of much of the legislation during those years were less
than satisfying to temperance advocates, however; only six states
emerged with state-wide prohibition by statute or constitutional
amendment. Numerous other states had enacted local option, which
permitted towns to go dry if they so chose by referendum. Without
state or federal insulation from wet communities, however, the
so-called dry towns were scarcely temperance models. </p>

<p>In the wake of these state legislative actions, South Carolina
introduced a state dispensary system in order to eliminate the
motive of private gain from the liquor business. Political
scandals which quickly developed tended to discredit it, however,
if indeed it had enjoyed much support from any corner
(Cherrington, 1920: 250-251). </p>

<p>With this discomfiting history behind it, the Anti-Saloon
League arose to the challenge, while Carrie Nation independently
thrust her way into the public eye. The League was to develop the
art of lobbying or &quot;pressure political&quot; to its most
dramatic heights. Scarcely more than 10 years after organization,
it was described as &quot;the most dangerous political movement
that this country has ever known&quot; by the National Model
License League, a wet (and harassed) association. A more rational
viewpoint was expressed by the president of the New York State
Brewers Association in 1913: </p>

<p><i>We are not dealing with a theory which is the delusion of
the fanatic alone, but with a real condition which is in the
hands of a well organized force, led by aggressive, experienced,
and untiring leaders </i>(Odegard, 1928: 23).<br>
</p>

<p>The focus of the League's indictments included not simply
alcohol, but the saloon itself, as the purveyor of spirits. The
myriad League publications denounced the saloon for <i>&quot;annually
sending thousands of our youths to destruction, for corrupting
politics, dissipating workmen's wages, leading astray 60,000
girls each year into lives of immorality and banishing children
from school&quot;</i> (Odegard, 1928: 40-59). </p>

<p><i>&quot;Liquor is responsible for 19% of the divorces, 25% of
the poverty, 25% of the insanity, 37% of the pauperism, 45% of
child desertion, and 50% of the crime in this country,&quot;</i>
the League determined. <i>&quot;And this,&quot;</i> it concluded
, <i>&quot; is a very conservative estimate&quot;</i> (Odegard,
1928: 60). </p>

<p>League posters appeared everywhere depicting the saloon-keeper
as a profiteer who feasted on death and enslavement. Others
screamed out the dire consequences of alcohol. &quot;Alcohol
inflames the passions, thus making the temptation to sex-sin
unusually strong,&quot; advertised one (Sinclair, 1962: 51). </p>

<p>It was the League which geared up the campaign, but it was not
alone. As the Progressive spirit caught the national interest in
the early 19th century, the movement for reform embraced the
cause of temperance. The temperance movement assumed an aura of
evangelism, combining the concept of America's mission with the
vision of Messianism. Through the combination of temperance and
progressivism, it was believed that the Kingdom of God could
actually come to the United States.<br>
</p>

<p>In an article in Appleton's Magazine in 1908, the Reverend
Charles F. Aked articulated the aspirations of the reformers: </p>

<p><i>We are spending our lives, many of us, in the effort to
make the world a little better and brighter for those that shall
come after us.... we want to open out life and liberty to all the
sons of men. We want to make possible for all of life in the
whole, the good and the beautiful ... and the common sale of
intoxicating liquor renders our work a thousand times more
difficult ... </i>(Timberlake, 1063: 34-38).<br>
</p>

<p>Others were more mundane. Scientists began accumulating
evidence of the effect of quantities of alcohol on the nervous
system and general physical condition. The myth that alcohol
consumption improved muscular power was exploded. The
relationship between mental psychoses and alcohol was documented,
and thus did the condemnation of alcohol as a poison assume
scientific support. Finally, in 1915, whiskey and brandy were
discreetly removed from the list of authoritative medicinal drugs
contained in the United States Pharmacopoeia (Timberlake, 1963:
47). </p>

<p>Who were the people fueling the movement? Largely middle
class, rural, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant comprised the temperance
movement and they confronted the urban and industrial communities
head-on. &quot;The Anglo-Saxon stock is the best improved,
hardiest and fittest.... [I]f we are to preserve this nation and
the Anglo-Saxon type we must abolish [saloons],&quot; proclaimed
one temperance publication (Gusfield, 1963: 100). Calling itself
&quot;The Protestant church in action&quot; (Sinclair, 1962:
108), the Anti-Saloon League concentrated single-mindedly and
evangelically on the cause of temperance and refrained from
dabbling in other reforms (Gusfield, 1963: 108). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Episcopal and Lutheran churches never
aligned themselves with the AntiSaloon League, while Jewish and
Catholic groups generally opposed their objective. The conviction
shared by Anti-Saloon Leaguers expressed by Reverend Francis
Ascott McBride was: &quot;The League was born of God&quot; (Lee,
1963: 35). Thus one had to be for or against the movement; there
was no half-way commitment. </p>

<p>When the sides were lined up initially, industrialists and
union leaders alike preferred to keep God on their side. From the
company's point of view, the saloon was often responsible for
industrial injuries and absenteeism. Some believed that the
drinking man demanded higher wages than his sober counterparts.
Furthermore, union locals tended to congregate in saloon meeting
halls maintained for that purpose and, it was sometimes
suspected, for the plottings of anarchistic conspirators (Furnas,
1968: 310). </p>

<p>Accordingly, it was not long before industry moved from an
acquiescent position to an active role in the temperance
movement. Various methods were adopted to encourage sobriety,
including lectures, literature and job preferences for
teetotalers. Businessmen opined that sobriety expanded
productivity, increased bank deposits, improved collections and
stimulated the retail trade (Timberlake, 1963: 67-79). </p>

<p>At the same time, the prospect of diverting patronage of the
liquor industry to other products tantalized some industries.
Thus the Welch Grape Juice Company advertised:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Get the Welch Habit-It's one that won't get you!</i>
(Timberlake, 1963: 77).<br>
</p>

<p>Opinion was not unanimous, of course. Businessmen, including
bankers, whose interests were tied to the liquor industry could
ill afford to be beneficent toward temperance. Others, including
the DuPonts, Rockefellers, Kresges, and Wanamakers spent freely
to cover the League's annual campaign costs of $2.5 million
(Odegard, 1928: 126). </p>

<p>As surely as liquor was the enemy of the home, it was also
proclaimed the enemy of the working man. &quot;The great sinkhole
for the workers' wages is the saloon,&quot; wrote the editors of
one League publication, The California Liberator. &quot;When that
abomination is destroyed, labor is freed from its greatest
curse&quot; (Odegard, 1928: 53). The logic appealed to the union
leadership. According to one official of the American Federation
of Labor: <br>
</p>

<p><i>No force in our country has been as effective in the
promotion of temperance among working people as the organized
labor movement. The labor movement has achieved more for the
cause of temperance than all the temperance societies combined
... </i>(Timberlake, 1963: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>Since similar credit has been claimed for the League, the
Protestant church, and business interests, it is difficult to
apportion the plaudits. Subsequent events suggest that the labor
interests failed to live up to this claim, however. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding Terrence V. Powerderly's early speech against
&quot;the strong right hand of labor itself . . . that carries
with it the rum which drowns reason,&quot; his own Knights of
Labor repealed their constitutional provision which denied
membership to anyone connected with the liquor trade (Timberlake,
1963: 85-86). </p>

<p>As the reports of the National Commission on Enforcement of
the Prohibition Laws (known as the &quot;Wickersham
Commission&quot;) were later to record, it was particularly the
workers who resented the paternal legislation which they believed
was directed at them and their habits (National Commission on Law
Observance, 1931: 345). </p>

<p>In addition, there were. those whose livelihoods would be
directly affected-indeed, effaced-by the success of the campaign:
brewery workers, bartenders, glass workers, waiters, and
musicians among others.<br>
</p>

<p>Thus, even though the Socialist Party resolved in 1908 that <i>&quot;any
excessive indulgence in intoxicating liquors by members of the
working class is a serious obstacle to the triumph of our cause
since it impairs the vigor of the fighters in political and
economic struggle&quot; </i>(Timberlake, 1963: 98), the
industrial urban centers of the country continued to harbor and
stimulate antagonism towards the temperance movement.<br>
</p>

<p>The identification of the saloon and its offerings with the
urban, immigrant working class further enraged Prohibitionists.
As one sociologist observed, &quot;The saloon appeared as the
symbol of a culture which was alien to the ascetic character of
American values . . .&quot; (Gusfield, 1963: 100). Thus,
Americanism became a central issue in the temperance movement. </p>

<p>One temperance spokesman, cited in Barker's &quot;The Saloon
Problem,&quot; vented these sentiments:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The influx of foreigners into our urban centers, many of
whom have liquor habits [sic], is a menace to good government. .
. . [T] he foreign born population is largely under the social
and political control of the saloon. If the cities keep up their
rapid growth they will soon have the balance of political power
in the nation and become storm centers of political life </i>(Timberlake,
1963: 118).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1913-1933: NATIONAL PROHIBITION -- PROLOGUE AND FINISH<br>
</b></p>

<p>The distrust of the immigrant population became more
pronounced as the economic, political, and social power of the
cities developed. It was given a strong impetus by the
anti-German tremors which shook the country in a mood of
anticipation before World War 1. </p>

<p>The United States Brewers Association misread the prevailing
temper and associated itself with the German-American Alliance to
oppose the temperance advocates and defend German kultur in the
United States. </p>

<p>As the United States came closer to war, the antipathy which
developed against the Central Powers was directed with equal
force against brewers and tipplers (Furnas, 1968: 334-35) :<br>
</p>

<p><i>Pro-Germanism is the only froth from the German's beer
saloon. Our German Socialist Party and the German American
Alliance are the spawn of the saloon. . . . Prohibition is the
infallible submarine chaser </i>(Sinclair, 1962:122).<br>
</p>

<p>The war gave the prohibition cause new ammunition. Literature
depicted brewers and licensed retailers as treacherously stabbing
American soldiers in the back. Raw materials and labor were being
diverted from the war effort to an industry which debilitated the
nation's capacity to defend itself. It was urged that wartime
prohibition would stop the waste of grain and molasses and would
remove a handicap on workers' efficiency. </p>

<p>&quot;Liquor is a menace to patriotism because it puts beer
before country,&quot; preached Prohibitionist Wayne Wheeler
(Odegard, 1928: 72). The fact that names Pabst, Schlitz, and
Blatz broadcast their national origin only did further injury to
their interests. </p>

<p>In this atmosphere the Wartime Prohibition Act was passed in
1918. It followed a series of federal laws such as the Wilson
Original Packages Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act, attempts to
protect dry states from their wet neighbors. </p>

<p>The Wilson Original Packages Act was passed on August 8, 1890,
and provided that all intoxicating beverages shipped interstate
would be subject to the laws of the destination state upon
arrival. No mechanism for federal enforcement was provided. </p>

<p>The Webb-Kenyon Act, enacted March 1, 1913, was intended to
reinforce the 1890 Act by providing that it was a violation of
federal law to ship an intoxicating beverage interstate with the
intent that it be used or sold in any manner in violation of the
laws of the destination state. The lack of federal enforcement
rendered the statute virtually meaningless. </p>

<p>The Reed Amendment, enacted four years later, provided a fine
of $1,000 for transporting liquor into a dry state with no
greater effect. </p>

<p>None of the earlier acts met with substantial success in
curbing the flow of liquor into purportedly dry regions, but they
did mark a change in federal policy. Formerly liquor laws were
designed solely to produce federal revenue; Congress now took
cognizance of the role it could play in the regulation of
consumption. </p>

<p>The role was actually forced upon a reluctant Congress at
first. Indeed, the government had passed up numerous prior
opportunities to involve itself in the temperance movement as
such. The particular part it was to play was forecast by the Sons
of Temperance who, in 1856, declared themselves for national
constitutional prohibition. </p>

<p>Twenty years later, Congressman Henry Blair of New Hampshire
introduced a prohibition amendment to the Constitution for the
first time in Congress. As a senator, he introduced another such
resolution in 1885, along with Senator Preston Plum of Kansas.
After consideration by the Senate Committee on Education, the
bill was reported out favorably and placed on the Senate Calendar
in 1886. Nevertheless, no action resulted (Cherrington, 1920: 317
). </p>

<p>In the meantime, states continued the struggle between the
wets and the drys, with great success for the temperance
advocates. By 1913, nine states were under stateside prohibition.
In 31 other states, local option laws were in effect. By reason
of these and other variants of regulatory schemes, more than 50%
of the United States population was then under prohibition. </p>

<p>The national constitutional campaign was resumed as such in
1913 when the Anti-Saloon League went on record at its 15th
National Convention in favor of immediate prosecution of the
objective of constitutional amendment. </p>

<p>The National Temperance Council, founded at the same time,
coordinated the activities of numerous temperance organizations
with the same object. In 1913, the demands of the League were
formally presented to Congress by the Committee of 1,000. </p>

<p>The measure was then introduced in the House by Congressman
Thompson and in the Senate by Senator Sheppard. The following
year, the first joint resolution failed to secure the necessary
two thirds majority for submitting a constitutional amendment to
the states. A second resolution was submitted in 1915 and
favorably considered by the Judiciary Committees of both houses,
but neither ever came to a vote. </p>

<p>Ultimately, in 1917, the resolution to prohibit the
manufacture, sale, transportation or importation of alcoholic
beverages in the United States was approved by Congress and sent
to the states for ratification (Cherrington, 1920: 317-330). </p>

<p>It took only one year and eight days for the 18th Amendment to
secure the necessary ratification. On January 8, 1918,
Mississippi proudly became the first state to ratify, and on
January 16, 1919, Nebraska completed the job as the 36th state
(Lee, 1963: 42). By the end of February 1919, there remained only
three hold-outs: New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island
(Cherrington, 1920: 330). </p>

<p>October 28, 1919, was the day that Congress enacted the
National Prohibition Act-more often known as the Volstead
Act-with the intent to give effect to the new constitutional
amendment. Officially, the liquor drought was to begin on January
17, 1920. The celebrants of the occasion were concentrated in the
membership of the Anti-Saloon League, which could rightly claim
that its consummate skill in pressure politics had maneuvered the
country into its dry state. </p>

<p>The early experience of the Prohibition era gave the
government a taste of what was to come. In the three months
before the 18th Amendment became effective, liquor worth half a
million dollars was stolen from Government warehouses. By
midsummer of 1920, federal courts in Chicago were overwhelmed
with some 600 pending liquor violation trials (Sinclair, 1962:
176-177). Within three years, 30 prohibition agents were killed
in service. </p>

<p>Other statistics demonstrated the increasing volume of the
bootleg trade. In 1921, 95,933 illicit distilleries, stills,
still works and fermentors were seized. in 1925, the total jumped
to 172,537 and up to 282,122 in 1930. In connection with these
seizures, 34,175 persons were arrested in 1921; by 1925, the
number had risen to 62,747 and to a high in 1928 of 75,307
(Internal Revenue, Service, 1921, 1966, 1970: 95, 6, 73).
Concurrently, convictions for liquor offenses in federal courts
rose from 35,000 in 1923 to 61,383 in 1932. </p>

<p>The law could not quell the continuing demand for alcoholic
products. Thus, where legal enterprises could no longer supply
the demand, an illicit traffic developed, from the point of
manufacture to consumption. The institution of the speakeasy
replaced the institution of the saloon. Estimates of the number
of speakeasies throughout the United States ranged from 200,000
to 500,000 (Lee, 1963: 68). </p>

<p>Writers of this period point out that the law was circumvented
by various means. Although there may have been legitimate,
medicinal purposes for whiskey, the practice of obtaining a
medical prescription for the illegal substance was abused. It is
estimated that doctors earned $40 million in 1928 by writing
prescriptions for whiskey. </p>

<p>The legal system was equally evasive; the courts convicted
about seven percent of those charged with liquor violations
(Sinclair, 1962: 193-195; Dobyns, 1940: 292). The exception for
sacramental wine from protection under the Volstead Act also
invited abuse. In 1925, the Department of Research and Education
of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ reported that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The withdrawal of wine on permit from bonded warehouses for
sacramental purposes amounted in round figures to 2,139,000
gallons in the fiscal year 1922; 2,503,500 gallons in 1923; and
2,944,700 gallons in 1924. There is no way of knowing what the
legitimate consumption of fermented sacramental wine is but it is
clear that the legitimate demand does not increase 800,000
gallons in two years </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 297).<br>
</p>

<p>The smuggling trade was revived with new vigor and new
incentives. Rum-runners, often under foreign flags, brought
liquor into the country from Belgium and Holland. In 1923, there
were 134 seizures of such vessels. The following year, 236 were
apprehended (History of the Alcohol . . . 928). With fewer risks,
liquor was readily smuggled across the Canadian border. One way
or the other, the Department of Commerce estimated that, as of
1924, liquor valued at approximately $40 million was entering the
United States annually (Sinclair, 1962: 198).<br>
</p>

<p>The manufacture of &quot;near-beer&quot; and industrial
alcohol provided other opportunities for diversion from licit
channels, while the salvage of the California grape industry was
section 29 of the Volstead Act (27 U.S.C.  46) which authorized
the home production of fermented fruit juices. Although the
section was allegedly inserted to save the vinegar industry and
the hard cider of America's farmers, it was welcomed by home
winemakers as well. In the spirit of cooperation, the grape
growers even produced a type of grape jelly suggestively called
&quot;Vine-go&quot; which, with the addition of water, could make
a strong wine within two months (Sinclair, 1962: 206). </p>

<p>One of the great ironies of the prohibition era was the fact,
noted by the Wickersham Commission, that women happily took to
drink during the experimental decade, and, what is more, did so
in public. As the counterpart of the WCTU, the Women's
Organization for National Prohibition Reform was founded, stating
in its declaration of principles that Prohibition was &quot;wrong
in principle&quot; and <i>&quot;disastrous in consequences in the
hypocrisy, the corruption, the tragic loss of life and the
appalling increase of crime which has attended the abortive
attempt to enforce it&quot; </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 107). </p>

<p>Drinking at an earlier age was also noted, particularly during
the first few years of Prohibition. The superintendents of eight
state mental hospitals reported a larger percentage of young
patients during Prohibition (1919-1926) than formerly. One of the
hospitals noted: &quot;During the past year (1926), an unusually
large group of patients who are of high school age were admitted
for alcoholic psychosis&quot; (Brown, 1932:176). </p>

<p>In determining the age at which an alcoholic forms his
drinking habit, it was noted: &quot;The 1920-1923 group were
younger than the other groups when the drink habit was
formed&quot; (Pollock, 1942: 113).<br>

<p>To be sure, the Volstead Act was enforced in the United States
wherever it had popular support. In the rural South and West
prohibition was effective and in some cases still is. The
failures of prohibition enforcement were spotlighted in the big
cities where the law was flagrantly defied and in the smaller
towns, populated by miners and industrial workers, where the law
was simply ignored (National Commission on Law Observance, 1931:
345). </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the weak enforcement of the Volstead Act, some
believe that it was only the coming of the Depression with its
demand for increased employment and tax revenues which finally
killed the experiment (Gusfield, 1963: 127). Others observe that
Prohibition was a by-product of the stress and excesses of war
and could not have survived in peacetime even under optimal
economic conditions (Sinclair, 1962: 23-24). Finally, there are
those who accuse the selfishly motivated businessmen of the
United States for repeal which they allegedly brought about
through the same high-pressure tactics so successfully employed
by the partisans of temperance in the preceding decades (Dobyns,
1940: 5-130 passim). </p>

<p>Despite mixed motivations, the repeal movement was financed
and driven by the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment
(AAPA). </p>

<p>The members declared that &quot;the principal business and
objective of the Association shall be to educate its members as
to the fundamental provisions, objects and purposes of the
Constitution of the United States&quot; (Dobyns, 1940: 5). They
worked for the election of Congressmen who agreed to submit the
question of repeal to a vote of the people in each state. They
were successful fund-raisers and by January 1, 1931, had almost
$3 million in cash in the bank (Dobyns, 1940: 9). </p>

<p>The sources of the funds included a number of converts from
the dry cause. In 1928, the DuPont family abandoned the drys,
followed in 1932 by John D. Rockefeller and S. S. Kresge
(Gusfield, 1963: 128). Their conversion was effected under the
strong influence of the income tax. Doggedly, Pierre S. DuPont
circulated a brochure concluding that &quot;the British liquor
policy applied in the United States would permit the total
abolition of the income tax both personal and corporate&quot;
(Dobyns, 1940: 22). </p>

<p>Concern for the effects of the prohibition laws was not
limited to the private, wealthy sector. In 1928, a dry-wet
confrontation emerged in the presidential election between Alfred
E. Smith, a Catholic New Yorker, and Herbert Hoover. Hoover
solemnly praised the &quot;great social and economic
experiment&quot; and tightened his grip on the dry vote.<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the popular image of Smith as a staunch wet,
his platform tried to avoid any outright repeal sentiment. He
asked instead for an amendment of the Volstead Act which would
provide a &quot;scientific definition of the alcoholic content of
an intoxicating beverage.&quot; This would enable each state to
interpret and apply the federal standard within its borders. In
addition, he favored what was to be known as the &quot;state
store&quot; system of manufacturing and dispensing alcoholic
beverages (Lee, 1963: 212).<br>
</p>

<p>In retrospect, it is difficult to ascertain whether it was the
religious campaign or the dry campaign which defeated Al Smith.
H. L. Mencken may have written accurately that &quot;if [Al
Smith] loses, it will be because those who fear the Pope
outnumber those who are tired of the Anti-Saloon League&quot;
('Sinclair, 1962: 303). Nevertheless, Prohibition survived the
1928 election, as did Hoover's campaign pledge to establish a
commission to investigate the conditions under Prohibition. Head
of the Commission was George W. Wickersham, former Attorney
General under Taft. Although the Commission's purpose was set
forth as an examination of the problems of enforcement, it soon
decided to undertake much broader policy considerations. </p>

<p>The Commission's report, published in 1931, included opinion
surveys, statistics on the number of deaths connected with
enforcement efforts, testimony by consultants and experts, and an
analysis of the organization, personnel and methods of
prohibition enforcement. On the basis of the five volume report,
the Wickersham Commission ironically concluded in its summary
that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There have been more sustained pressures to enforce this
law than on the whole has been true of any other federal statute,
although this pressure in the last four or five years has met
with increasing resistance as the sentiment against prohibition
has developed . . . . That a main source of difficulty is in the
attitude of at least a very large number of respectable citizens
in most of our large cities and in several states, is made more
clear when the enforcement of the national prohibition act is
compared with the enforcement of the laws as to narcotics. There
is an enormous margin of profit in breaking the latter. The means
of detecting transportation are more easily evaded than in the
case of liquor. Yet there are no difficulties in the case of
narcotics beyond those involved in the nature of the traffic
because the laws against them are supported everywhere by a
general and determined public sentiment </i>(Sinclair, 1962:
367-368).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this dire analysis, 10 out of the 11
commissioners signed a summary of conclusions of the report which
stated that the Commission as a whole opposed the repeal of the
18th Amendment, the entry of the Federal or state governments
into liquor business, or even the modification of national
prohibition to permit the sale of light wines and beer (Sinclair,
1962: 364). </p>

<p>Walter Lippmann commented, &quot;What was done was to evade a
direct and explicit official confession that Federal prohibition
is a hopeless failure&quot; (Sinclair, 1962: 365). Whether or not
Lippmann correctly read the Commission's intentions, there was
clearly a gap between the input and the outcome of the report. </p>

<p>It is difficult to assess the relative numbers of the wet and
dry partisans during the last few years of national prohibition.
In terms of strength, however, the wets surely had the edge which
less than two decades before had belonged to the drys. The new
wet strength showed up at the National Convention of the
Democratic party held in Chicago in 1932, where Mayor Cermak of
that city filled the galleries with his supporters. And, though
Franklin D. Roosevelt had wooed the dry vote for some time, he
now came forward on a platform which favored the outright repeal
of the 18th Amendment. Accepting his nomination, he stated:<br>
</p>

<p><i>I congratulate this convention for having had the courage,
fearlessly to write into its declaration of principles what an
overwhelming majority here assembled really thinks about the 18th
Amendment. This convention wants repeal. Your candidate wants
repeal. And I am confident that the United States of America
wants repeal </i>(Dobyns, 1940: 160).<br>
</p>

<p>While dry leaders looked on with disgust, Roosevelt was
elected president and Congress turned a somersault. The repeal
amendment was introduced February 14, 1933, by Sen. Blaine of
Wisconsin and approved two days later by the Senate 63 to 23. The
House followed four days later, voting 289 to 121 to send the
amendment on to the States (Lee, 1963: 231). It required approval
by 36 states. Michigan was the first state to ratify it; 39
states voted, on the amendment during 1933, with 37 approving its
ratification and two-North and South Carolina-voting against its
ratification. The final ratification was accomplished on November
7,1933, when Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Utah gave their
approval. </p>

<p>Congress officially adopted the 21st Amendment to the
Constitution on December 5, 1933. </p>

<p>Within three weeks of taking office, President Roosevelt
witnessed the first sales of 3.2 beer, following a redefinition
by statute of the terms &quot;intoxicating liquors.&quot; The
more popular, higher alcohol-content beer was relegalized by
Congress under the Cullen-Harrison Act. Sale of beer became legal
on April 7, 1933, in the District of Columbia and the 20 states
where state laws did not prohibit its sale. During the next four
years the remaining states changed their laws to permit its sale,
with Alabama and Kansas in 1937, as the last to join the legal
sale ranks. <br>
</p>

<p>The job of total repeal was accomplished with the help of the
determined AAPA during the succeeding year. Their lawyers
assisted the states in preparing bills for conventions and
release of various forms of political propaganda, thereby
enacting a serious satire on the 1919 campaign launched by the
Anti-Saloon League. Notwithstanding their high and enduring
constitutional principles, on December 31, 1933, with repeal a
reality, the AAPA ceased to exist and sent its files to the
Library of Congress. &quot;Having attained its objective . . .
the Association resisted the temptation to linger on as a
'sentinel of American liberty' '', the New York Times observed in
the organization's obituary (Dobyns, 1940: 132). <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>PROHIBITION IN PERSPECTIVE</b> </p>

<p>During 13 years, what did Prohibition accomplish? There is no
single compilation of Prohibition statistics which would enable
us to determine the degree of success which Prohibition enjoyed
during its lifetime. </p>

<p>In discussing the relative successes and failures of
Prohibition, most observers conclude that the undertaking failed.
&quot;Prohibition destroyed the manufacturing and distributive
agencies through which the demand for liquor had been legally
supplied. But the demand remained&quot; (Hu, 1950: 51). </p>

<p>In its Report on the Enforcement of the Prohibition Laws of
the United States, the Wickersham Commission concluded that the
country had prohibition in law but not in fact. They reported:<br>
</p>

<p><i>There was general prevalence of drinking in homes, clubs
and hotels.... Throughout the country people of wealth,
businessmen and professional men and their families, and the
higher paid workingmen and their families, are drinking in large
numbers in open flouting of the law. And neither Congress nor the
states set up adequate machinery or appropriated sufficient funds
for the enforcement of the prohibitory legislation. Federal and
state legislation, as a matter of fact, strove to satisfy so
that, as it was aptly said, the drys had their prohibition law
and the wets had their liquor </i>(Hu, 1950: 52).<br>
</p>

<p>Although some view the theory of prohibition as reasonable, it
is generally conceded that the realities of manufacture and
distribution make it unworkable, for in one form or another,
alcohol can be easily produced by farmers, high school chemistry
students, and ordinary citizens. </p>

<p>Prohibition has been attempted many times in various parts of
the world; except for some Moslem areas, attempted legislative
controls have not proven adequate. In spite of many sincere and
determined efforts, no country in Europe or the Americas has yet
succeeded in eliminating the use of alcohol by society by
legislative fiat (H.E.W., 1968: 41). </p>

<p>Those who had been accustomed to using alcoholic beverages
sought other sources of supply &quot;in disregard of the
legislative mandate. In the presence of high pecuniary returns
there [was] a strong tendency for supply to meet demand in spite
of prohibition&quot; (Hu, 1950: 51). </p>

<p><b>Consumption. </b>Although it is impossible to make an
accurate determination of the consumption of alcoholic beverages
under Prohibition-since there are no statistics compiled
regarding the output and sale of the outlaw industry-estimates
have been made by those examining the economic results of
Prohibition as well as by the Bureau of Prohibition of the U.S.
Department of Justice. The Bureau placed the consumption of
alcoholic beverages at 73,831,172 gallons, or 0.6 gallon per
capita in fiscal year 1930 as contrasted with 166,983,681 gallons
or 1.7 gallons per capita in 1914. </p>

<p>In terms of pure alcohol, the Bureau concluded that per capita
consumption in 1930 was 35% of the 1914 rate of legal
consumption. These estimates have been criticized as being far
too low (Tillitt, 1932: 35). </p>

<p>The figures published by the Department of Commerce in the
Statistical Abstract of the United States reflect a different
picture. The average annual per capita consumption of hard liquor
from 1910-1914, inclusive, was 1.46 proof gallons. &quot;This
5-year period was before the rise of abnormal conditions
coincident to the World War and may be taken as fairly indicative
of the normal rate of drinking that - prevailed in the
Pre-Prohibition 'era&quot; (Rosenbloom, 1935: 51). </p>

<p>The per capita rate for the Prohibition years is computed to
be 1.63 proof gallons. This is 11.64% higher than the
Pre-Prohibition rate (Tillitt, 1932: 35). Based on these figures
one observer concluded: &quot;And so the drinking which was, in
theory, to have been decreased to the vanishing point by
Prohibition has, in fact, increased&quot; (Tillitt, 1932: 36). </p>

<p>Others disagree with the implications of these unverified
statistics noting that persons of limited means, formerly unable
to patronize the expensive speakeasies, once again had cheap
access to alcohol following repeal and thereby increased
consumption (Harrison &amp; Laine, 1936: 1). </p>

<p>Popular opinion is equally inconclusive; a survey conducted by
the American Institute of Public Opinion in 1936 asked whether
conditions (drinking customs, consumption, etc.) were better
worse or without significant change since Repeal 36% indicated a
worsening and 31% could see no appreciable change (Harrison &amp;
Laine, 1936: 2). Perhaps indicative of a gradual process of
adjustment, however, the results of later Gallup polls suggest a
gradual decline in the use of alcohol. Of a national sample, 67%
indicated they used alcohol in 1945, in contrast to 60% in 1950
and 55% in 1958 (Gusfield, 1963: 135).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Alcoholic Psychoses.</b> There was a notable decrease in
alcoholic psychoses and in deaths due to alcoholism immediately
preceding the enactment of Prohibition and a gradual increase in
alcoholic psychosis and in deaths from alcoholism in the general
population since 1920. </p>

<p><i>&quot;These facts appear to indicate that since 1920,
Prohibition [was] increasingly impotent as a means of preventing
excessive use of alcohol to an extent productive of serious
mental disorders and untimely death. 1920 marks the end of the
decline and the beginning of the rise in the trends of alcoholic
mental diseases and of deaths from alcoholism in the general
population&quot;</i> (Brown, 1932: 88). </p>

<p>The increase in mental disorders and deaths from alcoholism
after 1920, however, also coincides with the heavy consumption
period-early 1900's-which would have resulted in an increase in
alcoholism some years later. </p>

<p>The following table reflects the decrease prior to 1920 and
the subsequent gradual increase in percentage of alcoholic
psychosis among new admissions to 56 hospitals in 25 states as
well as among admissions to New York civil state hospitals
(Brown, 1932: 76-77; Malzburg, 1949: 294) :<br>

<p><b>Deaths from Alcoholism.</b> In New York City, from 1900
through 1909, there was an average of 526 deaths annually
attributable to alcoholism. From 1910 through 1917, the average
number was 619. It plummeted to 183 for the years 1918 through
1922. Thereafter, the figure rose, averaging a new high of 639
for the years 1923 through 1927 (Rice, ed., 1930: 122). </p>

<p>Total deaths from alcoholism in the United States show a
comparable trend, with the gradual increase resuming somewhat
earlier, about 1922 (Brown, 1932: 61, 77; Feldman, 1927: 397;

<p>The highest death rates from alcoholism occurred during the
decade prior to Prohibition as did the highest death rates from
cirrhosis of the liver. These statistics should be qualified by
the observations of Dr. Charles Morris, Chief Medical Examiner
for New York City: <i>&quot;In making out death certificates
(which are basic to Census Reports) private or family physicians
commonly avoid entry of alcoholism as a cause of death whenever
possible. This practice was more prevalent under the National Dry
Law than it was in preprohibition time&quot;</i> (Tillitt, 1932:
114-115). </p>

<p>Even if reliable, per se, such statistics may be unrelated to
the consumption of alcoholic beverages in any given year. Another
writer of this period noted: &quot;The relation of fatal
alcoholic diseases to consumption of alcohol must be one
extending over a long period of years and the actual duration of
the critical period can hardly be estimated&quot; (Jellinek,
1942: 48-1). According to one sociologist, rates of alcoholism
and related mental and physical diseases reflect past drinking
habits, developed ten to 15 years earlier (Gusfield, 1963: 119).<br>
</p>

<p>A shorter &quot;lead time&quot; is suggested by a mental
hygiene statistician who attributes the temporary reduction in
alcoholic psychoses &quot;to the legal restriction of the sale
and use of alcoholic beverages, made effective by the support of
public opinion which during the war period had discountenanced
self-indulgence, of all sorts&quot; (Brown, 1932: 88). He adds,
however, that the notable increase in alcoholic psychoses and
deaths from alcoholism towards the end of the prohibition era
(1927-1932) indicated that: </p>

<p><i>... since 1920, prohibition has become increasingly
impotent as a means of preventing excessive use of alcohol to an
extent productive of serious mental disorders and untimely deaths
</i>(Brown, 1932: 88). </p>

<p>The highly limited statistical label of death from alcoholism
has been noted elsewhere:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The trend of death from alcoholism reflects hardly anything
else than progress in the treatment of the so-called diseases of
chronic alcoholism. Nevertheless, statistics of death from
alcoholism have been used by both Drys and Wets to prove that
Prohibition or repeal has greatly improved the rate of death from
alcoholism. . . . Death from alcoholism is simply not an index of
the prevalence of inebriety. Death from alcoholism could fall to
zero in response to medical progress, while at the same time the
rate of inebriety might rise many fold </i>(Jellinek, 1947: 39).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Arrests</b> Arrests for drunkenness also provide a source
of information about the extent of drinking in the United States.
It must be noted, however, that statistics of this sort vary with
local police policies. For example, during a six-year period in
the 1930's, the arrests for drunkenness were from 14 to 31 times
higher in Philadelphia than in New York (Kolb, 1941: 608). </p>

<p>Nevertheless, gross statistics drawn from 383 cities indicate
that arrests for drunkenness per 10,000 population reached a high
of 192 in 1916 and fell to 71 in 1920. From this level, they rose
steadily again to reach 157 in 1928 (Warburton, 1932: 102). Of
course, arrests prior to Prohibition may not bear the same
relation to the use of alcohol as they did subsequently,
Warburton theorizes: <br>
</p>

<p><i>. . . [U]nder Prohibition, especially during the early
years, police were more strict in making arrests, and . . . a
larger proportion than formerly of persons appearing on the
streets under the influence of liquor are arrested. Also, since
the sale of liquor is illegal and cannot be obtained in public
saloons, and when the police are more strict in arresting
intoxicated persons, it is reasonable to suppose that drinking is
less public and that fewer drunken persons appear on the streets
relative to the quantity of liquor consumed </i>(Warburton, 1932:
103).<br>
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the cyclical trend suggested by these figures
coincides with statistics on alcoholism (Brown, 1932: 61, 71,
77). Whatever their independent validity, however, they correlate
earth the theory of one author that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>[T] he l8th Amendment could not have been passed without
the support of the psychologically tolerant, made temporarily
intolerant by the stress of war. But when the moderates deserted
the drys in the time of peace, the hard core of the movement was
revealed</i> (Sinclair, 1962: 23--24).<br>
</p>

<p>Without the support of the moderates, the author theorizes,
Prohibition was to become itself a symbol of excess, unsupported
by the vast majority of the population. </p>

<p>Outcome. What, then, did Prohibition accomplish? To a great
extent it eliminated the saloon from American life. While bars
and taverns reopened joyfully following repeal, they ceased to be
the centers of systematic political corruption and debauchery
which they had once been. Part of this may be attributable to the
greater sophistication of the electorate and politics generally.
Part, no doubt, is owing to the fact that women were welcome as
customers in the new cocktail lounges, having shown themselves to
be eager patrons of the speakeasies. </p>

<p>And finally, the change in the character of the saloon was
effected by public determination that it should be changed. This
attitude was expressed in the post-repeal statutes concerned with
the physical appearance of the saloon and the character of
persons authorized to operate them. </p>

<p>Prohibition did make the nation conscious that corruption of
the law and of the populace may be the consequence of a law which
is not reflective of the morals and mores of the time. It played
out some of the deepest social class resentments, culminating in
the realization that the behavioral standards of some could not
be impressed -upon others. It demonstrated that the fervor of war
and the cult of patriotism may be abused-and abuse the country in
return. </p>

<p>Repeal reimposed the burden of regulation upon the states.
They were required to develop a system of control directed at the
particular objectives they wished to achieve. The post-repeal era
was to prove an exercise not only in states' rights but in
states' responsibilities. <br>
</p>

<p><b>1933-1971: AFTER THE DELUGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>On December 4, 1933, the day before final ratification of the
repeal amendment, the President established the Federal Alcohol
Control Administration, pursuant to Executive Order No. 6474.
FACA was to have the power to grant or revoke permits to engage
in the alcoholic beverage industry-not the brewing industry-as
well as the power to control plant capacity and production; it
was also to engage in consumer protection through regulations
designed to prevent misbranding and false advertising of
alcoholic beverages. In addition, FACA prohibited the ownership
of retail outlets by manufacturers and wholesalers (Harrison
&amp; Laine, 1936: 24-29). </p>

<p>This scheme fell under the Schecter Poultry decision by the
Supreme Court. The Treasury, Federal Trade, Commission and Food
and Drug Administration then moved in. A new alcohol control
agency was proposed, leading to a dispute as to whether it should
be independent or part of the Treasury.<br>
</p>

<p>Joseph H. Choate, Jr., first head of the FACA, testified that:
</p>

<p><i>The Treasury has not been an organization whose duty it was
to study and understand the liquor business, the interest of the
public in that business, or the method by which that business
ought to be carried on in order to subserve the interests of both
the public and state governments. It has been a creature of one
idea, that one idea being, quite properly, to get revenue and get
it as fast and as copiously as it could </i>(Harrison &amp;
Laine, 1936: 33).<br>
</p>

<p>The Department of the Treasury agreed with Choate's analysis. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, this testimony was disregarded and the Federal
Alcohol Administration was created as a division of Treasury in
1935. This arrangement was superseded in 1936 when the Liquor Tax
Administration Act established FACA as an independent agency of
the government. Soon thereafter it was reorganized, once again as
an arm of the Department of Treasury, and even its separate
identity was abolished as of June 30, 1940. Today, the Treasury
retains full authority to administer all federal liquor laws. </p>

<p>The current federal laws regulating trade in intoxicating
beverages may be classified in the following categories: </p>

<p>(1) Revenue: Taxes are imposed on rectifiers, brewers,
manufacturers of stills, dealers; wholesale and retail stamps are
required on distilled spirits (26 USC, 1971a). </p>

<p>(2) Criminal Penalties: Criminal penalties are provided for
unauthorized production, sale or possession, transportation into
states prohibiting sale, C.O.D. shipments and unlabeled shipments
(26 USC, 1971b; 18 USC, 1971). </p>

<p>(3) Interstate Transportation: Interstate shipments of
alcoholic beverages are subject to the laws of the receiving
state (27 USC, 1971a). </p>

<p>(4) Permits: Importers, manufacturers and sellers of
intoxicating beverages must have permits (27 USC, 1971b). </p>

<p>(5) Unfair Practices: Exclusive sales arrangements, tying,
bribery and false advertising or labeling are prohibited (27 USC,
1971b). </p>

<p>The intent of the Federal Government to reserve all decisions
regarding regulation of consumption is quite clear from federal
statutes presently in force. The states have reacted with a
variety of regulatory schemes controlling to varying degrees the
seller, the buyer, the place, time and opportunity for sale and,
through revenue measures, the cost. </p>

<p>In 18 states, the state store or state monopoly system has
entirely displaced the private wholesale or retail sale of
intoxicating beverages. Other states permit the sale of liquor,
wine and beer through private, licensed outlets. </p>

<p>The license system may be implemented by different, means.
Administration may be solely by the state, or control may be
shared by the counties or municipalities. </p>

<p>Local control may be exercised to a greater or lesser degree.
For example, in the 1930's, immediately after repeal,
Massachusetts and New Mexico permitted local boards to grant
retail licenses only after investigation and approval of
applicants by the state board. During the same period, other
states, predominantly in the South, gave local authorities
supplemental powers to issue licenses while requiring concurrent
state licenses as well.<br>
</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions, the local license had to be obtained
first, and the state license could be granted thereafter. In
Illinois, however, the state commission's power was curtailed by
requiring that a state license be granted once the local license
was secured. And although the state was given the power to revoke
its license, it was given no power to inspect places of sale to
determine grounds for revocation (Harrison &amp; Laine, 1936:
50-53). </p>

<p>The license system has been suspect by many wets as well as
drys because of the opportunities it may afford for political
abuse. On the other hand, there is substantial opinion which
holds direct participation in the sale of liquor in contempt. As
to the relative efficacy of each, there are no reliable means of
making a judgment. Each apparently depends on the integrity and
capacity of the individuals charged with the job of enforcement
and oversight. </p>

<p>Superimposed on the basic system of regulating the sale of
liquor are other sumptuary laws which are directed at the
purchaser. Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated
persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales as well.
Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence
of alcohol as well as for drunken behavior.<br>
</p>

<p>The sale of liquor by the drink is permitted in most states,
but some still require that it be sold in packaged form only,
reflecting the continuing fear of the resurrection of the saloon.
In many states Sunday closing laws are enforced, and mandatory
closing times are imposed upon bars and package stores alike.
Sales are prohibited almost uniformly on Election Day, at least
during polling hours, and, in many places, on Thanksgiving,
Memorial Day, Christmas and other holidays. </p>

<p>Local option is still granted in most states, in voting units
ranging from the plantation to the city or county. Of the
monopoly or control states, only Utah and Wyoming fail to make
provision for local option at all. Wyoming maintains a state
monopoly at the wholesale level only. Private retailer sellers
are licensed. </p>

<p>In the remaining monopoly states, it is often possible for
towns within a wet county to go dry, and sometimes vice versa. Of
the 33 license states, only 10 (including the District of
Columbia) do not permit local option at any level. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the various patterns of regulation, Senator
Arthur Capper's words of the 1930's still seem to be correct: </p>

<p><i>We can repeal prohibition, but we cannot repeal the liquor
problem</i> (Peterson, 1969: 126).<br>
</p>

<p>Neither the states nor the population have yet come to grips
with the problems of alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Both the
monopoly system and the license system are directed at other
concerns. They, no more than Prohibition, have been able to
control or even alleviate the very real and dire consequences of
alcohol use by society.<br>

<h2>History of Tobacco Regulation* </h2>

<p><b>*This section is based in part on a paper prepared for the
Commission by Jane Lang McGrew, an attorney from Washington, D.C.
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>Since 1613, when John Rolfe introduced a successful experiment
in tobacco cultivation in Virginia (Morison, 1965 : 52) the leaf
has assumed major social, industrial, economic and medical
implications. Consequently, persons concerned with tobacco on a
commercial or personal basis have been subject to a variety of
different regulations over the past 360 years.<br>
</p>

<p>Tobacco has been attacked by social observers and medical
authorities for the damage it has allegedly done, to the social
and physical condition of man. Yet it has also provided a
substantial source of revenue to the state and Federal
governments of the United States. </p>

<p>As is now the case with alcohol, tobacco has long been subject
to regulatory controls over the quantity and quality of
production. On the other hand, sumptuary laws affecting tobacco
have been far fewer-and weaker-than those aimed at alcohol. In
fact, there has never been a time when tobacco was prohibited
throughout the United States although consumption under certain
circumstances has been forbidden at various times in different
jurisdictions. </p>

<p>Tobacco-associated today with smoking of cigarettes, and to a
lesser extent, of pipes and cigars-has been popular at times for
both snuffing and chewing. Indeed, until about 1870 cigarettes
were relatively rare in the United States, and almost all tobacco
consumed domestically was chewed during the mid-19th century
(Gottsegen, 1940: 9-10). </p>

<p>What ever the preferred mode of consumption, however, the,
commodity has always been the subject of debate respecting the
appropriate governmental attitude. On the one hand, proponents of
the leaf stress its social benefits and its economic and
industrial significance. Some enthusiasts even endorse its
alleged medical and psychological benefits. Opposed are those who
cite the health hazards of smoking and others who are convinced
of its immorality.<br>
</p>

<p>The motivation for regulation has come from both sides of the
controversy. Most sumptuary restrictions were fostered by the
latter group in an effort to suppress the habit. Those who seek
to institutionalize and foster use of the drug focus on the
regulation of the quantity and quality of production.<br>
</p>

<p>This section does not attempt to weigh the merits of the
various regulatory schemes. Rather, it will trace from John
Rolfe's day the three threads of regulation which have
circumscribed both the producer and consumer of tobacco in the
United States.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>REGULATION OF PRODUCTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>In the opinion of King James I of England, tobacco was
&quot;loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the
brain&quot; and &quot;dangerous to the lungs&quot; (Middleton,
1953: 93). Whether the King was prescient, or simply sensitive,
was irrelevant in the 17th and 18th centuries, however, for
tobacco rapidly became the mainstay of the Maryland and Virginia
economics. Within seven years of John Rolfe's first imaginative
experiment,, Virginia exported nothing but tobacco and a little
sassafrass to England (Middleton, 1953: 93-94). Almost as
quickly, the leaf became the staple of the colony of Maryland and
competition developed in Carolina as well.<br>
</p>

<p>In Massachusetts Bay, the product fared less well. The first
general letter (April 17,1629) from an official of the New
England Company to the Massachusetts Bay settlers prohibited the
planting of tobacco except in small quantities for medicinal
purposes (Werner, 1922: 100). Next door in Connecticut, however,
the colonists attempted to rival the southern planters with a
local leaf. Indeed, the infant industry was coddled by the
protectionist General Court at New Haven, which promulgated a
rule in 1641 that: </p>

<p><i>No persons within this jurisdiction shall [smoke] any other
Tobacco but such as is or shall be planted within these
[districts], except they have license from the Courte </i>(Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut, undated: 20).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the royal attitude and the fear of certain
patent holders of the London Company that Virginia had become a
&quot;colony founded on smoke&quot; (Tobacco Institute,,
Virginia, 1971 : 19; Middleton, 1953: 94), England encouraged the
growth of the tobacco industry. Monopolies to import tobacco from
the colonies were granted by the Crown to court favorites who
soon prospered as a result of this trade. </p>

<p>In 1621, a bill was introduced which, according to one
contemporary commentator, was &quot;extremely remarkable&quot;:
No tobacco was to be imported after the 1st of October, 1621,
except from Virginia and Bermuda; and, after that day, none was
to be planted in England. Although the act was initially defeated
by the House of Lords, James I in 1922 himself granted the import
monopoly to the Virginia and Bermuda, companies and prohibited
the domestic cultivation of tobacco (Brooks, 1952: 88). </p>

<p>The system worked well for the British importers, but the
methods of financing they employed became onerous to the colonial
planters. The tobacco was marketed by consignment to an English
merchant who deposited the proceeds of the sale to the planters'
accounts. Often, however, the high commissions charged and the
cost, of goods ordered by the Virginians in payment for their
crop contributed to the growth of colonial indebtedness. The
extension of credit to cover the deficiencies caused the debts to
grow constantly, but the only alternative to the consignment
system was to sell the product in the colony at a lower price
(Middleton, 1953: 104-107). </p>

<p>Industrial competition in this market provided the impulse for
certain regulatory relief. Importation of the Carolinian product
into Virginia was forbidden by an act of 1679, amended in 1726 to
prohibit importation by land as well as by sea. Nor was North
Carolina permitted to export its tobacco from Virginia ports. In
Great Britain, the Privy Council looked with disfavor upon such
colonial legislation which threatened the financial well-being of
the merchants and so disallowed the Virginia Act in 1731
(Middleton, 1953: 114-115). </p>

<p>Competition similarly induced both Virginia and Maryland to
enact laws prescribing the dimensions of the hogshead in which
tobacco was packaged in 1658. Vying for purchasers, the two
colonies gradually enlarged the statutory size of the hogshead
until, under edict from the Privy Council in Britain, Maryland
was ordered to pass a gauge act establishing the size of the
hogshead in the same dimensions as those fixed in Virginia. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding such legislation, however, the manufacture of
hogsheads was still characterized by carelessness and
irregularity until the warehouse inspection system went into
effect in the 18th century (Middleton, 1953: 116-117). </p>

<p>It was not long before the colonial planters were faced with a
more serious problem-overproduction-which was causing a decline
in prices as well as quality of the leaf. In 1619, the first
tobacco inspection law was passed by the Virginia House of
Burgesses, ordering the lowest grade of tobacco to be destroyed
and prohibiting &quot;second growth&quot; tobacco and the
marketing of trash leaves. </p>

<p>This act was followed in 1621 by a more direct attempt to
restrict production. Each cultivator was required to limit his
growth to 1000 plants of nine leaves each. Although this order
was soon rescinded as a patent failure, an act of 1629 permitted
each planter to tend only 3000 plants with an additional
allowance of 1000 for non-laboring 'women and each child (Brooks,
1952: 96).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the statutory effort, the problem intensified.
Virginia attempted to encourage the other tobacco colonies to
reach agreements restricting plantings, but in Maryland, Lord
Baltimore resisted. If planters were poor, he asserted: </p>

<p><i>It is not from the low price of Tobacco, but from their
owne sloth, ill husbandry and profusely spending their croppe in
Brandewine, and other liquors </i>(Robert, 1949: 11).<br>
</p>

<p>Carolina, Maryland and Virginia actually reached a decision to
prohibit the planting of the staple from. February 1667 to
February 1668. This &quot;stint&quot; proved a less effective
means of control than the winds of 1667, which almost destroyed
the, crop ready for harvest that year (Tobacco Institute,
Virginia, 1971: 19). </p>

<p>Acts of God failed to provide an ultimate solution, however,
and severe economic dislocation in Maryland and Virginia
intensified. By 1681, the Virginia governor, Lord Culpeper,
complained:<br>
</p>

<p><i>... [T]hat which is more to us than all other things put
together, and will be the speedy and certain ruin of the colony,
is the low price of tobacco. The thing is so fatal and desperate
that there is no remedy; the market is overstocked and every crop
overstocks it more. It is commonly said that there is tobacco
enough now in London to last all England for five years.... Our
thriving is our undoing, and our purchase of negroes, by
increasing the supply of tobacco, has greatly contributed thereto</i>
(Brooks, 1952: 112-113).<br>
</p>

<p>The failure of the Virginia Assembly to pass another act
requiring a &quot;stint&quot;' led the so-called &quot;cutters
and pluckers&quot; to take the matter into their own hands in
1682 by burning both their own crops and the plants of their
neighbors (Roberts, 1949: 11). The riot stimulated legislative
action in 1684 of a less helpful sort: the destruction of tobacco
was made a criminal offense,, subject to the death penalty
(Brooks, 1952: 12). </p>

<p>Seventeenth century quality control laws proved no more
successful in the effort to relieve the depression of the
industry. Renewed efforts were made in early years of the next
century, however. </p>

<p>In 1713, the Virginia House of Burgesses established a
warehouse system to enforce tobacco inspection. Forty public
warehouses were created. Strong opposition to the system led the
Privy Council to disallow the act In 1717, but the ensuing
depression of the 1720's was convincing evidence of the need for
relief. Accordingly, the system was reinstated with British
approval in 1730, cornplete with public warehouses and official
inspectors (Middleton, 1953: 120-121). </p>

<p>The apparent success of the system appealed to Maryland,
suffering also from a surfeit of tobacco. &quot;Tobacco, our
money, is worth nothing wrote one Marylander in 1724, &quot;'and
[there is] not a Shirt to be had for Tobacco this year in all our
country&quot; (Tobacco Institute, Maryland, 1971: 21). </p>

<p>Tobacco riots ensued when the Mary] and Assembly initially
refused to follow Virginia's example. One individual was moved to
inform Lord Baltimore that no improvement in the economic state
of the colony was possible until inspection laws were passed that
&quot;will prevent the sending to Market Such trash as is unfit
for any other use but Manure&quot; (Tobacco Institute,,,
Maryland, 1971: 23). Accordingly, Maryland followed Virginia in
the creation of an inspection system in 1747,and Carolina did
likewise in 1754 (Brooks, 1952: 165). </p>

<p>Tobacco entirely dominated the economic and social structure
of Virginia and Maryland. &quot;Tobacco requires us to abhor
communities or townships,&quot; wrote a 17th century governor of
Maryland, &quot;since a planter cannot carry on his affairs
without considerable elbow room within his plantation&quot;
(Brooks, 1952: 98). </p>

<p>In Virginia, tobacco had gained such ascendancy that it was
used as money. For example, when, in 1621, a cargo of twelve
young women made its way to the colony, each one was valued at
120 pounds of the best leaf (Brooks, 1952: 93). By law,
Virginia's ministers were paid in tobacco at 16,000 pounds
annually in 1696. The law provided that: </p>

<p><i>A competent and sufficient provision for the clergy will be
the only means to supply this dominion with able and faithful
Ministers whereby the glory of God may be advanced,the church
propagated, and the people edified </i>(Werner, 1922: 102).<br>
</p>

<p>Not until the Option Act was passed by the Virginia Assembly
in 1755 could the clergy's fees be paid in either money or
tobacco (Brooks, 1952: 167). </p>

<p>The regulation of tobacco in the colonies was devised in
response to the industry with the intent to further the
prosperity of the planters who dominated the economy. This theme
continued to pervade all related regulatory efforts in the
tobacco-producing states thereafter, as new practices developed
in the marketing of the leaf. </p>

<p>The initial hogshead inspection system gradually gave way to
the sale of loose-leaf tobacco by auction. In 1849 the Virginia
Code recognized these methods in lieu of the sale of hogsheads of
the leaf as provided in the 1730 Act. By 1865, the tobacco
auction had completely replaced the earlier marketing techniques
in Virginia (Tobacco Institute, Virginia, 1971: 28-29). </p>

<p>More than a half century later Maryland followed suit. In
1939, the loose-leaf auction warehouse system was introduced to
replace the hogshead system, and the conversion occurred almost
overnight. The practices engaged in are regulated by the Maryland
State Tobacco Authority, established in 1947 by law. The
Authority itself is supervised by eight representatives selected
by the Governor from the producing counties, the University of
Maryland, the buyers and the sellers (Tobacco Institute,
Maryland, 1971: 9-10). </p>

<p>The Federal Government came to recognize the significance of
the tobacco industry in response to state pressures. Accordingly,
since 1930, several bills have been enacted to aid the growers. </p>

<p>Enacted in 1935, the Tobacco Inspection Act directs the
Secretary of Agriculture to establish quality standards and to
designate auction markets (7 U.S.C. 511 (b) and (d)). The
following year, the Tobacco Control Act was passed, bestowing
Congressional approval upon state compacts which regulate the
production of tobacco, and subsidizing the expenses of the state
commissions involved (7 U.S.C. 515). Thus, the two elements of
initial colonial regulation were preserved: the encouragement of
quality and the discouragement of quantity. </p>

<p>The latter objective was further implemented by the
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. Since that time, parity
payments have been made to tobacco producers: </p>

<p><i>In amounts which, together with the proceeds thereof, will
provide a return to such producers which is as nearly equal to
parity price as the funds so made available will permit </i>(7
U.S.C. 1303). <br>
</p>

<p>In addition, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to set
national marketing quotas respecting each kind of tobacco (7
U.S.C. 1312), to apportion the quotas among the states, and to
allot the portions among the farms (7 U.S.C. 1314). Penalties are
imposed for overproduction (7 U.S.C. 1314). </p>

<p>There is nothing subtle about these measures, of course. Their
intent is obvious: to assure the economic stability of an
industry which, as of 1960, provided the United States population
with more than 150,000,000 pounds of manufactured tobacco for
consumption annually (Heimann, 1960: 93), and which provided more
than $4.8 billion in taxes in 1971 (USDA, Tobacco Situation,
1971b: 44). </p>

<p>During the same year, growers' gross receipts reached about
$900 million (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 2), while cigarette
sales alone grossed for the manufacturer and seller approximately
$5 billion (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 53). The commercial
motivation is sound enough if considered abstractly. When
combined with the revenue incentive, however, it has largely
obscured sumptuary controls.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>REGULATION FOR REVENUE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton's tax package of 1794 proposed the first
federal excise taxes upon tobacco products. To the distress of
Philadelphia snuff manufacturers (Brooks, 1952: 146), however,
the tax was restricted after serious Congressional debate to
their product only. </p>

<p>James Madison led the opposition to a general tobacco tax; his
views were summarized in the Annals of Congress on May 2, 1794: </p>

<p><i>As to the subject before the House, it was proper to choose
taxes the least unequal. Tobacco excise was a burden the most
unequal. It fell upon the poor, upon the sailors, day-laborers,
and other people of these classes, while the rich will often
escape it</i> (Robert, 1949: 100). </p>

<p>The legislative decision was probably tempered as well by
considerations of the enforceability of the measure: snuff had to
be manufactured, while quid and pipe tobacco were often homegrown
leaf at the time (Heimann, 1960: 155). In any case, the snuff
bill was ultimately enacted, modified, suspended and repealed,
with small, if any, effect upon federal revenues. </p>

<p>The opportunity to distill tax money from tobacco was seized
upon more vigorously at the time of the Civil War. On July 1,
1862, an ad valorem tax was imposed upon cigars for the first
time. This tax was raised two years later when a separate tax
upon cigarettes was also imposed (Werner, 1922: 358). (Even the
Confederacy sought to levy a tax-in-kind upon tobacco crops, but
was precluded from doing so by the inspection system which
required the inspector to deliver the full amount of tobacco
specified in the warehouse receipt (Robert, 1949: 117).) </p>

<p>Thereafter, the taxes were raised in 1865, 1866 and 1875. A
temporary reduction followed, until the Spanish-American War
necessitated further increases. Concurrently, taxes were levied
upon smoking and manufactured tobacco and snuff, lest the burden
fall unequally upon smokers (Werner, 1922: 559). </p>

<p>By 1880, the tobacco taxes bad largely stabilized. At that
time, they accounted for 31% of total federal tax receipts, or
$38.9 million. Of this, 50% of the collections was derived from
smoking and chewing tobacco, 40% from cigars and cheroots, and
less than 2% from cigarettes (Heimann, 1960: 156). </p>

<p>Since that time, federal tax collections on tobacco products
have risen almost annually. Between 1910 and 1920, they increased
more than 500%, the greatest increase in any single decade. By
1970, they accounted for almost $2.1 billion, down slightly from
the two preceding years (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5). </p>

<p>Indicative of changing patterns of consumption, the taxes on
cigarettes, as a percentage of the total federal tobacco revenue
jumped from 13.6% in 1910 to 51.1% in 1920. By 1970, the
percentage at 97.2% far outdistanced those revenues derived from
other forms of the product (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5). </p>

<p>Excise taxes have proved profitable and easy to collect. The
revenue schemes are simple on both the federal (26 U.S.C. 5701 et
seq.) and state levels. In the past, no justification for them
has been deemed necessary since Madison's protest. No elaborate
licensing or state monopoly system, such as those designed to
control commerce in alcohol, has ever been imposed.<br>
</p>

<p>In 1921, Iowa became the first state to cash in on the crop
directly by taxing cigarettes. By 1930, 11 other states had
adopted the revenue measure (Robert, 1949: 256). </p>

<p>In 1950, 40 states and the District of Columbia taxed
cigarettes. The rates ranged from one cent to five cents for a
pack of 20 except in Louisiana which levied an eight cent tax on
cigarettes. In 1958, Montana imposed an equivalent rate. </p>

<p>Between 1950 and 1962, 43 of the 47 taxing states raised their
rates at least once. The frequent increase in cigarette taxes
narrowed the gap between the rates in low tax states and higher
tax states. In the 12-year period, the median tax rate rose from
three cents to six cents per pack (Federal Trade Commission,
1970: 3) ; the maximum rate remained at eight cents in Texas,
Louisiana, Montana and New Mexico, in contrast to the two cent
rate in the District of Columbia and Kentucky. </p>

<p>The four leading states in terms of both production and
relative dependence on the crop have been North Carolina, South
Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia, the latter two being the only
states in the history of cigarette taxation to decrease their
taxes; the reduction was only .5 cent (from three cents to two
and a half cents) in 1960 and 1961, respectively.<br>
</p>

<p>By 1966, Oregon became the 49th state to impose a tax on
cigarettes; the rate was four cents per pack. Finally, in 1969
North Carolina imposed a cigarette tax-two cents. </p>

<p>The cigarette excise taxes continued to increase during the
sixties. By 1970, the taxes ranged from North Carolina's two
cents to Pennsylvania's 18 cents for a weighted average of 10.7
cents. Twenty nine states levied taxes of 10 cents or more per
pack (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 40). Local governments
superimposed further excise taxes on the state taxes, ranging
from one cent to 10 cents per package (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970:
iv). </p>

<p>By mid-1971, the range had widened further Connecticut at 21
cents and North Carolina at two cents, the weighted average state
tax being 11.1 cents (USDA, Tobacco Situation , 1971a: 7).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOBACCO REVENUES<br>
</b></p>

<p>A peculiar relationship exists between production and revenue.
In 1970, cash receipts from tobacco brought in $11 million for
Pennsylvania; tobacco farmers and cigarette taxes amassed $194.6
million for the state. By comparison growers in North Carolina
collected $576 million while the state collected only $13.4
million in cigarette revenues (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b:
43). </p>

<p>The federal excise tax on a package of cigarettes is currently
eight cents and has remained so since 1951. The combined state
and federal tax was highest in Pennsylvania; 26 cents for 20
cigarettes, which was 58.2% of the retail price. Connecticut's 24
cents and Texas's 23.5 cents were close behind; the average for
the United States was 46.8%. </p>

<p>To the Federal and state governments today, tobacco is a
financial asset. The total federal and state revenue collected f
rom all tobacco products in 1971 amounted to over $4.7 billion.
Local governments excised the product further bringing the sum
total to $4.8 million (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 44). </p>

<p>From the years 1890 to 1930 cigarette tax collections from
tobacco soared from approximately $1 million to over $339
million. By 1950, they exceeded $1.2 billion. </p>

<p>Totals for the years 1890 to 1970 are recorded in the
following chart (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5)<br>

<p><b>REGULATION OF CONSUMPTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>Even as far back as the 16th century, smoking was considered
to have medicinal value. Juan de Cardenas, a Spanish physician
who lived in Mexico in the late 1500's, wrote that &quot;Soldiers
subject to privations, kept off cold, hunger, thirst by smoking
and all the inhabitants of the hot countries of the Indies
alleviate their discomforts by the smoke of this blessed and
medicinal weed&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 63-64). </p>

<p>During, the recurrent epidemics of plague in the 17th century,
it was widely believed that smokers were spared; it has been
reported that men who attended the sick and accompanied the dead
kept their pipes lit (Wagner, 1971: 63-64). </p>

<p>In 1614, one Scottish doctor praised the tobacco plant which: </p>

<p><i>Prepareth the stomach for meat; it maketh a clear voice: it
maketh a sweet breath . . . in a few words it is the princess of
physical plants</i> (Gottsegen, 1940: 87).<br>
</p>

<p>King James disagreed strenuously, and in 1604 ordered a
substantial increase in the import duty on the leaf. Smoking, he
wrote in &quot;A Counterblaste to Tobacco&quot;, is: </p>

<p><i>A custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful
to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking
fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible Stygian smoke of
the pit that is bottomless</i> (Brooks, 1952:56, 71). </p>

<p>Another more passionate moralist wrote: </p>

<p>.<i> . . imagine thou beheldest here a firme-sucker's wife
most fearfully fuming forth very fountains of blood, howling for
anguish of heart, weeping, wailing, and wringing her hands
together . . . while she _pitifully pleads with her husband thus:
Oh husband, my husband . . . ! Why dost thou so vainly prefer a
vanishing filthy fume before my permanent virtues? </i>(Brooks,
1952: 72). <br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such alliterative literature, the habit of
smoking increased in popularity, particularly in the colonies. A
French visitor observed in 1686 that: </p>

<p><i>Large quantities of it [tobacco] are used in this country,
besides what they sell. Everyone smokes while working and idling.
I sometimes went to hear the sermon; their churches are in the
woods, and when everyone has arrived the minister and all the
others smoke before going in. The preaching over, they do the
same thing before parting. They have seats for that purpose. It
was here I saw that everybody smokes, men, women, girls and boys
from the age of seven years </i>(Robert, 1949: 99).<br>
</p>

<p>It was said that even in New England, women of the colony
&quot;smoke in bed, smoke as they knead their bread, smoke whilst
they're cooking&quot; (Gottsegen, 1940: 147). </p>

<p>In the tobacco colonies, of course, there was no attempt to
restrict Consumption of tobacco. It was, after all, their
economic mainstay. </p>

<p>Officials in the northern colonies were less enthusiastic
about the habit, however. In 1632, the General Court of
Massachusetts Bay took the initiative and forbade smoking in
public tinder penalty of a fine (Tobacco Institute,
Massachusetts, 1971 : 17). In 1638, the proscription was expanded
to prohibit anyone from smoking in any inn or public house except
in his own room &quot;so as neither the master of the house nor
any of the guests there shall take offense thereat which if they
do, then such person is forthwith to forebear upon paying of two
shillings sixpence fine for every offense&quot; (Werner, 1922:
100). </p>

<p>This law was followed by another in 1646 which prohibited
smoking except on a journey of five miles or more from any town.
Nor could a citizen of the colony bring a pipe or tobacco into
the precincts of the court (Werner, 1922: 100), although he might
smoke at &quot;the ordinary tyme of repast comonly called
dynner&quot; (Heimann, 1960: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>Plymouth colony was similarly strict. In 1638, a law was
passed forbidding anyone from smoking on the streets. The
following year, it was decreed that jurymen might not smoke, on
pain of a five shilling penalty. </p>

<p>In 1641, even the importation of tobacco was forbidden,
although the law was repealed a year later. A law passed in 1646
prohibited all from smoking, but exempted &quot;soldiers in time
of their training.&quot; And, finally, in 1669, it was ordered
that anyone found smoking on the Sabbath within two miles of a
meeting house, would be fined 12 pence (Werner, 1922: 101). </p>

<p>The colony at New Haven, Connecticut, essayed a like series of
statutes to regulate tobacco consumption. In 1646, the General
Court decreed that: </p>

<p><i>No person under the age of twenty years nor any other that
hath not already accustomed himself to the use thereof, shall
take any tobacko, until he hath brough a certificate under the
hands of [a physician] that it is usefull for him, and also, that
he hath received a license from the court for the same.... None
shall take any tobacko, publickly in the street or any open
places unless on a journey of at least ten miles.</i> (Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut: 20-21).<br>
</p>

<p>Within three years those laws were repealed (Werner, 1922:
102). However, it was further ordered in 1655 that: </p>

<p><i>No tobacco shall be taken in the streets, yards or aboute
the howses in any plantation or farme in this jurisdiction
without dores, neere or aboute the towne, or in the meeting
howse, or body of the trayne Souldiors, or any other place where
they may doe mischief thereby, under the penalty of 84 pence a
pipe for a time, wch is to goe to him that informs and prosecuts </i>(Heimann,
1960: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>As a result of the regulation, snooping became a profitable
undertaking. In the end, however, the laws were of no avail in
suppressing tobacco. </p>

<p>By 1680, the governor of Connecticut recognized the
significance of the leaf and reported that, &quot;We have no need
of Virginia's trade, most people planting so much Tobacco as they
spend,&quot; (Heimann, 1960: 84). Indeed, by the early 18th
century, New England-grown tobacco was being produced in great
enough quantity for both domestic consumption and export (Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut: 22-23). <br>
</p>

<p>Tobacco was not one of the major concerns of the 18th century
either before or after the Revolution. Social reform was
generally secondary to political issues. By the end of the
century, however, Dr. Benjamin Rush had published his
&quot;Observations upon the influence of the Habitual use of
Tobacco upon Health, Morals, and Property&quot; in his collection
of Essays, Literary, Moral and Philosophical. It appeared in
1798, and stressed the Doctor's thesis that smoking and chewing
provoked drunkenness:<br>
</p>

<p><i>One of the usual effects of smoking and chewing is thirst.
This thirst cannot be allayed by water, for no sedative or even
insipid liquor will be relished after the mouth and throat have
been exposed to the stimulus of the smoke, or juice of Tobacco. A
desire of course is excited for strong drinks, and these when
taken between meals soon lead to intemperance and drunkenness.
One of the greatest sots I ever knew, acquired a love for ardent
spirits by swallowing ends of Tobacco, which he, (lid, to escape
detection in the use of it. . . </i>(Robert, 1949: 106).<br>
</p>

<p>There was little immediate response to Rush's dire warnings,
although in the year his tract was published, Boston enacted a
statute to prohibit the carrying of a lighted pipe or cigar in
public streets-apparently with the intent to reduce the hazard of
fire (Brooks, 1952: 245). </p>

<p>An anti-tobacco crusade was launched in the 19th century,
although with considerably less fervor that its sister movement
against alcohol. Among the leaders were Rev. George Trask who
said tobacco and alcohol were Satan's twins; and the Rev. Orin
Fowler, who declared in 1833: &quot;Rum-drinking will not cease,,
till tobacco-chewing and tobacco smoking and snuff -taking shall
cease&quot; (Robert, 1949: 107). Another, Dr. Joel Shew,
attributed delirium tremens, perverted sexuality, impotency,
insanity and cancer to the effects of smoking and chewing
(Brooks, 1952: 219). </p>

<p>The crusade warned as the pipe continued to attract adherents.
From the 18th century on, the cigar too began to grow in favor,
particularly after 1840. It is estimated that by 1850, the
average number of cigars smoked was approximately 19 per capita.
Within 10 years, the number had increased to about 26 (Gottsegen,
1940: 8-10). </p>

<p>Women smoked and chewed as well as the men. Indeed, Mrs.
Andrew Jackson and Mrs. Zachary Taylor both smoked their pipes in
the White House (Heimann, 1960: 90). And, of course, the other
residents of the Capital engaged heavily in the practices of both
chewing and spitting, to the extent that Charles Dickens, during
his tour of the States, felt called upon to report that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Washington may be called the headquarters of
tobaccotinctured saliva.... In all the public places of America,
this filthy custom is recognized. In the courts of law, the judge
has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, and the
prisoner his; while the jurymen and spectators are provided for.
. . . The stranger will find [the custom] in its full bloom of
glory, luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness, at Washington </i>(Brooks,
1952: 215-216). <br>
</p>

<p>Chewing and snuffing remained popular until the time of the
Civil War. Thereafter, cigarette smoking was gradually adopted in
North America, a habit indirectly acquired through the British
from their Turkish and French allies during the Crimean War
(Werner, 1922: 105). </p>

<p>By 1870, approximately 13.9 million cigarettes were smoked
annually in the United States, or .36 per capita. Over the next
60 years, the number was to reach 976.91 per capita (Gottsegen,
1940: 28). </p>

<p>As more persons took to cigarettes, the zeal of reformers,
which had ebbed during the Civil War, was renewed. Pamphlets,
like those of the Temperance Movement, were published, urging
abstinence from smoking: </p>

<p><i>&quot;I'll never use tobacco, no;</i> </p>

<p><i>It is a filthy weed;</i> </p>

<p><i>I'll never put it in my mouth.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>Said Little Robert Reed.</i> </p>

<p><i>&quot;It hurts the health ; it makes bad breath;</i> </p>

<p><i>'Til very bad indeed.</i> </p>

<p><i>I'll never, never use it, no!&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>Said Little Robert Reed </i>(Brooks, 1952: 242-243).<br>
</p>

<p>During the period following the Civil War and prior to the
formation of the American Tobacco Company in 1890, the
anti-liquor forces continued to snipe at tobacco in all forms. A
reformed drinker and temperance lecturer, John B. Gough, would
pull from his pocket a square of tobacco, smell it as if it were
a rose, cry out &quot;Ali you black devil, I love-you&quot; and
throw it away. </p>

<p>The anti-tobacconists were led by Lucy Gaston, the greatest,
warrior in the anti -cigarette campaign who was trained in the
office of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and then moved
over into the anti-tobacco Movement in the 1890's. Miss Gaston
encouraged children to wear anti-tobacco pins or buttons and
organized armies of children to sing and preach to and against
their smoking elders (Wagner, 1971: 40). </p>

<p>&quot;All hostility to tobacco seems nowadays to be
concentrated on cigarettes,&quot; noted Harper's Weekly,
observing the scene in 1905 (Robert, 1949: 169). It was scarcely
a startling revelation. Twenty years earlier, the New York Times
editorialized that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>A grown man has no possible excuse for thus imitating the
small boy.... The decadence of Spain began when the Spaniards
adopted cigarettes and if this pernicious habit obtains among
adult Americans the ruin of the Republic is close at hand . . . </i>(Brooks,
1952: 253).<br>
</p>

<p>Miss Gaston witnessed some legislation victories. Between 1895
and 1921, 14 states banned the sale of cigarettes (Neuberger,
1963: 52). Even in the city of New York it was declared unlawful
for women to smoke in public (Brooks, 1952: 271). Curiously,
However, the city of Boston repealed its law which prohibited
smoking in public in 1880 (Gottsegen, 1940: 153). </p>

<p>The apparent success of the prohibitionists revived the
anti-tobacconists' enthusiasm. &quot;Prohibition is won; now for
tobacco!&quot; pledged Billy Sunday. Miss Gaston also renewed her
dedication and actually announced her candidacy for the
presidency of the United States in 1920 on an antitobacco
platform. </p>

<p>For many anti-tobacconists, when it became apparent that the
elder generation may be lost, the war against tobacco was focused
on the youth of the country. The National Education Association
pledged its membership to cooperate in efforts made in the city,
state and nation to safeguard the health and morals of youth from
cigarette smoking to the end that high ideals for American
manhood may be, preserved for the coming generation (Hamilton,
1927: 168). </p>

<p>The National Congress of PTA, in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1926
resolved &quot;to lend its force to the cause of eliminating
throughout the United State-, the use of cigarettes by minors and
make this a special work for the ensuing year for the good of our
youth&quot; (Hamilton, 1927: 168). </p>

<p>It is for these reasons that the WCTU declared an educational
war against tobacco, but declined to seek prohibitory legislation
(Robert, 1949: 247). </p>

<p>The disenchanting experience of Prohibition, the omnipresence
of the tobacco industry, the need for new sources of state
revenues and the prevalence and popularity of cigarette smoking
combined to frustrate the anti-tobacco campaign. Cigarettes did
provide a new source of revenue. Federal income from tobacco
taxes soared to new heights because of increased cigarette
consumption and advanced rates. </p>

<p>In any event, by 1927, each of the 14 states which had enacted
prohibitory laws against cigarettes had repeated them (Neuberger,
1963: 52). Immediately thereafter these, states imposed taxes
upon the once forbidden product (Robert, 1949: 256; Federal Trade
Commission, 1970: 3).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>STATE REGULATION</b> </p>

<p>Only those laws which forbade the sale of tobacco products to
minors remain on the books, a trend set by New Jersey and
Washington in 1883 (Gottsegen, 1940: 155). </p>

<p>All but a few statutes restricting tobacco products to minors
were enacted between 1916-1920, simultaneous to the development
and popularity of the domestic-blend cigarette. </p>

<p>All 50 states bad laws banning sales to minors by 1950. Since
then, Georgia,. Louisiana, and Wisconsin have repealed theirs le
o 47 states plus the District of Columbia, WIL Vs prohibiting
sales to minors. </p>

<p>The most common age of restriction for cigarettes and tobacco
products today applies to persons under the age of 18. In an
effort to ensure stricter enforcement 11 states have lowered the
age of restriction from 21 to 15 (Tobacco Merchants Association,
1971: 1-2). In contrast to this trend, however, the, California
Legislature, 1971 defeated a bill to allow school smoking areas
and lowering the sale to minor restrictions to 15 years old (NIC
Smoking and Health, 1971: 1). </p>

<p>According to a Special Report released by the Tobacco
Merchants Association of the United States, the liability for
infractions in all states is on the vendor and donor of
cigarettes. In a few states, manufacturer and persons advising or
compelling the minors to smoke, or owning the premise where such
behavior occurs are also liable. However, in some states the
infraction does not extend to the parent or guardian. Some states
penalize the minor himself and others require that he divulge his
source. </p>

<p>Most of the statutes that prohibit the furnishing of
cigarettes to minors extend the ban also to one or more other
tobacco products. Only I 1 states restrict the sale
&quot;only&quot; to cigarettes. The efficacy of such statutes, in
the day of the cigarette machine, is subject to substantial
skepticism. </p>

<p><b>THE IMPETUS FOR FEDERAL SUMPTUARY REGULATION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The effect of smoking on health has been the subject of
discussion for hundreds of years. Early participants in the
tobacco controversy, beginning in the late 16th century, did not
associate the use of tobacco with the production of cancers
although they credited it with causing or curing nearly every
other known disease. </p>

<p>Dr. John Hill, of London, a physician, botanist and prolific
writer, first suggested the relation in 1761. In Cautions Against
the Immoderate Use ol Snuff, he reported six cases of
&quot;polypusses&quot; related to excessive indulgence in tobacco
in the form of snuff. One such &quot;polypus&quot; was described
as a swelling in one nostril that was hard, black and adherent on
a broad base. Painless at first, it later developed &quot;all the
frightful symptoms of an open cancer.&quot; Dr. Hill believed
that this lesion could be fatal and placed the blame for its
origin on tobacco. Dr. Hill has been noted as the first to report
an association of tobacco with cancer (Redmond, 1970: 21). </p>

<p>In 1939, the first scientific study linking lung cancer with
smoking was published. Between 1950 and 1954, 14 studies
associating cigarettes and serious diseases were completed
(Fritschler, 1969: 145). </p>

<p>At the present time, there is no government agency with clear
jurisdiction over the health aspects of cigarettes. The Federal
Trade Commission can act on matters of advertising and package
information. The Food and Drug Administration concerns itself
only with foods, drugs, solids, or liquids that are eaten or
drunk. Tobacco is neither a food nor a drug under current legal
definitions. Nor are cigarettes eaten or drunk; they are inhaled.<br>
</p>

<p>The 1890 edition of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, an official
listing of drugs published by the government, included tobacco.
In later editions, tobacco was dropped. Former Senator Maurine
Neuberger has claimed that the removal of tobacco from the
Pharmacopoeia was the price paid to get support of tobacco-state
legislators for the Food and Drug Act of 1906. The leaf was
thereby removed from the jurisdiction of the FDA (Wagner, 1971:
74).<br>
</p>

<p>The first statement from the Public Health Service on the
subject was made by its Surgeon General, Leroy F. Burney, M.D.,
in the Journal of the American Medical Association in November,
1959. The heart of this statement was that &quot;the weight of
evidence at present implicates smoking as the principal
etiological factor in the increased incidence of lung
cancer&quot; (Diehl, 1969: 154). </p>

<p>In June, 1961 the American Cancer Society, the American Heart
Association and the National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease
Association jointly requested that a commission be appointed
&quot;to consider the responsibilities of government, of business
and of voluntary agencies relative to the health hazards of
cigarette smoking and to recommend a solution of this health
problem that would protect the public and would interfere least
with the freedom of industry and the happiness of
individuals&quot; (Diehl, 1969: 155). </p>

<p>On June 7, 1962, the then Surgeon General, Dr. Luther Terry,
announced, with the approval of the President, that he was
establishing an &quot;expert committee to undertake a
comprehensive review of all data on smoking and health.&quot; </p>

<p>The members of this committee were respected scientists who
had previously expressed no opinion about the relationship of
tobacco to health. All members were approved for appointment by
the tobacco industry as well as by the American Medical
Association and several national health agencies. Half of the
committee members were cigarette smokers. </p>

<p>On January 11, 1964, after some 15 months of intensive study,
this Advisory Committee- to the Surgeon General issued its
monumental unanimous report stating that &quot;cigarette smoking
is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States
to warrant, appropriate remedial action.&quot; </p>

<p>The committee stated unequivocally that &quot;cigarette
smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men; the magnitude
of the effect of cigarette smoking far outweighs other factors.
The data for women, though less extensive, point in the same
direction.&quot; Air pollution was found to be a very minor
factor in the cause of the disease, far outweighed by cigarette
smoking. </p>

<p>The death rate from heart disease, the report noted, was 70
percent higher in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers, and
although there was not enough evidence to say positively that
smoking causes heart disease, there was enough to assume that it
is a cause and to take action against it. </p>

<p>Another conclusion of great importance was that
&quot;cigarette smoking is the most important of the causes of
chronic bronchitis in the United States and increases the risk of
dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema.&quot; </p>

<p>The report analyzed the statistical, pathological, clinical,
and experimental evidence in relation to smoking and other
diseases. A total of more than 4,000 published reports were
studied and more than 150 investigators were personally
interviewed. &quot;The result was the most comprehensive and
authoritative report on this subject ever made&quot; (Diehl,
1969: 156).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE HEALTH WARNING REQUIREMENT<br>
</b></p>

<p>At the time the Surgeon General's Report was published, no
statute, administrative ruling or court decision required that
cigarette packaging or advertising contain any statement about
the dangers to health attributable to cigarette smoking.<br>
</p>

<p>After Trade Regulation Rule Proceedings in March and June
1964, the Federal Trade Commission concluded that cigarette
advertising was deceptive (misleading) and that advertisers had a
responsibility to warn the public of the health hazards of
cigarette smoking. </p>

<p>To accomplish this, the Commission proposed that cigarette
packages state the amount of tar and nicotine in the smoke of the
cigarette which the package contains and that cigarette packages
and cigarette advertising carry a statement such as:
&quot;Caution: Cigarette 'Smoking is Dangerous to Health. It May
Cause Death from Cancer and Other Diseases.&quot; </p>

<p>This warning was to be required on cigarette packages
beginning January 1, 1965, and in cigarette advertising beginning
July 1, 1965. The tobacco industry first obtained a postponement
of the effective dates of this ruling and then prevailed upon
Congress to vitiate the ruling by passing the Cigarette Labeling
and Advertising Act, requiring all packages of cigarettes sold in
this country to carry the label &quot;Cigarette Smoking May be
Hazardous to Your Health,&quot; but prohibiting the Federal Trade
Commission and state and local governments from requiring any
other label on cigarette packages and any warnings in cigarette
advertising at least until 1969. </p>

<p>A New York Times editorial called the Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act of 1965 &quot;a shocking piece of
special-interest legislation-a bill to protect the economic
health of the tobacco industry by freeing it of proper
regulation&quot; (Cigarette Labeling and Advertising, 1965). An
article in the Atlantic Monthly described the political
maneuvering behind this legislation under the title &quot;The
Quiet Victory of the Cigarette Lobby: How It Found the Best
Filter Yet-Congress&quot; (Diehl, 1969:162). </p>

<p>Public concern attending publication of the Surgeon General's
report, Smoking and Health, and the pending FTC regulations for
warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising
apparently convinced the tobacco industry that some action by
Congress was inevitable. </p>

<p>Reportedly the industry decided to accept a weak label on
cigarette packages provided that the legislation would prevent
any regulation of cigarette advertising. This was accomplished by
inserting into the proposed law the provision precluding the FTC
and all state or local governments from requiring any warning on
cigarette packages other than the one approved by Congress and
also preventing any warnings in cigarette advertising. </p>

<p>At House and Senate committee hearings, committee members
friendly to the industry attempted to discredit both the Surgeon
General's Report and the testimony given by the Surgeon General,
the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and the
representatives of various medical and health organizations. The
tobacco industry then presented a number of physicians who
testified that they disagreed with the conclusions of the Surgeon
General's Advisory Committee and that in their opinion there was
no real evidence that cigarette smoking is harmful (Diehl, 1969:
162). </p>

<p>Although this act temporarily prevented any requirement that
tar and nicotine content be indicated on cigarette packages, the
Federal Trade Commission did establish a laboratory to determine
the, tar and nicotine content of the smoke of cigarettes on the
American market, making the results of these tests available
periodically to the public. </p>

<p>The Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act also required that
about July 1, 1967, and annually thereafter the Federal Trade
Commission report to Congress concerning the effectiveness of the
warning label, and upon current practices of cigarette
advertising and promotion, with &quot;recommendations for
legislation that are deemed appropriate.&quot; </p>

<p>After an intensive study the Federal Trade Commission made a
detailed report to Congress with the following summary and
recommendations: &quot;There is virtually no evidence that the
warning statement on cigarette packages has had any significant
effect.&quot; </p>

<p>Sales remained constant and the industry continued to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising; $200 million a
year was being spent on radio and television alone in 1967;
cigarette advertisers had become the single largest product
advertisers on television accounting for about eight per cent of
television advertising time (Wagner, 1971: 166).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Another government agency had become concerned with cigarette
advertising. The Federal Communications Commission is mandated to
assure that the airways, which belong to the public, are used in
the public interest. </p>

<p>John P. Banzhaf, III, who has been called the &quot;Ralph
Nader of the tobacco industry&quot; was responsible for the FCC's
involvement in the cigarette advertising controversy. After
viewing several cigarette commercials on television, Banzhaf
concluded that &quot;what he was seeing might be considered
legally 'controversial&quot;' (Wagner, 1971: 168). He then wrote
to WCBS-TV in New York on December 1, 1966, requesting that he or
some other responsible spokesman be given an opportunity to
present contrasting views on the issue of the benefits and
advisability of smoking. </p>

<p>Banzhaf's letter cited three commercials that presented the
view that smoking is &quot;socially acceptable and desirable,
manly, and a necessary part of a rich full life. &quot;He
asked-free time roughly approximate to that spent on the
promotion of the &quot;virtues and values of smoking.&quot; CBS
routinely turned down the request. He sent a second letter to CBS
and submitted a formal complaint against WCBS-TV to the FCC in
Washington. </p>

<p>The FCC, in a letter to the television station dated June 2,
1967, said programs it had broadcast dealing with the effect of
smoking on health were insufficient to offset the effects of paid
advertisements broadcast for a total of five to 10 minutes each
broadcast day. &quot;We hold that the fairness doctrine is
applicable to such advertisements&quot; the Commission said. They
rejected Banzhaf's claim for equal time, however. </p>

<p>The FCC called on the station to provide free each week
&quot;a significant amount of time for the other viewpoint,&quot;
thereby implementing the smoking education campaigns launched by
the government under the cigarette labeling law. &quot;This
requirement will not preclude or curtail presentation by stations
of cigarette advertising which they choose to carry.&quot; The
FCC basically decided that it was not in the public interest for
the airways to be used by radio and television to advertise
cigarettes without some warning of the health hazards involved
with smoking (Wagner, 1971: 169). </p>

<p>The FCC was deluged with requests to reconsider its action.
The agency stood firm in its unanimous decision. As a result of
the ruling many of the voluntary health agencies and the Public
Health Service made available to the television and radio
industries spot announcements and other program materials on the
serious consequences to health caused by cigarette smoking. </p>

<p>The FCCs decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals on
November 21, 1968; the court said the agency could indeed use its
fairness doctrine to require free time for anti-smoking
commercials. &quot;The danger cigarettes may pose to health is,
among others, a danger to life itself,&quot; the Court said. </p>

<p>As the Commission emphasized, it is a danger inherent in the
normal use of the product, not one merely associated with its
abuse or dependent on intervening fortuitous events. It threatens
a substantial body of the population, not merely a peculiarly
susceptible fringe group. Moreover, the danger, though not
established beyond all doubt, is documented by a compelling
cumulation of statistical evidence (Wagner, 1971: l66-173). </p>

<p>(The cigarette manufacturers then asked the Supreme Court to
review their case, but the high court turned down the request,
leaving the appeals court decision standing.) </p>

<p><i>&quot;Most observers agree that the dramatic entrance of
the FCC into the smoking controversy was probably the most
important single event during the three-year moratorium on
requiring health warnings in cigarette advertisements imposed by
Congress on the FTC&quot;</i> (Wagner, 1971 : 175).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE BAN ON ADVERTISING<br>
</b></p>

<p>Both the U.S. Public Health Service and Federal Trade
Commission have annually reported findings to Congress since
passage of the cigarette labeling law. The FTC recommended that
the Act should be amended to: &quot;Warning: Cigarette Smoking Is
Dangerous to Health and May Cause Death From Cancer and Other
Diseases.&quot; </p>

<p>Additionally, the FTC recommended legislation to require the
same warning to appear in all cigarette advertisements and to
require statements of tar and nicotine content on all cigarette
packages and in all advertising. </p>

<p>Legislation to accomplish these objectives as well as the
following were recommended by the FTC: </p>

<p><i>Cigarette advertising on television and radio should be
barred entirely. Alternately, cigarette advertising on television
and radio should be limited as to hours in which it may appear;
the extent to which it may appear; and the types of programs on
which it may appear;</i> </p>

<p><i>Increased appropriations, should be made to the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare for education of the public
(especially young people) as to the health hazards of smoking;</i>
</p>

<p><i>Appropriations should be made for research under the
direction of the National Institutes of Health on the development
of less hazardous cigarettes.<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;By 1969, the stage had been set for a showdown over
cigarette advertising and promotion&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 190).
The U.S. Government was increasing its efforts to discourage the
sale of cigarettes. Post office trucks carried posters:
&quot;100,000 Doctors Have Quit Smoking.&quot; </p>

<p>The Surgeon General continued to release reports about the
adverse health effects of smoking. </p>

<p>Dr. Daniel Horn, director of the National Clearinghouse for
Smoking and Health, was urging doctors to deliver antismoking
appeals to patients in their offices. </p>

<p>Movie personalities had become involved in the American Cancer
Society's campaign called I.Q. (for &quot;I Quit&quot;) that
passed out lapel buttons and dispatched public speakers around
the country to discourage the habit. Doris Day, Debbie Reynolds
and Lawrence Welk refused to allow tobacco companies to sponsor
their TV shows. </p>

<p>Two ad agencies--Ogilivy and Mather and Doyle Dane
Bernbach-and a few radio and television stations would not accept
cigarette business. Several magazines did not accept cigarette
advertising as a matter of principle: Reader's Digest, the New
Yorker, and the Saturday Review. The Christian Science Monitor
had never carried cigarette ads; the Boston Globe announced in
May, 1969 that it would no longer accept such advertising
&quot;because accumulated medical evidence has indicated that
cigarette smoking is hazardous to health&quot; (Wagner, 1971:
220). </p>

<p>In April 1969, a few weeks before the House Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee was scheduled to open hearings on the
FTC proposals, a series of bills were introduced in the House by
representatives of tobacco producing states. One such bill, H.R.
7177, co-sponsored by all eleven of North Carolina's House
Delegation, proposed &quot;to establish a comprehensive Federal
program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with
respect to any relationship between smoking and health.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Identical measures were introduced under the sponsorship of
congressmen from Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and Florida. Some
accounts of the activity on Capitol Hill during this period
attribute these bills to the tobacco interests' intention
&quot;to prevent strengthening of the warning label and make
permanent the ban on state and Federal regulation of cigarette
advertising, which was due to expire on June 30. Passage of this
legislation was the best tobacco interests could have hoped for
under the circumstances&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 205). </p>

<p>After testimony from both sides, the House Committee approved
a stiffer health warning but prohibited regulatory action on
cigarette advertising for six years and in other ways generally
upheld the status quo. </p>

<p>The Senate, Commerce Committee, on December 5, 1970, voted out
a bill banning cigarette commercials from the air as of January
1, 1971. The FTC was prohibited from acting on cigarette ads in
newspapers and magazines until the middle of 1972. The labeling
provision in the Senate bill was weaker than that established in
the House-voted measure, and the bill also precluded cigarette
regulatory action by the fifty states and local governments. </p>

<p>In a session on December 12, a floor amendment was introduced
which loosened the Committee's proposed restriction on the FTC by
allowing the agency to require health warnings in advertising as
of July 1, 1971. The bill also authorized the FTC to move sooner
if it found that tobacco companies were switching from broadcast
to print advertising so massively that it could be considered a
&quot; gross abuse.&quot; This bill also approved a new required
health warning for cigarette packages&quot;Warning: Cigarette
Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.&quot; </p>

<p>After Senate passage, the measure still had to -pass a joint
Senate-House Conference Committee where important differences
between the two bills had to be reconciled. </p>

<p>The bill that emerged from conference differed only slightly
from the Senate measure. The cautionary label to which the
conferees agreed provides: &quot;Warning: The Surgeon General Has
Determined That Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your
Health.&quot; &quot;In a final concession to the broadcasters,
the conferees agreed to delay for one day the blackout of
cigarette commercials from December 31, 1970, to midnight January
1, 1971. That would give them a last shower of cash from the New
Year's Day football bowl games&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 216). It was
estimated that the loss to television and radio stations would
amount to about $220 million a year, or about 7.5% of their total
advertising revenues. </p>

<p>President Nixon signed the Act on April 1, 1970. </p>

<p>Some observers marvel that the bill was passed &quot;in spite
of massive pressure that had been brought to bear against it and
against the regulation of cigarette advertising generally, by the
tobacco industry, the broadcasting industry, and the lobbyists
and their political allies. This was a combination that for years
had proved invincible against a counterforce of scientists and
public health and public interest advocates who, armed with
formidable statistics on the damage to health and life caused by
cigarette smoking, had sought to protect consumers by requiring
all cigarette advertising to provide adequate warnings of these
dangers&quot; (Whiteside, 1970: 58). </p>

<p>There are those observers , on the other hand, who do not view
the ban of cigarette advertising on television and radio as such
a success for the consumer. Rather, they cite the statistics on
consumption in other countries to point up the fact that bans on
advertising do not reduce sales.<br>
</p>

<p>In Czechoslovakia, for example, no direct advertising of
tobacco is permitted; yet consumption increased 14% between 1953
and 1958. Advertising of foreign cigarettes was banned in 1962 in
Italy; the following year sales increased 39.4% and in 1964, 11.7
%. Sales increased in England after television cigarette
advertisements were banned in 1965. Consumption figures for the
following three years in Britain reveal increases: 112 billion
cigarettes in 1965, 118 billion in 1966; and 119.1 billion in
1967 (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 113-114). </p>

<p>Robert Miller, an agricultural economist in the Department of
Agriculture's Economic Research Service, reports that cigarette
consumption is up in every part of the world although advertising
was banned in several European countries some years ago. He
predicts an eventual decrease in sales during the next five years
and perhaps a 12-13% decrease in tobacco consumption (Tobacco
Advertising Could End, 1970: 7). </p>

<p>Other observers can see a gradual reduction in cigarette
consumption as a result of a prohibition on advertising; some
feel a ban on advertising merely makes it difficult to launch a
new brand. Others predict that the ban will eliminate the social
acceptability of the habit although consumption will not go down.
</p>

<p>The &quot;live dangerously novelty&quot; has also been
identified as a possible cause for gains in consumption;
&quot;such a philosophy might well be prevalent among the young,
the very ones that antismoking advocates are most anxious to
protect&quot; (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 112-113). </p>

<p>Another consequence of the ban on cigarette commercials was
the FCC ruling that the broadcasters' obligation to air
antismoking messages had ended. The stations continue to run them
as public service spots; however, the volume was decreased
considerably from the former 1 to 3 ratio established by the FCC.
The antismoking forces are fearful that a decrease in these spots
is harmful to their cause and may retard their efforts to reduce
cigarette consumption. </p>

<p>On October 20,1971, a U.S. District Court ruled that the
Congressional ban on cigarette advertising is constitutional. The
ruling stated that such advertising does not qualify under the
First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech; a sharp
distinction was drawn between guarantees of freedom. of speech
for individuals and the &quot;limited extent&quot; to which
broadcast advertising qualifies for such protection. </p>

<p>The court also ruled that Congress had more than one
&quot;rational basis&quot; for excluding cigarette ads from
television and not the printed media one being that broadcasts
are the &quot;most persuasive&quot; types of advertising
(Cigarette Ad Ban, 1971). Ultimately, the constitutional question
will have to be decided by the United States Supreme Court.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONSUMPTION TRENDS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is widespread in America today; 45.9% of the
male population 17 years of age and over and 30.5% of females 17
and over are smokers. In 1970, about $10.6 billion of
individuals' expenditures was for cigarettes. </p>

<p>Data on cigarette sales and advertising has been obtained by
the FTC from domestic cigarette manufacturers; the table below
provides cigarette sales for the years 1963 to the present
(Federal Trade Commission, 1970: 3) :<br>
</p>

<p><b>TOTAL CIGARETTES SOLD<br>
</b></p>

<p>Year Billions </p>

<p>1963 516.5 </p>

<p>1964 505.0 </p>

<p>1965 521.1 </p>

<p>1966 529.9 </p>

<p>1967 535.8 </p>

<p>1968 540.3 </p>

<p>1969 527.9 </p>

<p>1970 534.2 </p>

<p>The reduction in sales in 1964 coincides with the public
attention given the Report of the Surgeon General issued on
January 11, 1964. Public awareness of the dangers cited in the
Report was high. It was soon forgotten, for in 1965 the total
number of cigarettes sold was almost 5 billion higher than the
year prior to the Surgeon General's Report. </p>

<p>In 1969 there was another significant decline; it has been
suggested that this decline is attributable to several
high-visibility events and also by sales tax increases. For
example, the FCC ruling was upheld in November 1968 giving
impetus to the antismoking TV campaign; the federal government's
anti-smoking campaign was in full swing during 1968-69; the
public outcry was being felt by economic interests-magazines,
newspapers, personalities and advertising agencies which refused
sponsorship for business from tobacco companies. </p>

<p>There were significant state tax increases immediately prior
to 1969 which probably contributed to the reduction in sales
during that year. During fiscal year 1967, 15 states increased
their cigarette tax rates; the average increase was 3.5 cents.
The rate increase ranged from New York's, Ohio's, and Illinois'
two cents to California's and Florida's seven cents. The next
year, seven more states increased their cigarette taxes. The
rates ranged from Massachusetts' and Vermont's two cents to
Minnesota's, Rhode Island's, and Tennessee's five cents the
average increase approximately four cents (Council of State
Governments, 1968: 196-197). </p>

<p>The ban on cigarette advertising on television and radio began
on January 2, 1971, yet several calculations reflect a rise in
cigarette sales during the past year. Business Week projections
of industry sales and brand rankings show that a record 529
billion cigarettes were consumed in 1971, 1.5% more than 1970's
sales (Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 56). Tobacco industry
sources estimate that consumption has risen in 1971 by 1.5% to
535 billion cigarettes (Cigarette Sales Up, 1972: 3). </p>

<p>John C. Maxwell, tobacco analyst for Oppenheimer &amp;
Company, a brokerage firm, also reported a rise-2.3% in domestic
unit sales in 1971. He relates part of the growth in cigarette
consumption to the population mix the increase hit the 20-40 year
age group, where smoking is heaviest. The Maxwell report suggests
that the rest of this growth must be related to &quot;government
overkill, wherein many voices in Washington suggest that
everything we eat or drink is harmful&quot; (Maxwell, 1971: 1).<br>
</p>

<p>An industry specialist with Manufacturers Hlanover Trust
Company, on the other hand, attributes both the lag in sales in
1969 and the new increase to the &quot;very effective antismoking
ads on television. Since the ban, these commercials rarely
appear&quot; (Cigarette Sales Up, 1972: 3). </p>

<p>Another industry executive notes, &quot;For years we have
believed that the role of cigarette advertising is to attract
smokers from competitive brands rather than induce nonsmokers to
start smoking. We failed to convince the Federal Communications
Commission of this, but it is borne out by our industry's
experience since the TV ban. Within a relatively stable market,
some companies have continued to gain while others lost. Some
brands have increased their share of market while others have
declined&quot; (Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 56). Skeptics
continue to argue that tobacco companies have also been trying to
recruit new young smokers.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOBACCO: ECONOMICS AND POLITICS<br>
</b></p>

<p>It is generally accepted that tobacco has been an extremely
powerful force in American politics. Approximately 50 million
smokers smoked 535 billion cigarettes in the past year. More than
100,000 employees receive $500 million in wages annually from
tobacco manufacturing companies; over 4,500 wholesalers handle
the distribution of tobacco products and hundreds of thousands of
merchants depend on tire sale of cigarettes as a source of their
income. </p>

<p>Cigarette companies had been spending over $200 million per
year on radio and television advertising, and since the ban,
almost all of this money has been diverted to other media
advertising providing many thousands of jobs in ad agencies and
in the various media. Three million people from about 750,000
families receive $1.4 billion annually for the cultivation of
tobacco used in cigarettes. </p>

<p>Peripherally affected are those involved in producing the 40
million pounds of moisture-proof cellophane, the 70 million
pounds of aluminum foil, the 27 billion printed packs, and the
2.7 billion cartons (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 110-111;
Wagner, 1971: 120; USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971a: 29-31). </p>

<p>One writer, reporting on the present public policy trend,
notes that &quot;attempts to discourage smoking would affect the
lives of millions of people and would have profound economic and
political consequences&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 121). </p>

<p>Advocates of cigarette smoking today are organized into
extremely powerful groups, each having its own specific function
and plentiful resources. </p>

<p>The Tobacco Tax Council, established in 1949, compiles data on
the taxation of tobacco products by the Federal, state and local
governments. The Council's annual booklet, &quot;Cigaret Taxes in
the United States&quot; has been superseded by &quot; The Tax
Burden on Tobacco&quot; since 1966. This pamphlet
&quot;undertakes to trace the history of tobacco taxes from the
years of the Civil War down through [the present year]&quot;
(Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: iii).<br>
</p>

<p>The trade association promoting the welfare of the tobacco
industry is the Tobacco Merchants Association of the U.S. It is
composed of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, importers,
exporters, leaf dealers, suppliers, and firms interested in the
industry. Its Bulletins cover legislation, trends, special
reports; its numerous other publications and activities seek to
improve industry operations and expand outlets (e.g.,
international) f or potential sales (Tobacco Merchants
Association, 1971: 1-4).<br>
</p>

<p>The tobacco industry's point of view is nurtured and protected
by the Tobacco Institute, a nonprofit corporation founded in
1958. Its membership includes major U.S. manufacturers of
cigarettes, smoking and chewing tobacco, and snuff: The Bloch
Brothers Tobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corporation, Conwood Corporation, G. A. Georgopulo &amp; Company,
Helme Products, Larus &amp; Brother Company, Liggett &amp; Myers,
Lorillard, Philip Morris Incorporated, R. J. Reynolds Industries,
Scotten-Dillion Company, and United States Tobacco Company. </p>

<p>The Institute is financed by contributions from the large
corporations according to their share of the market. The
institute reports on the pro-tobacco side of the medical story,
attempting to discredit antismoking publicity, and publishes
information on the historical role of tobacco, its place in the
national economy, the industry itself, and the public's use of
tobacco products. </p>

<p>The Council for Tobacco Research, created in 1953 in response
to medical bulletins reporting on the hazards of smoking,
processes and administers millions of research grants.
&quot;Although research money was to be awarded with no strings
attached [The Council] nicely serve[s] the purpose of identifying
the industry with the welfare of humanity and spreading good will
through the scientific community&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 80). </p>

<p>The scientific data continue to be attacked from both sides.
Since 1954 a great quantity of research has been published and,
in turn, disputed. For example, &quot;the press played up the
Hammond and Auerbach study and the claim that twelve beagles had
developed lung cancer&quot; from cigarettes. &quot;The findings
have subsequently been downgraded by ' v the author to two
microscopic tumors with the further revelation that two dogs in
the control group also developed tumors&quot; (Maxwell, 1971: 1).
</p>

<p>Another area of contention has developed around the
relationship between cigarette smoke itself and lung cancer. A
recent paper by Dr. Geoffrey Myddelton given at the Second World
Conference on Smoking and Health in London, September 20-24,
1971, compares the incidence of smoking and lung cancer in
various countries. He indicates, &quot;Japan smokes 86% as much
as Britain but has only 27% of its lung cancer. Canada smokes
twice as many cigarettes as the Netherlands but has only 69% as
much lung cancer.&quot; He goes on to correlate the use of diesel
file] in England to lung cancer (Maxwell, 1971: 2). </p>

<p>From the other side, the United States Public Health Service
1972 report The Health Consequences of Smoking maintains that
&quot;nonsmokers as well as smokers may be harmed by cigarettes,
. . . tobacco smoke in closed cars and poorly ventilated rooms
can contaminate the atmosphere for everyone. . . . The chief
danger is exposure to low levels of the deadly gas, carbon
monoxide. Experiments, with animals have shown that various
concentrations of the colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas
'adversely affect' the structure and function of the heart and
lungs. The implication is that this may also be true in man&quot;
(Study Says Cigarette Smoke Also May Harm Nonusers, 1972: 1). </p>

<p>It is estimated that at the present time one and a half to two
million adults give up smoking every year. Sensing the hazards of
the future, some cigarette, companies sought fiscal security in
diversification and substitution; tobacco manufacturers are now
marketing, for example, safety razors, fertilizers, dog food,
ballpoint pens, peanut butter and other non-nicotine products. By
1967, sales on non-tobacco products accounted for approximately
one-third of the, total sales of cigarette manufacturers. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether tobacco power will be whittled
away any further in the next few years. Some feel that &quot;the
tobacco subsystem has succeeded in keeping the health question a
low priority item on the government's agenda by playing one
government agency off against another.... This subsystem cuts
across institutional lines and includes the paid representatives
of tobacco growers, marketing organizations and manufacturers.,.
Congressmen representing tobacco growing states [are] leading
members of four subcommittees, including two ,appropriations
subcommittees and two committees in each house of Congress
handling tobacco legislation. . . . Tobacco power [is] thus
firmly entrenched and well supported&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 121). </p>

<p>On the other hand, a strongly worded commentary by an industry
spokesman cites Justice John Marshall's statement to illustrate
industry's precarious position: &quot;The power to tax involves
the power to destroy.&quot; He continues with a description of
the tobacco industry's present situation:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The onslaught of state and local taxes on tobacco products
... represents a most serious threat to all segments of our
industry.... We are now facing a calculated attempt to destroy,
or at least drastically curtail, the sale of smoking products.
The political and economic climate is most favorable for this
attack. Smoking and health is a prime political issue in the same
context as air pollution, crime in the streets, and consumerism.
At the same time, local governments are verging on bankruptcy.
Revenue of any sort is therefore a must. It is a tough battle,
and cigarette industry is currently bearing the largest part of
the attack </i>(Regensburg, 1971: 146).<br>
</p>

<p>The revenues gained from tobacco tax collections are
significant. Over $2.1 billion in Federal taxes and over $2.5
billion in state cigarette taxes were collected in Fiscal Year
1971 (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 4-6, 8; USDA, Tobacco Situation,
1971b: 44). Total tobacco taxes were $4.8 billion in 1971
compared with $1.7 billion in 1950. </p>

<p>In 1970 tobacco taxes accounted for 1.1% of total federal tax
receipts and represented 13.8 percent of all excise taxes (USDA,
Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 40). This places the tobacco tax as the
seventh largest source of collection by the Federal government
behind the major giants, e.g., income and profit taxes (both
corporate and individual), employment taxes, manufacturers excise
taxes, alcohol taxes, and estate and gift taxes. In terms of
individual commodities it ranks behind only alcohol. Thus,
federal revenue would be importantly affected if tobacco
consumption were to decline. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONCLUSION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The big question is how the Federal government plans to
proceed. Six tobacco bills are now pending in Congress. One of
these bills would give the Federal Trade Commission authority to
set maximum permissible limits on tar and nicotine. Another would
establish a graduated cigarette tax based on tar content. </p>

<p>The FTC is presently carrying on negotiations with the
industry to come up with a &quot;clear and conspicuous&quot;
health warning for its print advertising. It is expected that the
industry, &quot; which has been working closely with the FTC
'will' take some 'voluntary' labeling action&quot; (Where
Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 57). </p>

<p>The industry feels the pressure; one member explains: &quot;We
are resigned to it. Over-all.... the industry mood is much more
relaxed-now that we have this first big year behind us&quot;
(Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 57). </p>

<p>The public is clamoring for government action; a 1970 College
Poll'. surveying-youths 18 and older on more than 100 campuses
reveals that 96% believe that smoking is dangerous to one's
health (College Poll, 1971). </p>

<p>Further, a 1969 study on teenage (13- to 18-yearolds) smoking
attitudes, motivation and habits indicates &quot;deep teenage
dissatisfaction with cigarette smoking, considerable knowledge of
its ill effects, but a very exaggerated estimate of the
acceptance of smoking by the adult world&quot; (Lieberman
Research, 1969: 1-20). And, a 1970 nationwide survey of teenagers
revealed: &quot;72% of non-smokers identified physicians as the
one group that could persuade them not to start smoking and 42%
of those who smoked said their physician's advice would influence
them to stop&quot; (Doctors, 1970: 24). </p>

<p>Critics of the industry claim: &quot;The controversy about
smoking and health continues largely because of the energy, time
and money spent by the tobacco industry in keeping this
controversy alive&quot; (College Poll, 1971).<br>
</p>

<p>In September, 1935, Fortune Magazine published a discussion of
the medical implications of smoking. It concluded that: </p>

<p><i>This much can be said: That the possible benefit to be
derived from tobacco is always less than the possible harm </i>(Robert,
1949: 256).<br>
</p>

<p>Official policy has never accepted this judgment. In recent
years, steps have been taken to discourage smoking, although
there is little conclusive evidence that consumption patterns are
changing. It can be expected that official policy and alterations
in individual behavior will both evolve slowly during the coming
years. The socioeconomic impact of a sudden change in official
policy would be great, a circumstance reflecting the momentum of
several centuries of intense commercial activity.<br>

<p><b>National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<h2>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding </h2>

<h1>Introduction </h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the first of two Reports by the National Commission on
and Drug Abuse. Public Law 91-513 requires that we report to the
President, Congress and the public initially on marihuana and
then on the broader issue of drug abuse in the United The second
Report will include a review of the marihuana issue with
particular attention to studies which have been conducted in the
interim. </p>

<p>In large measure, the marihuana issue is a child of the
sixties, the visual and somewhat pungent symbol of dramatic
changes which have permanently affected our nation in the last
decade. Some have that our mandate has placed the cart before the
horse, and that we should have focused first on the wider social
issue and assessed marihuana's impact on society within that
context. much thought and investigation, we now believe that
Congress was wise in focusing this Commission's attention first
on marihuana. separating it from the rest of the drug
controversy, we have been better able to analyze the unique
position marihuana occupies in our society. </p>

<p>Our mandate was a broad one, covering, for example, the nature
and scope of use, the effects of the drug, the relationship of
marihuana use to other behavior and the efficacy of existing law.
Realizing that marihuana had never before in the American
experience been the subject of a concentrated, authoritative
governmental study, we launched a comprehensive research and
fact-finding effort. We sought.. to evaluate and supplement
existing material, to fill knowledge voids. and to assess the
so-called truths commonly posed in the marihuana debate. </p>

<p>Soon after funds became available on March 22, 1971, we
commissioned more than 50 projects, ranging from a study of the
effects of marihuana on man to a field survey of enforcement of
the marihuana laws in six metropolitan jurisdictions. Of
particular importance in our fact-finding effort were the
opinions and attitudes of all groups in our society. </p>

<p>Through formal and informal hearings, recorded in thousands of
pages of transcripts, we solicited all points of view, including
those of public officials, community leaders, professional
experts and students. We commissioned a nationwide survey of
public beliefs, information and experience referred to in this
Report as the National Survey. In addition, we conducted separate
surveys of opinion among', district attorneys, judges, probation
officers, clinicians, university health officials and free clinic
personnel. </p>

<p>This inquiry focused on the American experience. However, we
have been well aware from the outset that the scope of marihuana
use in the United States differs considerably from that in other
countries where the drug has been used for centuries.
Accordingly, the Commission sought to put the American experience
in perspective by seeing the situation first hand in India,
Greece, North Africa, Jamaica, Afghanistan, and other countries. </p>

<p>Because of our initial concentration on marihuana, certain
issues common to marihuana and other drugs have been deferred for
more complete coverage in the second Report. For example, a
detailed analysis of educational programs about marihuana and its
use will be considered when we evaluate drug education programs
in general. </p>

<p>Further, we do not discuss the rehabilitation of the problem
marihuana user since no such specialized programs exist; we found
the subject is best approached from a broader perspective of
rehabilitation programs for problem users of all non-narcotic
drugs. An examination of federal and state organizational
response to the drug issue, as well as an in-depth study of
general law enforcement strategies, have both been undertaken and
will continue, but will not be reported fully until the second
year. </p>

<p>Officers of the Federal Government have set a high priority on
fuller understanding of the marihuana issue and appropriate
governmental action. President Nixon has frequently expressed his
personal and official commitment to providing a rational and
equitable public response to the use and misuse of drugs.
Similarly, Congress has shown its concern in passing the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. In
appointing this Commission, both the President and Congress have
recognized the need for an independent, nonpartisan appraisal of
the nature of marihuana and the consequences of its use, for a
similar appraisal of the abuse of all drugs, and for appropriate
recommendations for public policy as a result of both studies. </p>

<p>The Commission decided early in its deliberations to write a
Report that was complete but not overly technical so that the
reader could understand the points discussed without analyzing
detailed studies. Some. studies and supporting data are included
in an Appendix to the Report, which is published separately. For
the researcher and others interested in greater detail, the
Appendix provides the necessary technical data. </p>

<p>This Report focuses on marihuana, the popular name for a
mixture of stems, leaves and flowering tops of the Indian hemp
plant, Cannabis Sativa L. This Report presents the most
significant information gathered to date about the drug and its
users, concluding with the Commission's recommendations
concerning the most appropriate public response to marihuana
usage in our society.<br>

<p><b>The National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<p><b>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding</b> </p>

<h1>I -- marihuana and the problem of marihuana</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;There are no whole truths; all truths are half -truths.
It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the
devil.&quot; </p>

<p>Alfred North Whitehead (1953) </p>

<hr>

<p>We are a nation of problem-solvers. We are restless and
impatient with perceived gaps between the way things are and the
way we think ought to be. Understandably, such an impulse toward
self-correction never leaves us wanting for social problems to
solve. Although it is a prerequisite to social progress, this
problem-solving orientation misdirects our attention. In order to
maximize public awareness we are apt to characterize situations
as being far worse than they really are. Because any activity is
commonly regarded as a move toward a solution, rhetoric and
stopgap legislation sometimes substitute for rational reflection.
We become so impressed with social engineering that we overlook
inherent human limitations. </p>

<p>Since the mid-sixties, American society has been increasingly
agitated by what has been defined as a marihuana problem. The
typical sequences of &quot;a national problem&quot; have
resulted: exaggeration, polarization and the inevitable demand
for a. solution. The appointment of this Commission and the
publication of this Report reflect the escalation of marihuana
use into the realm of social problem. Since the beginning of our
official life, we have grappled with the threshold question: Why
has the use of marihuana reached problem status in the public
mind? </p>

<hr>

<h2>Origins of the Marihuana Problem </h2>

<p>Marihuana has been used as an intoxicant in various parts of
the world for centuries and in this country for 75 years. Yet use
of the drug has been regarded as a problem of major proportions
for less than a decade. We will not find the reasons for
contemporary social concern in pharmacology texts or previous
governmental reports, for we are dealing with two separate
realities: a drug with certain pharmacologic properties and
determinable, although variable, effects on man; and a pattern of
human behavior, individual and group, which has, as a behavior,
created fear, anger, confusion, and uncertainty among a large
segment of the contemporary American public. The marihuana
behavior pattern is the source of the marihuana controversy. </p>

<p>The most apparent feature of the behavior is that it is
against the law. But inconsistency between behavior and the legal
norm is not sufficient, in itself, to create a social problem.
Marihuana, has been an illegal substance for several decades; and
the widespread violation of laws against gambling and adultery
have not excited the public to the same extent as has
marihuana-smoking in recent years. </p>

<p>At the same time, we suspect that illegality may play an
important role in problem definition where drugs are concerned.
Alcohol is of proven danger to individual and societal health and
the public is well aware of its dangers, yet use of this drug has
not been accorded the same problem status. Marihuana's illegality
may have been a necessary condition for the marihuana problem,
but the increased violation of the legal proscription does not by
itself explain the phenomenon. </p>

<p>The Commission believes that three interrelated factors have
fostered the definition of marihuana as a major national problem.
First, the illegal behavior is highly visible to all segments of
our society. Second, use of the drug is perceived to threaten the
health and morality not only of the individual but of the society
itself. Third, and most important, the drug has evolved in the
late sixties and early seventies, as a symbol of wider social
conflicts and public issues. </p>

<p><b>VISIBILITY</b> </p>

<p>More than anything else, the visibility of marihuana use by a
segment of our population previously unfamiliar with the drug is
what stirred public anxiety and thrust marihuana into the problem
area. Marihuana usage in the United States has been with us for a
very long period of time, dating back to the beginning of the
century. For decades its use was mainly confined to the
underprivileged socioeconomic groups in our cities and to certain
insulated social groups, such as jazz musicians and artists. As
long as use remained confined to these groups and had a
negligible impact on the dominant social order, the vast majority
of Americans remained unconcerned. From the other side, the
insulated marihuana user was in no position to demand careful
public or legislative scrutiny. </p>

<p>However, all this changed markedly in the mid-1960's. For
various reasons, marihuana use became a common form of recreation
for many middle and upper class college youth. The trend spread
across the country, into the colleges and high schools and into
the affluent suburbs as well. Use by American servicemen in
Vietnam was frequent. In recent years, use of the drug has
spanned every social class and geographic region. </p>

<p>The Commission-sponsored National Survey, &quot;A Nationwide
Study of Beliefs, Information and Experiences,&quot; indicated
that some 24 million Americans have tried marihuana at least once
and that at least 8.3 million are current users. </p>

<p>Other surveys uniformly indicate that more than 40% of the
U.S. college population have tried marihuana, and in some
universities the figure is much higher. Also, use of the drug has
become almost as common among young adults out of college, and
among older teenagers in high school. The National Survey
indicates that 39%, of young adults between 18 and 25 years of
age have tried marihuana. The stereotype of the marihuana user as
a marginal citizen has given way to a composite picture of large
segments of American youth, children of the dominant majority and
very much a part of the mainstream of American life. </p>

<p>Public confusion, anger, and fear over this development became
increasingly apparent during the mid and late 1960's. Such mass
deviance was a problem and the scope of the problem was augmented
by frequent publicity. The topic of the usage of marihuana by the
young received considerable attention from newspapermen and
television reporters. The drug's youthful users abetted the media
in this regard by flaunting their disregard of the law, Few of us
have not seen or heard of marihuana being used en masse at rock
concerts, political demonstrations and gatherings of campus
activists. </p>

<p>In addition, new scientific and medical interest in marihuana
and its use was stimulated by the sudden public interest. For the
first time in the American experience, the drug became the
subject of intensive scrutiny in the laboratories and clinics.
Unfortunately, this research was conducted in the spotlight of
public controversy. Isolated findings and incomplete information
have automatically been presented to the public, with little
attempt made to place such findings in a larger perspective or to
analyze their meanings. </p>

<p>Any new marihuana research has had ready access to the news
spotlight and often has been quickly assimilated into the
rhetoric of the marihuana, debate. Science has become a weapon in
a propaganda battle. Because neither the reporters nor the public
have the expertise to evaluate this information, the result has
been an array of conflicting anecdotal reports, clinical studies
on limited populations, and surveys of restricted utility. </p>

<p>Visibility, intense public interest, and fishbowl research are
all important components of the marihuana problem. </p>

<p><b>PERCEIVED THREATS</b> </p>

<p>Although marihuana is taken by most users for curiosity or
pleasure, the non-using public still feels seriously affected by
use of the drug. Several decades ago it was popularly asserted
that the drug brought about a large variety of social and
individual ills, including crime and insanity. As a result it was
prohibited by federal law in 1937. The marihuana explosion of the
mid-sixties occurred within the context of 30 years of instilled
fear. Although based much more on fantasy than on proven fact,
the marihuana &quot;evils&quot; took root in the public mind, and
now continue to color the public reaction to the marihuana
phenomenon. Even beyond the violation of law, the widespread use
of marihuana, is seen as a threat to society in other ways. And
the threats grow proportionately as the controversy swells. </p>

<p>It has been astutely observed that any statement frequently
repeated in public assumes the status of fact. With so many
people continually arguing about marihuana, the public has
understandably become alarmed and confused. </p>

<p>On the basis of the National Survey, we have tried to identify
the ways in which the public feels threatened by marihuana use.
Essentially these threats fall into three general categories:
threats to the public safety, threats to the public health, and
threats to the dominant social order. </p>

<p>In terms of public safety, the concern is with the
relationship between marihuana and aggressive behavior, crime and
juvenile delinquency. Threats to the public health usually refer
initially to the impact of marihuana on the user. Lethality,
psychosis, addiction potential and effects of chronic long-term
use, are major concerns. Additionally, the fear exists that
marihuana leads to the use of more dangerous drugs, especially
LSD and heroin. </p>

<p>The threat which marihuana use is thought to present to the
dominant social order is a major undercurrent of the marihuana
problem. Use of the drug is linked with idleness, lack of
motivation, hedonism and sexual promiscuity. Many see the drug as
fostering a counterculture which conflicts with basic moral
precepts as well as with the operating functions of our society.
The &quot;dropping out&quot; or rejection of the established
value system is viewed with alarm. Marihuana becomes more than a
drug; it becomes a symbol of the rejection of cherished values. </p>

<p><b>SYMBOLISM</b> </p>

<p>The symbolic aspects of marihuana are the, most intangible of
the items to which the Commission must address itself, and yet
they may be at the heart of the marihuana problem. Use of
marihuana was, and still is, age-specific. It was youth-related
at a time in American history when the adult society was alarmed
by the implications of the youth &quot; movement&quot;: defiance
of the established order, the adoption of new life styles, the
emergence of &quot;street people,&quot; campus unrest, drug use,
communal living, protest politics, and even political radicalism.
In an age characterized by the so-called generation gap,
marihuana symbolizes the cultural divide. </p>

<p>For youth, marihuana became a convenient symbol of
disaffection with traditional society, an allure which
supplemented its recreational attraction. Smoking marihuana may
have appealed to large numbers of youth who opposed certain
policies or trends, but who maintained faith in the American
system as a whole. In ;a time when symbolic speech is often
preferred to the literal form, marihuana was a convenient
instrument of mini-protest. It was also an agent of group
solidarity, as the widely-publicized rock concerts so well
illustrate. </p>

<p>For the adult society, the decade of the sixties was a
distressing time. The net effect of racial unrest, campus
disruption, political assassination, economic woes and an
unpopular war was widespread uneasiness. Attending a general fear
that the nation was witnessing its own disintegration was a
desire to shore up our institutions and hold the line. That line
was easy to define where drugs, particularly marihuana, were
concerned. </p>

<p>Use of drugs, including marihuana, is against the law. For
many, marihuana symbolized disorder in a society frustrated by
increasing lawlessness. Insistence on application of the law
tended also to harden views, thereby escalating still further the
use of marihuana as a symbolic issue. </p>

<p>The social conflicts underlying the drug's symbolic status
have dissipated somewhat in the past few years; and in some ways,
the Commission has similarly noted a partial deflation of the
marihuana problem and of the emotionalism surrounding it. We are
hopeful that our attempt to clarify the scientific and normative
dimensions of marihuana use will further deemphasize, the problem
orientation and facilitate rational decision-making. </p>

<h2>The Need for Perspective </h2>

<p>This Commission has the task of exploring the marihuana
controversy from as many vantage points as possible in its
attempt to make sound, realistic and workable policy
recommendations. Because we are dealing essentially with a
complex social concern rather than a simple pharmacologic
phenomenon, any social policy decision must discuss the realities
of marihuana as a drug, marihuana use as a form of behavior, and
marihuana as a symbol. </p>

<p>Particularly important is the determination of the longevity
of the behavior. Are we dealing with a behavior that is becoming
rooted in our culture or are we experiencing an aberration, a fad
that will in time, of its own accord, pass away? </p>

<p>The vortex of the marihuana controversy is the present, but
the prudent policy planner must not be blinded by the deluge of
recent statistics. It is important that we scan the past for
clues about the meaning of certain behavior and the promise
offered by various social policy responses. We are convinced that
a wider historical understanding will also go a long way toward
deflating marihuana as a problem. </p>

<h3>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE </h3>

<p>When viewed in the context of American society's ambivalent
response to the non-medical use of drugs, the marihuana problem
is not unique. Both the existing social policy toward the drug
and its contemporary challenge have historical antecedents and
explanations. Somewhat surprisingly, until the last half of the
19th century, the only drugs used to any significant extent for
non-medical purposes in this country were alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p>American opinion has always included some opposition to the
nonmedical use of any drug, including alcohol and tobacco. From
colonial times through the Civil War, abstentionist outcries
against alcohol and tobacco sporadically provoked prohibitory
legislation. One 18th century pamphleteer advised against the use
of any drink &quot;which is liable to steal away a man's senses
and render him foolish, irascible, uncontrollable and
dangerous.&quot; Similarly, one 19th century observer attributed
delirium tremens, perverted sexuality, impotency, insanity and
cancer to the smoking and chewing of tobacco. </p>

<p>Despite such warnings, alcohol and tobacco use took deep root
in American society. De Tocqueville noted what hard drinkers the
Americans were, and Dickens was compelled to report that &quot;in
all the public places of America, this filthy custom [tobacco
chewing] is recognized.&quot; Nonetheless, the strain in our
culture opposed to all non-medical drug use persisted and in the
late 19th century gained ardent adherents among larger segments
of the population. </p>

<p>Beginning in earnest around 1870, abstentionists focused the
public opinion process on alcohol. As science and politics were
called to the task, public attention was drawn to the liquor
problem. &quot;Liquor is responsible for 19% of the divorces, 25%
of the poverty, 25% of the insanity, 37% of the pauperism, 45% of
child desertion and 50% of the crime in this country,&quot;
declared the Anti-Saloon League. &quot;And this,&quot; it was
noted, &quot;is a very conservative estimate.&quot; </p>

<p>The Temperance advocates achieved political victory during the
second decade of the 20th century. By 1913, nine states were
under statewide prohibition, and in 31 other states local option
laws operated, with the ultimate effect that more than 50% of the
nation's population lived under prohibition. Four years later,
Congress approved the 18th Amendment and on January 16, 1919,
Nebraska became the 36th state to ratify the Amendment, thus
inscribing national Prohibition in the Constitution. </p>

<p>Although on a somewhat smaller scale and with lesser results,
public attention was simultaneously attracted to a growing
tobacco problem. Stemming partly from the immediate popularity of
cigarette-smoking, a practice introduced after the Civil War, and
partly from riding the coattails of abstentionist sentiment,
anti-tobacconists achieved a measure of success which had
previously eluded them. The New York Time editorialized in 1885
that: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The decadence of Spain began when the Spaniards adopted
    cigarettes and if this pernicious habit obtains among adult
    Americans, the ruin of the Republic is close at hand. . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Between 1895 and 1921, 14 states banned the sale of
cigarettes. </p>

<p>Although though there has been some posthumous debate about
the efficacy of alcohol Prohibition as a means of reducing
excessive or injurious use, the experiment failed to achieve its
declared purpose: elimination of the practice of alcohol
consumption. The habit was too ingrained in the society to be
excised simply by cutting off legitimate supply. </p>

<p>In addition, the 18th Amendment never commanded a. popular
consensus; in fact, the Wickersham Commission, appointed by
President Hoover in 1929 to study Prohibition, attributed the
Amendment's enactment primarily to public antipathy toward the
saloon, the large liquor dealers and intemperance rather than to
public opposition to use of the drug. </p>

<p>Subsequent observers have agreed that Prohibition was
motivated primarily by a desire to root out the institutional
evils associated with the drug's distribution and excessive use;
only a minority of its supporters opposed all use. And in this
respect, Prohibition succeeded. Upon repeal, 13 years after
ratification, liquor was back, but the pre-Prohibition saloon and
unrestrained distribution had been eliminated from the American
scene. </p>

<p>Both the scope of the alcohol habit and the ambivalence of
supporting opinion are manifested in the internal logic of
Prohibition legislation. The legal scheme was designed to cut off
supply, not to punish the consumer. Demand could be eliminated
effectively, if at all, only through educational efforts. Only
five states prohibited possession of alcohol for personal use in
the home. Otherwise, under both federal and state law, the
individual remained legally free to consume alcohol. </p>

<p>The anti-tobacco movement was not propelled by the
institutions outrage or the cultural symbolism surrounding the
alcohol problem It never succeeded on a national scale. Local
successes were attributable to the temporary strength of the
abstentionist impulse, together with the notion that
tobacco-smoking was a stepping-stone to alcohol use Lacking the
consensus necessary to reverse a spreading habit, tobacco
&quot;prohibition&quot; never extended to possession. Insofar as
the anti-tobacco movement was really a coattail consequence of
alcohol Prohibition, is not surprising that all 14 states which
had prohibited sale repealed their proscriptions by 1927. </p>

<p>By the early 1930's, the abstentionist thrust against alcohol
and tobacco had diminished. State and federal governments
contented themselves with regulating distribution and extracting
revenue. When the decade ended, the general public no longer
perceived alcohol and tobacco use as social problems. The two
drugs had achieved social legitimacy. </p>

<p>A comparison between the national flirtation with alcohol and
tobacco prohibition and the prohibition of the non-medical use of
other drugs is helpful in analyzing the marihuana issue. In 1900,
only a handful of states regulated traffic in
&quot;narcotic&quot; drugs--opium, morphine, heroin and cocaine
even though, proportionately, more persons probably were addicted
to those drugs at that time than at any time since. Estimates
from contemporary surveys are questionable, but a conservative
estimate is a quarter of a million people, comprising at least 1%
of the population. This large user population in 1900 included
more females than males, more whites than blacks, was not
confined to a particular geographic region or to the cities, and
was predominantly middle class. </p>

<p>This 19th century addiction was generally accidental and well
hidden. It stemmed in part from over-medication, careless
prescription practices, repeated refills and hidden distribution
of narcotic drugs in patent medicines. Society responded to this
largely invisible medical addiction in indirect, informal ways.
Self -regulation by the medical profession and pharmaceutical
industry, stricter prescription practices by the state
governments and regulation of labeling by the Federal Government
in 1906 all combined in the early years of the new century to
reduce the possibility of this accidental drug addiction. </p>

<p>About this same time, during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, attention within the law enforcement and medical
communities was drawn to another use of narcotics----the
&quot;pleasure&quot; or &quot;street&quot; use of these drugs by
ethnic minorities in the nation's cities. Society reacted to this
narcotics problem by enacting criminal legislation, prohibiting
the non-medical production, distribution or consumption of these
drugs. Within a very few years, every state had passed
anti-narcotics legislation, and in 1914 the Federal Government
passed the Harrison Narcotics Act. </p>

<p>The major differences between the temperance and
anti-narcotics movements must be, emphasized. The temperance,
movement was a matter of vigorous public debate; the
anti-narcotics movement was not. Temperance legislation was the
product of a highly organized nation-wide lobby; narcotics
legislation was largely ad hoc. Temperance legislation was
designed to eradicate known problems resulting from alcohol
abuse; narcotic--, legislation was largely anticipatory.
Temperance legislation rarely restricted private activity;
narcotics legislation prohibited all drug-related behavior,
including possession and use. </p>

<p>These divergent policy patterns reflect the clear-cut
separation in the public and professional minds between alcohol
and tobacco on the one hand, and &quot;narcotics&quot; on the
other. Use of alcohol and tobacco were indigenous American
practices. The intoxicant use of narcotics was not native,
however, and the users of these drugs were either alien, like the
Chinese opium smokers, or perceived to be marginal members of
society. </p>

<p>As to the undesirability and immorality of nonmedical use of
narcotics, there was absolutely no debate. By causing its users
to be physically dependent, the narcotic drug was considered a
severe impediment to individual participation in the economic and
political systems. Use, it was thought, automatically escalated
to dependence and excess, which led to pauperism, crime and
insanity. From a sociological perspective, narcotics use was
thought to be prevalent among the slothful and immoral
populations, gamblers, prostitutes, and others who were already
&quot;undesirables.&quot; Most important was the threat that
narcotics posed to the vitality of the nation's youth. </p>

<p>In short, the narcotics question was answered in unison: the
nonmedical use of narcotics was a cancer which had to be removed
entirely from the social organism. </p>

<p>Marihuana smoking first became prominent on the American scene
in the decade following the Harrison Act. Mexican immigrants and
West Indian sailors introduced the practice in the border and
Gulf states. As the Mexicans spread throughout the West and
immigrated to the major cities, some of them carried the
marihuana habit with them. The practice also became common among
the same urban populations with whom opiate use was identified. </p>

<p>Under such circumstances, an immediate policy response toward
marihuana quite naturally followed the narcotics pattern rather
than the alcohol or tobacco pattern. In fact, marihuana was
incorrectly classified as a &quot;narcotic&quot; drug in
scientific literature and statutory provisions. By 1931, all but
two states west of the Mississippi and several more in the East
had enacted prohibitory legislation making it a criminal offense
to possess or use the drug. </p>

<p>In 1932, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform
State Laws included an optional marihuana, provision in the
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, and by 1937 every state, either by
adoption of the Uniform Act or by separate legislation, had
prohibited marihuana use. In late 1937, the Congress adopted the
Marihuana Tax Act, superimposing a, federal prohibitory scheme on
the state scheme. </p>

<p>Not once during this entire period was any comprehensive
scientific study undertaken in this country of marihuana, or its
effects. The drug was assumed to be a 'narcotic' to render the
user psychologically dependent, to provoke violent crime, and to
cause insanity. Although media attention was attracted to
marihuana use around 1935, public awareness was low and public
debate non-existent. As long as use remained confined to
insulated minorities throughout the next quarter century, the
situation remained stable. When penalties for narcotics
violations escalated in the 1950's, marihuana penalties went
right along with them, until a first-offense possessor was a
felon subject to lengthy incarceration. </p>

<p>With this historical overview in mind, it is not surprising
that the contemporary marihuana experience has been characterized
by fear and confusion on one side and outrage and protest on the
other. As scientific and medical opinion has become better known,
marihuana has lost its direct link with the narcotics in the
public mind and in the statute books. </p>

<p>But extensive ambivalence remains about the policies for
various drugs. Marihuana's advocates contend that it is no more
or less harmful than alcohol and tobacco and should therefore be
treated in similar fashion. The drug's adversaries contend that
it is a stepping-stone to the narcotics and should remain
prohibited. At the present time public opinion tends to consider
marihuana less harmful than the opiates and cocaine and more
harmful than alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p>Interestingly, while marihuana. is perceived as less harmful
than before, alcohol and tobacco are regarded as more harmful
than before. In some ways, the duality which previously
characterized American drug policy has now been supplanted by an
enlightened skepticism as to the variety of approaches to the
non-medical use of various drugs. </p>

<p>Despite this shift in attitudes, however, the use of alcohol
and tobacco is not considered a major social problem by many
Americans, while marihuana use is still so perceived. </p>

<p>This remains true despite the fact that alcoholism afflicts
nine million Americans. According to the National Institute on
Alcohol Addiction and Alcoholism of the National Institute of
Mental Health: alcohol is a factor in half (30,000) of the
highway fatalities occurring each year; an economic cost to the
nation of $15 billion occurs as a result of acoholism and alcohol
abuse; one-half of the five million yearly arrests in the United
States are related to the misuse of alcohol (1.5 million offenses
for public drunkenness alone) ; and one-half of all homicides and
one-fourth of all suicides are alcohol related, accounting for a
total of 11,700 deaths annually. </p>

<p>Similarly, tobacco smoking is not considered a major public
concern despite its link to lung cancer and heart disease.
According to the Surgeon General in The Health Consequences of
Smoking, 1972: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>cigarette smoking is the, major &quot;cause&quot; of lung
    cancer in men and a significant &quot;cause&quot; of lung
    cancer in women; the risk of developing lung cancer in both
    men and women is directly related to an individual's exposure
    as measured by the number of cigarettes smoked, duration of
    smoking, earlier initiation, depth of inhalation, and the
    amount of &quot;tar&quot; produced by the cigarette; and data
    from numerous prospective and retrospective studies indicate
    that cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor
    contributing to the development of coronary heart disease
    (CHD) including fatal CHD and its most severe expression,
    sudden and unexpected death. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE </h3>

<p>Realizing the importance of social change in understanding the
issues surrounding the use of marihuana and other drugs, the
Commission decided early that an objective appraisal of cultural
trends was vital for the, development of policy recommendations.
Since neither the increase in marihuana use nor its attendant
controversy is an isolated phenomenon, we sought a wider cultural
perspective. To this end, the Commission sponsored a wide-ranging
seminar on &quot;Central Influences on American Life.&quot; With
the cooperation of the Council for Biology in Human Affairs of
the Salk Institute, we elicited a three-day conversation among 13
exceptionally thoughtful and perceptive observers of American
life.* </p>

<p>*The participants included Jacques Barzun, as moderator, Mary
Bingham, Claude T. Bissell, Kenneth Boulding, Robert R. Bowie,
Theodore Caplow, Jay W. Forrester, T. George Harris. Rollo May,
Jay Saunders Redding, Jonas Salk, Ernest van den Haag, and Leroy
S. Wehrle. </p>

<p>It is well beyond both our mandate and our competence to
attempt a definitive presentation of the status of the American
ethical system However, we shall try to suggest some of the more
salient influence in our changing society, recognizing that only
against the backdrop of society's fears, aspirations and values
can a rational response to marihuana be formulated. Although we
are not prepared to identify specific causal connections between
these social trends and marihuana use, we do believe that some of
the major points raised in the discussion of cultural change
provide essential background in understanding the marihuana
problem. </p>

<h2>The Search for Meaning </h2>

<p>One overriding influence in contemporary America is the
declining capacity of our institutions to help the individual
find his place in society. As one of the participants at the
Seminar observed: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A society is stable, peaceful, happy, not when it has rid
    itself of the tensions-because you never get rid of the
    tensions, because people's drives will be satisfied in ways
    that clash and so on-but when a very high proportion of the
    people feel fulfillment of some sort within the context which
    the society normally provides. The long-term problem now, for
    many many people, not just young people, is that this
    condition is not met. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>What is wrong with our social system, it seems to me, is
    that it no longer inspires in people a feeling of purpose,
    meaningfulness and so on. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A number of institutional trends have joined to deprive the
individual of a sense of communal inspiration. Perhaps most
important is the economic element. Whereas the individual's
economic achievement formerly gave his life broad social meaning
and inspired his existence, automation and technological advance
have tended to depersonalize the individual's role in the
economy. Instead of the economic system being dependent on
individual productivity, the individual is increasingly dependent
on the system. As his work dwindles in significance to the total
society, it diminishes in meaning for him. Moreover, as more and
more of our people share the nation's affluence, Horatio Alger's
example is no longer needed to climb the economic ladder. </p>

<p>A particularly emphatic manifestation of the declining
economic demand on the individual is the institutionalization of
leisure time. Whereas the economy used to require long hours of
work, now it barely requires more than a five-day week. Expanding
vacation time and reduced work-weeks tend to diminish the
strength of the work ethic. The implications of enforced leisure
time are only now becoming apparent, and the concept of
&quot;idle hands are the devil's plaything&quot; has to be
reexamined in terms of acceptable forms of non-work behavior.
This new time component, allowing for the assertion of
individuality, has produced both privileges and problems. </p>

<p>In the last decade we have seen the beginnings of the
institutionalization of this leisure ethic. A leisure-time
industry has sprung up to organize this time period for the
individual. Many Americans, due to the nature of their jobs in an
automated economic system, find little personal satisfaction in
their work, and many are now searching for individual fulfillment
through the use of free time. Where meaning is not found in
either work or recreational pursuits, the outcome is likely to be
boredom and restlessness. Whether generated by a search for
individual fulfillment, group recreation or sheer boredom, the
increased use of drugs, including marihuana, should come as no
surprise. </p>

<p>Another social development which has chipped away at
individual identity is the loss of a vision of the future. In an
age where change is so rapid, the individual has no concept of
the future. If man could progress from land transportation to the
moon in 60 years, what, lies ahead? Paralleling the loss of the
technological horizon is the loss of a vision of what the future,
in terms of individual and social goals, ought to look like. Are
times moving too fast for man to be able to plan or -to adjust to
new ways and new styles? This sense of the collapsing time frame
was best summed up by one of the Seminar participants: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>.... there are great forces that have developed over the
    last several decades that cause one to lose sight of the
    distant future. Let me contrast a rural farm family of
    several decades ago which settled a farm. They expected their
    children to live there, they can imagine their grandchildren
    living there-there is an image of the future. There is really
    no one who [now] has any image of where his great
    grandchildren will he or what they will do. This comes about
    because of the nature of industrial society; it comes about
    because we have retirement plans instead of looking after
    one's own old age. There area whole set of these [factors]. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Now the morality, the ethics get tied into it because
    ethics are really a long-time horizon concept. It's something
    you engage in because it's contrary to immediate reward and
    immediate gratification and so you look to some distant
    future. But as one loses sight of any future then I think the
    ethics and morality creep up to the very near term also . . .
    We have no one who has got an image of this country two
    hundred years from now, who is trying to create a structure
    that be believes will exist that long. So a number of these
    things . . . tie together in terms of the long-term goals and
    how they have shifted. In any of our systems there tend to be
    a conflict between the short-term and the long-term goals. If
    the long-term goals are lost sight of then the short-term
    expediencies seem to be the things that well up. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To the extent that planning for the future no longer gives the
individual his inspiration, he must look to the present. Such a
climate is conducive to pleasure-seeking, instant gratification
and an entire life-perspective which our society has always
previously disclaimed A third force depriving the individual of a
presumed place in society is the loss of a sense of community, a
sense of belonging. Mobility, mass living and rapid travel all
conspire to destroy the smaller community. The family moves from
place to place and then separates with each child going his own
way. This global thinking leaves little time for home-town
concern. </p>

<p>The dissipation of geographic roots parallels a social
uprooting. As one of our Seminar participants noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When you grow up with a, small number of people with whom
    you have to live for a while, it does something which isn't
    done now. It forces you to face yourself. It forces you to
    ask what kind of pet-son you are, because you can't get away
    with it with a group you're going to have to live with. They
    know what you really are. The mobility has the effect of
    making it possible for people to live playing parts for
    years. It seems to me we see it among the youngsters: role
    playing as distinguished from being somebody. . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of these social trends have their most potent impact on
young people who are just beginning to develop their values,
beliefs and commitments. The adult society has found it easier to
adjust to the emergence of the leisure value. Having experienced
it as a gradual process, they see it as a reward for previous
toil. For many of our young, however, a substantial segment of
leisure time may be considered an essential part of living; they
have known no other experience. Similarly, an adult society,
increasingly influenced toward the present, at least has
developed an historical perspective. Also, adult values were
internalized at a time when a future vision was possible. For
many of the young, however, the present weighs more, heavily.
This notion is best reflected in the vociferous youth response to
the Vietnam conflict, the embodiment of a war fought for the
future, </p>

<p>Finally, all of these cultural changes have occurred,
especially for the young, in an environment of affluence. The
successful economic system has maximized individual freedom. But
the individual has been given unlimited choices at exactly the
time when a, value system within which to make such choices is in
doubt. Because he has no sense of direction, the result is
restlessness, boredom and an increase in the likelihood of
present-oriented choices. Self-destructive drug-taking is one
form such behavior may take. One of our Seminar participants
observed in this connection: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It seems to me that you've got this affluence. So that
    while most of us grew up with the feeling that the channels
    within which we were going to have to move and make choices
    were very narrow, channels for these youngsters look
    absolutely open. It's an absolutely a, la carte menu-it's the
    biggest a la, carte menu you can imagine. [This occurs] in a
    situation in which this sense of radical change is going on
    so fast that you can't master it, together with a feeling
    that the society is being operated by very large
    organizations which you can't get a grip on, giving one a
    sense of helplessness, of not knowing where to take hold. All
    these things inherently are disorienting to youngsters and
    don't give them a, feeling of challenge, [but rather] a doubt
    as to the meaning of their own lives, of the significance of
    their being here, [a sense of] being atoms. So then they do
    act like children in the sense of behaving violently to call
    attention to themselves. They do a whole lot of other things
    which, it seems to me, are the sort of things you often see
    when people feel their lives have no meaning. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Skepticism</b> </p>

<p>Another major influence in contemporary American life with
substantial relevance to the marihuana problem is the uneasy
relationship between the individual and society's institutions,
particularly the state. For 50 years, there has been a continuing
upward flow of power to large institutional units, whether they
be corporate conglomerates, labor unions, universities or the
Government. We have created a society which &quot;requires the
individual to lean on society,&quot; observed one of our Seminar
participants, &quot;in ways that formerly he did not have to do.
He used to lean on the clan, on the family, on the village. We
have used bureaucracy to deal with these problems.&quot; For
many, the Federal Government epitomizes this development,
bureaucratizing a social response to the most human of needs. </p>

<p>We suspect that the implications of this trend for the
individual, although inevitable, became more visibly apparent in
the 1960's. Mass institutions must deal through rules; the
individual becomes a number. &quot;Intuitively, [the individual]
feels that bureaucracies must make man into an object in order to
deal with him.&quot; So we have a depersonalization at exactly
the time that many individuals are casting about for identity and
fulfillment. </p>

<p>Simultaneously, technological advance poses the awesome
prospect of 1984: the intrusion of the omnipresent state into the
private affairs of the individual. Computerized data-banks and
electronic surveillance are perceived as restrictions on
individuality at a time when the desire for personal privacy is
ascendant. </p>

<p>Another cultural feature of governmental bureaucracy during
the sixties has been failure to match expectations. Government
promises the elimination of poverty, the dissipation of racial
discrimination, the excision of drug abuse, and creates rising
expectations. But government is often ill-equipped or unable to
perform such monumental tasks. As individual helplessness
increases, as the &quot;responsibility&quot; of the bureaucracy
enlarges, those in need often feel that the gap between public
declaration and performance must be the result of a conspiracy to
fail. And for the rest of us, there is the credibility gap. The
net result is a loss of confidence in society's institutions.
Viewed from this perspective, youthful dissent, cynicism and
disobedience of the 1960's were not such surprising consequences.
</p>

<p>Still another significant feature of institutional life in
contemporary America is the lag between purpose and
implementation. That is, some of our social institutions have not
yet begun to deal with the consequences of the social and
economic changes which have occurred over the last several
decades. The best example, and the one most germane to the youth,
is the educational system. Two generations ago, the labor force
could assimilate the large majority of the nation's youth.
Neither a high school nor a college education was prerequisite to
occupational choice or achievement. Increased educational
attainment was presumed to be limited to either the privileged or
the able and would be rewarded by certain careers. </p>

<p>Today, however, the labor force grows more quickly than the
system is able to assimilate it, and the educational system now
serves as custodian as well as teacher. Although we sincerely
wish to achieve the democratic ideal of a highly educated
populace, we also keep our children in school as long as possible
because we have nothing else for them to do. The trend is
strikingly apparent even in the last 20 years.<br>

<p>This custodial function confronts educators with a dilemma.
Attrition is not in society's best interest; thus, single-minded
devotion to the highest levels of achievement would be
dysfunctional. In a sense, because the system no longer wants to
turn away its subjects, the notion of failure has lost its
meaning. As one of the Seminar participants observed: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I think one of the problems is that there is no longer a
    penalty for failure. We-the educators-have had to lower
    standards in order to accommodate these people who need no
    longer fear failure. Of course this has been a cyclical
    thing, a wheel within a wheel. [If ] there is no longer a
    penalty for failure, then there is no longer the need to
    acquire. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The changing function of education has been felt in both the
secondary schools and in our institutions of higher learning.
Numerous high school graduates cannot read. Colleges and junior
colleges have sprung up overnight to accommodate the population,
but many provide classrooms with little specific purpose. Only
slowly is the educational system beginning to come to grips with
its role in a changed society. At the university level, many
educators have been appalled at sacrifices which have ensued from
the custodial feature; rote learning, they contend, has
supplanted citizen and character education. </p>

<p>Uncertainty about the role of the educational system has not
escaped the students, particularly at the college level. Many of
our youth, pressed into longer attendance, question its need or
desirability. The demand for &quot;relevance&quot; is but another
reflection of the search for meaning, for an understandable role
in society. Drug use has perhaps provided an outlet for some
members of this restless generation, uncertain of its place. </p>

<p><b>The Limits of Rationality</b> </p>

<p>The social response to the individual's search for meaning has
fostered an ambivalence, an unwillingness to act, a paralysis. In
large measure, according to one Seminar member, this default of
authority reveals the intensity of the search: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the same way we are getting universities that can't
    teach, families that can't socialize and police forces that
    can't catch criminals. In every case, the same issue is
    involved: the subject of authority questions the legitimacy
    of authority and the exerciser of it is unable to find-very
    often doesn't even try to find-a defense, because he feels in
    himself a sympathy, as do so many parents, with the
    challenge. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a significant extent, society is waiting, hoping that the
impulse for change will settle around certain fundamental
attributes of the American ethic. At the present time, however,
no consensus about the nature of these fundamentals exists. We
are all looking for values that have deep roots, as we attempt to
sort out the durable from the ephemeral. </p>

<p>All of the participants at our Central Influences Seminar
agreed that the unique feature of this search was its a rational
quality. As one observer put it: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We have been discussing the question of how we change a
    society. I don't think it's changed by rational intention. As
    I understand societies, historically and our own, what really
    is required to change it is something on a deeper level that
    involves myth, ritual, sacrament-a number of these functions
    that have always been related to societies. On these you
    can't just suddenly make up your mind and then prescribe. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Regarding our problem of authority, you cannot really ask
    the question: why can't these people hang onto their
    authority? They can't hang onto it because what gave them
    authority is something not of themselves, but part of the
    society, part of a ritual, a sacrament: a way of behaving in
    the group which gave them authority, [whether] professorial,
    parental or policy authority. In each one of these cases,
    what we see is not the diminishing of these men so much but
    rather the developing emptiness, the lack of the particular
    ethic that gave them authority to start with. This is why we
    are in a terrible dilemma. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>What is essentially lacking is a system of ethics,
    morality or religion that gives birth -to the myths, the
    rituals, the sacraments that are its expression. These touch
    human beings on the unconscious level. These are the ways we
    see the world. They are not our conscious thought, but the
    ways we form ourselves, form each other, love each other or
    hate each other-in terms not so much of rational intention as
    a deeper unconscious-conscious and unconscious-which is my
    definition of a myth; much more of a feeling level, a living
    level. That is what is not present now. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>What we need, below and above all of our deliberations, is
    the growth and development of an ethical system. We just do
    not have this now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we move into the 1970's, our society is collectively
engaged in the task -of determining what America means, and how
each individual should find fulfillment in `a changing age. From
this wider perspective of flux emerges an uncertainty about what
the increased prevalence of marihuana use means for the
individual and the total society. </p>

<h2>Formulating Marihuana Policy </h2>

<p>Present symbolism, past implications, and future apprehensions
all combine to give marihuana many meanings. These diverse
notions of what marihuana means constitute the marihuana problem.
In this atmosphere, the policy-maker's position is precarious
insofar as no assumption is beyond dispute. Accordingly, the
Commission has taken particular care to define the process by
which a social policy decision should be reached. </p>

<p>In studying the arguments of past and present observers to
justify a particular kind of marihuana policy, we conclude that a
major impediment to rational decision-making in this area is
oversimplification. As suggested earlier, many ingredients are
included in the marihuana mix-medical, legal, social,
philosophical, and moral. Many observers have tended to isolate
one element, highlight it and then extrapolate social policy from
that one premise. In an area where law, science and morality are
so intertwined, we must beware of the tendency toward such
selectivity. </p>

<p><b>SCIENTIFIC OVERSIMPLIFICATION</b> </p>

<p>It is wrong to assume, as many have done, that a particular
statement of marihuana's effects compels a given social policy or
legal implementation. An accurate statement of the effects of the
drug is obviously an important consideration, but it is
conclusive only if the effects are extreme one way or the other.
For example, if the use of a particular drug immediately causes
the user to murder anyone in his presence, we have no doubt that
a vigorous effort to eliminate use of that drug would be in
order. On the other hand, if the effects of the drug are purely
benign, presenting no danger whatsoever to the user or society,
no reason would exist to suppress it. </p>

<p>We know of no psychoactive substance, including marihuana,
which falls at either of these extremes. Thus, it begs the issue
to contend, as some have done, that because we don't know enough
about the effects of heavy, chronic use, we should maintain the
status quo. We know a lot about the adverse effects of alcoholism
and heavy cigarette smoking, and yet no responsible observer
suggests that we should adopt total prohibition for these drugs.
Similarly, previous estimates of marihuana's role in causing
crime and insanity were based quite erroneous information; but to
infer from this that marihuana should be considered totally
benign and hence made freely available is also not logical. Both
approaches are simplistic; both approaches fail to take into
account the social context in which the drug is used and the
dynamic factors affecting the role that marihuana use may or may
not play in the future. </p>

<p>A similar manifestation of scientific oversimplification is
the focus on causality. Many opponents of marihuana use feel
compelled to establish a causal connection between marihuana use
and crime, psychosis, and the use of other drugs, while, their
adversaries focus the dispute on negating such relationships. The
Commission believes that this tendency misses the mark. </p>

<p>The policy-maker's task is concerned primarily with the
effects of marihuana on human behavior. For both philosophical
and practical reasons, proof of causal relationships is next to
impossible. At the same time, however, the extent to which
marihuana use is associated with certain behaviors and whether
any significant relationships exist can offer important clues. </p>

<p>We must be cautious when dealing with such data. Yet we cannot
afford to paralyze the decision-making process simply because
absolute &quot;proof &quot; is lacking. Spokesmen on both sides
of the marihuana debate should focus not on causation but instead
on the relevance of the association between various behavioral
effects and marihuana use. </p>

<p><b>PHILOSOPHICAL OVERSIMPLIFICATION</b> </p>

<p>Some partisans stoutly maintain that the state has no right to
interfere with essentially private conduct or that the state has
no right to protect the individual from his own folly. Some of
the greatest minds of the Western world have struggled over such
philosophical issue always with the same outcome: a recognition
of the need to draw a line between the individual and his social
surroundings. That is, everything an individual does, in private
or not, potentially may affect others. The issue is really to
determine when the undesirable effect upon others is likely
enough or direct enough for society to take cognizance of it and
to deal with it. Coupled with this is the further question of
whether the nature of the behavior and its possible effect is
such that society should employ coercive measures. </p>

<p>Advocates of liberalization of the marihuana laws commonly
contend either that the decision to use marihuana is a private
moral decision or that any harm flowing from use of the drug
accrues only to the user. Defenders of the, present restrictions
insist that society not only has the right but is obligated to
protect the existing social order and to compel an individual to
abstain from a behavior which may impair his productivity.
Unfortunately, the issue is not so simple and the line often
drawn between the private conduct and behavior affecting the
public health and welfare, is not conclusive or absolutely
definable. </p>

<p>For example, a, decision to possess a firearm, while private
is considered by many to be of public magnitude, requiring
governmental control. A decision to engage in adulterous conduct,
although generally implemented in private, may have public
consequences if society believes strongly in the desirability of
the existing family structure. Similarly, excessive alcohol
consumption, in addition to its adverse effects on individual
health, may impair familial stability and economic productivity,
matters with which the total society is concerned. </p>

<p>So, while we agree with the basic philosophical precept that
society may interfere with individual conduct only in the public
interest, using coercive measures only when less restrictive
measures would not suffice this principle merely initiates
inquiry into a rational social policy but does not identify it.
We must take a careful look at this complicated question of the
social impact of private behavior. And we must recognize at the
outset the inherent difficulty in predicting effects on public
health and welfare, and the strong conflicting notions of what
constitutes the public interest. </p>

<p>Again and again during the course of our hearings, we have
been startled by the divergence of opinion within different
segments of our population. Sometimes the disagreement is quite
vehement, and relates to the underlying social concerns of
particular groups. For example, we were told repeatedly by
leaders of the urban black communities that they wanted to purge
all drug use from their midst, marihuana included, and that the
&quot;legalization&quot; of marihuana would be viewed as part of
a design to keep the black man enslaved. </p>

<p>On the other hand, we were informed repeatedly by the activist
student element that the pre-sent social policy regarding
marihuana was merely a tool for suppression of political dissent,
and until the law was changed, there could be no hope of
integrating the dissident population into the mainstream of
American society. </p>

<p>Such statements reemphasize the degree to which marihuana is
regarded as a symbol of a larger social concern. </p>

<p>The conflicting notions of the public interest by different
segments of the population reinforced in the Commission's
deliberations the realization that we have been called upon to
recommend public policy for all segments of the population, for
all of the American people. The public good cannot be defined by
one segment of the population, the old or the young, users or
non-users of marihuana, ethnic minorities or white majority. At
the same time, the fears of each of these groups must be taken
into consideration in arriving at the basic social objectives of
the Commission's public policy recommendation. Where such fears
are real, they must be confronted directly; where they are
imagined, however, they must be put in perspective and,
hopefully, laid to rest. </p>

<p><b>SOCIOLOGICAL OVERSIMPLIFICATION</b> </p>

<p>Public debate and decision-making in our society suffer from
the glorification of statistical data. After a particular social
phenomenon, such as marihuana use, has been defined as a problem,
armies of social scientific researchers set out to analyze and
describe the problem. A sophisticated computer technology
instantly translates millions of bits of data into correlations,
probabilities and trends. The most striking findings are then fed
to a data-hungry public. The result is data overload. </p>

<p>Descriptive information about the nature and scope of
marihuana use as a behavior is an essential component of the
policy-maker's knowledge-base. However, such information does not
in itself have social policy implications. The policy-maker must
define goals and evaluate means; only after he asks the right
questions will statistical data suggest useful answers.
Unfortunately, a tendency exists in the marihuana debate to
assign prescriptive meanings to descriptive data without testing
the underlying assumptions. Further, the data have often been
accumulating in a fragmented way. No overall plan was devised
beforehand; the result has been an ad hoc use of available data
triggered by individual research interests rather than by
long-term policy needs. </p>

<p>What does it mean that 24 million people have tried marihuana?
Some have suggested that it means marihuana ought to be
legalized. But does it mean the same thing if 15 million tried
the drug once and have decided not to use it again? And does it
mean the same thing if popular interest in the drug turns out to
be a passing fancy, which wanes as suddenly as it waxed? </p>

<p>On the other side of the controversy, what does it mean that a
substantial percentage of the public would favor increased
penalties for marihuana use? The prescriptive implications of a
democratic impulse may be offset by a preference for individual
freedom of choice. Also, this segment of public opinion may have
been influenced by incorrect information, such as unwarranted
belief in marihuana's lethality or addiction potential. So,
although the policy-maker must be aware of political realities,
he must not allow his function to be supplanted by public opinion
polls. This is an area which requires both awareness of public
attitudes and willingness to assert leadership based on the best
information available. </p>

<p><b>LEGAL OVERSIMPLIFICATION</b> </p>

<p>Perhaps the major impediment to rational decision-making is
the tendency to think only in terms of the legal system in
general and of the criminal justice system in particular. This
thinking is certainly understandable, given the history of
marihuana's involvement with the criminal law. Nonetheless, the
law does not exist in a social vacuum, and legal alternatives can
be evaluated only with reference to the values and policies which
they are designed to implement and the social context in which
they are designed to operate. </p>

<p>Legal fallacies are apparent on both sides of the marihuana
controversy. Many of the persons opposed to marihuana use look
exclusively to the law for social control. This reliance on the
law is stronger today because many of our fellow citizens are
uneasy about the diminishing effectiveness of our other
institutions, particularly when the non-legal institutions have
been relatively lax in controlling drug related behavior.
Increasing reliance is placed upon the legal system to act not
only as policeman, but as father confessor, disciplinarian,
educator, rehabilitator and standard-bearer of our moral code.
Little or no thought is given to what impact this over-reliance
on the law has on the viability of other social institutions, not
to mention it's effect on the legal process. </p>

<p>A society opposed to marihuana use need not implement that
policy through the criminal law. Non-legal institutions, such as
the church, the school and the family, have great potential for
molding individual behavior. Accordingly, the policy-maker must
delicately assess the capacity of the legal system to accomplish
its task and must consider the mutual impact of legal and
non-legal institutions in achieving social objectives. </p>

<p>We recognize the short-sightedness of an absolute assumption
that the criminal law is the necessary tool for implementing a
social policy opposed to marihuana use. But equally short-sighted
is the opposing contention which attempts to analyze the law
separately from its underlying social policy objective. This
argument assumes that if the law isn't working, or if the costs
of enforcing the law outweigh its benefits, the law should,
therefore, be repealed. </p>

<p>If society feels strongly enough about the impropriety of a
certain behavior, it may choose to utilize the criminal law even
though the behavior is largely invisible and will be minimized
only through effective operation of other agencies of social
control. Laws against incest and child-beating are good examples.
In weighing the costs and benefits of a particular law, one must
provide a scale and a system of weights. The scale is the
normative classification of behavior, and the system of weights
is the largely subjective evaluation of the importance of the
values breached by the behavior. This weighing process is what is
open to dispute. </p>

<p>In sum, no law works alone. Where an unquestioned consensus
exists about the undesirability of a particular behavior and all
social institutions are allied in the effort to prevent it, as is
the case with murder and theft, the law can be said to
&quot;work&quot; even though some murders and thefts may still be
committed. Where society is ambivalent about its attitude toward
the behavior and other institutions are not committed to its
discouragement, the law cannot be said to be working, even though
many people may not engage in the behavior because it is against
the law. </p>

<p>The question is whether the social policy, which the law is
designed to, implement, is being achieved to a satisfactory
extent. To determine the role of law regarding marihuana, we must
first look to society's values and aspirations, and then define
the social policy objective. If we seek to discourage certain
marihuana-related behavior, we must carefully assess the role of
the legal system in achieving that objective. </p>

<h2>The Report </h2>

<p>In this Chapter, we have tried to put the marihuana problem in
perspective. In the remainder of this Report, we explore several
aspects of the phenomenon of marihuana use, its effects, its
social impact and its social meaning, assessing their relative
importance in the formulation of social policy. </p>

<p>In Chapter II, we consider the effects of the drug on the
individual user, with particular attention to the size of the
user population for whom various effects are relevant. The
Commission emphasizes that this material is related only
indirectly to its policy-making function. The social policy
planner is concerned not about the effects on the individual per
se, but about the impact of any adverse effect on his behavior
and on the larger society and about the meaning of this behavior
in the larger social perspective. The material in Chapter II
serves primarily to educate and inform. </p>

<p>In Chapter III, the Commission evaluates the various threats
which marihuana use is perceived to present to the public safety,
public health, and dominant social order. This Chapter is
designed to assess the social impact of marihuana use, the
initial step in the policy making process. </p>

<p>In Chapter IV, we consider what role marihuana use plays and
will play in the life of American society. This is the dynamic
element of marihuana use and is the most intangible of the
marihuana realities, but is particularly important from a
policy-planning perspective. This consideration is the one most
overlooked by contemporary observers and participants in the
marihuana debate. </p>

<p>Because social meaning is not a directly measurable entity, we
must examine the ways in which society responds to the behavior
and whether such responses, both formal and informal, are fluid
or. static. After analyzing public opinion, law enforcement
behavior and the reactions of medical, educational, and other
segments of the population, we then discuss what marihuana use
has come to mean and is likely to mean in the future.
Particularly important in this highly speculative endeavor is the
wider cultural perspective which we described earlier in this
Chapter. </p>

<p>In Chapter V, we bring this information to bear on a
policy-making process. After establishing the philosophical
framework, we explore the spectrum of social policy options,
choosing the one we judge most suitable to the present time. Then
we consider the range of legal alternatives for implementing this
chosen policy, and select the one we believe to be most
appropriate for achieving it. </p>

<p>In an addendum to the Report, we present some ancillary
recommendations. Some of these recommendations flow from our
basic premise, others are a result of independent evaluation by
the Commission of other areas of concern. </p>

<p>We ask the reader to set his preconceptions aside as we have
tried to do, and discriminate with us between marihuana, the
drug, and marihuana, the problem. We hope that our conclusions
will be acceptable to the entire public, but barring that, we
hope at the least that the areas of disagreement and their
implications will be brought into sharper focus.<br>

<p><b>Marihuana - A Signal of Misunderstanding.</b> </p>

<p><b>Chapter II</b> </p>

<h1>marihuana use and its effects<br>
</h1>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our
wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they
cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.&quot; John Adams
(1770) <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>The ultimate objective of the Commission is to evaluate the
total impact of actual and potential marihuana use on
contemporary American society. This endeavor involves three
phases: first, an evaluation of the nature and scope of
contemporary American marihuana use; second, a careful
reevaluation of the pharmacological effects of the drug on the
human body with special emphasis on the drug's capacity to alter
or modify behavior; and third, an evaluation of the impact of
marihuana use on society. This chapter deals with the first and
second phases, and Chapter Three deals with the third.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>The Marihuana User <br>
</b></p>

<p>Cannabis has been used widely for many centuries in
nonindustrialized countries of Asia and Africa. Today, as in
earlier years, use of drug is concentrated primarily among lower
socioeconomic groups. in these countries, the practice is
estimated to be confined to a tenth of the lower socioeconomic,
male population. Although such use of the drug is
well-established, it offers little direct comparison with the
American experience. </p>

<p>Although the commercial, industrial and therapeutic value of
the hemp plant was widely recognized and exploited in the United
States from the earliest days of its history, knowledge and use
of its intoxicating and psychoactive properties remained largely
unknown until about 1900. </p>

<p>At that time, the custom of smoking marihuana was generally
limited to groups of Mexican itinerant workers in the border
states of the Southwest. By 1910, marihuana use began to emerge
in other southern states and cities, particularly New Orleans,
and in the port cities along the Mississippi River. In time,
these cities became distribution centers for enterprising
sailors. From there, marihuana use spread cross-country to other
urban centers, mining camps, railroad construction sites, farm
labor camps, &quot;bohemian&quot; communities of artists and jazz
musicians, and various other groups outside the mainstream of
American society.<br>
</p>

<p>Recently, of course, use of the drug has spread to young,
white, middle class groups and especially to high school and
college populations.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>On the basis of the Commission-sponsored National Survey, we
have concluded that contemporary marihuana use is pervasive,
involving all segments of the U.S. population. The Survey
estimated that about 24 million Americans over the age of 11
years (15% of the adults 18 and over, and 14% of the 12-17 year
olds) have used marihuana at least once, referred to in this
Report as ever-users. Until recently twice as many males as
females had used it; the most up-to-date studies of high school
students, college-age individuals, and young adults carried out
by the Commission indicate that this sex differential appears to
be diminishing. In many youthful populations use is almost
equally distributed between males and females. </p>

<p>Marihuana use does not appear to vary significantly by race.
With respect to the religious affiliation of the users, Jews and
Catholics appear to be slightly overrepresented as compared to
Protestants. </p>

<p>Usage is highest in cities, towns, and suburbs but not
uncommon in rural areas. States in the Northeast and West have
considerably higher rates of use than have the North Central
states, which in turn have significantly higher rates than those
in the South. </p>

<p>Use is found in all socioeconomic groups and occupations,
though slightly more predominant among persons with above-average
incomes. A New York survey of the state's general population
indicated that ever-use as well as regular use is almost equally
prevalent among <font size="2">sales workers, clerical workers,
skilled, semiskilled and unskilled workers, managers, owners,
professionals and technical workers.</font> </p>

<p>At the same time, the incidence of use seems to vary according
to educational attainment. Among all adults not now in school, 5%
of those with an eighth grade education or less have used the
drug, contrasted with 11% of those who completed some high
school, 14% of those who graduated from high school, 25% of those
who completed some college and 21 % of those who graduated from
college. </p>

<p>Age is presently one of the most significant correlates of
marihuana use. Among the total population, those who have tried
or used marihuana at least once, termed ever-users, are heavily
concentrated in the 16-25 age bracket. Of all the ever-users,
about half are in this group. At the same time, however, we
should emphasize that use is by no means confined to teenagers
and young adults. <br>
</p>

<p>The proportion of individuals in different age groups who have
used marihuana is indicated in Figure 1.<br>
<br>
<img src="img00001.gif" align="bottom" width="1343" height="973"><br>
</p>

<p>The incidence of use is greatest among young people: 27% of
the 16-17 year olds, 40% of the 18-21 year olds, and 38% of the
22-25 year olds have tried marihuana; at the low extremes, 6% of
the 12-13 year olds and 6% of the over-50 generation have used
the drug. </p>

<p>Among those now in school, incidence also seems to rise with
increasing school level: Ever-users represent 44% of those
persons now in college or graduate school; 30% of high school
juniors and seniors; 17% of freshmen and sophomores; and 8% of
students in junior high school.<br>
</p>

<p>At the same time, the use of the drug among adults is by no
means confined to college students. Even among the 18-25 year
olds, 75% of the ever-users are not now in school. </p>

<p>The initial patterns of contemporary marihuana use appear to
be shifting; there is a trend toward increased use among college
students as well as non-college students. Non-student users now
span social class, income level and occupational classification.
In addition, the proportion -of users increases during the teens,
peaks during the young adult years and then falls off rapidly
(Figure 1). </p>

<p>Having described the incidence of any use of marihuana ever,
and demographic characteristics of the 24 million Americans who
have tried the drug, we recognize the need to place this
information into perspective. The policymaker must also be
concerned with the patterns of use: frequency, amount consumed at
each smoking, and duration of use. </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>PATTERNS OF USE<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The most striking of the use patterns revealed in the National
Survey is that 41 % of the adults and 45 % of the youth who have
ever used marihuana reported that they no longer use the drug.
Twenty-nine percent of the adults and 43% of the youth reported
that they are still using marihuana (see Table 1). When asked why
they bad terminated use, the overwhelming majority of adults
(61%) specified, among other reasons, that they had simply lost
interest in the drug.<br>

<p>These data indicate that at least 41% of the adults and 45% of
the youth have used marihuana but have -discontinued use; 9% of
the adults and 15% of the youth use the drug sporadically, once
a, month or less. These persons can be characterized as
experimental marihuana users.* </p>

<p>To ensure an understanding of this section of the Report, some
definitions are required at this juncture. In this report, the
Commission employs the following designations:<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>Frequency of Use <br>
</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Experimental-At least one trial to once a month
or less.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Intermittent-Two to 10 times monthly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Moderate-11 times monthly to once, daily.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Heavy-Several times daily.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Very Heavy-Almost constant intoxication with
potent preparations; brain rarely drug free. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><i>Duration of Use</i></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Short Term-Less than two years.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Long Term-Two to 10 years.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Very Long Term-Over 10 years. <br>
</font></p>

<p>Twelve percent of the adults and 19% of the youth who have
ever used marihuana can be designated intermittent users; they
continue to use the drug more than once a month, but less than
several times a week, probably on weekends. Six percent of the
adults and five percent of the youth are moderate users who
continue to use marihuana several times a week to once daily. </p>

<p>Finally, 2% of the adults and 4% of the youth who have ever
used marihuana are heavy users: they use the drug several times
daily. A very small fraction of these heavy users may be very
heavy users, who are intoxicated most of their waking hours and
probably use very potent preparations of the drug. </p>

<p>In addition to frequency, duration of use is an important
variable in discussing use patterns and especially when
considering drug effects. Most users in this country have smoked
the drug over a short term, that is, less than two years. Others
have used the drug over a long term, two to 10 years. Very few
Americans can be considered very long term users, that is, over
10 years. </p>

<p>Another important element of use is the amount of marihuana
used on each occasion. Most intermittent and moderate users
average about one-half to one cigarette per occasion, usually at
night. Most heavy users smoke at least one to two cigarettes an
occasion, with a few using as many as five consecutively. </p>

<p>As this brief description of use patterns suggests, marihuana
use and the marihuana user do not fall into simple, distinct
classifications. Although it is possible to sketch profiles of
various marihuana-using populations, no valid stereotype of a
marihuana user or non-user can be drawn. The spectrum of
individuals who use or have used marihuana varies according to
frequency, intensity and duration of use. It is meaningless to
talk of &quot;the marihuana user&quot; or &quot;marihuana
use&quot; without first clarifying descriptive data.<br>
</p>

<p>*All respondents for the National Survey were asked to
complete a self administered questionnaire. This instrument
covered many sensitive areas, including a series of items on
personal experience with marihuana and other drugs. Given the
nature of the questions, the contractor took every precaution to
insure that the interviewee responded honestly and that his
responses were kept strictly confidential. Even the interviewer
who orally administered the rest of the Survey was not permitted
to view the written instrument. </p>

<p>One of the inevitable costs of such confidentiality is the
risk that a certain percentage of respondents would not complete
one or more of the questions. Where a significant number of
questions remained unanswered, the questionnaire was not
tabulated at all. However, in 30%, of the otherwise complete
questionnaires, the adult respondents who had ever used the drug
did not answer the question, &quot;On the average, about how
often do you use marihuana at the present time?&quot; </p>

<p>Concerned about the meaning of this non-response rate, the,
Commission directed the contractor to conduct a detailed analysis
comparing the non-respondents with all respondents and with those
individuals who had never used marihuana at all. On the basis of
this analysis, we are confident that the overwhelming majority,
if not all, of the non-respondents are experimenters. </p>

<p>In the flrst place, the demographic characteristics of the
non-respondents coincide closely with those of the non-users and
less frequent users. Very few of the young adults, where more
frequent use is concentrated, failed to respond. </p>

<p>Secondly, the non-respondents are disproportionately located
in the geographic regions where use was least prevalent and least
frequent. For example, 50% of the ever-users in the North Central
region failed to respond, compared to 71% in the West. Yet only
5% of the ever-users in the North Central region continue to use
the drug more than once a week, compared to 21% in the West; and
less than .5% of the ever-users in the North Central region use
the drug more than once a day, as compared to 4% in the West. <br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>PROFILES OF USERS <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Several studies by the Commission and many other recent
college and high school surveys have elucidated a variety of
personality types or categories of marihuana users. These
profiles relate primarily to the patterns depicted above and to
the meaning of marihuana use for various individuals. Essentially
we will describe a continuum with much overlapping among the
categories. The reader should understand that group
identification is at best a hazardous occupation; the traits
described are not exclusive to marihuana users. A much larger
number of individuals who have not used the drug can be similarly
described. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Experimental Users<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The first and by far the largest group has been designated as
&quot;experimenters&quot; because of their extremely infrequent
or non-persistent marihuana usage. Experimentation with the drug
is motivated primarily by curiosity and a desire to share a
social experience. These experimenters are characteristically
quite conventional and practically indistinguishable from the
non-user in terms of life style, activities, social integration,
and vocational or academic performance. </p>

<p>Disciplined, optimistic, and self-confident, experimenters
appear to be as conventional, responsible, goal-oriented and
orderly as non-users.<br>
</p>

<p>Intermittent Users<br>
</p>

<p>The intermittent users are motivated to use marihuana for
reasons similar to those of the experimenters. They use the drug
irregularly and infrequently but generally continue to do so
because of its socializing and recreational aspects. For the
intermittent user, marihuana often contributes to the
establishment and solidification of close social relations among
users similarly inclined. The individual has a sense of belonging
to an intimate group. </p>

<p>Investigations of behavioral aspects of marihuana smoking
clearly demonstrate that marihuana smoking is a social activity,
believed by intermittent users to enhance the enjoyment of shared
activities, especially music, art, films and food. </p>

<p>In a Commission-sponsored study to determine the effects of
repeat doses of marihuana, under free access conditions, the
subjects smoked almost exclusively in groups. A certain number of
these individuals tended to share much of their leisure time in
common activities, and marihuana, smoking was the focal activity
around which other types of social interactions revolved, such as
conversation, watching TV, listening to music and playing games.
The intermittent users studied exhibited an increased sense of
well-being, relaxation, and friendliness during these activities.
They were more inclined to seek and emphasize the social rather
than personal effects of the drug. </p>

<p>Intermittent marihuana users, like the experimenters, are
generally conventional in most respects. They are more liberal
politically and socially and they tend to stress education for
personal improvement rather than for recognition or high grades.
Like many non-users, these individuals are likely to be
self-expressive, intellectually and culturally oriented,
creative, and flexible. Placing a high value on experimentation
and responsible, independent decision-making, they often manifest
a desire to search for new experiences, resulting in some
behaviors which depart from the norms of the larger society.
Often accompanying their search is a sense of uncertainty about
the future.<br>
</p>

<p>Moderate and Heavy Users </p>

<p>The final groups of marihuana users are the moderate and heavy
users. This range is wide and includes individuals who use
marihuana more than 10 times a month to several times a day.
Practically all of the American research effort to date has
focused on the large majority of individuals who use less often,
that is, the experimental and intermittent users. Consequently,
not enough is known about characteristics and behavior of the
moderate and the heavy users, so it is difficult to distinguish
accurately between the two groups. We suspect however that the
moderate users share traits with both the intermittent and the
heavy users. Having already discussed the intermittent group, we
will now turn to the characteristics of the heavy group. </p>

<p>Heavy users seem to need the drug experience more often. Their
initial and continued marihuana use is motivated not only by
curiosity and an urge to share a social experience but also by a
desire for &quot;kicks,&quot; &quot;expansion of awareness and
understanding,&quot; and relief of anxiety or boredom. </p>

<p>Generally, the heavy marihuana user's life style, activities,
values and attitudes are unconventional and at variance with
those of the, larger society. These individuals are more
pessimistic, insecure, irresponsible, and nonconforming. They
find routine especially distasteful. Their behavior and mood are
restless and uneven. </p>

<p>Heavy users place particularly strong emphasis on impulsive
response in the interest of pleasure-seeking, immediate
gratification, and individual expression. They tend to evidence
social and emotional immaturity, are especially indifferent to
rules and conventions, and are often resistant to authority.
However, several surveys have also revealed that they tend to be
curious, socially perceptive, skillful and sensitive to the needs
of others, and possess broadly based, although unconventional,
interests. </p>

<p>The Boston free-access study permitted the Commission to
observe a group of individuals whose life styles, activities,
values and attitudes are representative of a segment of the
unconventional youthful subculture. The month-long period of
controlled study during the fall prevented the participation of
individuals who were married, steadily employed, or enrolled in
school. </p>

<p>Individuals who smoked marihuana once a week or less were
sought by the researchers but were exceedingly unusual among the
population available for the study. Consequently, the group
studies contrasted with the student and full-time working
populations in which weekly marihuana use is more common. For
this reason, the intermittent users studied appeared to be
similar to, rather than different from, the moderate and heavy
users studied. Both groups had used marihuana for an average of
five years. </p>

<p>Under the study's confined conditions, participants tended to
smoke more marihuana than they did &quot;on the outside.&quot;
The intermittent users, who by our definition averaged eight
times a month under outside conditions, averaged three cigarettes
a day during the study. The range was from one-half to six
cigarettes daily. </p>

<p>The moderate and heavy users, who &quot;on the outside&quot;
averaged 33 times a month, now averaged six-and-a-half cigarettes
a day. The range was three-and-a-half to eight cigarettes. In
discussing the Boston study, we will call this group
&quot;daily&quot; users. </p>

<p>Smoking usually occurred at night, sometimes during the
afternoon and only occasionally upon awakening. The intermittent
and heavy users usually smoked one cigarette a session. The daily
users were more likely to smoke more than one a session. A few
individuals in the daily group could have been considered
constantly intoxicated on a few occasions during the 21 -day
period. </p>

<p>The mean age of the subjects studied was 23. Based on IQ
testing, they were superior intellectually, although they had
completed, on the average, only two-and-a-half years of college.
Their job histories were rather erratic, characteristic of a
pattern of itinerant living. The intermittent users -were from a
middle or upper class background, while the daily users generally
shared a lower socioeconomic status. Broken homes and instances
of alcohol or drug abuse were more common in the family
backgrounds of the daily users. </p>

<p>Alcohol was rarely used by the subjects. Use of hallucinogens
and amphetamines was significantly more widespread and had begun
earlier in the daily user group. In contrast to the intermittent
group, the daily users almost uniformly reported that marihuana
smoking produced relaxation, noting <b>also </b>increased
alteration <b>in </b>perception or psychedelic-like effects.
Similarly, they reported an increased sense of well-being,
friendliness, carefreeness and decreased hostility. Additionally,
the daily users appeared to demonstrate a moderate psychological
dependence <b>on </b>the marihuana experience while the
intermittent users demonstrated little or no psychological
dependence. </p>

<p>Analysis of social-behavioral aspects of daily users'
marihuana smoking clearly demonstrated that it is a pivotal
social activity around which conversation, other personal
interactions, and much of the users' lives revolve. Smoking
almost exclusively occurred in groups and was the focal activity
around which these groups formed. The daily users exhibited a
readiness to take part in but not to initiate a smoking session. </p>

<p>In contrast to the intermittent users, all the daily users in
a group smoked when marihuana was made available. Marihuana
smoking appeared to be a primary means of reinforcing group
solidarity. Yet these users were more inclined to seek the
personal effects of the drug rather than the socializing effects
sought by the intermittent users. </p>

<p>The social adjustment of the daily users, when judged from a
traditional psychiatric standpoint, was impaired. Individuals
tended to be more withdrawn and to interact less with each other
than the intermittent users, regardless of the type of activity
or state of intoxication. However, the daily users did appear to
accommodate themselves better than the intermittent users to the
effects of the intoxication on social interaction.<br>
</p>

<p>Despite a relatively high level of scholastic attainment and
superior intelligence, many of the subjects were performing well
below their intellectual capability, usually working at menial,
mechanical or artisan tasks. They were not oriented toward
achieving the traditional goals of the larger society. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, during the period of the Boston study, the
subjects could not be characterized as displaying a general
lassitude and indifference, carelessness in personal hygiene or
lack of productive activity, all supposed to be characteristic of
very heavy use. Even during the periods of heaviest marihuana
smoking, they maintained a high level of interest and
participation in a variety of personal activities, such as
writing, reading, keeping up on current world events, and
participating in athletic and aesthetic endeavors. </p>

<p>Additionally, all of the subjects maintained a desire to
complete all aspects of the research study. Although they could
be labeled 'underachievers&quot; in terms of the traditional
standards of the larger society, these individuals were motivated
to pursue actively the interests and activities of their <b>own </b>subculture.
</p>

<p>Generally, most studies which have been undertaken indicate
that individuals who are heavy marihuana users cannot find a
place for themselves in conventional society. Their heavy
marihuana use may reflect and perhaps perpetuate their
unconventionality while providing social acceptance in one of the
non-conventional subcultures.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Very Heavy Users<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The Commission's analysis of frequency, quantity and duration
of marihuana use suggest that the United States is at the present
time in a fortunate position. All of the studies available to the
Commission have indicated that only a minute number of Americans
can be designated as very heavy marihuana users. These studies
uniformly indicate that chronic, constant intoxication with very
potent cannabis preparations is exceedingly rare in this country.
</p>

<p>The Commission believes that important distinctions must be
made between the daily (moderate and heavy) American marihuana
user and the very heavy hashish or charas user in other parts of
the world where cannabis is widely cultivated and its use deeply
ingrained. Many of the North African and Asian users do not
employ the drug only as an intoxicant in the western sense.
Instead, it is frequently used in &quot;folk medical
practice,&quot; in religious rites and as a work adjunct
particularly in those occupations which are physically demanding,
monotonous, unintellectual, and offer little possibility of
advancement. </p>

<p>In these countries, very heavy use is typically associated
with young males from a lower socioeconomic background.
Nonetheless, use is more widespread among all ages and elderly
chronic users are not uncommon. </p>

<p>Generally, these very heavy users consume high amounts of very
potent preparations continually throughout the day so that they
are rarely drug-free. These individuals evidence strong
psychological dependence on the drug, requiring compulsive
drug-taking. Clear-cut behavioral changes occur in these extreme
cases. The very heavy User tends to lose interest in all
activities other than drug use. A common element of the
behavioral pattern is lethargy and social deterioration. Not
surprisingly, these users have been held in low esteem and very
heavy use has been subject to societal disapproval in almost all
countries.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>BECOMING A MARIHUANA USER<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Our attempt to classify marihuana users is primarily for
descriptive purposes. It does not imply that all individuals who
resemble any of the categories are necessarily marihuana users.
Nor is it implied that all marihuana users fit neatly or
precisely into these slots. There is no &quot;typical&quot;
marihuana user, just as their is no typical American. The most
notable statement that can be made about the vast majority of
marihuana users-experimenters and intermittent users-is that they
are essentially indistinguishable from their non-marihuana using
peers by any fundamental criterion other than their marihuana
use. </p>

<p>But if most users and non-users of marihuana essentially are
indistinguishable, why have some people chosen to use the drug
and others not, and why have some people continued to use it and
others not? An important part of the explanation is that use of
marihuana, like all human behavior, occurs within specific social
and cultural settings. The individual's biological
characteristics and personality probably play an important role
in determining the pattern his use will take. However, the
cultural and social setting play a larger role in determining
whether be will use it at all. </p>

<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that the young person who
chooses to use marihuana differs in some important sociological
respects from his peer who does not choose to do so. These
differences relate to his willingness to experiment with a drug,
especially a forbidden one. in short, the process of becoming a
marihuana user is not a &quot; seduction of the, innocent&quot;
as is often portrayed. Based on interrelated familial, social and
cultural factors, persons, especially young persons, who may
choose to use marihuana can be predicted statistically.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Parental Influence<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The decision to use marihuana is related to parental life
style. </p>

<p>Parents provide the most important example of acceptable
drug-taking behavior for their children. That marihuana users
frequently have medicine-taking, cigarette-smoking, or
liquor-drinking parents has been demonstrated. In a series of
Canadian studies, grade and high school students who said their
mothers took tranquilizers daily were three times more likely to
try marihuana than the students who did not so report. </p>

<p>Beyond the influence of a drug-taking example, parents have
the primary influence on their childrens' acquisition of skills,
values and attitudes necessary to be mature and responsible
adults. Many parents have oriented their children toward becoming
independent, competent, educated, and adaptive adults. </p>

<p>Simultaneously, many young people observe in their parents'
lives the trend toward shorter work periods, earlier retirement
and increased emphasis on leisure time activities. It appears
that the incidence of adolescent marihuana use is strongly
correlated with this trend toward increased leisure time.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Situational Factors and Behavioral
Correlates </b></font></p>

<p>All studies of the ever user, including the
Commission-sponsored National Survey, have established that
marihuana smoking is significantly correlated with a number of
demographic variables. Males, college students, and residents of
metropolitan areas, especially in the Northeast and West, are
generally overrepresented in proportion to their percentage of
the total population. </p>

<p>Among the behaviors statistically correlated with marihuana,
use are radical politics, visits to psychiatrists, sexual
freedom, and separate residences from parents. The most
significant behavior seems to be use of legal drugs, especially
alcohol and tobacco. Young people who choose to experiment with
marihuana are fundamentally the same people, socially and
psychologically, as those who use alcohol and tobacco. For
example, in a study of high school youngsters, only 3% of all the
nonsmokers in the sample had ever tried marihuana, compared with
50% of all the current cigarette smokers. Similarly, for alcohol
drinking outside the family setting, only 2% of all the
nondrinkers had tried marihuana, as compared to 27% of the
drinkers. The National Survey tends to confirm the close
association between marihuana use and cigarette smoking and
alcohol use. Among all the adults sampled in the Survey, 71% had
smoked cigarettes and 39% are current smokers. Similarly, of
adult non-marihuana users, 70% have smoked cigarettes and 38% are
current smokers. These percentages increase somewhat for
marihuana users: 87 have smoked cigarettes and 54% are current
cigarette smokers. </p>

<p>In regard to alcohol consumption, 40% of all the adults
sampled indicated that they had not consumed beer or bard liquor
in the 30 days prior to the survey. Marihuana users tended to
have consumed alcohol more often than non-marihuana users (Table,
2).<br>
</p>

<b>30</b> <b>12</b> <b>8</b> <b>24<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Social Group Factors<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>One of the most influential factors in determining behavior in
contemporary America among adolescents and young adults is peer
group influence. Knowing other people who use marihuana
predisposes the individual to use marihuana, and having
marihuana-using friends provides the social opportunity for the
curious. Ile individual who is already part of a, social group
which uses marihuana indicates by this choice that his attitudes
and values are already to some degree compatible with illicit
drug use. </p>

<p>Social peer groups are especially influential upon individuals
who have not yet become &quot;successful&quot; adults, such as
adolescents, college students and young adults, who spend a great
deal of time and effort competing for status in situations where
status opportunities are minimal. The social peer group provides
an opportunity for achieving status among equals by demonstrating
competence and autonomy. Outstanding performance in athletics,
organizations or academics demonstrates competence but not
autonomy because these activities are adult-oriented and
controlled. Additionally, only a relative few are able to excel. </p>

<p>Opportunity to prove oneself is more readily available in the
peer group. Often, adolescents participate in forms of delinquent
behavior, termed symbolic infractions, in order to demonstrate
autonomy and competence to their peers. These include joy-riding,
vandalism, sexual promiscuity, underage drinking, violation of
rules of decorum and dress, and purposeless confrontation with
authority. </p>

<p>Marihuana use has recently been added to the list of
infractions and offers several advantages for adolescents and
young adults. Most important, it provides a shared group
experience which offers the, shy, lonely, socially awkward
neophyte a means of entrance to the group, complete with its own
ceremonial initiation. Repetition of the behavior serves to
increase closeness and commitment to the group. Usually the
experience is pleasurable and the individual is able to control
his level of intoxication. This delinquency is viewed as
relatively harmless to oneself and others, although its symbolic
impact on parents and authority is often greater than that of
other common infractions. </p>

<p>Therefore, a, subtle process of acquiring attitudes favorable
to drug use, of having friends and acquaintances who define the
marihuana experience in acceptable and pleasurable terms, and of
having a social belief system which prepares one to accept the
conversion process to begin with, are all powerful complementary
factors which direct a young person toward marihuana use. At this
point, the use of marihuana provides further opportunities for
acquiring new marihuana using friends and entering the social
milieu of marihuana, users.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Dynamics of Persistent Use<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The cultural and social factors sketched above, in combination
with the individual's somatic and psychic characteristics,
determine the pattern of his drug behavior once he has chosen to
experiment with it. The majority of individuals who reach this
point progress no further and often discontinue marihuana use.
The most common explanation for discontinuing use is loss of
interest; the effect lost its novelty and became boring. Other
less common reasons are fear of legal hazards, social pressure,
and concerns over physical and mental drug effects. Among the
infrequently noted reasons are: interference with other
activities; replacement by alcohol; unavailability; cost;
unpleasant experiences; fear of moral transgression; or
progression to other forms of non-drug interests such as yoga,
transcendental meditation, agrarian communes, esoteric religion
and restrictive diets. </p>

<p>For those who continue use, psychosocial factors are important
determinants of the use patterns. Many marihuana users are
strongly committed to traditional society in which they desire to
rise socially. They have chosen to participate fully in the
traditional adult-oriented activities and the formal
achievement-reward system. Their peer groups consist primarily of
similarly oriented individuals. The infrequent use of marihuana
by these persons is a social activity for fun and satisfies
curiosity. </p>

<p>Those individuals who continue to use marihuana more
frequently appear to be different types of people and oriented
toward a different part of the social system. Most of them
maintain stable career orientations and continue to function
within the broader society. But they feel more burdened by the
traditional system of social controls and more removed from
contemporary society's institutions. These individuals tend to
turn away from more traditional adult-oriented reward systems and
intensify their peer-group orientation. Their interests and
activities emphasize an informal &quot;in-crowd,&quot;
out-of-school or work orientation. The meaning of marihuana use
by this peer group emphasizes the ideological character of usage.
In contrast to the infrequent type of user, these individuals
seem to build their self-identity around the marihuana-using peer
group.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>BECOMING A MULTIDRUG USER<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The more one smokes marihuana, the more involved his
interpersonal relationships are likely to become with his peers
who share the experience with him. As he spends more time with
this group, he begins to sever his contacts with conventional
individuals and conventional routines. He may eventually view
himself as a drug user and be willing to experiment with other
drugs which are approved by his peer group. Only ;a small portion
of the marihuana users who reach this stage are likely to become
persistent, frequent users of these other drugs. The majority
appear to experiment only.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Epidemiologic Studies<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The Commission's studies have confirmed the association
between marihuana usage and the consumption of other drugs for
curiosity and pleasure. This association holds for all drugs,
including over-thecounter and prescription pain relievers,
tension relievers, sleeping pills, and stimulants as well as
hashish, methamphetamines, cocaine, LSD and mescaline, and
heroin. The National Survey showed that current marihuana users
are about twice as likely to have used any illicit drugs than are
those who have ceased using marihuana (Table 3).<br>

<p>The Commission additionally has contracted a study of 105
selected, middle class, young, working adults from California,
who are marihuana smokers. Of this sample, 11% were daily
marihuana users and 47% used it several times a week; 33% used it
several times a month; 6% used it once to several times a year;
and 3% had used it but were not currently using marihuana. The
study indicates that while most of the subjects were frequent
marihuana users, the incidence of other drug use was relatively
low (Table 4).<br>

<p>With the exception of marihuana and hashish, no drug was used
by more than 25% of this population and this use was almost
exclusively experimental. Interestingly, the more exotic drugs,
mescaline and cocaine were more frequently used (21% and 25% of
this sample respectively) than the common dangerous drugs: LSD
(4%), heroin (2%), codeine (11%), barbiturates (14%), and
amphetamines (11%). </p>

<p>Among high school students, marihuana, is normally the, first
illicit drug used, although several recent studies have suggested
that a significant number of students initiate illicit use, with
other drugs. Of the marihuana users, a majority have used no
other illicit drug, and they tend to be experimental or
intermittent users of marihuana. </p>

<p>The more frequently the adolescent uses marihuana, the more
likely he is to experiment with other drugs. For example, in one
recent study of San Diego high school students of predominantly
white middle socioeconomic background, 80% of the students who
used marihuana weekly or more often had used other drugs, and 50%
of this group had used LSD. In contrast, 33% of the less than
weekly users bad used other drugs. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Profiles and Dynamics<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The personality profile of the heavy marihuana user discussed
earlier includes elements propelling him toward heavy involvement
in the multiple-drug-using-subculture. Heavy drug use by these
individuals may reflect and aggravate a total alienation and
disaffiliation from American society and its institutions. This
group hopes to find in drug use more than simple, fun or relief
from boredom. The heavy use of drugs represents a shift into the
drug subculture and an adoption of a totally new life style. Some
observers feel that this shift provides a new identity which
allows the individual to counteract his apathy and search for
meaning in a society he views as unloving, lonely, and
meaningless. He seeks to become involved with what he describes
as the exciting, relevant, &quot;real&quot; experience of life.
Additionally, he believes drug use provides new feelings and
awareness needed to overcome barriers between himself, others,
and the natural world. </p>

<p>The drug culture as a community also helps to meet the needs
of the individual. It provides a ready supply of drugs, unites
common experiences and secrets that enhance the drug experience,
and protects the individual against undesired experiences and
against &quot;the outside world.&quot; Most important, the
culture instills self-confidence by reassuring the individual
that he has been wise in choosing this new identity. </p>

<p>Frequently, these are individuals who express feelings of
loneliness, isolation and over-protection from their home and
family. One frequent pattern involves an intimate, dominating
mother and a distant, unemotional father. In some cases, the
drug-use ritual and the, sense of community closeness offered by
the drug subculture appear to satisfy certain personal needs.
Additionally, joining the subculture provides a release from
sheltered life, a test of competence, an opportunity to
participate, and a chance to express anger. When the anger is
turned inward instead of directed at society and family, drug use
becomes a form of passive, self-destructiveness. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Sociocultural Factors<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>After the individual views himself as a drug user and has
become immersed in the drug-using subculture, the drugs he
chooses to experiment with and his pattern of use are determined
primarily by non-drug factors well beyond the simple properties
of the psychoactive chemical. These factors are predominantly
socioeconomic and sociocultural, although psychic and somatic
factors also play a role in determining who will continue and how
intensively. </p>

<p>The availability of a distribution system which stocks the
other drugs is essential. Most often, contact with this
distribution system is increased by having friends or
acquaintances who use or sell other drugs. However, much of the
marihuana selling takes place, at the customer level between
friends, and involves little profit and relatively small
quantities of the drug. The marihuana user who only buys has
little contact with the professional multidrug dealing system.
However, the user-buyer-seller of marihuana is more involved with
the multidrug system, uses more himself and has more friends who
use and sell other drugs. This factor of being a seller rather
than only a buyer-user is influential in determining the degree
of an individual's involvement with and commitment to the use of
other drugs. </p>

<p>Marihuana use does not itself determine which drugs the
heavily involved user will choose to use. Generally, the
selection of other drugs is influenced by the social group. For
example, blacks and whites have roughly equal rates of trying and
using marihuana, but their choice of other drugs and the styles
of drug use are quite different and distinctive, due to their
frequently different sociocultural backgrounds. Additionally, one
recent study of white high school and college students revealed
different patterns of further drug use among males and females.
Men and women used marihuana in equal numbers, but the men who
used other drugs tended to use hallucinogens while the women
tended to use amphetamines. </p>

<p>An extensive survey of drug use among 3,500 liberal arts
undergraduates attending 14 campuses in the New York area
demonstrated the racial character of drug use among this
population (Table 5).<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Table 5.-RACIAL CHARACTER OF DRUG USE<br>

<b>19</b> <b>21<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>According to recent studies, heroin usage is not common among
white marihuana users. Heroin is most strongly linked to
marihuana use in black and Spanish-speaking ghettos where many
feel they have little chance of personal advancement and
self-fulfillment. In such communities, a segment of the
population constructs new illegitimate but accessible avenues for
social coping. For some this involves the hustle (non-violent
stealing) and the excitement of obtaining and using heroin and
cocaine. They regard marihuana as a &quot;cool&quot; drug and use
it for its social and calming effects. </p>

<p>In contrast, studies have demonstrated that the psychedelics
are more often used by the white, middle to upper middle class,
collegeeducated populations. The typical use of these drugs in
high school college and working populations is episodic and
experimental, and is usually discontinued rather rapidly in
contrast with marihuana use, which for many persons is of long
duration. In many instances, psychedelic drug use begins almost
simultaneously with marihuana. </p>

<p>For a few, drug use becomes an ideologic focus, reflecting
disillusionment with society and rejection of the
&quot;establishment.&quot; These and other motives, including
mere pleasure-seeking, lead to continued use of LSD and other
hallucinogens. Marihuana is viewed as a dilute LSD and is often
used to enhance or prolong the effects of that drug. Sometimes it
is encountered after first LSD use. </p>

<p>Methamphetamine, or &quot;speed,&quot; use is more
characteristic of those lower socioeconomic white, youth who are
not school or work oriented. Living for the moment is the
characteristic attitude of the speed scene. The speed user views
marihuana as he does alcohol and uses it for fun or for its
calming effects. </p>

<p>For these three groups of illicit drug users, marihuana use
has different meanings and is secondary in importance to the use
of the other drugs. Whether or not marihuana leads to other drug
use depends on the individual, on the social and cultural setting
in which the drug use takes places, and on the nature of the drug
market. Its use, however, is neither inevitable nor necessary. <br>
</p>

<p align="center">The Effects of Marihuana on the User<br>
</p>

<p>The previous section has attempted to paint a broad picture of
the marihuana user. This section will deal with the, drug and its
effects on these individuals. </p>

<p>The meaning of drug often varies with the context in which it
is used. The physician would define a drug as any substance used
as a medicine in the treatment of physical or mental disease.
Today, due to the influence of many factors, the layman may focus
on the negative connotations of drugs, such as the stupefying,
poisoning, habit-forming misuse of the opiate drugs. The
considerably wider and more scientific definition of a drug which
will be used in this section is: any chemical substance which has
an action on living tissues.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>A psychoactive drug </i></font><font
size="1"><i>is </i></font><font size="2"><i>any substance capable
of modifying mental performance and individual behavior by
inducing functional or pathological changes in the central
nervous system. <br>
</i></font></p>

<p>As defined, psychoactive drugs exert their major effect on the
state of the mind including emotions, feelings, sensibility,
consciousness and thinking. The definition implies neither
positive nor negative meanings. Chemical substances are not
inherently good or bad. All substances, including medicines and
foods, which man has chosen to consume have certain desired
effects (whether therapeutically beneficial or pleasurable) and
undesired effects (whether detrimental or unpleasant). For
example, eating food is certainly a necessary and pleasurable
activity. However, obesity plays an important role in many
diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure and heart
attacks, and tends to limit physical activities. </p>

<p>The classification of any drug effect as either beneficial or
harmful often greatly depends on the values the classifier places
on the expected effects. This is especially relevant with respect
to the psychoactive drugs such as tranquilizers, stimulants,
coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, marihuana and other licit or illicit
drugs. For all of these drugs, the weights of benefit and harm
are difficult to determine when viewed merely in terms of their
stated effects. <br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>BOTANY AND CHEMISTRY <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Marihuana refers to a preparation derived from a plant,
cannabis sativa L. The preparation contains varying quantities of
the flowers and their resinous secretions, leaves, small stems
and seeds. These plant parts contain many chemical substances.
The chemical substance which produces the major drug effects is
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). According to current information, the
amount of THC present determines the potency of the preparation.
Hereinafter, any reference to drug content or drug effect of
marihuana will, for all practical purposes, mean that of
tetrahydrocannabinol. </p>

<p>The drug content of the plant parts is variable, generally
decreasing in the following sequence: resin, flowers, leaves.
Practically no drug is found in the stems, roots or seeds. The
potency and resulting drug effect of marihuana fluctuates,
depending on the relative proportions of these plant parts in the
marihuana mixture. </p>

<p>Most marihuana available in this country comes from Mexico and
has a THC content of less than 1%. Marihuana of American origin
often contains less than two-tenths of 1% THC. Marihuana
originating in Jamaica and Southeast Asia often has a 2% to 4%
THC content. </p>

<p>Marihuana is the least potent preparation of the plant.
Jamaican ganja, containing primarily the flower tops and the
small leaves or bracts, has a THC content of about 4% to 8%
depending on the mixture. Indian ganja is less potent. The most
potent preparation is hashish (charas) which is composed of only
the drug-rich resinous secretions of the flowers. Generally, the
THC content of hashish is 5 % to 12 %.<br>
</p>

<p>FACTORS INFLUENCING DRUG EFFECT<br>
</p>

<p>A number of variable factors exert an important influence on
the psychopharmacologic effects of marihuana in man, as is true
for all drugs. Failure to take these factors into consideration
probably accounts for a large part of the inconsistency and
controversy surrounding the description of the drug effect.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Dosage</b></font> </p>

<p>The dosage or quantity of the drug (tetrahydrocannabinol)
consumed is the most important variable. As with most drugs, the
larger the dose taken, the greater the physical and mental effect
will be and the longer the effect will last. The effect of a high
dose of marihuana on an individual would be quite different from
the effect of a low, usual &quot;social&quot; dose.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Method of Use<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The method of use has a bearing upon the drug effect. The
method is directly related to both dosage and time lapse before
the drug effect is felt. Injection directly into a vein delivers
the total dose immediately, producing a rapid, maximal response
of minimal duration. Smoking and inhalation cause rapid but less
efficient delivery of the dose; variable quantity of the drug is
destroyed during burning or escapes into the air and does not
reach the lungs. Oral ingestion produces different effects,
according to the system in which the drug is dispersed.
Generally, oral ingestion diminishes the drug effect, but
prolongs it.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Metabolism<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Another factor which influences the effect of the drug is
metabolism. During the metabolic process, the body cells,
principally in the liver and lungs, chemically alter drug
substances, changing their activity and providing for their
elimination from the body. Increasing evidence indicates that
marihuana is first changed by the body in a way that activates or
enhances the drug effect and is subsequently altered in a way
that inactivates the drug prior to its removal from the body. </p>

<p>The rate and direction of these metabolic steps can
significantly influence the effect of marihuana. For instance,
individuals with extensive exposure to marihuana or other drugs
metabolize more rapidly, and perhaps differently, from those
individuals with no drug exposure.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Set and Setting<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>An important variable in discussing the effect of marihuana on
the user is the social and emotional environment; that is, the
individual's &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Set&quot; refers to a combination of factors that create
the &quot;internal environment&quot; of the individual, including
personality, life style, and philosophy, past drug experiences,
personal expectations of drug effect, and mood at the time of the
drug experience. </p>

<p>&quot;Setting&quot; refers to the external environment and
social context in which the individual takes the drug. These
factors are most influential when drugs are taken at low dosages
and, like marihuana, produce minimal physical and subtle
subjective mental effects. The effect of marihuana generally will
be quite different for an intermittent social adult smoker from
that of a youth deeply involved in the youthful drug subculture.
These factors partially account for the belief of a marihuana
user that he is experiencing a &quot;high&quot; in certain
experiments even when he is given a non-marihuana substance
(placebo) but is told it is marihuana. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Tolerance<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Another important factor that determines the immediate effect
of any drug is tolerance. Tolerance has two different
connotations. The first, initial tolerance, is a measure of the
amount of a drug which a subject must receive on first exposure
to produce a designated degree of effect. A variety of innate and
environmental factors contributes to initial tolerance among
individuals. Different individuals require varying amounts of the
drug to attain the same physical and mental effect. </p>

<p>The second connotation, which shall be referred to when we use
the word tolerance, is that of an acquired change in tolerance.
That is, within the same individual, as a result of repeated
exposure to the drug, the same dose of the drug may produce a
diminishing effect so that an increased amount of the drug is
required to produce the same specified degree of effect. </p>

<p>Tolerance develops at differential rates to given effects of
the same drug. If tolerance has developed to one specific effect,
it has not necessarily developed to other specific effects. </p>

<p>By definition, the development of tolerance is neither
beneficial nor detrimental. If tolerance develops rapidly to the
desired mental effect of a &quot;high&quot; but slowly to the
behavioral or physical effects, rapid increase in dose would be
necessary in order to have the desired effect, and progressive
behavioral and physical disruption would be seen. This is the
pattern for amphetamines. </p>

<p>However, if tolerance develops slowly or not at all to the
desired mental effects but more rapidly to the behaviorally or
physically disruptive effects, no dosage increase or only a
slight one would be necessary and the unpleasant and undesired
effects would progressively diminish. </p>

<p>With regard to marihuana, present indications are that
tolerance does develop to the behaviorally and physically
disruptive effects, in both animals and man, especially at high
frequent doses for prolonged time periods. Studies in foreign
countries indicate that very heavy prolonged use of very large
quantities of hashish leads to the development of tolerance to
the mental effects, requiring an increase in intake to reach the
original level of satisfaction. However, for the intermittent use
pattern and even the moderate use pattern, little evidence exists
to indicate the development of tolerance to the desired
&quot;high,&quot; although the high may persist for a shorter
time period. During the Boston free-access study, no change was
apparent in the level of the high produced by a relatively large
dose of the drug over a 21-day period of moderate to heavy
smoking. <br>
</p>

<p>The fact that some individuals smoke more of the drug than
others may merely reflect a desire for a different level of
&quot;high.&quot; There is a tendency to develop a tolerance to
the physical effects and behaviorally disruptive effects,
especially the depressant effects, in heavy daily users. The
development of such behavioral tolerance of this nature may
explain the fact that experienced marihuana smokers describe a
lower occurrence rate of undesirable drug effects. The
development of tolerance may also explain why these smokers
exhibit normal behavior and competent performance of ordinary
tasks, while not appearing intoxicated to others even though they
are at their usual level of intoxication.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Reverse Tolerance<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Repeated exposure to marihuana has been said to cause an
individual to need lesser amounts of the drug to achieve the same
degree of intoxication. This &quot;reverse tolerance&quot; may be
related to one's learning to get high or to the recognition of
the subtle intoxication at low doses. Or perhaps, such tolerance
reflects an increase in the body's ability to change the drug to
an active chemical. To date, the existence of &quot;reverse
tolerance&quot; has not been substantiated in an experimental
setting.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Duration of Use<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Tolerance development is only one of a variety of occurrences
which possibly are related to repetitive use of marihuana. Any
discussion of drug effect must also take into account the time
period over which the drug use occurs. Immediate effects of a
single drug experience must be contrasted with effects of
short-term use and the effects of longterm use in order to detect
any cumulative effects or more subtle, gradually occurring
changes. </p>

<p>This issue of an individual's change over a period of years is
quite complex; a multitude of factors other than marihuana use
may affect his life. As previously defined, short-term refers to
periods of less than two years, long-term to periods of two to 10
years, and very long-term to periods greater than 10 years. Most
of the American experience involves short-term and long-term use,
with low doses of weak preparations of the drug.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Patterns of Use<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The drug effect of marihuana can be realistically discussed
only within the context of who the user is, how long he has used
marihuana, how much and how frequently he uses it, and the,
social setting of his use. <br>
</p>

<p>In general, for virtually any drug, the heavier the pattern of
use, the greater the risk of either direct or indirect damage.
For purposes of this discussion, the patterns of use developed in
the first section of this chapter will be utilized. Because
frequency of use is presently the, primary determinant of use
patterns in this country, we employ similar designations: </p>

<p><font size="2">(1) The <i>experimenter </i>who uses marihuana,
at most a few times over a short term and then generally ceases
to use it, or uses once a month or less;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(2) The <i>intermittent user </i>who uses
marihuana, infrequently, that is more than once monthly but less
than several times a week;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(3) <i>The moderate user </i>who uses it from
several times a week to once daily, generally over a long term;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">(4) The <i>heavy user </i>who uses it several
times a day over a long term and;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(5) The <i>very heavy user </i>who is
constantly intoxicated with high tetrahydrocannabinol content
preparations, usually hashish, over a very long term.</font> </p>

<p>Again, these classifications are not intended to be rigid but
are designed to facilitate a discussion of the many usage
patterns. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Definition of Dependence <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Before describing the effect of marihuana, on
the user, two additional definitions are required. They concern
the concept of <i>dependence </i>which has so clouded public and
professional consideration of psychoactive drugs. Throughout the
remainder of this report, we refer Separately to psychological
and physical dependence, defined as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Psychological dependence </i>is the repeated
use of psychoactive drugs leading to a conditioned pattern of
drug-seeking behavior. The intensity of dependence varies with
the nature of the drug, the method, frequency, and duration of
administration, the mental and physical attributes of the
individual, and the characteristics of the physical and social
environment. Its intensity is at its peak when drug-seeking
becomes a compulsive and undeviating pattern of behavior.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Physical dependence </i>is the state of
latent hyper-excitability which develops in the central nervous
system of higher mammals following frequent and prolonged
administration of the morphine-like analgesics, alcohol,
barbiturates, and other depressants. Such dependence is not
manifest subjectively or objectively during drug administration.
Specific symptoms and signs, the abstinence syndrome, occur upon
abrupt termination of drug administration; or with morphinelike
agonists by administering the specific antagonists.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>EFFECTS RELATED TO PATTERN

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>IMMEDIATE DRUG EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The immediate effects are those which occur during the drug
intoxication or shortly following it. The user is aware of some
of these effects, for they often cause him to use the drug. At
the same time, many changes may occur in his body which can be
measured by others but are not obvious to him.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Subjective Effects<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>A description of an individual's feelings and state of
consciousness as affected by low doses of marihuana is difficult;
the condition is not similar to usual waking states and is the
result of a highly individual experience. Perhaps the closest
analogies are the experience of day dreaming or the moments just
prior to falling asleep. The effect is not constant and a
cyclical waxing and waning of the intensity of the intoxication
occurs periodically. </p>

<p>At low, usual &quot;social&quot; doses, the intoxicated
individual may experience an increased sense of well-being;
initial restlessness and hilarity followed by a dreamy, carefree
state of relaxation; alteration of sensory perceptions including
expansion of space and time; and a more vivid sense of touch,
sight, smell, taste, and sound; a feeling of hunger, especially a
craving for sweets; and subtle changes in thought formation and
expression. To an unknowing observer, an individual in this state
of consciousness would not appear noticeably different from his
normal state. </p>

<p>At higher, moderate doses, these same reactions are
intensified but the changes in the individual would still be
scarcely noticeable to an observer. The individual may experience
rapidly changing emotions, changing sensory imagery, dulling of
attention, more altered thought formation and expression such as
fragmented thought, flight of ideas, impaired immediate memory,
disturbed associations, altered sense of self-identity and, to
some, a perceived feeling of enhanced insight. </p>

<p>At very high doses, psychotomimetic phenomena may be
experienced. These, include distortions of body image, loss of
personal identity, sensory and mental illusions, fantasies and
hallucinations. </p>

<p>Nearly all persons who continue to use marihuana describe
these usual effects in largely pleasurable terms. However, others
might call some of these same effects unpleasant or undesirable. </p>

<p>As discussed earlier, a wide range of extra-drug factors also
influences marihuana's effects. The more the individual uses
marihuana and the longer he has been using it, the more likely
the experiences will be predominantly pleasurable, and the less
likely the effects will be unpleasant. An increasing
sensitization to those effects viewed as pleasant occurs as the
user has more experience with the drug. </p>

<p>Persons subject to unpleasant reactions may eliminate
themselves from the using group although the occasional
experience of an unpleasant effect does not always discourage
use.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Body Function<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>A large amount of research has been performed in man and
animals regarding the immediate effect of marihuana on bodily
processes. No conclusive evidence exists of any physical damage,
disturbances of bodily processes or proven human fatalities
attributable solely to even very high doses of marihuana.
Recently, animal studies demonstrated a relatively large margin
of safety between the psychoactive dose and the physical and
behavioral toxic and lethal dose. Such studies seemed to indicate
that safe human study could be undertaken over a wide dose range.
</p>

<p>Low to moderate doses of the drug produce minimal measurable
transient changes in body functions. Generally, pulse rate
increases, recumbent blood pressure increases slightly, and
upright blood pressure decreases. The eyes redden, tear secretion
is decreased, the pupils become slightly smaller, the fluid
pressure within the eye lessens and one study reports that the
eyeball rapidly oscillates (nystagmus). </p>

<p>A minimal decrement in maximum muscle strength, the presence
of a fine hand tremor, and a decrease in hand and body steadiness
have also been noted. Decreased sensitivity to pain and
overestimation of elapsed time may occur. </p>

<p>The effects of marihuana on brain waves are still unclear and
inconsistent. Generally, the intoxication produces minimal,
transient changes of rapid onset and short duration. Sleep time
appears to increase, as does dreaming. </p>

<p>Investigation of the effects of marihuana on a wide variety of
other bodily function indices has revealed few consistently
observed changes. </p>

<p>These few consistently observed transient effects on bodily
function seem to suggest that marihuana is a rather unexciting
compound of negligible immediate toxicity at the doses usually
consumed in this country. The substance is predominantly a
psychoactive drug. The feelings and state of consciousness
described by the intoxicated seem to be far more interesting than
the objective state noted by an observer.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Mental Function<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Marihuana, like other psychoactive substances, predominantly
affects mental processes and responses (cognitive tasks) and thus
the motor responses directed by mental processes (psychomotor
tasks). Generally, the degree of impairment of cognitive and
psychomotor performance is dose-related, with minimal effect at
low doses. The impairment varies during the period of
intoxication, with the maximal effect at the peak intoxication.
Performance of simple or familiar tasks is at most minimally
impaired, while poor performance is demonstrated on complex,
unfamiliar tasks. Experienced marihuana users commonly
demonstrate significantly less decrement in performance than
drug-naive, individuals. </p>

<p>The greater his past marihuana experience, the better the
intoxicated individual is able to compensate for drug effect on
ordinary performance at usual doses. Furthermore, marked
individual variation in performance is noted when all else is
held constant. The effect of marihuana on cognitive and
psychomotor performance is therefore highly individualized and
not easily predictable. Effects on emotional reactions and on
volition are equally variable and are difficult to measure under
laboratory conditions, but can be significant.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Intoxicated State<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Studies of intoxicated persons have suggested possible
explanations for the subtle effects on mental processes produced
by marihuana, Generally, a temporary episodic impairment of
short-term memory occurs. These memory voids may be filled with
thoughts and perceptions extraneous to organized -mental
processes. Past and future may become obscured -as the individual
focuses on filling the present momentary memory lapse. His sense
of self -identity may seem altered if he cannot place himself in
his usual time frame. </p>

<p>This altered state of mind may be regarded by the individual
as pleasant or unpleasant. The important factors of dosage and
set and setting play a most important role in this determination.
When the nature of the drug-taking situation and the
characteristics of the individual are optimal. the user is apt to
describe his experience as one of relaxation, sensitivity,
friendliness, carefreeness, thoughtfulness, happiness,
peacefulness, and fun. For most marihuana users who continue to
use the drug, the experience is overwhelmingly pleasurable. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Unpleasant Reactions<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>However, when these circumstances are not optimal, the
experience may be unpleasant and an undesirable reaction to the
marihuana intoxication occurs. In these instances, anxiety,
depression, fatigue or cognitive loss are experienced as a
generalized feeling of ill-being and discomfort. A heavy sluggish
feeling, mentally and physically, is common in inexperienced
marihuana smokers who overshoot the desired high or in persons
who might orally ingest too large a dose. Dizziness, nausea,
incoordination, and palpitations often accompany the &quot;too
stoned&quot; feeling.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Anxiety States<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>&quot;Novice anxiety reactions&quot; or feelings of panic
account for a majority of unpleasant reactions to marihuana. When
the distortion of self image and time is recognized by the
individual as drug-induced and temporary, the experience is
viewed as pleasurable. Anxiety -and panic result when these
changes cause the individual to fear that the loss of his
identity and self-control may not end, and that he is dying or
&quot;losing his mind.&quot; These anxiety and panic reactions
are transient and usually disappear over a few hours as the
drug's effects wear off, or more quickly with gentle friendly
reassurance. </p>

<p>The large majority of these, anxiety reactions occur in
individuals who are experimenting with marihuana. Most often
these individuals have an intense underlying anxiety surrounding
marihuana use, such as fears of arrest, disruption of family and
occupational relations, and possible bodily or mental harm. Often
they are older and have relatively rigid personalities with less
desire for new and different experiences. </p>

<p>The incidence of these anxiety reactions may have decreased as
marihuana use has become acceptable to wider populations, as the
fears of its effects have lessened and as users have developed
experience in management of these reactions.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Psychosis<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Rare cases of full-blown psychotic episodes have been
precipitated by marihuana. Generally, the individuals had
previous mental disorders or had poorly developed personalities
and were marginally adjusted to their life situation. Often the
episode occurred at times of excessive stress. These episodes are
characteristically temporary. Psychotherapy and sometimes
medications are useful in prompt control and treatment of this
psychological reaction. In addition, rare nonspecific toxic
psychoses have occurred after extremely high doses. This state of
nonspecific drug intoxication or acute brain syndrome is
self-limited and clears spontaneously as the drug is eliminated
from the body.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Conclusions<br>
</b></p>

<p>In summary, the immediate effect of marihuana on normal mental
processes is a subtle alteration in state of consciousness
probably related to a change in short-term memory, mood, emotion
and volition. This effect on the mind produces a varying
influence on cognitive and psychomotor task performance which is
highly individualized, as well as related to dosage, time,
complexity of the task and experience of the user. The effect on
personal, social and vocational functions is difficult to
predict. In most instances, the marihuana intoxication is
pleasurable. In rare cases, the experience may lead to unpleasant
anxiety and panic, and in a predisposed few, to psychosis.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>SHORT-TERM EFFECTS <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The effect of an enormous daily oral dose of the drug (up to
about one hundred thousand times the minimal behaviorally
effective human dose) was recently studied in rats and monkeys
for three months. A severe, generalized nervous system depression
was evident the first few days. Evidence of cumulative toxicity
was observed at these doses. Severe central -nervous system
depression produced fatalities in some rats in the first few days
until tolerance developed. Later, extreme hyperactivity
developed. </p>

<p>The monkeys experienced severe central nervous system
depression and one group showed mild hyperactivity, but all
rapidly returned to normal behavior after the development of
tolerance to these effects. Minimal dose-related toxic effects on
bodily organs were noted at autopsy at the conclusion of the
experiment. These non-specific findings of unknown meaning
included bypocellularity of the bone marrow and spleen and
hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex. </p>

<p>A 28-day study employing intravenous administration of from
one to ten thousand times the minimal effective human dose to
monkeys produced -similar findings clinically. In the high dose
groups delayed deaths from acute hemorrhagic pneumonia were
possibly caused by accumulation of clumps of THC in the lung
producing irritation similar to that seen at the injection sites.
No other organ pathology was noted. These animal studies
illustrated that the margin of safety between active dose and
toxic dose was enormous. </p>

<p>A few studies have recently been carried out to observe the
effect of a few weeks of daily marihuana smoking in man. The
amount smoked was a relatively large American dose. Frequency of
use was once to several times daily. </p>

<p>During the 21-day Boston free-access study, no harmful effects
were observed on general bodily functions, motor functions,
mental functions, personal or social behavior or work
performance. Total sleep time and periods of sleep were
increased. Weight gain was uniformly noted. </p>

<p>No evidence of physical dependence or signs of withdrawal were
noted. In the heaviest smokers, -moderate psychological
dependence was suggested by an increased negative mood after
cessation of smoking. </p>

<p>Tolerance appeared to develop to the immediate effects of the
drug on general bodily functions (pulse rate) and
psychomotor-cognitive performance (time estimation, short-term
memory, and shootinggallery skill) but not to the
&quot;high.&quot; Marihuana intoxication did not significantly
inhibit the ability of the subjects to improve with practice
through time on these psychological-motor tasks. </p>

<p>Neither immediate nor short-term (21 day) high-dose marihuana
intoxication decreased motivation to engage in a variety of
social and goal-directed behaviors. No consistent alteration that
could be related to marihuana smoking over this period of time
was observed in work performance of a simple task, participation
in aspects of the research study, or interest and participation
in a variety of personal activities, such as writing, reading,
interest and knowledge of current world events, or participation
in athletic or aesthetic activities. </p>

<p>Marihuana smoking appeared to affect patterns of social
interactions. Although use of the drug was found to be a group
social activity around which conversation and other types of
social behavior were centered, it was not uncommon for some or
all of the smokers to withdraw from the social interaction and
concentrate on the subjective drug experience. </p>

<p>During the first part of the smoking period, both intermittent
and daily users demonstrated a marked decrement in total
interaction. Total interaction continued to diminish among
intermittent users but increased above presmoking levels among
the daily users during the later parts of the smoking period. The
quality of the interaction was more convivial and less
task-oriented when marihuana was available to the group. </p>

<p>Additionally, an assessment of the effect of marihuana on
risktaking behavior revealed that daily users tended to become
more conservative when engaging in decision-making under
conditions of risk. </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>LONG-TERM EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Our knowledge about marihuana is incomplete, but certain
behavior characteristics appear to be emerging in regard to long
term American marihuana use which, for the most part, is
significantly less than 10 years. These impressions were
confirmed in the Boston free-access study. The group of American
young adults studied averaged five years (range 2-17 years) of
intermittent or daily use, of marihuana. </p>

<p>No significant physical, biochemical, or mental abnormalities
could be attributed solely to their marihuana smoking. Some
abnormality of pulmonary function was demonstrated in many of the
subjects which could not be correlated-with quantity, frequency
or duration of smoking marihuana and/or tobacco cigarettes. (One
other investigation recently completed uncovered no abnormalities
in lung or heart functioning of a group of non-cigarette smoking
heavy marihuana users). Many of the subjects were in fair to poor
physical condition, as judged by exercise tolerance. </p>

<p>The performance of one-fifth of the subjects on a battery of
tests sensitive to brain function was poorer on at least one,
index than would have been predicted on the basis of their IQ
scores and education. But a definite relationship between the
poor test scores and prior marihuana or hallucinogen use could
not be proven. </p>

<p>In the past few years, observers have noted various social,
psychological and behavioral changes among young high school and
college age Americans including many who have used marihuana
heavily for a number of years. These changes are reflected by a
loss of volitional goal direction. These individuals drop out and
relinquish traditional adult roles and values. They become
present rather than future oriented, appear alienated from
broadly accepted social and occupational activity, and experience
reduced concern for personal hygiene and nutrition. </p>

<p>Several psychiatrists believe they have detected clinically
that some heavy marihuana-using individuals appear to undergo
subtle changes in personality and modes of thinking, with a
resulting change in life style. In adopting this new life style,
a troubled youth may turn toward a subculture where drug use and
untraditional behavior are acceptable. </p>

<p>This youthful population resembles in many respects the
marihuana smoker described in the Boston study. No evidence
exists to date to demonstrate that marihuana use alone caused
these behavioral changes either directly or indirectly. Many
individuals reach the same point without prior marihuana use or
only intermittent or moderate use; and many more individuals use
marihuana as heavily but do not evidence these changes. For some
of these young people, the drop out state is only a temporary
phase, preceding a personal reorganization and return to a more
conventional life style. </p>

<p>If heavy, long-term marihuana use is linked to the formation
of this complex of social, psychological and behavioral changes
in young people, then it is only one of many contributing
factors. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2">VERY LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF HEAVY AND VERY HEAVY
USE <br>
</font></p>

<p>Knowledge of the effects of very heavy, very long-term use of
marihuana by man is still incomplete. The Commission has
extensively reviewed the world literature as well as ongoing
studies in Jamaica and Greece, and carefully observed very heavy,
very long-term using populations in countries in other parts of
the world, such as Afghanistan and India. These populations smoke
and often drink much stronger drug preparations, hashish and
ganja, than are commonly used in America. From these
investigations, some observable consequences are becoming much
clearer.<br>
</p>

<p>Tolerance and Dependence<br>
</p>

<p>Some tolerance does occur with prolonged heavy usage; large
drug doses are necessary for the desired effects. Abrupt
withdrawal does not lead to a specific or reproducible abstinence
syndrome and physical dependence has not been demonstrated in man
or in animals. The very heavy users studied did evidence strong
psychological dependence, but were able to cease use for short
periods of time. In these users, <br>
</p>

<p>withdrawal does induce, symptoms characteristic of
psychological dependence. The anxiety, restlessness, insomnia,
and other non-specific symptoms of withdrawal are very similar in
kind and intensity to those experienced by compulsive cigarette
smokers. </p>

<p>Although the distress of withdrawal exerts a very strong
psychogenic drive to continue use, fear of withdrawal is, in most
cases, not adequate to inspire immediate criminal acts to obtain
the drug. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>General Body Function<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In the Jamaican study, no significant physical or mental
abnormalities could be attributed to marihuana use, according to
an evaluation of medical history, complete physical examination,
chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, blood cell and chemistry tests,
lung, liver or kidney function tests, selected hormone
evaluation, brain waves, psychiatric evaluation, and
psychological testing. There was no evidence to indicate that the
drug as commonly used was responsible for producing birth defects
in offspring of users. This aspect is also being studied further.
</p>

<p>Heavy smoking, no matter if the substance was tobacco or
ganja, was shown to contribute to pulmonary functions lower than
those found among persons who smoked neither substance. All the
ganja smokers studied also smoked tobacco. In Jamaica, ganja is
always smoked in a mixture with tobacco; and many of the subjects
were heavy cigarette smokers, as well. </p>

<p>In a study of a Greek hashish-using population preliminary
findings revealed poor dentition, enlarged livers, and chronic
bronchitis. Further study is required to clarify the relationship
of these to hashish use, alcohol or tobacco use, or general life
style of this user population.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Social Functioning<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Similarly, the Jamaican and Greek subjects did not evidence
any deterioration of mental or social functioning which could be
attributed solely to heavy very long-term cannabis use. </p>

<p>These individuals appear to have used the drug without
noticeable behavioral or mental deviation from their lower
socioeconomic group norms, as detected by observation in their
communities and by extensive sociological interviews,
psychological tests and psychiatric examination. </p>

<p>Overall life style was not different from non-users in their
lower socioeconomic community. They were alert and realistic,
with average intelligence based on their education. Most
functioned normally in their communities with stable families,
homes, jobs, and friends. These individuals seem to have survived
heavy long-term cannabis use without major physical or behavioral
defects.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Mental Functioning<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The incidence of psychiatric hospitalizations for acute
psychoses and of use of drugs other than alcohol is not
significantly higher than among the non-using population. The
existence of a specific longlasting, cannabis-related psychosis
is poorly defined. If heavy cannabis use produces a, specific
psychosis, it must be quite rare or else exceedingly difficult to
distinguish from other acute or chronic psychoses. </p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that the occurrence of any form of
psychosis in heavy cannabis users is no higher than in the
general population. Although such use is often quite, prevalent
in hospitalized mental patients, the drug could only be
considered a. causal factor in a, few cases. Most of these were,
short-term reactions or toxic overdoses. In addition, a
concurrent use of alcohol often played a role in the, episode
causing hospitalization. </p>

<p>These findings are somewhat surprising in view of the
widespread belief that cannabis attracts the mentally unstable,
vulnerable individual. Experience in the United States has not
involved a level of heavy marihuana, use comparable to these
foreign countries. Consequently, such long-lasting psychic
disturbances possibly caused by heavy cannabis use have not been
observed in this country. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Motivation and Behavioral Change<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Another controversial form of social-mental deterioration
allegedly related to very long-term very heavy cannabis use is
the &quot;amotivational syndrome.&quot; It supposedly affects the
very heavy using population and is described world-wide as a,
loss of interest in virtually all activities other than cannabis
use, with resultant lethargy, amorality, instability and social
and personal deterioration. The reasons for the occurrence of
this syndrome are varied and hypothetical; drug use is only one
of many components in the socioeconomic and psychocultural
backgrounds of the individuals. </p>

<p>Intensive studies of the Greek and Jamaican populations of
heavy long-term cannabis users appear to dispute the sole
causality of cannabis in this syndrome. The heavy ganja and
hashish using individuals were from lower socioeconomic groups,
and possessed average intelligence but had little education and
small chance of vocational advancement. Most were married and
maintained families and households. They were all employed, most
often as laborers or small businessmen, at a level which
corresponded with their education and opportunity. </p>

<p>In general, their life styles were dictated by socioeconomic
factors and did not appear to deteriorate as a result of cannabis
use. The Jamaicans were working strenuously and regularly at
generally uninteresting jobs. In their culture, cannabis serves
as a work adjunct. The users believe the drug provides energy for
laborious work and helps them to endure their routine tasks.<br>
</p>

<p>In contrast, others have described Asian and African
populations where heavy to very heavy hashish or charas smoking
for a very long time is associated with clear-cut behavioral
changes. In these societies, the smokers are mostly jobless,
illiterate persons of the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds. They
generally begin to use the drug in their early teens and continue
its use up to their 60's. </p>

<p>The users prefer to smoke in groups of two to 20, generally in
a quiet place out of the reach of non-smokers. Weakness,
malnutrition and sexual difficulties, usually impotence, a-re
common. Some of them report sleep disturbances. </p>

<p>Most users who have used the drug for 20 to 30 years are lazy
and less practical in most of their daily acts and reluctant to
make decisions. However, their ability to perform non-complicated
tasks is as good as non-smokers. </p>

<p>Although the smokers think they become faster in their daily
work, a general slowness in all their activities is noticed by
others. This user population is typically uncreative. They make
little if any significant contribution to the social, medical or
economic improvement of their community. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SUMMARY<br>
</b></p>

<p>Once existing marihuana, policy was cast into the realm of
public debate, partisans on both sides of the issue
over-simplified the question of the effects of use of the, drug
on the individual. Proponents of the prohibitory legal system
contended that marihuana, was a, dangerous drug, while opponents
insisted that it was a harmless drug or was less harmful than
alcohol or tobacco. </p>

<p>Any psychoactive drug is potentially harmful to the
individual, depending on the intensity, frequency and duration of
use. Marihuana is no exception. Because the particular hazards of
use differ for different drugs, it makes no sense, to compare the
harmfulness of different drugs. One may compare, insofar as the
individual is concerned, only the harmfulness of specific
effects. Is heroin less harmful than alcohol because, unlike
alcohol, it directly causes no physical in-jury? Or is heroin
more harmful than alcohol because at normal doses its use is more
incapacitating in a behavioral sense? </p>

<p>Assessment of the relative dangers of particular drugs is
meaningful only in a wider context which weighs the possible
benefits of the drugs, the comparative scope of their use, and
their relative impact on society at large. We consider these
questions in the next Chapter, particularly in connection with
the impact on public health. </p>

<p>Looking only at the effects on the individual, there, is
little proven danger of physical or psychological harm from the
experimental or intermittent use of the natural preparations of
cannabis, including the resinous mixtures commonly used in this
country. The risk of harm lies instead in the heavy, long-term
use of the drug, particularly of the most potent preparations. </p>

<p>The experimenter and the intermittent users develop little or
no psychological dependence on the drug. No organ injury is
demonstrable. </p>

<p>Some moderate users evidence a degree of psychological
dependence which increases in intensity with prolonged duration
of use. Behavioral effects are lesser in stable personalities but
greater in those with emotional instability. Prolonged duration
of use does increase the probability of some behavioral and
organic consequences including the possible shift to a heavy use
pattern. </p>

<p>The heavy user shows strong psychological dependence on
marihuana and often hashish. Organ injury, especially diminuation
of pulmonary function, is possible. Specific behavioral changes
are detectable. All of these effects are more apparent with
long-term and very long-term heavy use than with short-term heavy
use. </p>

<p>The very heavy users, found in countries where the use of
cannabis has been indigenous for centuries, have a compulsive
psychological dependence on the drug, most commonly used in the
form of hashish. Clear-cut behavioral changes and a greater
incidence of associated biological injury occur as duration of
use increases. At present, the Commission is unaware of any
similar pattern in this country. <br>

<h1>Social Impact of marihuana use<br>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Man is a creature who lives not upon
bread alone but principally by catchwords.&quot; -Robert Louis
Stevenson,</font> </p>

<hr>

<p>Implicit in existing social and legal policy toward marihuana
is the view that society suffers in some way from use of the
drug. When the widespread practice of marihuana smoking appeared
in the United States in the early decades of the 20th century,
the medical, law enforcement, newspaper, and legislative
communities immediately indicted the drug. They assumed that the
drug posed serious dangers to individual health; but more
importantly, they viewed it as a menace to the public order.
Crime, insanity and idleness were thought to be the inevitable
consequences of its use. </p>

<p>That some of these original fears were unfounded and that
others were exaggerated have been clear for many years. Yet, many
of these early beliefs continue to affect contemporary public
attitudes and concerns. Consequently, one of the Commission's
most important tasks is to evaluate carefully all data relevant
to the social impact of marihuana use. We must determine whether
and in what respects social concern is justified. What is myth
and what is reality? </p>

<p>The literature pertaining to -the presumed effects and
consequences of marihuana use still reveals a wide diversity of
opinion about social impact. Careful scrutiny is inhibited by the
prevalence of hearsay, rhetoric and undocumented assertions about
the effects and consequences of marihuana use. Nonetheless,
evidence is mounting and a number of significant trends have
recently emerged. In the previous Chapter we explored the
evidence regarding the nature and scope of contemporary marihuana
use, and the effects of the drug on the individual user. Now we
must consider the impact on society of behavior resulting from
use of marihuana. </p>

<p>In dealing with the behavioral consequences of marihuana, use,
the Commission has made, a concerted effort to review and
evaluate the enormous body of existing popular and scientific
literature, and has itself initiated new empirical research,
including national surveys, retrospective studies and controlled
laboratory experiments. </p>

<p>Awareness of the difficulties involved in investigating an
inherently complex social phenomenon and applying its research
findings to policy decisions has fostered particular sensitivity
to the quality of previous and Commission-sponsored research. As
such, considerable attention was given to such basic research
questions as: </p>

<p>What behavioral effects are most relevant in assessing the
consequences of marihuana use? </p>

<p>What measures produce the most valid data concerning given
effects? </p>

<p>What reliance should be placed on various research techniques,
such as self-reporting, controlled experiments, clinical
observations and statistical relationships? </p>

<p>What generalizations can be made from particular populations
studied? </p>

<p>What are the limits of given data in terms of inference.
interpredation and attribution of cause?<br>
</p>

<p>With respect to the Commission's own research program, the
process of selection and allocation of resources was indeed
difficult, and some areas of inquiry have undoubtedly been either
neglected or shortchanged. Nonetheless, we believe that the
studies undertaken and information gathered will add
significantly to our understanding of the conditions and
circumstances under which marihuana use is likely to affect
adversely the public safety, public health and welfare, and
dominant social order.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marihuana and Public Safety<br>
</b></p>

<p>The belief that marihuana is causally linked to crime and
other antisocial conduct first assumed prominence during the
1930's as the result of a concerted effort by governmental
agencies and the press to alert the American populace to the
dangers of marihuana use. Newspapers all over the country began
to publish lurid accounts of &quot;marihuana atrocities.&quot; In
the absence of adequate understanding of the effects of the drug,
these largely unsubstantiated stories profoundly influenced
public opinion and gave birth to the stereotype of the marihuana
user as physically aggressive, lacking in self-control,
irresponsible, mentally ill and, perhaps most alarming,
criminally inclined and dangerous. The combination of the
purported effects of the drug itself plus the belief that it was
used by unstable individuals seemed to constitute a significant
danger to public safety. </p>

<p>Now, more than 30 years later, many observers are skeptical
about the existence of a cause-effect relationship between
marihuana use and antisocial conduct.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>MARIHUANA AND CRIME <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Over the years, there have been several hypotheses about the
relationship between marihuana and antisocial conduct. The
earliest view was that marihuana causes or leads to the
commission of aggressive and violent criminal acts such as
murder, rape and assault. These acts are committed, it has been
argued, because marihuana allegedly produces a relaxation of
ordinary inhibitions, a weakening of impulse control and a
concomitant increase in aggressive tendencies while the user is
under its influence. </p>

<p>Marihuana's alleged criminogenic role is not always limited to
violent or aggressive behavior. Some commentators also postulate
that marihuana leads to or causes non-violent forms of criminal
or delinquent conduct, ranging from sexual promiscuity to grand
larceny. Underlying this second causal hypothesis are the
assumptions that marihuana frequently impairs judgment, distorts
reality and diminishes, at least temporarily, the user's sense of
personal and social responsibility. Regular or heavy use over an
extended period of time is felt to interfere, perhaps
irreversibly, with the orderly development of psychosocial and
moral maturity. </p>

<p>As indicated above, however, a growing uncertainty prevails
about ,the existence of a causal link between marihuana use and
antisocial conduct. In fact, recent surveys, including several
sponsored by the Commission, suggest that large segments of the
professional public, particularly the law enforcement and
criminal justice communities, are no longer willing to assert a,
cause-effect relationship but observe, instead, the existence of
a statistical association. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Issue of Cause and Effect<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The controversy over the cause-effect relationship between
marihuana use and criminal, violent or delinquent behavior poses
a number of serious problems for the investigators Proponents and
opponents of the causal view tend to rely on different kinds of
evidence and to call upon different types of experts, thereby
differing substantially in the kinds of information they accept
as relevant, reliable or valid. </p>

<p>Practitioners, such as police and probation officers for
example, frequently cite case examples in which apprehended
offenders are found to be in possession of marihuana at the time
of arrest. The mere presence of the drug or the fact that an
offender is a known user of marihuana is sometimes deemed
sufficient to establish a causal link between the marihuana and
the offense.* </p>

<p>Empiricists, on the other hand, would deny that the simple
presence of the drug constitutes a satisfactory demonstration of
a causal relationship between marihuana use and the crime in
question. They would defer, instead, to the results of empirical
studies designed explicitly to test the assertion. Essentially,
they emphasize that even if some offenders do use marihuana, an
equal or larger number of offenders do not, and there are
certainly large numbers of marihuana users in the
population-at-large who never engage in the kinds of antisocial
conduct deemed to be related to or caused by the use of the drug.
</p>

<p>Proving any positive and direct relationship, be it causal or
otherwise, between two inherently complex social phenomena is
fraught with enormous difficulties. The relationship of marihuana
use to crime, violence, aggression or juvenile delinquency
presents no exception. Before examining the evidence with respect
to the existence of a causal connection, certain basic
considerations deserve at least brief mention here. </p>

<p>To prove, the existence of a positive and direct relationship,
one would be required to demonstrate that the alleged offender
was, indeed, a marihuana, user; that he was under the influence
of the drug at the time he committed the offense; and that the
crime was directly attributable to the effects of the marihuana.
The kinds of evidence necessary to establish these facts are not
easy to obtain. </p>

<p>First, evidence of the use of marihuana by the accused is
generally dependent upon either direct admission of use, hearsay
evidence, or inferences derived from knowledge of possession
(that is, the offender was found to have marihuana on his person
or in his possession at the time of arrest). </p>

<p>Second, because no chemical tests presently exist outside the
laboratory to identify the presence of marihuana in the body of
the accused, it is difficult if not impossible to prove that the
offender was definitely under the influence of marihuana when he
committed the offense. </p>

<p>Third, in order to prove that the marihuana represented the
significant contributory or precipitating variable, all other
factors possibly related to the offense would have to be examined
and excluded. </p>

<p>The problems of validation are further compounded by
additional variations in behavior attributable to: (a) the
pharmacological potency of the drug; (b) possible adulteration of
the marihuana; (c) the interaction of marihuana with other drugs
simultaneously ingested; (d) differing individual response to
similar dosage levels; (e) the time-action function; (f) the
cumulative effect of marihuana use; and (g) various social,
psychological and situational variables such as set and setting,
individual expectations, personal predispositions or preexisting
impulse disorders. </p>

<p>Despite the inherent complexities of the issue and the
difficulties in securing reliable and valid evidence, a
relatively large body of research is now available pertaining to
the criminogenic effects of marihuana upon the individual and the
nature and extent to which the drug constitutes a danger to
public safety. In the following section, we present the available
evidence and assess the strength and direction of the alleged
relationships between marihuana use and violent or aggressive
behavior and also non-violent forms of criminal and delinquent
behavior.<br>
</p>

<p>*In the widely publicized Licata case of the 1930's. for
example, a 16-year-old cannabis user was charged with the ax
murder of his family and the offense was directly attributed to
the effects of marihuana. There was, however. no precise
information available regarding the use of marihuana in relation
to the crime. Nor. in the various accounts of the case, was there
generally any reference to the fact that several of the boy's
relatives had previously been committed to mental institutions;
that the police hall, about one year prior to the offense (and
presumably before the youth's alleged use of marihuana) attempted
to commit him for his bizarre behavior; or that shortly after the
crime, the boy began to exhibit the symptoms of paranoid
schizophrenia.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Marihuana and Violent Crime <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>As indicated earlier, the belief that marihuana causes or
leads to the commission of violent or aggressive acts first
emerged during the 1930's and became deeply embedded in the
public mind. Until recently, however, these beliefs were
generally based on the anecdotal case examples of law enforcement
authorities, a few clinical observations and several
quasi-experimental studies of selected populations comprised of
military offenders, convicted or institutionalized criminals or
delinquents and small groups of college students. Few efforts
were made to compare the incidence of violent or aggressive
behavior in representative samples of both user and non-user
populations. </p>

<p>Even in these early observations and investigations, however,
no substantial evidence existed of a causal connection between
the use of marihuana and the commission of violent or aggressive
acts. Indeed, if any relationship was indicated, it was not a
positive and direct causal connection but in inverse or negative
statistical correlation. </p>

<p>Rather than inducing violent -or aggressive behavior through
its purported effects of lowering inhibitions, weakening impulse
control and heightening aggressive tendencies, marihuana was
usually found to inhibit the expression of aggressive impulses by
pacifying the user, interfering with muscular coordination,
reducing psychomotor activities and generally producing states of
drowsiness lethargy, timidity and passivity. </p>

<p>In fact, only a small proportion of the marihuana users among
any group of criminals or delinquents known to the authorities
and appearing in study samples had ever been arrested or
convicted for such violent crimes as murder, forcible rape,
aggravated assaultor armed robbery. When these marihuana-using
offenders were compared with offenders who did not use marihuana,
the former were generally found to 'have committed less
aggressive behavior than the latter. </p>

<p>In an effort to accumulate data on the relationship between
marihuana use and aggressive or violent criminal behavior, the
Commission sponsored several studies designed to assess the
purported causal relationship. </p>

<p>First, the Commission wanted to tap the unique experience of
the law enforcement and criminal justice communities.
Representative samples of prosecuting attorneys, judges,
probation officers and court clinicians were asked their opinions
about the relationship between marihuana use and the commission
of aggressive or violent criminal acts. When asked to evaluate
the statement that &quot;most aggressive acts or crimes of
violence committed by persons who are known users of marihuana
occur when the offender is under the influence of
marihuana,&quot; three-quarters of the judges, probation officers
and clinicians indicated either that the statement was probably
untrue or that they were unsure of its accuracy. Of these three
groups, a greater proportion of clinicians (76.5%) thought the
statement false than did the probation officers (60%)and judges
(44.2%). </p>

<p>In a separate mail survey of the chief prosecuting attorneys
in the 50 states-the group which has often supported the causal
hypothesis-52% of the respondents stated that they either did not
believe or were uncertain of the truth of the proposition that
use of marihuana leads to aggressive behavior. </p>

<p>We have already noted that only a small fraction of the
offender populations in past studies were found to have been
arrested for crimes of violence. Similarly, in a
Commission-sponsored study of 1,776 16to-21-year-olds arrested in
five New York counties for marihuana law violations between 1965
and 1969, onlv a small percentage bad either previously or
subsequently come to the attention of authorities for such
offenses as assault or robbery. In fact, less than 1% of the
offenders in this sample had been arrested for these offenses
prior to their first marihuana arrest, and less than 3% were
known to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for these offenses
subsequent to their marihuana violation. </p>

<p>Perhaps more important than professional opinion or the
incidence of violent offenses in an offender population, however,
is the determination of the extent to which marihuana use is
related to violent or aggressive behavior in the general
population. </p>

<p>In a Commission-sponsored survey, face-to-face interviews were
conducted with a representative sample of 559 West Philadelphia
residents in order to ascertain the extent of marihuana use in
this heterogeneous population and the relative involvement of
marihuana users and nonusers in violent criminal behavior. In
corroboration of the earlier findings, the researchers found no
significant differences in the proportions of users and
non-users; who stated that they had committed any of the
aggressive or violent crimes enumerated. </p>

<p>Further, no findings indicated that marihuana was generally or
frequently used immediately prior to the commission of offenses
in the very small number of instances in which these offense's
did occur. In contrast, however, the aggressive and violent
offenders in this sample did report with significantly greater
frequency the use of alcohol within 24 hours of the offense in
question. </p>

<p>These findings should be considered in fight of an earlier
West Coast study of disadvantaged minority-group youthful
marihuana users, many of whom were raised in a combative and
aggressive social milieu similar to that found in several of the
West Philadelphia sampled neighborhoods. The data show that
marihuana users were much less likely to commit aggressive or
violent acts than were those who preferred amphetamines or
alcohol. They also show that most marihuana users were able to
condition themselves to avoid aggressive behavior even in the
face of provocation. In fact, marihuana was found to play a
significant role in youth's transition from a &quot;rowdy&quot;
to a &quot;cool,&quot; non-violent style. </p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the claim that a few emotionally
unstable or impulsive individuals have become particularly
aggressive or impulsive under the influence of marihuana. As we
have noted, some newspaper accounts have attributed sensational
homicides or sexual assaults to marihuana-induced transitory
psychotic states on the part of the user. No evidence exists,
however, to indicate that marihuana was responsible for
generating or creating excessive aggressiveness or impulsivity in
individuals having no prior history of impulse or personality
disorder. The most that can be said is that in those rare
instances, marihuana may have aggravated a preexisting condition.
</p>

<p>In sum, the weight of the evidence is that marihuana does not
cause violent or aggressive behavior, if anything, marihuana
generally serves to inhibit the expression of such behavior.
Marihuana-induced relaxation of inhibitions is not ordinarily
accompanied by an exaggeration of aggressive tendencies. </p>

<p>No evidence exists that marihuana use will cause or lead to
the commission of violent or aggressive behavior by the large
majority of psychologically and socially mature individuals in
the general population.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Marihuana and Non-Violent Crime<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>A second hypothesis reflecting the statements of significant
numbers of government officials is that marihuana plays a major
role in the commission of other, essentially non-violent, forms
of criminal and delinquent behavior. </p>

<p>In general, those espousing this more general cause-effect
relationship assume that the drug frequently produces, in
addition to the lowering of inhibitions, impairment of judgment,
distortion of reality and at least temporary reduction of a sense
of personal and social responsibility. Indeed, the earlier
stereotype of the marihuana user was that of an immoral,
physically debilitated, psychologically unstable and criminally
marginal man whose state of severely and irreversibly
underdeveloped psychosocial and moral maturity was said to derive
directly from his continued use of marihuana. </p>

<p>As indicated earlier, neither the inherent complexities of the
issue nor the previously inconclusive empirical evidence has
deterred the formulation and expression of strong opinions about
the relationship of marihuana use to crime and delinquency.
Opinion in this area, quite apart from the empirical evidence,
has long assumed critical importance in the development of social
policy. </p>

<p>The Commission has addressed the issue in three different
ways. One was to assess the state of current public and
professional opinion relative to the general proposition that
marihuana causes or leads to the commission of criminal or
delinquent acts. A second approach was to review the professional
literature addressed to the issue, and a third was to initiate
empirical investigations of our own. </p>

<p>The opinion surveys found that substantial numbers of persons
raised serious questions about the existence of a causal
relationship between marihuana use and criminal or delinquent
behavior. Confusion and uncertainty about the existence of such a
relationship have been expressed by both youth and adults,
including practicing professionals in the criminal justice
system. </p>

<p>Recent data suggest that some of this confusion may be the
result of a fairly widespread misconception about the addiction
potential of marihuana. To the extent that persons believe
marihuana users are physically dependent on the -drug, they may
assume that, like the heroin user, the marihuana user commits his
offenses in order to support what is perceived as a drug habit;
and that, like the heroin model, offenses are committed more
often in the desperate attempt to obtain the drug rather than
under its influence following use. There is no evidence that this
is the case, even for those who use the drug heavily. </p>

<p>In the Commission-sponsored National Survey, the respondents
were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement
that &quot;many crimes are committed by persons who are under the
influence of marihuana.&quot; Fifty-six percent of the adult
population and 41% of the youth indicated agreement. As in the
Survey generally, there was a significant difference of opinion
according to age in the adult population. While 69% of the
over-50 age group agreed with this statement, only about
one-third of the 18-to-25 age group and the 14-to-17-yearolds
agreed. One of every four youth respondents and 18% of the adults
said they were &quot;not sure&quot; of the existence of such a
relationship between marihuana use and crime. </p>

<p>Much greater consensus exists, even between generations,
regarding the association of alcohol and crime. While 56% of all
adults expressed their belief that many crimes are committed by
persons under the influence of marihuana, 69% of these same
adults believed that alcohol was related in the same way. Only 7%
felt unsure about the alcohol crime relationship, in contrast to
18% who expressed uncertainty about the relationship between
crime and marihuana. </p>

<p>The Commission also surveyed opinion within the criminal
justice community. A sample of 781 judges, probation officers and
court clinicians replied to a questionnaire which asked
respondents to indicate whether or not their professional
experience led them to believe that &quot;use of marihuana causes
or leads to antisocial behavior in the sense that it leads one to
commit other criminal or delinquent acts.&quot; Of all
respondents, 27% believed this to be the case. Within each
professional group, 34% of the judges, 18% of the probation
officers and 2% of the clinicians indicated their agreement. </p>

<p>On the assumption that some, proportion, however small, of
marihuana users might ultimately be arrested for non-drug
offenses, these officials were also asked to assess the relative,
truth of the statement that &quot;most non-drug offenses
committed by persons who are known users of marihuana or are
found to have marihuana on their person or in their possession
occur when the offender is under the influence of
marihuana.&quot; Seventy-one percent of the responding judges,
75% of the probation officers and 85% of the court clinicians
either thought the statement false or were unsure of its
accuracy. </p>

<p>Respondents likewise rejected, however, the proposition that
these crimes perpetrated by marihuana users occur when the
offender is attempting to obtain the drug rather than while under
its influence; 65.6% of the judges, 64.6% of the probation
officers and 78.3% of the court clinicians either denied or were
unsure of the truth of this proposition. </p>

<p>In short, marihuana, is not generally viewed by participants
in the criminal justice community as a major contributing
influence in the commission of delinquent or criminal acts. </p>

<p>This increasing professional skepticism is buttressed by the
weight of research findings. A comprehensive review of the
literature revealed that in the various offender populations
studied for this purpose, only a small percentage were marihuana
users. In only a handful of cases did researchers report that
criminal conduct followed the use of marihuana. Generally, the
rate of self -reported, non-drug crime did not significantly
differ between users and non-users. </p>

<p>Both of the Commission-sponsored studies (the New York and
Philadelphia studies referred to earlier) corroborated this
research consensus. In the Philadelphia study, for example, less
than 10% of the sample were known to the police, and there were
no significant differences among marihuana users and non-users in
the sample who reported the commission of major criminal acts
when statistical controls were applied. Further, most of the
first offenses committed by users occurred prior to their use of
marihuana, and only in rare instances did the offenses
immediately follow (within 24 hours) upon the use of marihuana
(five cases out of 741 first offenses and 19 cases out of 516
most recent offenses). </p>

<p>Likewise, the New York study revealed that about one-fifth of
-the marihuana law violators arrested between 1965 and 1969 were
found to have previous arrest records. Of those with previous
arrests, the great majority of offenses (86%) involved traffic
violations and minor violations of the vagrancy statutes. In but
10% of the cases the previous arrests were for assault, robbery,
burglary or larceny. </p>

<p>In essence, neither informed current professional opinion nor
empirical research, ranging from the 1930's to the present, has
produced systematic evidence to support the thesis that marihuana
use, by itself, either invariably or generally leads to or causes
crime, including acts of violence,, juvenile delinquency or
aggressive behavior. Instead the evidence suggests that
sociolegal and cultural variable's account for the apparent
statistical correlation between marihuana use and crime or
delinquency.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>A Sociocultural Explanation <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The persistent belief that some relationship exists between
marihuana use and crime is not without statistical support.
Undoubtedly, the marihuana user of the 1920's and 1930's was
overrepresented in the nation's jails and penitentiaries and in
the general crime and delinquency statistics. Especially during
the late 1920's and early 1930's when the nation was preoccupied
with lawlessness, the translation of this statistical correlation
into a causal hypothesis is not surprising. </p>

<p>The increasing incidence of use in the mid-sixties by white,
affluent, middle class, high school youth, college students and
adults has occasioned a reevaluation of the marihuana user and a
reexamination of the crime issue. The overwhelming majority of
the new marihuana offenders have had no previous arrests, and
come from the normally low risk, middle and upper socioeconomic
population groups. </p>

<p>Recent public opinion surveys suggest that considerable social
disapproval is attached to the &quot;hippie&quot; life style,
unconventional mode of dress and apparent disregard for the law
displayed by many of these individuals. Nonetheless, fewer
persons are now willing to classify as criminal those marihuana
users whose only contact with the law has been as a result of
their marihuana use. Perceptions have undergone a change as a
result of the increased usage of marihuana among youth of the
dominant social class. Nonetheless, a statistical association
remains. </p>

<p>First, the majority of both marihuana users and offenders
other than actual marihuana law violators fall into the
14-to-25-year age group. Second, the majority of those arrested
for marihuana law violations as well as other delinquent or
criminal acts were, and to a much lesser degree, still are, drawn
from the same &quot;high risk&quot; populations, such as minority
groups, socially and economically disadvantaged, young, male,
inner-city residents. </p>

<p>Third, various offender populations subjected to study often
included a number of marihuana users, although it was not the
marihuana violations per se but other, more serious criminal
conduct that originally brought most of them to the attention of
the authorities. Finally, during the past five years, marihuana
law violators have increasingly swelled the crime and delinquency
statistics; in most cases, their only contact with the law has
been for these marihuanaspecific offenses. </p>

<p>The Philadelphia study corroborated this continuing
statistical association. The simple relationship between using
marihuana and committing offenses was positive and statistically
significant, and there was also a high correlation between
frequency of smoking marihuana and committing offenses. These
direct associations were reduced to insignificance, however, upon
further analysis of the data, and other explanations for the
coincidence of marihuana use and crime became evident. These
included: race, education, age, the use of other drugs, and
having drug-using friends. </p>

<p>We conclude that some users commit crimes more frequently than
non-users not because they use marihuana but because they happen
to be the kinds of people who would be expected to have a higher
crime rate, wholly apart from the use of marihuana. In most
cases, the differences in crime rate between users and non-users
are dependent not on marihuana use per se but on these other
factors. </p>

<p>In summary, although the available evidence suggests that
marihuana use may be statistically correlated with the incidence
of crime and delinquency, when examined in isolation from the
other variables, no valid evidence was found to support the
thesis that marihuana' by itself, either inevitably, generally or
even frequently causes or precipitates the commission of crime,
including acts of violence, or juvenile delinquency. <br>
</p>

<p>Within this framework, neither the marihuana user nor the drug
itself can be said to constitute a danger to public safety. For,
as two researchers have so cogently stated for the Commission,
&quot;Whatever an individual is, in all of his cultural, social
and psychological complexity, is not going to vanish in a puff of
marihuana smoke.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>MARIHUANA AND DRIVING <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Within the context of public safety another issue which merits
attention is the extent to which drivers under the influence of
marihuana constitute a hazard on the nation's streets and
highways. Although in recent years increasing attention has been
given to this issue, at present little empirical evidence exists
to inform discussion. </p>

<p>To assess the actual and potential impact of marihuana on
traffic safety, a number of basic research questions must be
answered. </p>

<p>the extent to which marihuana, users actually drive while
under the influence of the drug </p>

<p>the extent to which marihuana users driving while
&quot;high&quot; commit traffic violations and are involved in
traffic accidents </p>

<p>the amounts of marihuana consumed immediately prior to the
commission of traffic violations or the involvement in traffic
accidents and the drug's role in these events </p>

<p>the nature and extent to which marihuana actually impairs
psychomotor skills, judgment and driving performance<br>
</p>

<p>To date, the generalizations made concerning the effects of
marihuana on driving behavior have generally been based on
statistical studies of traffic violations and accidents and
inferences drawn from more general studies of the physiological
and psychological consequences of marihuana use, such as changes
in pulse rate, reaction time, neuromuscular coordination, time
estimation and spatial perceptions. </p>

<p>Such studies pose serious limitations in the nature,
reliability and validity of the data. The basic problems derive
from difficulties in identifying and attributing cause. A major
obstacle in such retrospective analysis is the inability to
separate the effects of marihuana from those possibly engendered
by the use of other drugs, such as alcohol, tranquilizers and
amphetamines. Finally, conclusive analysis is impossible until a
reliable technique is developed for measuring the level of
marihuana present in the body of the driver at the time of his
violation or accident. </p>

<p>Prospective experimental studies of actual reactions to road
conditions and traffic emergency situations would undoubtedly
provide the most reliable and valid data, but such studies would
themselves endanger the public and have not been undertaken.
Researchers have relied, therefore, on controlled laboratory
simulator studies and direct interviews with those who have
admitted to driving while under the influence of marihuana.<br>
</p>

<p>With respect to the simulator studies , the available evidence
suggests that while, in some cases, marihuana has produced
interference with certain motor or mental abilities which affect
driving behavior, these effects were generally believed to be
readily overcome by the exercise of extreme caution by the driver
and a significant reduction in speed. </p>

<p>The few driving simulator tests completed to date have
generally revealed no significant correlations between marihuana
use and driving disabilities. Comparison of the simulator scores
of users and nonusers, however, did reveal small but
nonsignificant differences in the number of speedometer errors
made. </p>

<p>These simulator studies also examined the comparative effects
of alcohol and marihuana on driving scores. The findings of one
study, though controversial, suggested that intoxication
resulting from low doses of marihuana was less detrimental to
driving performance than was the presence of alcohol at the
legally prohibited blood level of .10%. </p>

<p>The methodological limitations of the study raise serious
questions about the reliability and validity of the findings. As
one critic has noted, &quot;It does not follow automatically that
lack of effect of a drug on the simulated task will correlate
with lack of effect on the actual task.&quot; Further , the use
of dissimilar doses of alcohol and marihuana has led another
critic to assert that &quot;finding that a heavy dose of alcohol
caused more impairment than a mild dose of marihuana is neither
surprising nor helpful in assessing the relative effects of the
two drugs in the relative doses in which they are normally
used.&quot; </p>

<p>Recent research has not yet proven that marihuana use
significantly impairs driving ability or performance. The
Commission believes, nonetheless, that driving while under the
influence of any psychoactive drug is a serious risk to public
safety; the acute effects of marihuana intoxication, spatial and
time distortion and slowed reflexes may impair driving
performance. That the risk of injury may be greater for alcohol
than for marihuana matters little. </p>

<p>Obviously, Much more research needs to be undertaken in this
area. Hopefully, recent studies sponsored by the National
Institute of Mental Health and other agencies will soon provide
the concrete information that is needed.<br>
</p>

<p>Marihuana, Public Health and Welfare<br>
</p>

<p>As the feared threat to public safety through violent crime
has diminished in recent years, policy-makers and the public have
begun increasingly to view marihuana and other illicit drug use
as a public health concern. The National Survey indicates that
American adults regard drug abuse as the third most pressing
problem of the day, closely following the economy and Vietnam.
However, public attitudes reflect considerable confusion about
the facts concerning marihuana and drugs in general. </p>

<p>This confusion has resulted from too little understanding of
the motives for drug use as well as inadequate knowledge of the
classification of drugs according to their main effects. Legal
penalties have frequently mirrored this confusion, and the
resulting inconsistencies cause, many young people to lose
confidence in adult authority. Even in the medical profession,
much uncertainty is evident, and for most of the general public
there is no clear authority to whom they can turn for guidance.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH <br>
</font></p>

<p>The Commission broadly defines public health concerns as all
health problems which affect people en masse and are thereby
difficult to treat on a traditional physician-to-patient basis.
This category would include social and economic dependence and
incapacity. A health problem which spreads to other susceptible
members of the society cannot be controlled by the individual
physician. This view coincides with the concept of preventive
medicine, recognizing that all public health problems must be
dealt with on both an individual and societal level. </p>

<p>To illustrate, the increasing incidence of deaths due to lung
cancer subsequent to chronic, heavy tobacco usage is a major
public health concern. In this instance, prevention of smoking
and ascertaining the cause of the malignancies, rather than the
individual treatment of each case by a physician, define the
public health dimension. A major concern exists because the
population at risk is large and growing, and the risk of harm is
great. </p>

<p>In addition to the risk of large numbers of the populace being
affected, the issue of contagion must also be examined. Unlike
infectious diseases such as influenza and smallpox, where the
person affected &quot; catches&quot; the ailment unintentionally,
those individuals who use marihuana choose to come into contact
with it. The contagion model is relevant only insofar as social
pressure from proselytizing friends and social contacts play a
role in spreading the use of the, drug. This dimension exists
with marihuana, as well as alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p>After assessing the potential harm to the individual and
society, the size of the population at risk and the contagion
aspect, society must determine the nature of the control
mechanism used to deal with the problem, and how nine]) of its
health resources, manpower and facilities will be allocated to
meet the perceived threat to the public health. Therefore, an
analysis of the relative risk of marihuana use must be
undertaken. We must examine not only the effects of the drug on
the individual but also determine which groups are at risk and
why.<br>
</p>

<p>Practically all substances consumed by man are potentially
dangerous to the physical or mental health of the individual if
used irresponsibly or by particularly sensitive persons. Certain
substances are sufficiently complex in their effects that
societal control is necessary to reduce risk, for example,
fluorides added to the water supply, prescription drugs, and food
additives. The degree of concern and control varies, depending on
relative public health dangers. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Population At Risk <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Before the dangers can be assessed, the population at risk
must be defined. Viewing the public health picture on a large
scale, the United States in 1972 may still be considered
fortunate with regard to marihuana usage. While it is the third
most popular recreational drug, behind alcohol and tobacco, it
has not been institutionalized and commercialized. </p>

<p>Most of the Americans who have used marihuana have been merely
experimenting with it. As noted in Chapter 1, there are 24
million Americans who have tried marihuana at one time or
another, with 8.3 million still using it. Of those who have quit,
most say they have simply lost interest in it. The same Survey
shows that experience with marihuana peaks in the
18-to-25-year-old group and falls off sharply thereafter. A fact
of some significance is that at least 71% of all adults (18-years
and older) and 80% of youth (12-to-17-years) have never used
marihuana at all.* </p>

<p>The Survey also indicates that the majority of those youth and
adults who continue to use marihuana do so intermittently, that
is, between one and 10 times a month. These individuals are
classified as intermittent marihuana smokers who use the drug for
its socializing effects. They are, for the most part, ordinary
Americans who are either in school or are employed. </p>

<p>About 2% of those who have ever used marihuana, or 500,000
people, now use the drug heavily. They use the drug several times
a day. These individuals use marihuana for its personal drug
effects in addition to its socializing effects. Generally, their
life styles, values, attitudes, behaviors and activities are
unconventional. Marihuana plays an important role in their lives.
Because the risk of psychological, and perhaps physical, harm
from marihuana increases with the frequency quantity and duration
of its use, these heavy marihuana users constitute the greatest
at-risk population in the United States today. </p>

<p>The heavy marihuana user presents the greatest potential
concern to the, public health. It is the Commission's opinion
that these heavy marihuana users constitute a source of contagion
within American society. They actively proselytize others into a
drug-oriented way of life. The effectiveness of peer group
pressure has been described earlier in Chapter II </p>

<p>We anticipate that this at-risk population would increase in
number should a policy of institutionalized availability be
adopted toward marihuana. Although marihuana is readily available
illicitly in the United States today, a policy permitting its
legal distribution could be expected to bring about an increase
in users, with some percentage of them becoming heavy users. It
is the availability of the drug, coupled -with a governmental
policy of approval or neutrality, that could escalate this group
into a public health and welfare concern. While this is
speculative, it is a concern which cannot be dismissed. The
experience with the rise in the use of tobacco and alcohol makes
clear the probable consequences of commercial exploitation. </p>

<p>Another concern of the Commission is the experience of other
countries which have large heavy user populations. While the
pattern of behavior in one country is not automatically similar
to a pattern of behavior in another country, the existence of
heavy user populations constitutes a serious public health
concern which must be avoided in this country. The availability
of the drug alone does not seem to determine increased usage;
supply and governmental inaction appear to tip the balance toward
increased use. The proportion of our population susceptible to
this pattern of use is conjectural but good preventive public
health requires limiting the number to an irreducible minimum. <br>
</p>

<p>*In the self-administered instrument, several separate
questions were utilized to elicit the respondent's experience
with marihuana. This technique permitted an analysis of
consistency of responses, and also minimized the possibility of
nonresponse. Nevertheless, 14% of the adults and 6% of the youth
did not respond to enough of these questions to ascertain whether
they had ever tried marihuana or not. <br>
</p>

<p>Percentage who- Adult Youth </p>

<p>Ever used ------------------------------------- 15 14 </p>

</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Confusion and Fact <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>One of the primary sources of confusion surrounding the use of
marihuana and other psychoactive drugs is the ambiguity of the
term &quot;drug abuse.&quot; In many quarters the excessive use
of any drug is considered drug abuse, regardless of the effect of
the drug on the individual or his behavior. In order to clarify
this issue the Commission defines psychoactive drug abuse as
follows: <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Drug abuse is the use of psychoactive drugs
in a way likely to induce mental dysfunction and disordered
behavior. <br>
</i></font></p>

<p>It should be emphasized that demonstrable pathology of organ
systems, including the brain, is not a necessary characteristic
of psychoactive drug abuse. There are numerous non-psychoactive
drugs which can induce extensive organ pathology but do not
modify behavior; such drugs leave their imprint primarily on the
individual, not on society. The Commission believes that many of
the perplexing issues relating to psychoactive drugs, including
marihuana, can be clarified if drug abuse refers only to the
impact of drug-induced behavior on society. </p>

<p>Three types of such drug-induced behavior are considered
unacceptable in most organized societies: (1) aggressiveness
leading to violence; (2) loss of psychomotor control; (3) mental
or physical disorder leading to social and economic incapacity or
dependency. </p>

<p>This is not to say that society is unconcerned about the
harmful effects of psychoactive drugs on the individual, or that
such effects do not merit the attention of public health
officials. Cigarette smoking, although affecting primarily the
individual, is surely a matter of public health concern. We
believe, however, that the term drug abuse, with its attendant
societal disapprobation, should be reserved for drug taking which
has a more direct effect on society through disordered behavior. </p>

<p>Beyond the confusion surrounding the term drug abuse, a
rational evaluation of the public health impact of marihuana use
is also inhibited by extensive misinformation about the drug.
Recently, a great deal of research has increased significantly
our knowledge about marihuana. Further research data are
necessary before ;a conclusive statement about marihuana and
public health can be made. However, enough is known today to
discuss some of the public perceptions in detail. And sufficient
data are presently available to allow for rational
decision-making.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>ASSESSMENT OF PERCEIVED RISKS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The Commission believes that marihuana. is perceived by the
American public to present the following risks to the public
health:<br>
</p>

<p>lethality </p>

<p>potential for genetic damage or teratogenicity </p>

<p>immediate adverse physical or mental effects </p>

<p>long-term physical or mental effects including psychosis and
&quot;amotivation&quot; syndrome </p>

<p>&quot;addiction&quot; potential </p>

<p>* progression to other stronger drugs, especially heroin<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Lethality<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The Commission's National Survey revealed that 48% of adults
believe that some people have died from marihuana use. A careful
search of the literature and testimony of the nation's health
officials has not revealed a single human fatality in the United
States proven to have resulted solely from ingestion of
marihuana. Experiments with the drug in monkeys demonstrated that
the dose required for overdose death was enormous and for all
practical purposes unachievable by humans smoking marihuana. This
is in marked contrast to other substances in common use, most
notably alcohol and barbiturate sleeping pills. </p>

<p>Of comparative note, 89% of all adults in the same Survey
believe that some people have died from using alcohol. This
indicates that public opinion regarding alcohol and its potential
lethality is more accurate than it is for marihuana. At the same
time, factual knowledge regarding the inherent danger in using a
substance, for example alcohol, seemingly does not deter many
persons from using it irresponsibly.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Potential For Genetic Damage <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The thalidomide tragedies of the 1950's have taught us to
ponder carefully the possibility of genetic damage subsequent to
any drug use. The much publicized controversy regarding LSD and
subsequent genetic damage has led investigators to study
marihuana and its possible genetic effects. Although a number of
studies have been performed, at present no reliable evidence
exists indicating that marihuana causes genetic defects in man. </p>

<p>Early findings from studies of chronic (up to 41 years), heavy
(several ounces per day) cannabis users in Greece and Jamaica
also failed to find such evidence. In all its studies, the
Commission found no evidence of chromosome damage or teratogenic
or mutagenic effects due to cannabis at doses commonly used by
man. However, since fetal damage cannot be ruled out, the use of
marihuana like that of many other drugs, is not advisable during
pregnancy.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Immediate Effects<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The intoxicant effects of marihuana on the mental function of
the user does have potential health significance both for the
individual and others with whom he may come in contact. Because
marihuana is a psychoactive drug, it is important to examine the
acute toxic effects which may occur in certain predisposed
individuals and which increase with the potency of the
preparation. </p>

<p>The Commission has reviewed numerous clinical studies
describing acute panic reactions and transient psychotic-like
episodes which occur as acute effects of the drug intoxication.
In addition, a predisposed individual might experience
aggravation of a latent psychotic state or other underlying
instability. Although severe abnormal psychological states are
rare when compared to the total number of marihuana users, lesser
problems are not rare, and they may endanger both the individual
and those around him at the time of their occurrence. The
individual contemplating use is not capable of predicting whether
he is predisposed by his particular circumstances to an
undesirable mental reaction. The undesirable consequences
occurring while an individual is involved in complex tasks such
as driving or operating machinery or tasks requiring fine
psychomotor precision and judgment are all too imaginable. </p>

<p>From a public health point of view, the immediate effects of
marihuana intoxication on the individual's organs or bodily
functions are of little significance. By and large these effects,
which have been carefully outlined in Chapter 11 of the Report,
are transient and have little or no permanent effect upon the
individual.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Effects Of Long-Term, Heavy Use<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>To determine the long-term chronic effects of heavy marihuana
use, the Commission has carefully reviewed the world literature
and contemporary studies of heavy, chronic (up to 41 years)
cannabis users in the world. In addition, lower socioeconomic
populations in Afghanistan, Greece, and Jamaica have been
examined.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b><i>Effects On The Body <br>
</i></b></font></p>

<p>These recent studies in Greece and Jamaica report minimal
physical abnormalities in the cannabis users as compared with
their non-using peers. </p>

<p>Minimal abnormalities in pulmonary function have been observed
in some cases of heavy and very heavy smokers of potent marihuana
preparations (ganja or hashish). However, one study concluded the
cause was smoking in general no matter what the substance. The
other study could not express any conclusion because of the
absence of a control population. Such decrements in normal
pulmonary capacity may represent early warning signals in the
development of chronic lung disease. They must be considered in
any program of early prevention of disease and future disability.
</p>

<p>No objective evidence of specific pathology of brain tissue
has been documented. This fact contrasts sharply with the
well-established brain damage of chronic alcoholism.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b><i>Effects On The Mind <br>
</i></b></font></p>

<p>No outstanding abnormalities in psychological tests,
psychiatric interviews or coping patterns have been conclusively
documented in studies of cannabis users in other countries of the
world. Further research in this important area is necessary
before definite conclusions can be drawn relating or linking
marihuana to mental dysfunction because available psychological
tests do not measure certain higher mental functions very
accurately.<br>
</p>

<p>Cannabis use has long been known to precipitate short-term
phychotic-like episodes in predisposed individuals or those who
take excessive doses. Some observers report that the prevalence
of shortterm psychoses as well as the psychotic episodes of
longer duration in heavy cannabis users are compatible with the
prevalence rate of psychosis in the general population and,
therefore, may not be attributable to cannabis use. In fact, some
believe that in populations under stress where marihuana is
widely used, occurrence of the acute psychotic-like episodes
occur less often than one would expect in such a population.
Other researchers have disagreed with these conclusions, and the
matter is still controversial. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b><i>Effects On Motivation <br>
</i></b></font></p>

<p>The Commission is deeply concerned about another group of
behavioral effects that have been described in other nations as
being associated with the heavy, long-term use of cannabis. This
behavioral condition has been termed the &quot;amotivational
syndrome.&quot; An extreme form has been reported in populations
of lower socioeconomic males in several developing nations. These
reports describe lethargy, instability, social deterioration, a
loss of interest in virtually all activities other than drug use.
This state of social and economic disability also results in
precipitation and aggravation of psychiatric disorders (overt
psychotic behavior) and possible somatic complications among very
heavy, very long-term users of high potency cannabis products.
However, in the populations so far observed in Jamaica, Greece,
and Afghanistan, physical and psychosocial deterioration was not
reported. The life styles of these populations appeared to be
conditioned by cultural and socioeconomic factors. Some
researchers believe cannabis' may serve to keep these individuals
stratified at this lower socioeconomic level. </p>

<p>The occurrence of a similar, though less intense, syndrome has
been identified recently with heavy marihuana use among young
persons in the Western world, including the United States. Some
clinicians have described the existence of a complex of subtle
social, psychological and behavioral changes related to a loss of
volitional goal direction in certain individuals, including some
long-term heavy users of marihuana. Such persons appear to orient
only to the present. They appear, alienated from generally
accepted social and occupational activities, and they tend to
show a reduced concern for personal hygiene and nutrition. </p>

<p>Some clinicians believe that this picture is directly caused
by the action of marihuana. However , other behavioral scientists
believe that among impressionable adolescents, marihuana-induced
suggestibility may facilitate the rapid adoption of new values
and behavior patterns, particularly when the drug is taken in a
socially alienated subculture that advocates and strongly
reinforces such changes. </p>

<p>Whichever interpretation one accepts, the fact is apparent
that the chronic, heavy use of marihuana may jeopardize social
and economic adjustments of the adolescents We believe this is
one concern which merits further research and evaluation. On the
basis of past studies, the chronic, heavy use of marihuana, seems
to constitute a high-risk behavior, particularly among
predisposed adolescents. This consideration is especially
critical when we consider the adolescent who is in the throes of
a normally turbulent emotional process. The Commission has
reviewed numerous reported studies and heard the testimony of
several clinicians dealing with heavy users of marihuana who
exhibit this particular behavior pattern. Although the United
States does not, at the present time, have a large number of such
persons within its population, the incidence is too frequent to
ignore. Expanded epidemiologic studies are imperative to obtain a
better understanding of this complex behavior.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Addiction Potential<br>
</font></p>

<p>Unfortunately, fact and fancy have become irrationally mixed
regarding marihuana's physiological and psychological properties.
Marihuana clearly is not in the same chemical category as heroin
insofar as its physiologic and psychological effects are
concerned. In a word, cannabis does not lead to physical
dependence. No torturous withdrawal syndrome follows the sudden
cessation of chronic, heavy use of marihuana. Although evidence
indicates that heavy, long-term cannabis users may develop
psychological dependence, even then the level of psychological
dependence is no different from the syndrome of anxiety and
restlessness seen when an American stops smoking tobacco
cigarettes.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Progression To Other Drugs<br>
</font></p>

<p>As noted in Chapter 11, to say marihuana leads to any other
drug avoids the real issue and reduces a complex set of variables
to an oversimplified premise of cause and effect. If any one
statement can characterize why persons in the United States
escalate their drug use patterns and become polydrug users, it is
peer pressure. Indeed, if any drug is associated with the use of
other drugs, including marihuana, it is tobacco, followed closely
by alcohol. Study after study which the Commission reviewed
invariably reported an association between the use of tobacco,
and, to a lesser extent, of alcohol with the use of marihuana and
other drugs. </p>

<p>The fact should be emphasized that the overwhelming majority
of marihuana users do not progress to other drugs. They either
remain with marihuana or foresake its use in favor of alcohol. In
addition, the largest number of marihuana users in the United
States today are experimenters or intermittent users, and 2% of
those who have ever used it are presently heavy users. Only
moderate and heavy use of marihuana is significantly associated
with persistent use of other drugs. </p>

<p>Some persons in our society are interested in experimenting
with a series of drugs, and there is no uniformity regarding
which drug these multidrug users take first. In some cases, the
drug used is a matter of preference; in others, a matter of
availability; and in further instances, it matter of group
choice. </p>

<p>Citizens concerned with health issues must consider the
possibility of marihuana use leading to use of heroin, other
opiates, cocaine or hallucinogens. This so-called stepping-stone
theory first received widespread acceptance in 1951 as a result
of testimony at Congressional hearings. At that time, studies of
various addict populations repeatedly described most heroin users
as marihuana users also. The implication of these descriptions
was that a causal relationship existed between marihuana and
subsequent heroin use. When the voluminous testimony given at
these hearings is seriously examined, no verification is found of
a causal relationship between marihuana use and subsequent heroin
use. </p>

<p>Again, we must avoid polarity on this issue. To assume that
marihuana use is unrelated to the use of other drugs would be
inaccurate. As mentioned earlier, the heavy or very heavy
marihuana users are frequently users of other drugs. The
stepping-stone theory holds that the adolescent begins the use of
illicit drugs with marihuana, and later proceeds to heroin in the
search for greater thrills. The opposing viewpoint holds that the
large majority of marihuana users never become heroin addicts and
denies the validity of a causal relationship. </p>

<p>In the National Survey, among the adult respondents, 70%
thought that marihuana makes people want to try stronger drugs
such as heroin; 56% of the youth in the 12-to-17-year-old
category agreed with the same statement. These perceptions
contrast with another finding in the same Survey which revealed
that 4% of current marihuana users have tried heroin. On the
other hand, very few respondents perceived alcohol and tobacco to
be precipitants of other drug use. </p>

<p>Studies of the escalation process demonstrate that the rates
of progression vary from one group to another and from one
segment of the population to another. There is no set proportion
of marihuana users who &quot;escalate&quot; to the use of other
drugs. The other drugs which some marihuana smokers use vary
according to the social characteristics of the population in
question. Within some groups, heroin may be the choice; in other
groups, it may be LSD. </p>

<p>Marihuana use per se does not dictate whether other drugs will
be used; nor does it determine the rate of progression, if and
when it, occurs, or which drugs might be used. As discussed in
Chapter 11, the user's social group seems to have the strongest
influence on whether other drugs will be used; and if so, which
drugs will be used.<br>
</p>

<p>PREVENTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS <br>
</p>

<p>The hallmark of a good health care delivery system is
preventing as much illness as possible. This objective is
achieved by means of immunizations, regular routine checkups, and
educational programs. </p>

<p>Education programs regarding marihuana have been notably
ineffective, partly due to an exaggeration of the effects of
using the drug and partly because the effects of the opiates and
marihuana have been compared inaccurately. As a result, many
persons have developed a conscious or unconscious denial of
nearly all dangers associated with marihuana use. Some educators
believe that drug programs merely sharpen the curiosity of
children and tempt them to use drugs which they otherwise would
not use. Others believe that the responsibility should not be
lodged with the schools but rather with the home or the
community. </p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty about the efficacy of these,
programs, education programs dealing with drug usage simply do
not exist in the school systems of a number of major cities; in
others, token programs are offered in response to the demand that
something be done. Health educators have the responsibility to
help this vulnerable group of Americans become aware of all
options so that they are able to make enlightened choices. </p>

<p>The educational role of physicians and other clinical health
personnel should not be underestimated. The National Survey shows
that the public believes young people should receive information
concerning marihuana first from schools and second from family
physicians. The health professional has a unique position as both
teacher and confidant to an individual struggling with a
&quot;drug abuse&quot; problem. Honest, sincere, and confidential
guidance from a physician may prevent later difficulties to both
the individual and the society. The Commission believes that
action must be taken to inform and support the physician in his
role as confidant and counsellor to those seeking assistance. </p>

<p>Considering the current patterns of marihuana use in the
United States, the need for treatment and/or rehabilitation does
not appear necessary for the vast majority of persons who are
experimenting with the drug or using it intermittently. Rather,
these persons need to be realistically educated regarding the
potential hazards they face. To this end, a comparison of the
personal and public health risks of marihuana and those of
heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, and other drugs would be useful. <br>
</p>

<p>A concern for public health also requires thoughtful
consideration of the consequences of any change in public policy.
We have objectively appraised the present scope of public health
concerns concluding that the most serious risk lies with the
population of heavy users, which is, at this time, quite small in
this country. </p>

<p>Now, we must soberly consider the likely effect of adoption of
a social policy of neutrality or approval toward marihuana use.
Any legal policy which institutionalizes availability of the drug
carries with it a likely increase in the at-risk population. This
factor is not necessarily conclusive in itself , but it does
weigh heavily for the policymaker. Even though the proportion of
heavy users in the total using population might not increase if
such a social or legal policy were adopted, the absolute number
of heavy users would probably increase. Thus, we would have an
increase in the at-risk segment of the populace. A greater stress
would thereby be placed on the general health care delivery
system in all the areas of health concern described earlier. </p>

<p>Regardless of emerging social policy, greater emphasis must be
placed on educating our youth regarding the prospective dangers
inherent in expanded marihuana use. This anticipatory guidance
can serve to defuse or at least forestall a potentially serious
social phenomenon.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Summary<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>From what is now known about the effects of marihuana, its use
at the present level does not constitute a major threat to public
health. However, this statement should not lead to complacency.
Marihuana is not an innocuous drug. The clinical findings of
impaired psychological function, carefully documented by medical
specialists, legitimately arouse concern. These studies identify
marihuana-related problems which must be taken into account in
the development of public policy. Unfortunately, these
marihuana-related problems, which occur only in heavy, long-term
users, have been over generalized and overdramatized. </p>

<p>Two percent of those Americans who have ever used marihuana
are now heavy users and constitute the highest risk group. Strong
evidence indicates that certain emotional changes have taken
place among predisposed individuals as a result of prolonged,
heavy marihuana use. The clinical reports in the literature
describing transient psychoses, other psychiatric difficulties,
and impairment of cognitive function subsequent to use of
marihuana and of other drugs do not prove causality but cannot be
ignored. </p>

<p>The causes of these emotional difficulties are much too
complex to justify general conclusions by the public or the
press. The mass media have frequently promoted such clinical
reports to appear as far reaching events affecting the entire
population. The clinician sees only the troubled Population of
any group. In evaluating a public health concern, the essential
element is the proportion of affected persons in the general
group. The people responsible for evaluating public health
problems must concern themselves with the proportion of people
out of the total population who are affected by any specific
condition. The highest risk groups should be identified as the
source of primary concern. A recognition that a majority of
marihuana users are not now a matter of public health concern
must be made so that public health Officials may concentrate
their attention where it will have maximum impact. </p>

<p>The concept of relative risk is crucial to an evaluation of
the impact of marihuana on public health. We believe that
experimental or intermittent use of this drug carries minimal
risk to the public health, and should not be given overzealous
attention in terms of a public health response. We are concerned
that social influences might cause those who would not otherwise
use the drug to be exposed to this minimal risk and the potential
escalation of drug-using patterns. For this group, we must
deglorify, demythologize, and deemphasize the use of marihuana
and other drugs. </p>

<p>The Commission reemphasizes its concern about the small
minority of heavy, long-term marihuana users who are exposed to a
much greater relative risk of impaired general functioning in
contemporary America. Public health officials should concentrate
their efforts on this group. Fortunately, the group has to date
not grown sufficently in size to warrant its being considered a
major public health concern. </p>

<p>We retiterate, too, the public health implications of an
increase in the at-risk population. We suspect that such an
increase is most likely if a sudden shift in social policy
significantly increased availability of the drug. One of the
factors we consider in Chapter V when evaluating the various
social policy options and legal implementations is the effect of
each policy on incidence and patterns of use. Regardless of how
heavy this particular variable will weigh in that process, we
must state that a significant increase in the at-risk population
could convert what is now a minor public health concern in this
country to one of major proportions.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Marihuana And The Dominant Social Order<br>
</b></p>

<p>For more than 30 years it has been widely assumed that the
marihuana user constitutes a threat to the well-being of the
community and the nation. Originally, the users were considered
to be &quot;outsiders&quot; or marginal citizens. Included were
such people as hustlers, prostitutes, itinerant workers, merchant
seamen, miners and ranchhands, water-front day laborers and
drifters, many of whom were drawn from the lower socioeconomic
segments of the population. </p>

<p>Concerns about marihuana use expressed in the 1930's related
primarily to a perceived inconsistency between the life styles
and values of these individuals and the social and moral order.
Their potential influence on the young was especially worrisome.
When marihuana was first prohibited, a recurrent fear was that
use might spread among the youth. And in the late 1930's and
1940's, the attraction of young people to jazz music was thought
to be in part related to marihuana use by this
&quot;outsider&quot; population. </p>

<p>Throughout this early period, American society, in reaction to
its fear of the unfamiliar, translated rumor about the
criminality and immorality of the marihuana user into
&quot;unquestioned fact&quot; which, in turn, was translated into
social policy. </p>

<p>From the mid-thirties to the present, however, social
perceptions have undergone significant change in response to the
emergence of new and challenging social problems. As marihuana,
use has spread to include the affluent, middle class, white high
school and college-age youth as well as minority group members of
lower socioeconomic circumstances in urban core areas, the
concept of marginality has become blurred. </p>

<p>Also, as the use of marihuana has increased, those individuals
formerly labeled as marginal and threatening have been replaced
by a more middle class, white, educated and younger population of
marihuana smokers. A stereotyped user no longer exists, and
therefore, the question now properly focuses on who poses a
threat to the dominant order.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Adult Marihuana User <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Despite the fact that substantial numbers of adults use
marihuana, society does not appear to feel greatly threatened by
this group, probably because included in the group are a
considerable number of middle class individuals who are regularly
employed and whose occupational and social status appear to be
similar to those of peers and colleagues who do not use
marihuana. </p>

<p>In the course of its fact-finding effort, the Commission has
met with several groups of socially and economically
&quot;successful&quot; marihuana users in the professions of law,
medicine, banking, education and business. In most cases, these
persons, in their external appearances, seemed to be mature and
responsible adults whose social attitudes and behavior did not
mark them as radical ideologues or essentially irresponsible
individuals. </p>

<p>For the most part, use of marihuana by adults has been found
to be more directly related to the facilitation of social
interaction (much like the adult use of alcohol in social
gatherings) than to any other factor. Although their marihuana
smoking behavior is illegal, most adult users are not ordinarily
considered by their peers to be criminal nor is their use
generally likely to result in arrest. </p>

<p>Because the adult user generally maintains low visibility, is
primarily a recreational user, is not usually involved in radical
political activity and maintains a life style largely
indistinguishable from his non-using neighbors, he is not
ordinarily viewed as a threat to the dominant social order. In
short, aside from his use of marihuana, the adult recreational
user is not generally viewed as a significant social problem.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Young Marihuana User <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The widespread use of marihuana by millions of young people of
college and high school age has been viewed by many as a direct
threat to the stability and future of the social order. </p>

<p>Many parents, adults in general, and government officials have
expressed concern that young people who use marihuana often
reject the essential values and traditions upon which the society
is founded. Some have suggested that youthful marihuana use is,
in itself, an indication of the rejection of responsibility and a
sign of reckless hedonism which may well interfere with an
orderly maturation process. Others see youthful marihuana use as
part of a pattern of conduct which produces dropping out,
underachievement and dependency. </p>

<p>In short, the mass character of youthful marihuana use has
been frequently interpreted as a rejection of the
institutionalized principles of law and a lack of concern for
individual social responsibility, which threatens the social and
political institutions. </p>

<p>Implicit in this view is the assumption that a young person
who uses marihuana in spite of the law cannot be expected to
assume an individually and socially responsible, adult role. The
strength of this fear is drawn largely from the vocal and visible
&quot;counterculture&quot; to which marihuana is often tied. Not
surprisingly, the concerns posed by an alternate youthful life
style are extended to the drug itself. </p>

<p>Threats to the social order are often seen, for example, in
the character of youthful leisure time activities, such as
attendance at rock concerts, occasioned by the high mobility and
affluence of today's youth. They are also seen in the new modes
of speech and dress and in the seemingly casual manner of their
day-to-day living. Equally troublesome for many, however, is the
idea of intentional intoxication for purposes of recreation. </p>

<p>Such conduct and the more casual attitude toward sexual
relationships as well as participation in radical politics have
provoked increasing concern throughout the adult society. The
National Survey illustrates the extent to which the older adult
perceives youthful marihuana use as part of a much larger pattern
of behavior which bodes ill for the future of the nation.<br>
</p>

<p>First, the older the adult respondent, the more likely he was
to picture the marihuana user as leading an abnormal life. Only
9% of the over-50 generation agreed with the statement that
&quot;most people who use marihuana lead a normal life.&quot;
Nineteen percent of the 35to-49 age group and 29% of the
26-to-34-year-olds were of the same belief. Conversely, half of
the young adults (18-to-25) considered most marihuana users
normal. This fact is not surprising since many of their
contemporaries are marihuana users. </p>

<p>Second, the marihuana user, as envisioned by adults, is
typically a youthful dropout from society. He doesn't like to be
with other people, is uninterested in the world around him, is
usually lazy and has an above-average number of personal
problems. </p>

<p>Third, the less optimistic the adult respondent was about the
nation's youth, the more likely he was to oppose alteration of
the marihuana laws and to envision major social dislocations if
the laws were changed. Fifty-seven percent of the adult
population in general agreed with the statement, &quot;if
marihuana were legal, it would lead to teenagers becoming
irresponsible and wild.&quot; Among those adults who most
disapproved of youthful behavior in general, 74% agreed with the
quoted statement. Similarly, 84% of the non-approving adults
favored stricter laws on marihuana. </p>

<p>As we discussed in Chapter I, marihuana's symbolic role in a
perceived generational conflict has brought marihuana use into
the Category of a social problem. Today's youthful marihuana user
is seen as a greater threat to the social order than either the
marginal user of earlier times or the adult user of the present.
Since the concerns about marihuana today relate mostly to youth,
the remainder of this section will focus on these youth-related
issues. <br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>'THE WORLD OF YOUTH <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Youth of today are better fed, better housed, more mobile,
more affluent, more schooled and probably more bored with their
lives than any generation which has preceded them. </p>

<p>Adults have difficulty understanding why such privileged young
people should wish to offend by their language and appearance and
spend so much effort trying to discredit those institutions of
society which have made possible the privileges which those youth
enjoy. Many adults perceive the present level of youthful
discontent to be of a greater intensity than has been true of
past generations. </p>

<p>Marihuana has become both a focus and a symbol of the
generation gap and for many young people its use has become, an
expedient means of protest against adult values. </p>

<p>Adults in positions of authority, parents, teachers, policy
officials, judges, and others often view marihuana use as the
sign of youth's rejection of moral and social values and of the
system of government under which they live. The problem is that
both youth and adults tend to make pronouncements and are
frequently unable to reason together in logical fashion. Instead
they overstate their positions in such a way that effective
resolution of their differences becomes very difficult. </p>

<p>In effect, each group takes the rhetoric of the other at face
value. For youth, however, marihuana use plays many roles, only
one of which is a symbolic assault on adult authority and values.
</p>

<p>Marihuana use, for many young people, has become a part of a
ritual. It takes on the aspect of participating in a shared
experience which, for some if not all, is enjoyable in itself.
For many, it becomes an even more interesting experience because
it is forbidden. </p>

<p>Some of the rituals concerned with the purchase, storage,
preparation, and use of marihuana take on a mystique similar to
the time of Prohibition when people went through certain rituals
necessary to get a drink in a speak-easy. The three knocks and
&quot;Joe sent me&quot; cues have been replaced by the
not-so-secret handshakes, the new vocabulary of youth and other
exclusionary devices to delineate the &quot;in&quot; group. </p>

<p>The use of marihuana is attractive to many young people for
the sense of group unity and participation which develops around
the common use of the drug. This sense tends to be intensified by
a sense of &quot;common cause&quot; in those circumstances where
users are regarded as social or legal outcasts. </p>

<p>They know, too, that many of their peers who share the
marihuana experience and also share the designation of lawbreaker
are, in reality, productive and generally affirmative individuals
who are interested neither in promoting the downfall of the
nation nor in engaging in acts which would harm the general
well-being of the community. </p>

<p>In short, many youth have found marihuana use to be a
pleasurable and socially rewarding experience. They have found
that the continuance of this behavior has brought them more
pleasure than discomfort, more reward than punishment. </p>

<p>Youth have increasingly come to see law enforcement activity
directed at marihuana use as an unreasonable and unjustifiable
rejection of their generation. Most of these youth have grown up
with a positive image of the police as protectors of society.
Now, many are confronted with the possibility of police intrusion
into their private lives and the threat of a criminal record. The
unfortunate result, in many instances, has been a blanket
rejection and distrust of both the agents and institutions of
government. </p>

<p>In part, marihuana use as a social behavior is an unintended
byproduct of the formal and informal educational process. Some
persons even suggest that youthful drug usage is a
&quot;success&quot; in terms of the educational and socialization
process. Our society values independence of thought,
experimentation, and the empirical method, often reinforcing this
attitude by such advertising cliches as &quot;make up your own
mind,&quot; &quot;be your own man...... judge for yourself.&quot;
</p>

<p>Although experimentation with regard to drugs should not be
considered a &quot;success, the Commission does believe that the
educational efforts necessary to discourage this curiosity, which
may be valuable in other matters, have not succeeded. We
understand why teenagers and young adults encouraged over the
years to make up their own minds have not been restrained by
exaggerated accounts of marihuana's harmful effects, or by the
more recent assertions that a true evaluation of marihuana uses
requires more research. The Scottish verdict of &quot;not
proven&quot; does little to restrain youthful curiosity. </p>

<p>In the previous Chapter, we emphasized the difference between
the vast majority of experimenters and intermittent users and the
small group of moderate and heavy users who generally use drugs
other than marihuana as well. The former do not differ
significantly from non-users on many indices of social
integration. Various studies indicate that they maintain normal
patterns of living and social interaction, and are employed,
competent citizens. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there undoubtedly are a number of persons
who have used marihuana and have exercised poor judgment,
performed inadequately, or behaved irresponsibly while under the
drug's influence, thus jeopardizing themselves or others. The
fact remains, however, that a certain number of these persons
were immature and irresponsible individuals even prior to
marihuana use, who would be expected to have poor or impaired
judgment whether or not marihuana was involved. </p>

<p>The marihuana user is not, for the most part, a social
isolationist or a severely disturbed individual in need of
treatment or confinement. Most users, young or old, demonstrate
an average or above-average degree of social functioning,
academic achievement and job performance. Their general image of
themselves and their society is not radically different from that
of their non-marihuana-using peers. The majority of both groups
tends to demonstrate equal interest in corporate concerns. </p>

<p>Based upon present evidence, it is unlikely that marihuana
users will become less socially responsible as a result of their
marihuana use or that their patterns of behavior and values will
change significantly.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>WHY SOCIETY FEELS THREATENED<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Society appears to be concerned about marihuana use primarily
because of its perceived relationship to other social problems.
We noted in the discussion of marihuana and public health that
the focus of social concern should be the heavy users and the
possibility that their numbers will increase. Here we consider
the perceived impact of marihuana use upon the institutions and
proclaimed goals of the society.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Dropping Out <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Many parents have a genuine fear that marihuana use leads to
idleness and &quot;dropping out.&quot; During the 1960's,
marihuana use, as well as the use of other psychoactive drugs,
became equated with unconventional youth life styles. When a
number of young people adopted unconventional life styles, many
adults tended to view long hair, unkempt appearance and drugs as
symbols of counterculture. </p>

<p>They concluded that anyone who allowed his hair to grow or
gave little attention to his clothing or appearance was probably
a drug user with little or no motivation to achieve and no
interest in conventional goals. </p>

<p>A number of researchers and clinicians have observed the use
of marihuana or hashish in other societies, particularly among
poor, lower class males. Some have observed that many of these
individuals are generally unmotivated and ordinarily appear to
show little aspiration or motivation to improve their way of
life, regardless of whether they are judged by the standards of
the more prosperous members of their own society or by middle
class standards of contemporary American society. </p>

<p>One of the problems with this type of analysis is that it
fails to perceive the social and cultural realities in which the
phenomenon takes place. In the Middle East and in Asia where
hashish is used, the societies, in all instances, are highly
stratified with people in the lower classes having virtually no
social or economic mobility. Poverty, deprivation and disease
were the conditions into which these people were born and in
which they remain, regardless of whether they use cannabis. In
this context, a person's resignation to his status in life is not
likely to be caused or greatly influenced by the effects of
cannabis. Any society will always have a certain number of
persons who, for various reasons, are not motivated to strive for
personal achievement or participate fully in the life of the
community. Therefore, the determination is difficult to make
whether cannabis use influences a person to drop out and, if it
does, to what extent. </p>

<p>Some individuals possess particular personality as well as
psychosocial characteristics which in specified instances could
produce amotivation or dropping out. However, little likelihood
exists that the introduction of a single element such as
marihuana use would significantly change the basic personality
and character structure of the individual to any degree. An
individual is more likely to drop out when a number of
circumstances have joined at a given point in his lifetime,
producing pressures with which he has difficulty in coping. These
pressures often coincide with situations involving painful or
difficult judgments resulting from a need to adjust to the
pressures of the social environment. </p>

<p>Many young people, particularly in the college population, are
shielded in their earlier years from experiences which might be
emotionally stressful or unpleasant. Some young people, so
sheltered, are neither equipped to make mature and independent
judgments nor prepared to enjoy the new-found freedom of the
university or college in a mature and responsible way. Some of
these students are often unable to cope with social or academic
adversity. After being sheltered for so long, some of these young
people may be easily attracted to experiences which promise new
excitement and to fall under the influence of a peer group whose
values and living patterns may be inimical to a productive,
healthy and continuous process of personal growth and maturity.
In these instances, marihuana serves as the medium by which these
individuals encounter social and psychological experiences with
which they are ill-equipped to cope. </p>

<p>Certain numbers of these young people have demonstrated what
is described as amotivation long before the smoking of marihuana
became fashionable. Adolescence is often a particularly difficult
period of searching in many directions at the same time. In
addition to seeking a concept of &quot;self&quot; the adolescent
is, at the same time, attempting to comprehend the nature of the
world around him and to identify his status and role in society. </p>

<p>Different individuals, with different backgrounds,
socialization patterns, belief systems and levels of emotional
maturity cope with the period of transition from childhood to
adulthood in different ways., For a small number, dropping out
might be one of these coping mechanisms whether or not they use
marihuana. For others, the response to the difficult adjustments
of adolescence takes other forms, some of which are more,
acceptable, &quot;normal&quot; and easier for adults to
understand. </p>

<p>The young person who does not find it possible to cope with
the pressures of his adolescent developmental period in ways
convenient to the understanding of adult society should not be
rejected, stigmatized or labeled. He requires both support and
understanding and the opportunity to participate in roles which
have meaning for him and in ways in which he feels comfortable.
For a certain number of young people, marihuana and the mystique
of the experience eases this passage by helping them share their
feelings, doubts, inadequacies and aspirations with peers with
whom they feel safe and comfortable. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Dropping Down<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Apart from the concern over youthful dropping out and
idleness, there is also widespread concern about &quot;dropping
down&quot; or underachieving. </p>

<p>Parents frequently express fear that marihuana will undermine
or interfere with academic and vocational career development and
achievement by focusing youthful interests on the drug and those
associated with the drug subculture. Some parents make
considerable sacrifices for their children to go to school, and
the fears that marihuana might undermine the academic, emotional
and vocational development of their young are quite
understandable. </p>

<p>The Commission reviewed a number of studies related to
marihuana use by high school and college youth. No conclusive
evidence was found demonstrating that marihuana by itself is
responsible for academic or vocational failure or &quot;dropping
down,&quot; although it could be one of many contributory
reasons. Many studies reported that the majority of young people
who have used marihuana received average or above-average grades
in school. </p>

<p>In part, underachievement is related to a view of what one
individual judges to be the achievement capacity of another. This
judgment is often made without concern for what the individual
himself feels about his potential, his interests and his goals.
Perceptions about achievement also frequently fail to take into
consideration the individual feelings about the goals of his
peers and the values of the larger society, including the
relative prestige and status attached to various academic
programs, occupations and professions. <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Youth and Radical Politics <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Aside from the issue of unconventional life styles and the
concerns evoked by them, the other major concern of the sixties
which related to youth and drugs was radical politics. </p>

<p>During the latter half of the decade, youthful anti-war groups
were organized on many of the nation's college campuses and high
schools. These groups could be divided into two segments. The
largest segment consisted of concerned, sometimes confused,
frustrated and well-meaning petition signers and demonstrators.
Within this large group there was a small coterie of individuals
who constantly sought to turn the demonstration into a
confrontation and to protest for peace by means of violence. The
second segment consisted of organizations of individuals whose
stated purpose was to undermine the social and political
stability of the society through violent means. </p>

<p>What must be clearly understood, however, is that among the
young people, and some not so young, who protested against the
war in Vietnam, only a minority were bent on violence and
manipulated and corrupted these otherwise peaceful demonstrations
for their own purposes. </p>

<p>At the various gatherings, a number of the young people
protesting in these mass groups did smoke marihuana. We will
never know how many were initiated to marihuana use during the
course of these peace demonstrations. The fact remains, however,
that in the large campins, such as those in Washington, marihuana
was involved in two ways. First, there was the &quot;normal&quot;
use in which the smoking was part of the social experience.
Individuals came together and smoked, in part, to acknowledge and
strengthen group solidarity. Second, another quite different
aspect of the marihuana use at these gatherings said, in effect,
&quot;we know it's illegal but go and arrest all of us for doing
it. . . .&quot; This aspect can perhaps best be characterized as
a symbolic challenge to authority. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the media, particularly television and
some of the news magazines, sometimes portrayed the image of a
group of young people plotting the overthrow of the nation by
violent means while under the influence of marihuana. In those
relatively few instances where explosives and other violent means
were employed, the evidence points to a cold and calculated plan
which was neither conceived nor executed under the influence of
marihuana. </p>

<p>As a result of these protests and demonstrations, therefore,
radical politics has been seen by many as a mechanism through
which large numbers of young people would be introduced to
marihuana as well as to other drugs. Radical political activity
or mass political protest is viewed by some as a threat to the
welfare of the nation and is assumed to be aided and encouraged
by our enemies. </p>

<p>The involvement of large numbers of youth in political
activism and the concomitant public concern about drug use have
beclouded the issue of marihuana use and have led to a broadening
of the concerns about marihuana on the part of adults. </p>

<p>Some of the radical movement's leaders abetted this tendency
by pointing out the alleged irrationality and unfairness of the
marihuana laws to recruit members to their ranks. Not surprising
is the fact that 45% of the adult respondents in the National
Survey felt that marihuana is often promoted by people who are
enemies of the United States. Nor is it surprising that this
belief is a function of age. While 22% of all young people
(12-to-17 years of age) and 26% of young adults (18-to-25 years)
identified marihuana with national enemies, more than one-half
(58%) of those persons 50 years and older did so.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Youth and the Work Ethic <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Of the many issues related to youth and the use of marihuana,
one that greatly troubles many adults, is youthful attitudes
toward work. The work ethic in our society is based on a belief
that work is a good and necessary activity in and of itself. </p>

<p>The traditional view holds that work is not only a right and
moral act but that it keeps people from mischief and from wasting
time on harmful recreational pleasures. The rationale for this
thesis is that work in American society has served as the primary
means by which persons acquired the treasured symbols of society.
</p>

<p>In fact, throughout much of our history, with the exception of
the small number who inherited or married wealth, no ethical
alternative to work existed. In recent years, the increased
emphasis placed upon leisure time activities has resulted in
shorter work weeks, longer vacation periods and more paid
holidays. </p>

<p>Among the concerns of the adults about today's youthful
attitudes toward work and leisure are that young people seem to
enjoy their recreational pursuits so much that they forget that
to a considerable degree their enjoyment is paid for by the labor
of others. </p>

<p>Many young people do not express the same level of concern as
their parents did about preparing themselves for a career and
&quot;getting ahead in the world.&quot; In part, this attitude is
attributable to the fact that increasingly, the results of this
labor are not tangible, material goods. Service occupations
generally do not produce such tangible products, and even in
manufacturing industries the individual worker is usually too
remote from the product to feel any pride or interest in it. In
both instances, the traditional symbol of the &quot;manhood&quot;
of work, a tangible product, is no longer present. </p>

<p>In sum, society has become increasingly disturbed by certain
attitudes of today's youth which seem to stress pleasure, fun,
and enjoyment without a counterbalancing concern for a
disciplined and sustained work effort. Nevertheless, the number
of young people who view work as unimportant is small when
compared to the total number of young people. The Commission has
found no evidence to suggest that the majority of youth are
unwilling or incapable of productive and disciplined work
performance. In fact, the great majority of young people are
performing their tasks in industry, the professions and education
quite effectively. </p>

<p>Although many young people delay entry into the work force to
enjoy the fruits of our prosperous society, this delay does not
mean they will not one day contribute their best efforts to the
continued growth and advancement of the nation.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Changing Social Scene <br>
</b></font></p>

<p>The present confusion about the effects of youthful marihuana
use upon the dominant social order is caused by a variety of
interrelated social concerns, many of them emotionally charged
issues, including anti-war demonstrations, campus riots, hippie
life styles, the rising incidence of crime and delinquency and
the increased usage of all illicit drugs. The focus of concern
about marihuana is aggravated by the data overload mentioned in
Chapter 1, by the outpouring of incidental information about the
drug and its effects in a form and volume far beyond the capacity
of the readers or listeners to assimilate or interpret. Rather
than informing the public, much of the data disseminated has
produced frustration and misinterpretation of the information
presented. </p>

<p>Adult society, including parents and policy-makers, finds it
difficult to comprehend and account for many of the attitudes and
behavior of the young, including the use of marihuana. In many
cases the adults are still influenced by the myths of an earlier
period which overstated the dangers of the drug. At a time of
great social change and turbulence, the tendency to depend on the
&quot;traditional wisdom,&quot; and its moral justification, is a
strong one. </p>

<p>Just as youth must try to understand and appreciate the
strengths of the institutions of our society, adults must try to
understand the times through the eyes of their children. Where
marihuana is concerned, society must try to understand its role
in the lives of those who use it. The key to such understanding
lies in the changes which have taken place in society within
recent years and the effects these changes have had on succeeding
generations of youth. The increased use of marihuana is only one
of these effects. </p>

<p>One focal point in discussion between generations is the
contrast between the use of marihuana and the use of alcohol.
Many young people perceive that marihuana is less dangerous than
alcohol in terms of its addiction potential and long-term
physical and psychological consequences. Many believe also that
marihuana - and other psychoactive drugs make it possible to
expand their perceptions and see this as a perfectly legitimate
objective. </p>

<p>Viewed against the background of the profound changes of
recent years in the fields of economics, politics, religion,
family life, housing patterns, civil rights, employment and
recreation, the use of marihuana by the nation's youth must be
seen as a relatively minor change in social patterns of conduct
and as more of a consequence of than a contributor to these major
changes. </p>

<p>When the issue of marihuana use is placed in this context of
society's larger concerns, marihuana does not emerge as a major
issue or threat to the social order. Rather, it is most
appropriately viewed as a part of the whole of society's concerns
about the growth and development of its young people. </p>

<p>In view of the magnitude and nature of change which our
society has experienced during the past 25 years, the thoughtful
observer is not likely to attribute any of the major social
problems resulting from this change to marihuana use. Similarly,
it is unlikely that marihuana will affect the future strength,
stability or vitality of our social and political institutions.
The fundamental principles and values upon which the society
rests are far too enduring to -go up in the smoke of a marihuana
cigarette.<br>

<p>A general interpretation of the National Survey indicates that
roughly one-quarter of the American public is convinced that
criminal sanctions should be withdrawn entirely from marihuana
use. Another fourth of the public is equally convinced that
existing social and legal policy is appropriate, and would
ordinarily jail possessors, with the exception of young first
offenders. Approximately half of the citizenry is confused about
what marihuana means and ambivalent about what society ought to
do about its use. This half of the population is unenthusiastic
about classifying the marihuana user as a criminal, but is
reluctant to relinquish formal control over him. </p>

<p>In considering social and legal policy alternatives, the
Commission has analyzed the pattern of social response to
marihuana use. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The Initial Social Response</b> </p>

<p>As we noted in Chapter I, the initial social reaction to
marihuana use was shaped by the narcotics policy adopted by the
Federal Government. In the early legislation, marihuana was
officially characterized as a narcotic on the basis of the widely
shared assumption that it was a habit-forming drug, leading
inevitably to a form of dependence. Although the medical
community was aware that marihuana was distinguishable from the
opiates in that it did not produce physical dependence, no
functional distinction was drawn; it was assumed that most users
were psychologically compelled to continue using the drug. As one
psychiatrist noted in 1934, the marihuana &quot;user wants to
recapture over and over again the ecstatic, elated state into
which the drug lifts him . . . The addiction to cannabis is a
sensual addiction: it is in the services of the hedonistic
elements of the personality.&quot; </p>

<p>The notion of psychological dependence is still ill-defined,
and was understood even less in the early days of American
marihuana use. The Commission has concluded that the automatic
classification of marihuana as &quot;addictive&quot; was derived
primarily from an underlying social perception of the substrata
of society which used the drug: aliens, prostitutes, and persons
at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. </p>

<p>Additional characteristics of the opiates were also
transferred to marihuana. Particularly important in this regard
was the association of marihuana with aggressive behavior and
violent crime. One district attorney in New Orleans, where
marihuana use was particularly common, wrote in 1931: </p>

<p>It is an ideal drug to cut off inhibitions quickly . . . At
the present time the underworld has been quick to realize the
value of this drug in subjugating the will of human derelicts to
that of a master mind. Its use sweeps away all restraint, and to
its influence may be attributed many of our present day crimes.
It has been the experience of the Police and Prosecuting
Officials in the South that immediately before the commission of
many crimes the use of marihuana cigarettes has been indulged in
by criminals so as to relieve themselves from the natural
restraint which might deter them from the commission of criminal
acts, and to give them the false courage necessary to commit the
contemplated crime. </p>

<p>By 1931, those states in which marihuana use was at all common
had formally responded with a total eliminationist policy. They
generally amended the preexisting narcotics legislation to
include marihuana. Meanwhile, in 1929, the Federal Government
already had classified marihuana officially as a
&quot;habit-forming drug along with the opiates and cocaine, in
the legislation which established two federal &quot;farms&quot;
for treating narcotics addicts in Fort Worth, Texas, and
Lexington, Kentucky. </p>

<p>During the 1930's, the remaining states criminalized marihuana
use by adopting the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, in which the drug
was included (optionally) in the definition of narcotic drugs.
Then, in 1937, Congress adopted the Marihuana Tax Act, completing
the initial period of official response to marihuana use. </p>

<p>A difference of opinion among historians still exists as to
why policymakers thought national legislation was necessary at
that time. Whatever the reason, however, Congress responded
swiftly, without much attempt to learn the facts about the drug
and its use. The assumptions underlying that legislation were
summarized in the Report of the House Ways and Means Committee: </p>

<p>Under the influence of this drug the will is destroyed and all
power of directing and controlling thought is lost. Inhibitions
are released. As a result of these effects, it appeared from
testimony produced at the hearings that many violent crimes have
been and are being committed by persons under the influence of
this drug. Not only is marihuana used by the hardened criminals
to steel them to commit violent crimes, but it is also being
placed in the hands of high-school children in the form of
marihuana cigarettes by unscrupulous peddlers. Cases were cited
at the hearings of school children who have been driven to crime
and insanity through the use of this drug. Its continued use
results many times in impotency and insanity. </p>

<p>When Congress escalated penalties for narcotics offenses in
1951 and again in 1956, marihuana was included, with the
following effects: </p>

<p>Possession Minimum sentence </p>

<p>First offense ------------------------------------------ 2
years </p>

<p>Second offense ---------------------------------------- 5
years </p>

<p>Third and subsequent offense --------------------------- 10
years </p>

<p>Fine ------------------------------------------------- $20,000
</p>

<p>Sale Minimum sentence </p>

<p>First offense ------------------------------------------ 5
years </p>

<p>Second and subsequent offense --------------------------- 10
years </p>

<p>Sale to minor by adult ---------------------------------- 10
years </p>

<p>Parole or probation were made unavailable to all except first
offenders in the possession category. </p>

<p>The perceptions of 1937 were perpetuated in the comments of
Senator Price M. Daniel, Chairman of the Senate subcommittee
considering the 1956 Act, although by now an important new factor
had been added: </p>

<p>Marihuana is a drug which starts most addicts in the use of
drugs. Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to some of
the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted to the
habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin habit and then to
the final destruction of the persons addicted. </p>

<p><b>The Change</b> </p>

<p>With the adoption of marihuana use by middle and upper class
college youth in the mid-60's, the exaggerated notion of the
drug's dangers and the social tension so widespread during this
period combined to reopen the question of the impact of marihuana
use. But governmental policy held to the appropriateness of
existing law. </p>

<p>Arrests, prosecutions, convictions and sentences of
imprisonment all increased at both the federal and state levels.
Marihuana arrests by the U.S. Bureau of Customs increased
approximately 362% from fiscal year 1965 to 1970. Arrests by the
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, an agency which concerns
itself primarily with sale, rose 80% from 1965 to 1968. Because
major responsibility for enforcing the possession laws lies at
the state level, state arrests rose dramatically (1,000%) during
the five years from 1965 to 1970. Although the data compiled by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation are not comprehensive, the
FBI sample tracks the continuing increase of state arrests (Table
6). </p>

<p>In the wake of this upsurge in marihuana arrests, the criminal
justice system faced a far from usual &quot;criminal&quot;
population. Nonetheless, judging from federal figures, the number
of people prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated did rise
substantially as prosecutors and judges attempted to carry out
the law. </p>

<p>Beginning in 1966, however, the proportion of defendants
ultimately convicted declined gradually, as did the percentage of
defendants who were incarcerated, and the average length of their
sentences. This response reflected an attempt to -mitigate the
harshness of the law as applied to this new user population. By
1968, the trend toward leniency seemed to have temporarily
leveled off, before it accelerated again in 1969 (Table 7). </p>

<p>Paralleling the vigorous law enforcement effort between 1965
and 1968 was a punitive reaction in the schools and large numbers
of students using marihuana were suspended, expelled or referred
to the police. Similarly, the military's first reaction to the
surge of marihuana use took the form of court-martial,
administrative punishment, or discharge from the service.<br>

<p>The family, however, suffered the most from the sudden
conflict between accepted norms and this expression of youthful
independence. The use of drugs, particularly marihuana, became a
significant barrier between parent and child. Many young people
adopted marihuana as a symbol of their uneasiness with society's
prevailing norms. </p>

<p>As noted in Chapter 1, the sudden increase in marihuana use
precipitated extensive research by the medical and scientific
communities. By 1969, a consensus emerged holding that many of
the earlier beliefs about the effects of marihuana were
erroneous. Available U.S. data seemed to indicate that dependence
on the drug was rare, as was the incidence of psychosis among
marihuana users. Particularly important was the recognition that
there was little, if any, convincing proof that marihuana caused
aggressive behavior or crime. As such findings accumulated,
public attention was drawn increasingly to the consequences of
existing policy: soaring arrests, convictions and in some states,
lengthy sentences. </p>

<p>Policy-makers, in social institutions and government, as well
as the public began to believe that the harshness of the criminal
penalties was far out of proportion to the dangers posed by the
drug. As users were incarcerated, newspapers and television
stations often brought the matter to public attention,
particularly when the arrested youngster came from a prominent
family. </p>

<p>Official response to this development was twofold: a trend
toward leniency in marihuana cases within the legal system, and a
recognition by policy-makers of widespread uncertainty regarding
the effects of marihuana. </p>

<p>Reflecting the first response, the courts, prosecutors and
police applied existing law more leniently, and the law-makers in
most states and at the federal level changed the letter of the
law, reducing the penalties for possession of marihuana,
generally to a misdemeanor (up to a year in jail). In the
process, they repealed the mandatory minimums which had been of
major concern to the judiciary. </p>

<p>By June 1970, 24 states and the District of Columbia had
reduced the penalties, although 34 states and the District still
classified marihuana as a narcotic. Meanwhile, on the federal
level, Congress had been considering the Nixon Administration's
comprehensive proposal to overhaul the national government's
patchwork of drug legislation. </p>

<p>Since the passage of the Harrison Narcotics Act in 1914,
federal drug laws had taken the form of tax measures, an approach
compelled for constitutional reasons. The Marihuana Tax Act of
1937 followed the same format. The result, however, was a complex
set of offenses involving order forms and registrations. When the
Supreme Court declared certain aspects of the Tax Act
unconstitutional in 1969, revision of the law became essential.
Taking up the challenge, the Administration proposed a major
piece of legislation which tightened control over pharmaceutical
distributions and also reappraised the penalty structure for
narcotics and dangerous drug offenses. </p>

<p>Possession of all drugs, including marihuana, was reduced to a
misdemeanor. Special treatment for first offenders was provided,
allowing expungement of the record upon satisfactory completion
of a probationary period. Casual transfers of marihuana were
treated in the same manner as possession. After a series of
wide-ranging hearings, Congress passed the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act, and on October 27, 1970, the
President signed it into law. </p>

<p>After passage of the new federal drug law, the Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted a Uniform Controlled
Substances Act, conforming in structure and emphasis to the
federal law. Although the Uniform Act specifies no penalties, the
Commissioners recommended that possession of all drugs be a
misdemeanor. </p>

<p>At this writing, 42 of the states and the District of Columbia
classify possession as a misdemeanor or have adopted special
provisions so classifying possession of small amounts of
marihuana. In half of the remaining eight jurisdictions, the
courts have discretion to sentence possessors as misdemeanants. </p>

<p>In 11 jurisdictions, casual transfers are treated in the same
manner as possession, and in 27 jurisdictions, conditional
discharge is available to certain classes of offenders. </p>

<p>The second characteristic of the 1969-70 official response was
its acknowledgment of uncertainty. No longer perceived as a major
threat to public safety, marihuana use had now become primarily
an issue of private and public health. Scientific researchers
were asked to define the nature and scope of the health concern.
In a sense, lawmakers took the minimum official action dictated
by social and scientific realities, but were uncertain where to
go from there. The need to know more about the effects of the
drug, particularly its chronic, long-term effects, became the
core of official response. </p>

<p>Many states appointed special task forces and commissions to
report on marihuana and drug abuse in general. Congress directed
the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to file annual
Reports on Marihuana and Health and, in the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, established this
Commission. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Current Response</b> </p>

<p>In addition to an objective appraisal of the effects of
marihuana use, this Commission was directed to evaluate the
efficacy of existing law. The marihuana laws were and still are
the focus of much public debate. We have recognized from the
outset that a meaningful evaluation of the law is dependent upon
an understanding of objectives and the social context in which
the law operates. Particularly important in this connection are
the attitudes and practices of society's non-legal institutions
and the general direction of public opinion. </p>

<p>In order to comprehend the entire range of contemporary social
response, the Commission launched a threefold inquiry. First, we
designed a series of projects designed to ascertain opinion and
behavior within the criminal justice system. Included were an
analysis of all marihuana arrests during the last six months of
1970 in six metropolitan jurisdictions, a similar study of all
federal marihuana arrests during 1970, an opinion survey of all
local prosecuting attorneys, and a similar survey of attitudes
among a representative sample of Judges, probation officers, and
court clinicians. </p>

<p>We next focused on the practice and opinion of the medical,
clerical, educational, and business communities. To this end, we
solicited written responses from representative groups, invited
various spokesmen to testify before us, made numerous field
visits to secondary schools, colleges and universities and
surveyed opinion in free clinics and university health services.
We also launched a study of drug use and abuse in industry which
will be covered in our second Report on drug abuse. </p>

<p>Finally, we commissioned the National Survey of public opinion
about marihuana to which we have previously referred. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM<br>
</b></p>

<p>How does the criminal justice system respond when an enormous
increase in an illegal conduct, of a primarily private nature,
makes full enforcement of the law impossible, and when there is
widespread doubt about the rationale for making the conduct
illegal? This question guided our analysis of the responses and
opinions from members of the criminal justice system.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Law Enforcement Behavior</b> </p>

<p>On the basis of a detailed study of all federal marihuana
arrests during 1970 and of a sample of state arrests during the
last half of 1970 in Cook County, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Omaha,
Nebraska; Tucson, Arizona; San Mateo County, California; and the
Washington, DC Metropolitan Area, we present the following
findings. </p>

<p>FEDERAL The federal authorities make little or no effort to
seek out violators of laws proscribing possession of marihuana.
The Federal Government ceded responsibility for enforcement of
possession laws to the states several years ago. However, in the
course of general enforcement activity, the Federal authorities
do make possession arrests. If a person is arrested at the
Federal level for possession or casual transfer of small or
moderate amounts of marihuana, the case generally is either
dropped or turned over to the states for prosecution. </p>

<p>The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs does not
concentrate much of its energy on marihuana. By its own estimate,
approximately 6% of its investigative efforts are directed at
marihuana offenses. Most BNDD marihuana arrests occur as a result
of the agency's general investigation into the commercial
distribution of all drugs. </p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of all federal marihuana arrests
occur at or near the borders, as the Bureau of Customs, sometimes
in cooperation with the Border Patrol of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, attempts to interdict the importation of
the drug. </p>

<p><b>State</b> </p>

<p>At the state level, where enforcement of the possession laws
is focused, about 93% of the arrests in our sample were for this
offense. Yet, there was little formal investigative effort to
seek out violators of the possession laws. Instead, 69% of all
marihuana arrests arose from spontaneousor accidental situations
where there had been no investigation at all. Well over half of
these spontaneous arrests occurred when police stopped an
automobile and saw or smelled marihuana. The remaining
spontaneous arrests occurred when police stopped persons on the
street or in a park and discovered marihuana. </p>

<p>In an additional 16% of the cases, the marihuana arrest
resulted from police follow-up of a phoned tip or similar lead.
In less than 11% of all the cases was there any significant
police involvement. (Scope of investigation was unknown in about
4% of the cases). </p>

<p>Because of this enforcement pattern, arrests were concentrated
among the young. Typically the arrestee was a white male, in
school or employed in a blue collar job, without a prior record.
Of those arrested at the state level: </p>

<p>* 58% were under 21; 30% were between 21 and 26; 10% were over
26 (2% unknown) </p>

<p>* 85% were male; 15% were female </p>

<p>* 77% were white; 21% were black; 2% were Spanish speaking </p>

<p>* 27% were students, 2% were military; 28% were employed in
blue collar jobs; 15% were employed in white collar jobs; 11%
were unemployed (16% unknown) </p>

<p>* 44% had not been arrested previously; 31% had been arrested
previously (in 25% of the cases, the extent of prior contact was
unknown) ; only 6% of the arrestees had been previously
inearcerated </p>

<p>Such arrestees generally possessed only small amounts of
marihuana. Of our entire sample of 3,071 arrests: </p>

<ul>
    <li>67% were for possession of less than one ounce (18% were
        for less than one gram; 23% were for between one and 5
        grams; 26% were for between 5 and 30 grams) </li>
    <li>7% were for possession of between one ounce and 4 ounces </li>
    <li>8% were for possession of over 4 ounces </li>
    <li>13% were for possession of unknown quantities </li>
    <li>3 % were for transfer of less than one ounce </li>
    <li>3% were for transfer of over one ounce,* </li>
</ul>

<p>Offenders at the state level were generally arrested in
groups. </p>

<p>* 29 % were arrested alone </p>

<p>* 24% were arrested with one other person </p>

<p>* 43% were arrested with two or more other persons (4%
unknown) Faced with this population of offenders, the criminal
justice System responded often by dismissing or diverting to a
noncriminal institution the young first-offense possessor of
small amounts. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Adult Cases</b> </p>

<p>At least 48% of the cases were terminated in the defendant's
favor: </p>

<p>The police themselves disposed of l0% of the cases, refraining
from filing charges, or diverting the case, to some other
institution. </p>

<p>The prosecution declined to file complaints in an additional
7% of the cases. </p>

<p>An additional 28% of the cases were dismissed in the course of
pretrial judicial proceedings. </p>

<p>In 3% of the cases, the defendant was acquitted at trial. </p>

<p>*Because the figures have been rounded off, the total is not
always 100%.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Cases</b> </p>

<p>At least 70% of the cases were terminated in the youth's
favor: </p>

<p>The police themselves disposed of 21% of the cases, refraining
from referring the youth to juvenile authorities or diverting the
case to some other agency. </p>

<p>An additional 48% of the cases were dismissed either because
the juvenile officer responsible for filing a delinquency
petition refused to do so, or because the judge dismissed the
case prior to trial. </p>

<p>in 1% of the cases, the juvenile was found innocent. </p>

<p>Of the entire sample of arrests, both adult and juvenile, 33%
of those apprehended were ultimately sentenced,, after pleading
guilty or being found guilty. (Since 11% of the 3,071 cases -were
still pending at the time of our study, and disposition was
unknown in 2% of the cases, the figure may be as high as 40% of
all arrests). </p>

<p>Of those convicted for possession of marihuana, 24% were
incarcerated, usually for a year or less. Most of the remaining
persons were put on probation, although some were fined only. By
comparison, of those convicted of sale (5% of the convicted
individuals), 65% were incarcerated, usually for over a year. </p>

<p>In short, in the 2,610 cases where disposition was final and
was available to 6% of those apprehended were ultimately
incarcerated. </p>

<p>From this analysis of enforcement behavior. it appears that
the law enforcement community has adopted a policy of
containment. Although effort is sometimes expended to seek out
private marihuana use, the trend is undoubtedly to invoke, the
marihuana possession laws only when the behavior (possession)
comes out in the open. We were told by police officials in some
cities, for example, that arrests are made only when marihuana
use is flaunted in public. </p>

<p>The salient feature of the present law has become the threat
of arrest for indiscretion. The high percentage of cases which,
after arrest, are disposed of by dismissal or informal diversion
attests to the ambivalence of police officials, prosecutors and
judges about the appropriateness of existing law. Anyone
processed through the entire system does run a risk of
incarceration, especially when the individual had a prior record
and the offense was sale or possession of a significant amount. </p>

<p><b>Law Enforcement Opinion</b> </p>

<p>Prosecutorial opinion toward the existing system suggests both
a containment objective and a, flexible, response. As to
prosecution policy: </p>

<p>31% of the prosecutors state that they would not prosecute
anyone one arrested at a private, social gathering of marihuana
users who are passing a cigarette. </p>

<p>Large numbers of prosecutors admit that they consider factors
other than strength of the evidence in deciding whether or not to
prosecute a possession case; 41% cite age, 38% cite lack of prior
record, 36% consider the amount of marihuana seized and 26% take
into account the family situation of the accused; 31% thought one
or another of these non-legal factors was most important in his
decision </p>

<p>29% of the prosecutors acknowledge that they use informal
probation in lieu of prosecution in some cases. </p>

<p>As to the efficacy of existing law, a majority of the
prosecutors agree that the marihuana laws do not deter, or deter
only minimally: </p>

<p>Persons under 30 from initiating use (53%) </p>

<p>Users from using regularly (56%) </p>

<p>Users from transferring small amounts for little or no
remuneration (55%) </p>

<p>From the studies made by the Commission of enforcement
practices, we consider this to be a realistic assessment. </p>

<p>Conversely, however, the prosecutors agree that the laws have
a significant effect in deterring users from smoking marihuana
openly (62%) and persons over 30 from initiating use (44%). </p>

<p>We also asked the district attorneys for their views on an
appropriate legal policy concerning marihuana use. Their opinions
tend to fall in three groups. One group, representing about 25%
of the prosecutors, favors the status quo, and does not want any
further reduction in penalties. A fifth of the prosecutors
conclude, on the basis of their experience, that possession of
marihuana, and perhaps sale of the drug, should be removed
entirely from the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>The remaining prosecutors, a majority, is willing to consider
mitigation of the harshness of the law either by legislation or
by benign exercise of discretion, but is reluctant to relinquish
formal, criminal control. These prosecutors doubt the deterrent
value of the law and are willing to be lenient in appropriate
cases, but they believe some use of the legal system is necessary
to prevent all increase in marihuana use. </p>

<p>Underlying these opinions are diverse attitudes about
marihuana use and the efficacy of existing law. For example,
prosecutors who doubt the efficacy of existing law and reject the
&quot;escalation&quot; and &quot;aggressive behavior&quot;
hypotheses, are generally willing to modify the laws by their
enforcement policies and by legislative reform (Table 8). </p>

<p>The same general pattern of practice and opinion emerges at
the judicial and dispositional level. Only 13% of the responding
judges would jail an adult for possession of marihuana and only
4% said they would incarcerate a minor. Lesser proportions of
probation officers and clinicians would imprison adults (8% and
1%) and minors (2% and %). Conversely, 11% of the Judges, 15.5%
of the probation officers and 63.5% of the clinicians noted that
they would assess no penalty for possession by adults. For

<p>How to read table: 87.1%, of the prosecutors who favor no
change in existing law believe that marihuana leads to the use of
hard drugs; in contrast, 32.2% of the prosecutors who favor
legalization believe that marihuana leads to the use of hard
drugs. </p>

<p>With regard to appropriate legal policy, the judges exhibit
the same inclination as the prosecutors to look for alternatives
within a formal control system which would avoid the use of
criminal penalties. We asked essentially the same question in two
ways and received similar responses (Table 9). </p>

<p>The judges, as a group, are less enthusiastic about criminal
control than the prosecutors, but are equally unwilling to
relinquish formal control. By contrast, the probation officers
and clinicians, who have more personal contact with these
offenders and are perhaps more intensively aware of the control
potential of the criminal justice systern, are highly skeptical
about formal control (Tables 10, -and 11). </p>

<p>In conclusion, as one proceeds through the criminal justice
system, from district attorneys to court clinicians, the people
responsible for the functioning of that system seem to be
decreasingly enthusiastic about the appropriateness of criminal
control and decreasingly insistent on any technique for formal
control. </p>

<p>How to read table: When asked to identify the appropriate

informal control (1 1% would rely on personal choice and 22%,
would rely on informal social control). Similarly, when asked
about the appropriate statutory scheme for possession, 24.3% of
the judges preferred control outside the criminal justice system,
a functional equivalent of &quot;informal control.&quot; </p>

<p>Both Committees expressed doubt about the wisdom and

criminal justice system to deal with marihuana use. They both
urged the Commission to recommend the removal of criminal
penalties from possession of the drug for personal use and casual
non-profit transfers. Both Committees suggested that a regulatory
approach to distribution of the drug be given serious
consideration. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE NON-LEGAL INSTITUTIONS</b> </p>

<p>Law enforcement authorities, given available and prospective
resources, cannot possibly enforce the existing marihuana laws
fully. The best they can do is keel) marihuana use contained and
out of sight. In addition, many officials within the criminal
justice system are reluctant to enforce the marihuana laws, being
either uncommitted to the usefulness of this particular law or
opposed to the law itself. The net result is for the legal system
to leave much of the responsibility for social control to other
social institutions such as family, schools, churches, and the
medical profession. Since these other institutions themselves
have relied heavily on the legal system for control, caution and
confusion now dominate the social response to marihuana use. </p>

<p>The diminishing severity of the law enforcement response may
not have occurred if the other institutions of society had
continued to regard the marihuana user as a criminal. However,
many of these institutions have come to view the marihuana user
primarily in social or medical terms, and to recommend a form of
social control in accord with their respective self-interests or
orientations. In many cases, the ,attitudes of these other
institutions mirror that of the criminal justice system:
uncertainty about the proper role of formal legal control.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Family</b> </p>

<p>The most important institution for instilling social norms is
the family. Parental attitudes generally parallel public opinion,
and specific responses in our National Survey suggest an
inclination among parents and non-parents to deal with youthful
marihuana users through discussion and persuasion rather than
harsh or punitive measures. When asked what action they would
take upon discovering that one of their teenage children was
smoking marihuana with friends, 47% of the adults responded that
they would use persuasion and reason. Twenty-three percent
favored a punitive approach. Interestingly, 9% of the latter
group felt so strongly about the matter that they were willing to
report their own child to the police. A considerable number, 35%
indicated that they were uncertain about what to do, or failed to
respond to this multiple response question. </p>

<p>The non-punitive trend was also apparent when the adults were
asked what they would do if their teenage child was arrested for
a marihuana offense. A substantial number (58%) indicated they
would attempt to extricate their child from the situation, many
not wishing their child to have a police record, while 34%
expressed the sentiment that the child's arrest would help him
learn a lesson. </p>

<p><b>The Schools</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana use continues to increase among high school and
college students. The National Survey reveals that 30% of the
high school juniors and seniors have used marihuana. The National
Survey also reveals that 44% of those currently attending college
at the graduate or undergraduate levels have used it, while other
surveys indicate this figure is significantly higher in some
major universities. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, there has been, during the last two years,
ail appreciable change in the attitudes of school administrators,
faculty and even of the boards of education and trustees toward
marihuana use, Administrators at the secondary and college levels
are generally more relaxed and tolerant toward marihuana, use
than they were during the mid-1960's, when support for a punitive
response was common. After the initial shock of widespread use
dissipated, many school officials came to believe that strong
disciplinary action, including suspension and arrest, was
counterproductive. In addition, as the evidence accumulated that
marihuana, was not as dangerous as had once been thought,
parental and community pressures were sometimes brought to bear
on school administrators to be less punitive and more
understanding of marihuana use. </p>

<p>At the secondary level, the policies very somewhat from state
to state and even within states. Nevertheless, school boards
generally seem to have become less enthusiastic about suspension
and arrest as an appropriate response to marihuana use. One
school administrator in Philadelphia noted sarcastically that if
all users were suspended or arrested, the high schools would
become empty cells, with their entire clientele turned out onto
the streets. </p>

<p>A West Coast official emphasized that student alcohol use was
a much more serious problem than marihuana use; he even suggested
that legalization of marihuana might reduce alcohol use among the
young. The Commission ascertained that no suspensions for
marihuana use had occurred during 1971 in the entire school
system of a southern metropolitan area. Although security
officers in that system did make 20 arrests, they were all for
selling marihuana and other drugs. </p>

<p>At the secondary level, then, increased reliance is being
placed on persuasion rather than discipline, as a means of
discouraging marihuana use. Drug education programs, now being
instituted in almost every school system, often include
information about alcohol and tobacco. We will explore the
various pedagogical techniques employed in such programs and will
attempt to evaluate them in our next Report. </p>

<p>At the college level, the response is even more lenient. In
many cases official neutrality or even protection against police
intervention substitutes for the restraint common at the
secondary level. Under formal or informal arrangements with local
law enforcement officials, many schools bar on-campus arrests for
marihuana use. Apparently they have concluded that enforcement of
the marihuana laws causes more harm. than does use of the drug.
In some cases, college authorities have substituted their own
policy for society's official policy. The Commission learned at
one of its hearings in Chicago, for example, that a major
Midwestern university explicitly declared that students would be
subject to university disciplinary action if they were found in
possession of more than one week's supply of marihuana. </p>

<p>Control at the college level is usually considered a medical
Concern and is handled either through the university health
centers or free clinics. The trend toward leniency is also
apparent in the policy responses of the representative sample of
university health service and free clinic physicians. whose
profession presumably brings them into contact with the
population most it risk from marihuana. Among personnel of the
free clinics, 62% of the respondents favor legalization; 5% would
continue the present policy, and the remainder would either
reduce penalties (11%) or await further research (22%). </p>

<p>Even among the &quot;establishment-oriented&quot; health
service personnel, similar attitudes prevail. Nineteen percent
would continue the present policy, and 16% would legalize. Of the
remaining 55% (10% did not respond), 38% would reduce, penalties
and 17% would await further research. This pattern of views bears
a striking resemblance to that of the prosecuting attorneys, and
indeed of the public at large. The large majority indicates
uneasiness with the present system and opposition to
legalization, but is uncertain about exactly what to do. </p>

<p><b>The Churches</b> </p>

<p>The nation's churches play a major role in the process by
which society's norms and values are transmitted to the young.
Moral education, through individual and family counseling by
church personnel, is influential in the process of social
control, particularly for adolescents. Consequently, the
Commission sought to learn the attitudes, responses and
recommendations of the clergy. </p>

<p>The larger societal uncertainty about the social and moral
implications of marihuana use is also reflected in the attitudes
of religious institutions. For example, Dr. Thomas E. Price,
speaking for the National Council of Churches of Christ in the
U.S.A. before the Commission, referred to marihuana as a
&quot;tightly drawn moral knot.&quot; This uncertainty has led
many religious groups to minimize a punitive and repressive
response to marihuana use in their official statements and formal
programs. Instead, they have concentrated on educational and
rehabilitative programs. </p>

<p>Many church spokesmen have urged a reconsideration of social
and legal policy. The range of their suggestions for change
reflects, once again, widespread uncertainty. Some ask for some
form of &quot;adequate&quot; punishment or supervision so as to
discourage marihuana use. Others say &quot;reform or
elimination&quot; of penalties for possession would be
appropriate. And there are those who suggest legalization with
some government regulation. Some church spokesmen have defended
existing policy, recommending only that the law be more strictly
and uniformly enforced. </p>

<p><b>The Medical Community</b> </p>

<p>In contrast to the mixed opinions of other segments of
society, the medical profession has a rather broad consensus at
the present time. In a series of responses from various medical
societies, associations and committees, we found certain
recurrent themes. Every medical group emphasized the need for
more research into the effects of marihuana. There was uniform
emphasis on how marihuana, as a &quot;drug,&quot; affects heart,
head, blood, brain and so on, but not on how it affects society
as a behavior. The consensus was that marihuana, the drug, poses
some danger for the individual, physically or psychologically.
The only major disagreement is about the degree of such danger. </p>

<p>The second recurrent theme was that marihuana should
definitely not be legalized. Legalization would imply sanction,
medical groups said, with a probable, increase in use as a
result. One doctor compared legalization with the failure of
Prohibition: &quot;The fact [that] Prohibition was a failure
doesn't make alcoholism a good thing and the six million or so
(alcoholics) we have are no bargain. Therefore, since there is no
legitimate use for marihuana it seems rather silly to legalize
its use to initiate a second headache.&quot; Another reason
commonly given by physicians for opposing legalization is that
such a step should be taken if and when it is proven that
marihuana is not dangerous. </p>

<p>The third common theme of medical opinion was a call for a
more. lenient approach toward users, again a position reflected
in almost every quarter of society. One officer of a public
health association told a convention: &quot; (Our committee)
deplores the strong punitive measures suggested by some because
we feel that a jail sentence for the offense of smoking marihuana
is not likely to solve the problem of eliminating marihuana use.
On the contrary, a prison sentence is likely to do great damage
to a young person's personality as well as to his future
career.&quot; Another group called for prosecutors to use
discretionary powers in handling youthful first offenders. </p>

<p>When discussing penalties, the medical community begins to
take, a look at marihuana use as a form of social behavior rather
than simply a drug which produces certain physical and
psychological effects. One doctor wrote: &quot;Because marihuana
in present patterns of use is, by and large, a relatively
innocuous drug and because its use has many motivations from
simple curiosity to symbolism of hostility to the
'establishment', the legal penalties in many jurisdictions
throughout the United States are excessively punitive.&quot; </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Summary</b> </p>

<p>Social institutional spokesmen now commonly recognize that
control of marihuana is only partially a law enforcement problem.
Opinions cluster around the propositions that society should not
be punitive on the one hand, but should not make the drug
available, at least for now. Beyond these points, however,
uncertainty prevails. There is no common vision of an appropriate
social control policy. </p>

<p>Each institution is going about the business of control in its
own way. Parents emphasize mutual communication. The secondary
schools emphasize health education. The colleges recognize
personal freedom so long as it does not jeopardize the
educational enterprise. Churches emphasize uncertainty about the
moral implications of marihuana use. The medical fraternity
stresses the need for further research into the health
consequences of marihuana use. Uncertainly is the common
denominator. </p>

<p><b>THE PUBLIC RESPONSE</b> </p>

<p>For most Americans marihuana use is not an abstract
phenomenon. Fifteen percent of the adult population, the National
Survey revealed, has tried the drug and 44% of the non-trying
adults personally know someone who has used the drug. Fourteen
percent of the youth have tried the drug and 58% of the
non-triers personally know someone who has used the drug. Indeed,
six percent of the non-trying youth indicated that half or more
of their friends used marihuana. </p>

<p>The public is also aware of the consequences of the existing
system and concerned about its impact. Ninety-seven percent of
the adults know that selling marihuana is against the law. Only a
few less, 94%, know that possession is against the law. In fact,
one fourth of the adults know someone who has been arrested on a
possession charge. Ninety-two percent of the youth know that sale
is prohibited, and four out of five know that possession is
against the law. Fifty-three percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds
actually know someone who has been arrested for possession. </p>

<p>Acutely aware of the legal consequences of use, the public is
also cognizant of the difficulties encountered by the criminal
justice system in its attempt to enforce a widely-violated law,
Adults were asked whether they mostly agreed or mostly disagreed
with a series of 12 selected propositions regarding the
desirability of maintaining or altering the present system of
marihuana control. The two propositions which received the most
support relate to problems inherent in the existing laws. </p>

<p>Eighty-three percent of the adults mostly agreed with the
statement that &quot;because of marihuana a lot of young people
who are not criminals are getting police records and being put in
jail.&quot; And 76% agreed that &quot;laws against marihuana are
very hard to enforce because most people use it in private.&quot;
</p>

<p>Marihuana use is more personal than most public issues, but it
is also more confusing. Bombarded in recent years -with
contradictory &quot;findings&quot; and statistics about the
effects of marihuana, and with conflicting arguments about public
policy, the public tends to believe everything, whether pro or
con. Particularly important in this regard is the widespread
acceptance of beliefs which have little basis in fact. </p>

<p>Approximately half of the adult public believes that
&quot;many crimes are committed by persons who are under the
influence of marihuana,&quot; and that &quot;some people have
died from using it.&quot; Seven of every 10 adults believe that
&quot;marihuana makes people want to try stronger things like
heroin.&quot; Although the probability that a person believes
these statements increases with age, a significant percentage of
all groups are represented. </p>

<p>The underlying confusion is strongly indicated in the
contradictory attitudes toward various reasons for maintaining or
changing the law. For example, 43% of the adults thought, in the
context of an argument for making marihuana legal, that &quot;it
should be up to each person to decide for himself, like with
alcohol or tobacco.&quot; Yet 75% of the adults agreed, in the
context of an argument for keeping the laws the way they are,
that &quot;there are already too many ways for people to escape
their responsibilities. We don't need another one.&quot; </p>

<p>Youth tend to be less convinced than adults that marihuana use
may be fatal to the user, or cause him to commit crime or lead
him to use other drugs; but young people as a group also are
noticeably more uncertain about these matters. One of every four
young people indicated that they were unsure whether marihuana
caused death or crime, and one of every six expressed uncertainty
regarding the progression to other drugs. Similarly, young people
were more than twice as likely as adults to have &quot;no
opinion&quot; about the various propositions regarding the need
for legal change. </p>

<p>Public attitudes toward marihuana exhibit both doubt and
tension. On the one hand, we note an acute awareness of the legal
consequences of marihuana use and an appreciation of the adverse
impact of processing users through the criminal justice system.
On the other hand, we note some misconceptions about the dangers
of marihuana and confusion about the consequences of changing or
maintaining the present system. </p>

<p>Public responses on the basic questions of social and legal
policy reflect the underlying ambivalence. The overwhelming
majority of the public does not want to treat the marihuana user
harshly. This attitude appeared repeatedly through the entire
Survey. When asked &quot;For the good of the country, which of
the following courses of action would be the best thing to do
about [marihuana use] ?&quot; the public responded in the
following manner:<br>
</p>

<p>Percentage Youth Adults* 12-17 </p>

<p>Handle the problem mostly through the police and courts: </p>

<p>the process of arrest, conviction, punish- </p>

<p>Handle the problem mostly through medical clinics: </p>

<p>Don't worry about the use of marihuana, but spend time and
money on preventing and solving other crimes </p>

<p>No opinion --------------------------------------- 5 20 </p>

<p>*Some adults gave more than one answer. </p>

<p>Adults and youth were also asked to look at marihuana use from
the perspective of the system, and to identify the appropriate
penalty for possession of marihuana. Both groups were reluctant
to put users in jail, especially for a first offense.
Eighty-three percent of the adults and 64% of the youth would not
incarcerate a youthful first offender; 54% of the adults and 41 %
of the youth would not even give the young offender a police
record (Table 12). </p>

<p>Interestingly, the youth population as a whole was less
lenient than the adult population as a whole. Within each group,
however, the older teenagers and young adults were the most
tolerant in all respects. </p>

<p>These statistics suggest that the I public generally prefers
leniency when responding to questions specifically directed to
marihuana use. But when asked about &quot;control&quot; or
&quot;the law&quot; in general, the response often appears quite
harsh. For example, when asked to consider a range of five
alternative control schemes, most adults tended to resist change.
</p>

<p>Thirty-one percent of the adults thought that making marihuana
legally available through regulated channels (like alcohol) was
acceptable but 67% thought it was unacceptable. Although 23%
thought the removal of criminal sanctions from possession was
acceptable, 74% thought this approach was unacceptable. On the
other hand, 56% of the adults thought that the existing laws
were, acceptable; yet 41% found the present law unacceptable.
Finally, 72% thought &quot;stricter laws&quot; would be
acceptable, while only 26% thought such a change would be
unacceptable. Indeed 43% thought stricter laws were the
&quot;ideal solution&quot; and 62% thought this was the best of
the alternatives. </p>

<p>These responses seem to be contradictory. We are puzzled about
what the respondents thought they meant when they expressed a
preference for stricter laws. </p>

<p>They probably did not mean stricter penalties for possession.
Such an interpretation would be entirely inconsistent with
responses to questions aimed directly at appropriate policy
toward users. Under existing law some states still treat first
offenders as felons and most states treat multiple offenders as
felons. But, only a third of the adult respondents would put an
adult multiple offender in jail for more than a year. </p>

<p>The preference for stricter laws might be interpreted to mean
heavier penalties for sale, or better enforcement of existing
proscriptions against trafficking. Two-thirds of the adults did
indicate that they preferred heavier penalties for sale than for
possession. But penalties for selling for profit are already
quite heavy in every jurisdiction. </p>

<p>We suspect that a majority of the public, including many of
those favoring &quot;stricter laws,&quot; is actually disturbed
about the increase in marihuana use and would like a system which
would work better than the existing system to discourage use. A
majority of the adult public seeks a better system of control,
albeit one which is not punitive toward the user. Apparently
uneasy about the individual and social consequences of the
present system, the large center of public opinion is nonetheless
reluctant to relinquish formal control. </p>

<p>This insistence on maintenance of formal controls over the
user rests upon two interrelated factors: respect for law and
faith in the efficacy of legal control. First, the public does
not believe the, legal order should wither away simply because
many people choose to violate the laws against marihuana use.
Obedience, of the, law is highly valued in our society. </p>

<p>This factor is illustrated clearly by the widespread public
disagreement with the following arguments for changing the law:
76% of the adults disagreed with the statement that &quot;young
people would have more respect for the law if marihuana were made
legal;&quot; and four out of five adults disagreed with the
statement that &quot;so many people are using marihuana that it
should be made legal.&quot; </p>

<p>Second, most adults believe that legal remedies, even though
not punitive, are necessary to discourage use of the drug. This
belief is tied largely to their understanding of the effects of
the drug and is reflected in the response to the question about
&quot;the best way&quot; to handle the use of marihuana. As we
noted earlier, 51% of the public thought that marihuana use ought
to be handled as a medical problem. </p>

<p>Also, the substantial majority of people who are reluctant to
incarcerate possessors do prefer the imposition of fines without
a police record or probation. Both of these alternatives retain
formal control over the user and indicate faith in the deterrent
value of the law. The public responses in this respect bear a
striking resemblance to those of the judges and probation
officers, who repeatedly indicated a preference for non-punitive
formal control. </p>

<p>This interpretation of dominant opinion was drawn from
ostensibly inconsistent responses to a long series of questions
on appropriate social and legal policy. A substantial minority of
the public, however, exhibited a consistent pattern of response
to all questions. About a quarter of the public is convinced that
the criminal sanction should be withdrawn entirely from marihuana
use. Another quarter of the public prefers the criminal approach,
even for the user. </p>

<p>In sum, the existing system is not supported by the consensus
of public opinion that once existed. There is a consensus that
punitive measures are generally inappropriate. There is also a
predominant opinion that the legal system should not abandon
formal control.<br>

<p>&quot;The difficulty in life is the choice.&quot; </p>

<p>George Moore (1900) </p>

<p>A constant tension exists in our society between individual
liberties and the need for reasonable societal restraints. It is
easy to go too far in either direction, and this tendency is
particularly evident where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>We have guided our decision-making by the belief that the
state is obliged to justify restraints on individual behavior.
Too often individual freedoms are submerged in the passions of
the moment, and when that happens, the public policy may be
determined more by rhetoric than by reason. Our effort has been
to minimize the emotional and emphasize the rational in this
Report. </p>

<p><b>Drugs In a Free Society</b> </p>

<p>A free society seeks to provide conditions in which each of
its members may develop his or her potentialities to the fullest
extent. A premium is placed on individual choice in seeking
self-fulfillment. This priority depends upon the capacity of free
citizens not to abuse their freedom, and upon their willingness
to act responsibly toward others and toward the society as a
whole. Responsible behavior, through individual choice, is both
the guarantor and the objective of a free society. <br>
</p>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>The use of drugs is not in itself an irresponsible act.
Medical and scientific uses serve important individual and social
needs and are often essential to our physical and mental
well-being. Further, the use of drugs for pleasure or other
non-medical purposes is not inherently irresponsible; alcohol is
widely used as an acceptable part of social activities. </p>

<p>We do think the use of drugs is clearly irresponsible when it
impedes the individual's integration into the economic and social
system. A preference for individual productivity and contribution
to social progress in a general sense still undergirds the
American value structure, and we emphasize the policy-maker's
duty to support this preference in a public policy judgment. </p>

<p>At the same time, in light of the emerging leisure ethic and
the search for individual meaning and fulfillment noted in
Chapter 1, we cannot divorce social policy from the questions
raised by the recreational use of drugs. Productivity and
recreation both have a place in the American ethical system. They
are not inconsistent unless the individual's use of leisure time
inhibits his productive role in society. </p>

<p>Drugs should be servants, not masters. They become masters
when they dominate an individual's existence or impair his
faculties. To the extent that any drug, including alcohol,
carries with it risks to the well-being of the user and seriously
undermines his effectiveness in the society, that drug becomes a
matter of concern for public policy. </p>

<p>An essential step in the process of policy-formation is a
determination of the circumstances under which use of any given
drug' poses such risks. For some drugs, the risks may be so great
that all permissible measures should be taken to eliminate use.
For other drugs, such risks may be present only under certain
specific circumstances, in which case society may defer to
responsible individual choice on the matter of recreational use
but take appropriate steps to minimize the incidence and
consequences of dysfunctional use. In our Report next year, for
which studies are already underway, we will consider from this
perspective the whole range of drugs now used for non-medical
purposes. </p>

<p>A Social Control Policy for Marihuana </p>

<p>In formulating a Marihuana policy, our strongest concern is
with irresponsible use, whether it be too often, too much,
indiscriminate, or under improper circumstances. The excessive or
indiscriminate use of any drug is a serious social concern; and
this is particularly true of marihuana since we still know very
little about the effects of long term, heavy use. We have little
doubt that the substantial majority of users, under any social
control policy, including the existing system, do not and would
not engage in irresponsible behavior. </p>

<p>In identifying the -appropriate social control policy for
marihuana, we have found it helpful to consider the following
policy options: </p>

<p>I Approval of Use. </p>

<p>II Elimination of Use. </p>

<p>III Discouragement of Use. </p>

<p>IV Neutrality Toward Use. <br>
</p>

<p>APPROVAL OF USE </p>

<p>Society should not approve or encourage the recreational use
of any drug, in public or private. Any semblance of encouragement
enhances the possibility of abuse and removes, from a
psychological standpoint, an effective support of individual
restraint. </p>

<p>For example, so long as this society (not only the government,
but other institutions and mass advertising as well) in effect
approved of the use of tobacco, the growing medical consensus
about the dangers of excessive use did not make a significant
impression on individual judgment. With the Surgeon General's
Report on Tobacco in 1964, Smoking and Health, a very real change
has occurred in the way society now thinks about cigarettes. </p>

<p>The institutions of society definitely add their influences to
the variety of social pressures which persuade individuals to use
any kind of drugs. Rational social policy should seek to minimize
such social pressures, whether they come from peers, from the
media, from social custom, or from the user's sense of
inadequacy. Official approval would inevitably encourage some
people to use the drug who would not otherwise do so, and would
also increase the incidence of heavy or otherwise irresponsible
use and its complications. On this basis we reject policy option
number one, approval of use. </p>

<p>ELIMINATION OF USE </p>

<p>For a half-century, official social policy has been not only
to discourage use but to eliminate it (option number two). With
the principal responsibility for this policy assigned to law
enforcement, its implementation reached its zenith in the late
1950's and early 1960's when marihuana-related offenses were
punishable by long periods of incarceration. This policy grew out
of a distorted and greatly exaggerated concept of the drug's
ordinary effects upon the individual and the society. On the
basis of information then available, marihuana was not adequately
distinguished from other problem drugs and was assumed to be as
harmful as the others. </p>

<p>The increased incidence of use, intensive scientific
reevaluation, and the spread of use to the middle and upper
socioeconomic groups have brought about the informal adoption of
a modified social policy. On the basis of our opinion surveys and
our empirical studies of law enforcement behavior, we are
convinced that officialdom and the public are no longer as
punitive toward marihuana use as they once were. </p>

<p>Now there exists a more realistic estimate of the actual
social impact of marihuana use. School and university
administrators are seldom able to prevent the use of marihuana by
their students and personnel and are increasingly reluctant to
take disciplinary action against users. Within the criminal
justice system, there has been a marked decline in the severity
of the response to offenders charged with possession of
marihuana. </p>

<p>In our survey of state enforcement activities, only 11% of all
marihuana arrests resulted from active investigative activity,
and most of those were in sale situations. For the most part,
marihuana enforcement is a haphazard process; arrests occur on
the street, in a park, in a car, or as a result of a phone call.
Among those arrested, approximately 50% of the adults and 70% of
the juveniles are not processed through the system; their cases
are dismissed by the police, by the prosecutors or by the courts.
Ultimately less than 6% of all those apprehended are
incarcerated, and very few of these sentences are for possession
of small amounts for personal use. </p>

<p>In the law enforcement community, the major concern is no
longer marihuana but the tendency of some users to engage in
other irresponsible activity, particularly the use of more
dangerous drugs. Official sentiment now seems to be a desire to
contain use of the drug as well as the drug subculture, and to
minimize its spread to the rest of the youth population. Law
enforcement policy, both at the Federal and State levels,
implicitly recognizes that elimination is impossible at this
time. </p>

<p>The active attempt to suppress all marihuana use has been
replaced by an effort to keep it within reasonable bounds. Yet
because this policy still reflects a view that marihuana smoking
is itself destructive enough to justify punitive action against
the user, we believe it is an inappropriate social response. </p>

<p>Marihuana's relative potential for harm to the vast majority
of individual users and its actual impact on society does not
justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish
those who use it. This judgment is based on prevalent, use
patterns, on behavior exhibited by the vast majority of users and
on our interpretations of existing medical and scientific data.
This position also is consistent with the estimate by law
enforcement personnel that the elimination of use is
unattainable. </p>

<p>In the case of experimental or intermittent use of marihuana,
there is room for individual judgment. Some members of our
society believe the decision to use marihuana is an immoral
decision. However, even during Prohibition, when many people were
concerned about the evils associated with excessive use of
alcohol, possession for personal use was never outlawed federally
and was made illegal in only five States. </p>

<p>Indeed, we suspect that the moral contempt in which some of
our citizens hold the marihuana user is related to other behavior
or other attitudes assumed to be associated with use of the drug.
All of our data suggest that the moral views of the overwhelming
majority of marihuana users are in general accord with those of
the larger society. </p>

<p>Having previously rejected the approval policy (option number
one), we now reject the eliminationist policy (option number
two). This policy, if taken seriously, would require a great
increase in manpower and resources in order to eliminate the use
of a drug which simply does not warrant that kind of attention.<br>
</p>

<p>DISCOURAGEMENT OR NEUTRALITY </p>

<p>The unresolved question is whether society should try to
dissuade its members from using marihuana or should defer
entirely to individual judgment in the matter, remaining benignly
neutral. We must choose between policies of discouragement
(number three) and neutrality (number four). This choice is a
difficult one and forces us to consider the limitations of our
knowledge and the dynamics of social change. A number of
considerations, none of which is conclusive by itself, point at
the present time toward a discouragement policy. We will discuss
each one of them separately. </p>

<p>1. User Preference Is Still Ambiguous </p>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco have long been desired by large numbers
within our society and their use is deeply ingrained in the
American culture. Marihuana, on the other hand, has only recently
achieved a significant foothold in the American experience, and
it is still essentially used more by young people. Again, the
unknown factor here is whether the sudden attraction to marihuana
derives from its psychoactive virtues or from its symbolic
status. </p>

<p>Throughout this Commission's deliberations there was a
recurring awareness of the possibility that marihuana use may be
a fad which, if not institutionalized, will recede substantially
in time. Present data suggest that this is the case, and we do
not hesitate to say that we would prefer that outcome. To the
extent that conditions permit, society is well advised to
minimize the number of drugs which may cause significant
problems. By focusing our attention on fewer rather than more
drugs, we may be better able to foster responsible use and
diminish the consequences of irresponsible use. </p>

<p>The more prudent course seems to be to retain a social policy
opposed to use, attempting to discourage use while at the same
time seeking to deemphasize the issue. Such a policy leaves us
with more options available when more definitive knowledge of the
consequences of heavy and prolonged marihuana use becomes
available. </p>

<p>2. Continuing Scientific Uncertainty Precludes Finality </p>

<p>In 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, society was cognizant
of the effects of alcohol as a drug and the adverse consequences
of abuse. But, because so many people wished to use the drug,
policy-makers chose, to run the risk of individual indiscretion
and decided to abandon the abstentionist policy. There are many
today who feel that if the social, impact of alcohol use had then
been more fully understood, a policy of discouragement rather
than neutrality would have been adopted to minimize the negative
aspects of alcohol use. </p>

<p>Misunderstanding also played an important part when the
national government adopted an eliminationist, marihuana policy
in 1937. The policy-makers knew very little about the effects or
social impact of the drug; many of their hypotheses were
speculative and, in large measure, incorrect. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the argument that misinformation in 1937
automatically compels complete reversal of the action taken at
that time is neither reasonable nor logical. While continuing
concern about the effects of heavy, chronic use is not sufficient
reason to maintain an overly harsh public policy, it is still a
significant argument for choosing official discouragement in
preference to official neutrality. </p>

<p>3. Society's Value System Is In a State of Transition </p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, two central influences in
contemporary American life are the individual search for meaning
within the context of an increasingly depersonalized society, and
the collective search for enduring American values. In Chapter
IV, we noted that society's present ambivalent response to
marihuana use reflects these uncertainties. </p>

<p>For the reasons discussed in the previous Chapters, a sudden
abandonment of an official policy of elimination in favor of one
of neutrality toward marihuana would have a profound
reverberating impact on social attitudes far beyond the one issue
of marihuana use. We believe that society must have time to
consider its image of the future. We believe that adoption of a
discouragement policy toward marihuana at this time would
facilitate such a reappraisal while official neutrality, under
present circumstances, would impede it. </p>

<p>4. Public Opinion Presently Opposes Marihuana Use </p>

<p>For whatever reasons, a substantial majority of the American
public opposes the use of marihuana, and would prefer that their
fellow citizens abstain from using it. In the National Survey,
64% of the adult public agreed with the statement that
&quot;using marihuana is morally offensive` (40% felt the same
way about alcohol). </p>

<p>Although this majority opinion is not by any means conclusive,
it cannot be ignored. We are well aware of the skeptics in with
which marihuana user, and those sympathetic to their wishes, view
the policy making process; and we are particularly concerned
about the indifference to or disrespect for law manifested by
many citizens and particularly the youth. </p>

<p>However, we are also apprehensive about the impact of a major
change in social policy on that larger segment of our population
which supports the implications of the existing social policy.
They, too, might lose respect for a policy-making establishment
which appeared to bend so easily to the wishes of a
&quot;lawless&quot; and highly vocal minority. </p>

<p>This concern for minimizing cultural dislocation must, of
course, be weighed against the relative importance of contrary
arguments. For example, in the case of desegregation in the
South, and now in the North, cult-Lire shock had to be accepted
in the light of the fundamental precept at issue. In the, case.
of marihuana, there is no fundamental principle supporting the
use of the drug, and society is not compelled to approve or be
neutral toward it. The opinion of the majority is entitled to
greater weight. </p>

<p>Looking again to the, experience with Prohibition, when an
abstentionist policy for alcohol was adopted on the national
level in 1918, its proponents were not blind to the vociferous
opposition of a substantial minority of the people. By the late
1920's and early 1930's, the ambivalence of public opinion toward
alcohol use and the unwillingness of large numbers of people to
comply with the new social policy compelled reversal of that
policy. Even many of its former supporters acknowledged its
futility. </p>

<p>With marihuana, however, the prevailing policy of eliminating
use had never been opposed to any significant degree until the
mid-1960's. Unlike the prohibition of alcohol, which had been the
subject of public debate off and on for 60 years before it was
adopted, present marihuana policy has not until now engaged the
public opinion process, some 50 years after it first began to be
used. Majority sentiment does not appear to be as flexible as it
was with alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p>5. Neutrality Is Not Philosophically Compelled </p>

<p>Much of what was stated above bespeaks an acute awareness by
the Commission of the subtleties of the collective consciousness
of the American people, as shown in the National Survey. There is
a legitimate concern about what the majority of the non-using
population thinks about marihuana use and what the drug
represents in the public mind. The question is appropriately
asked if we are suggesting that the majority in a free society
may impose its will on an unwilling minority even though, as it
is claimed, uncertainty, speculation, and a large degree of
misinformation form the basis of the predominant opinion. If we
have nothing more substantial than this, the argument goes,
society should remain neutral. </p>

<p>To deal with this contention, one must distinguish between
ends and means. Policy-makers must choose their objectives with a
sensitivity toward the entire social fabric and a vision of the
good society. In such a decision, the general public attitude is
a significant consideration. The preferred outcome in a
democratic society cannot be that of the policy-makers alone; it
must be that of an informed public. Accordingly, the policy-maker
must consider the dynamic relationship between perception and
reality in the public mind. Is the public consensus based on a
real awareness of the facts? Does the public really understand
what is at stake? Given the best evidence available, would the
public consensus remain the same? </p>

<p>Assuming that dominant opinion opposes marihuana use, the
philosophical issue is raised not by the goal but by how it is
implemented. At this point, the interests of the unwilling become
important. For example, the family unit and the institution of
marriage are preferred means of group-living and child-rearing in
our society. As a society, we are not neutral. We officially
encourage matrimony by giving married couples favorable tax
treatment; but we do not compel people to get married. If it
should become public policy to try to reduce the birth rate, it
is unlikely that there will be laws to punish those who exceed
the preferred family size, although we may again utilize
disincentives through the tax system. Similarly, this Commission
believes society should continue actively to discourage people
from using marihuana, and any philosophical limitation is
relevant to the means employed, not to the goal itself.<br>
</p>

<p>FOR THESE REASONS, WE RECOMMEND TO THE PUBLIC AND ITS
POLICY-MAKERS A SOCIAL CONTROL POLICY SEEKING TO DISCOURAGE
MARIHUANA USE, WHILE CONCENTRATING PRIMARILY ON THE PREVENTION OF
HEAVY AND VERY HEAVY USE. </p>

<p>We emphasize that this is a policy for today and the immediate
future; we do not presume to suggest that this policy embodies
eternal truth. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that our
successor policy planners, at an appropriate time in the future,
review the following factors to determine whether an altered
social policy is in order: the state of public opinion, the
extent to which members of the society continue to use the drug,
the developing scientific knowledge about the effects and social
impact of use of the drug, and the evolving social attitude
toward the place of recreation and leisure in a work-oriented
society. In our second Report next year, we will carefully review
our findings to see if our perceptions have changed or if society
has changed at that time.<br>
</p>

<p>Implementing The Discouragement Policy </p>

<p>Choice of this social control policy does not automatically
dictate any particular legal implementation. As we noted in
Chapter 1, there is a disturbing tendency among participants in
the marihuana debate to assume that a given statement of the
drug's effects, its number of users or its social impact compels
a particular statutory scheme. </p>

<p>Law does not operate in a social vacuum, and it is only one of
the institutional mechanisms which society can utilize to
implement its policies. Consequently, the evaluation of
alternative legal approaches demands not only logic but also a
delicate assessment of the mutual relationship between the law
and other institutions of social control, such as the church, the
family and the school. <br>
</p>

<p>THE ROLE OF LAW IN EFFECTIVE SOCIAL CONTROL </p>

<p>Social control is most effectively guaranteed by the exercise
of individual self-discipline. Elementary social psychology
teaches us that restraint generated within is infinitely more
effective and tenacious than restraint imposed from without. </p>

<p>One of the participants at our &quot;Central Influences&quot;
Seminar observed: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When people grow up into a society, the principal aim is
    to internalize drives-that is, I assume they come up 'with
    certain drives which can be satisfied in many ways and you're
    trying to internalize, ways of satisfying those drives which
    will be compatible with life in a community and also
    satisfying to the individual. The external restraints can
    only complement this, they cannot possibly substitute for it.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The supplemental effect of external restraints, particularly
legal restraints, must also be weighed against the nature of the
control sought. It was put this way at our Seminar: </p>

<p>Think of the social welfare function as a mountain-the hill of
the Lords really. Large parts of it are something of a plateau;
that is you can be all sorts of places on it and be safe. You
don't have to maximize. This is an economist's fallacy. You can
have all sorts of variations, you can be Socialists, Capitalists,
Mormons, Adventists and get away with it-even Liberals. But there
are cliffs, and you can fall off of them. This is what we are
worrying about today. We are nervous about these cliffs. </p>

<p>The &quot;no-no's&quot;-as the kids call them-are the fences
on these cliffs. That is, we have set up taboos and say there's a
cliff there. Now -one of the problems socially is that we set up
&quot;no-no's&quot; where there are no cliffs. There are no
cliffs and people jump over these [fences] and they say, &quot;No
cliffs! See no cliffs!&quot; [Then, over other fences-and]
chop-chop-chop-crash! See, it's just as dangerous to set up
fences without any cliffs as not have fences where there are
cliffs. </p>

<p>To this functional consideration of external restraint, we
must also add the philosophical faith in the responsible exercise
of individual judgment which is the essence of a free society. To
illustrate, a preference for individual productivity underlies
this society's opposition to indiscriminate drug use, the fact
that so few of the 24 million Americans who have tried marihuana
use it, or have used it, irresponsibly, testifies to the extent
to which they have internalized that value. </p>

<p>The hypothesis that widespread irresponsibility would attend
freer availability of marihuana suggests not that a restrictive
policy is in order but rather that a basic premise of our free
society is in doubt. We note that the escalation thesis, used as
an argument against marihuana rather than as a tool for
understanding individual behavior, is really a manifestation of
skepticism about individual vulnerabilities. For example,
one-half of the public agreed with the statement that &quot;if
marihuana were made legal, it would make drug addicts out of
ordinary people.&quot; </p>

<p>At the same time, we do feel that the threat of excessive use
is most potent with the young. In fact, we think all drug use
should continue to be discouraged among the young, because of
possible adverse effects on psychological development and because
of the lesser ability of this part of the population to
discriminate between limited and excessive use. </p>

<p>Social policy implementation in this regard is extraordinarily
difficult. For example, although existing social policies toward
tobacco, alcohol and marihuana alike oppose their use by the
young, those policies are far from being fully effective. For
example: </p>

<p>Tobacco </p>

<p>The National Survey (1971) indicates that of young people age
12-to-17, </p>

<ul>
    <li>50 % have smoked at one, time or another; </li>
    <li>15% smoke now; and </li>
    <li>At least 8% smoke at least a half a pack a day. </li>
</ul>

<p>In a 1970 sample of smoking habits in the 12-to-18 population
conducted for the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health,
it was found that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>18.5% of the boys and 11.9% of the girls were regular
        smokers; and </li>
    <li>About 8% of the boys and 5% of the girls smoked more than
        a half a pack a day. </li>
</ul>

<p>Alcohol </p>

<p>The National Survey also ascertained the drinking pattern
during the previous month of young people aged 12-to-17, finding
that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>At least 23% had used beer during that month, at least
        14% had used wine and at least 12% had used hard liquor;
        and </li>
    <li>6% had used beer five or more days during the months 3%
        had used wine five or more days, and 3% had used hard
        liquor five or more days. </li>
</ul>

<p>Marihuana </p>

<p>Of the 12-to-17 population, the Survey found that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>15% of this population had tried marihuana; </li>
    <li>At least 6 % still use it; and </li>
    <li>Less than 1% use it once a day or more </li>
</ul>

<p>The inclination of so many young people to experiment with
drugs is a reflection of a so-called successful socialization
process on one hand, and of society's ambivalence to the use of
drugs on the other. This entire matter will occupy much of our
attention in the coming year, but it is essential that we make a
few anticipatory comments now. </p>

<p>This nation tries very had to instill in its children
independence, curiosity and a healthy self-assurance. These
qualities guarantee a dynamic, progressive society. Where drugs
are concerned, however, we have relied generally on
authoritarianism and on obedience. Drug education has generally
been characterized by overemphasis of scare tactics. Some
segments of the population have been reluctant to inform for fear
of arousing curiosity in young minds. Where drugs are concerned,
young people are simply supposed to nod and obey. - </p>

<p>This society has always been and continues to be ambivalent
about the non-medical (in the strict sense) use of drugs. And
this ambivalence does not escape our children. If we can come to
grips with this issue, we might convince our youth that the
curiosity that is encouraged in other aspects of our culture is
undesirable where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>The law is at best a highly imperfect reflection of drug
policy. The laws proscribing sale of tobacco to minors are
largely ignored. Prohibitions of sale of alcohol to minors are
enforced sporadically. As to marihuana, there are areas
throughout this nation where possession laws are not enforced at
all. In other sections, such proscriptions are strictly enforced,
with no apparent decrease in marihuana use. </p>

<p>As a guiding doctrine for parents and children, the law is
certainly confusing when it imposes widely varying punishments in
different states, and even in different courts of the same state,
all for use of the same substance, marihuana. That marihuana use
can be treated as a petty offense in one state and a felony in
another is illogical and confusing to even the most sincere of
parents. </p>

<p>The law is simply too blunt an instrument to manifest the
subtle distinctions we draw between the motivations and the
circumstances of use. At the same time, legal status carries a
certain weight of its own, and other institutions must take
account of the law in performing their functions. </p>

<p>In legally implementing our recommended social policy, we seek
to maximize the ability of our schools, churches and families to
be open and honest in discussing all drugs, including marihuana.
The law must assist, not impede. In this respect, we note with
concern the counterproductive tendency in our society to seek
simple solutions to complex problems. Since the statutory law is
a simple tool, the tendency in our society to look to the law for
social control is particularly strong. </p>

<p>We have discussed the four basic social policy objectives of
elimination, discouragement, neutrality and approval of marihuana
use and have selected discouragement of use, with emphasis on
prevention of heavy and very heavy use, as our generalized aim.
We have considered three legal responses, each with a wide range
of alternatives: </p>

<p>1. Total Prohibition. </p>

<p>2. Partial Prohibition. </p>

<p>3. Regulation.<br>
</p>

<p>TOTAL PROHIBITION </p>

<p>The distinctive feature of a total prohibition scheme is that
all marihuana-related behavior is prohibited by law. Under the
total prohibition response now in force in every state and at the
federal level, cultivation, importation, sale, gift or other
transfer, and possession are all prohibited acts. In 11 states
and the District of Columbia, simply being present knowingly in a
place where marihuana is present is also prohibited; and many
states prohibit the possession of pipes or other smoking
paraphernalia. For our purposes, the key feature of the total
prohibition approach is that even possession of a small amount in
the home for personal use is prohibited by criminal law. </p>

<p>From the very inception of marihuana control legislation, this
nation has utilized a policy of a total prohibition, far more
comprehensive than the restrictions established during the
prohibition of alcohol. </p>

<p>Until recent years, society was operating under an
eliminationist policy. The exaggerated beliefs about the drug's
effects, social impact, and user population virtually dictated
this legal approach. During this entire, period, total
prohibition was sought through the use of heavier and heavier
penalties until even first-time possession was a felony in every
jurisdiction, and second possession offenses generally received a
mandatory minimum sentence without parole or probation. Yet the
last few years have seen society little by little abandoning the
eliminationist policy in favor of a containment policy. </p>

<p>Under the total prohibition umbrella, this containment policy
has been implemented by a unique patchwork of legislation,
informal prosecutorial policy and judicial practice. Possession
is now almost everywhere a misdemeanor. Although some term of
incarceration remains as a penalty for possessors, it is
generally not meted out to young first offenders or to possessors
of small -amounts. Instead, most such offenders are dismissed or
informally diverted to agencies outside the criminal system by
those within the system who are trying to help them avoid the
stigma of a criminal record. </p>

<p>Offenders who are processed within the criminal justice system
generally receive fines and/or probation. In many jurisdictions,
enforcement officials make little or no effort to enforce
possession proscriptions, concentrating instead on major
trafficking. Possessors are generally arrested only when they are
indiscreet or when marihuana is found incident to questioning or
apprehension resulting from some other violation. From our
surveys, state and federal, we have found that only minimal
effort is made to investigate marihuana possession cases. </p>

<p>Such a tendency is a reflection of the adoption of a
containment policy. By acting only when marihuana appears above
ground, enforcement officials are helping to keep its use
underground. The shift away from the elimination policy has been
matched by a similar shift in legal implementation, but the
distinctive feature of the total prohibition scheme still
remains: all marihuana-related behavior, including possession for
personal use within the home, is prohibited by criminal law. </p>

<p>Is such a response an appropriate technique for achieving the
social control policy we outlined above? The key question for our
purposes is whether total criminal prohibition is the most
suitable or effective way to discourage use and whether it
facilitates or inhibits a concentration on the reduction and
treatment of irresponsible use. We are convinced that total
prohibition frustrates both of these objectives for the following
reasons.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1. Application of the Criminal Law to Private Possession Is
Philosophically Inappropriate</b> </p>

<p>With possession and use of marihuana, we are dealing with a
form of behavior which occurs generally in private where a person
possesses the drug for his own use. The social impact of this
conduct is indirect, arising primarily in cases of heavy or
otherwise irresponsible use and<br>
from the drugs symbolic aspects. We do not take the absolutist
position that society is philosophically forbidden from
criminalizing any kind of &quot;private&quot; behavior. The
phrase &quot;victimless crimes,&quot; like &quot;public, health
hazard, has become a rhetorical excuse for avoiding basic social
policy issues. We have chosen a discouragement policy on the
basis of our evaluation of the actual and potential individual
and social impact of marihuana use. Only now that we have done so
can we accord appropriate weight to the nation's philosophical
preference for individual privacy. </p>

<p>On the basis of this evaluation we believe that the criminal
law is too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in
the effort to discourage use. It implies an overwhelming
indictment of the behavior which we believe is not appropriate.
The actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great
enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private
behavior, a step which our society takes only 'with the greatest
reluctance.<br>
</p>

<p><b>2. Application of the Criminal Law Is Constitutionally
Suspect</b> </p>

<p>The preference for individual privacy reflected in the debate
over the philosophical limitations on the criminal law is also
manifested in our constitutional jurisprudence. Although no
court, to our knowledge, has held that government may not
prohibit private possession of marihuana, two overlapping
constitutional traditions do have important public policy
implications in this area. </p>

<p>The first revolves around the concept that in a free society,
the legislature may act only for public purposes. The
&quot;police powers&quot; of the states extend only to the
&quot;public health, safety and morals.&quot; In the period of
our history when the people most feared interference with their
rights by the government, it was generally accepted that this
broad power had an inherent limitation. For example, early
prohibitions of alcohol possession were declared unconstitutional
on the basis of reasoning such as that employed by the Supreme
Court of Kentucky in 1915 in the case of Commonwealth v.
Campbell: </p>

<p><i>It is not within the competency of government to invade the
privacy of the citizen's life and to regulate his conduct in
matters in which alone is concerned, or to prohibit him any
liberty the exercise which will not directly injure society.</i> </p>

<p>Noting that the defendant was &quot;not charged with having
the liquor in his possession for the purpose of selling it, or
even giving it to another,&quot; and that &quot;ownership and
possession cannot be denied when that ownership and possession is
not in itself injurious to the public,&quot; the Kentucky court
concluded that: </p>

<p><i>The right to use liquor for one's own comfort, if they use
it without injury to the public, is one of the citizen's natural
and inalienable rights.... We hold that the police power-vague
and wide and undefined as it is-has limits. . . .</i> </p>

<p>Even the perceived dangers of opium were not enough to
convince some members of the judiciary that the government could
prohibit possession. It is historically instructive to consider
these words, penned in 1890, by Judge Scott in Ah Lim v
Territory: </p>

<p><i>I make no question but that the habit of smoking opium may
be repulsive and degrading. That its effect would be to shatter
the nerves and destroy the intellect; and that it may tend to the
increase of the pauperism and crime. But there is a vast
difference between the commission of a single act, and a
confirmed habit. There is a distinction to be recognized between
the use and abuse of any article or substance.... If this act
must be held valid it is hard to conceive of any legislative
action affecting the personal conduct, or privileges of the
individual citizen, that must not be upheld.... The prohibited
act cannot affect the public in any way except through the
primary personal injury to the individual, if it occasions him
any injury. It looks like a new and extreme step under our
government in the field of legislation, if it really was passed
for any of the purposes upon which that character of legislation
can be sustained, if at all.</i> </p>

<p>As a matter of constitutional history, a second tradition, the
application of specific provisions in the Bill of Rights, has
generally replaced the notion of &quot;inherent&quot;
limitations. The ultimate effect is virtually the same, however.
The Fourth Amendment's proscription of &quot;unreasonable
searches and seizures&quot; reflects a constitutional commitment
to the value of individual privacy. The importance of the Fourth
Amendment to the entire, constitutional scheme was eloquently
described by Justice Brandeis in 1928 in the case of Olmstead v
U.S.: </p>

<p><i>The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure
conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized
the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and
his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure
and satisfaction of life are to be found in material things. They
sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts,
their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against
the Government, the right to be let alone-the most comprehensive
of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.<br>
</i></p>

<p>Although the Fourth Amendment is itself a procedural
protection, the value of privacy which it crystallizes is often
read in conjunction with other important values to set
substantive limits on legislative power. The Supreme Court, in
the case of Griswold vs. Connecticut, held in 1965 that
Connecticut could not constitutionally prohibit the use of birth
control devices by married persons. Although the Justices did not
agree completely on the reasons for their decision, Justice
Douglas stated in the opinion of the Court: </p>

<p><i>The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying
within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental
constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in
forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their
manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means of
having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such
a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often
applied by this Court, that a &quot;governmental purpose to
control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state
regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily
broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedom.&quot;
(citation omitted) Would we allow the police to search the sacred
precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of
contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of
privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.</i> </p>

<p>Four years later, the Supreme Court, in Stanley v. Georgia,
held that even though obscenity is not &quot;speech&quot;
protected by the First Amendment, a state cannot constitutionally
make private possession of obscene material a crime. The Court's
reasoning is revealed in the following language: </p>

<p><i>[The] right to receive information and ideas, regardless of
their social worth, (citation omitted), is fundamental to our
free society. Moreover, in the context of this case- a
prosecution for mere possession of printed or filmed matter in
the privacy of a person's own home-that right takes on an added
dimension. For also fundamental is the right to be free, except
in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental
intrusions into one's privacy ...<br>
</i></p>

<p>While the judiciary is the governmental institution most
directly concerned with the protection of individual liberties,
all policy-makers have a responsibility to consider our
constitutional heritage when framing public policy. Regardless of
whether or not the courts would overturn a prohibition of
possession of marihuana for personal use in the home, we are
necessarily influenced by the high place traditionally occupied
by the value of privacy in our constitutional scheme. </p>

<p>Accordingly, we believe that government must show a compelling
reason to justify invasion of the home in order to prevent
personal use of marihuana. We find little in marihuana's effects
or in its social impact to support such a determination.
Legislators enacting Prohibition did not find such a compelling
reason 40 years ago; and we do not find the situation any more
compelling for marihuana today.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Total Prohibition Is Functionally Inappropriate<br>
</b></p>

<p>Apart from the philosophical and constitutional constraints
outlined above, a total prohibition scheme carries with it
significant institutional costs. Yet it contributes very little
to the achievement of our social policy. In some ways it actually
inhibits the success of that policy. </p>

<p>The primary goals of a prudent marihuana social control policy
include preventing irresponsible use of the drug, attending to
the consequences of such use, and deemphasizing use in general.
Yet an absolute prohibition of possession and use inhibits the
ability of other institutions to contribute actively to these
objectives. For example, the possibility of criminal prosecution
deters users who are experiencing medical problems from seeking
assistance for fear of bring attention to themselves. In
addition, the illegality of possession and use creates
difficulties in achieving an open, honest educational program,
both in the schools and in the home. </p>

<p>In terms of the social policy objective of discouraging use of
the drug, the legal system can assist that objective in three
ways: first, by deterring people from use; second, by symbolizing
social opposition to use; and finally, by cutting off supply of
the drug. </p>

<p>The present illegal status of possession has not discouraged
an estimated 24 million people from trying marihuana or an
estimated eight million from continuing to use it. Our survey of
the country's state prosecuting attorneys shows that 53% of them
do not believe that the law has more than a minimal deterrent
effect in this regard. Moreover, if the present trend toward
passive enforcement of the marihuana law continues, the law
ultimately will deter only indiscreet use, a result achieved as
well by a partial prohibition scheme and with a great deal more
honesty and fairness. </p>

<p>A major attraction of the law has been its symbolic value.
Yet, society can symbolize its desire to discourage marihuana use
in many other, less restrictive ways. The warning labels on
cigarette packages serve this purpose, illustrating that even a
regulatory scheme could serve a discouragement policy. During
Prohibition, the chosen statutory implementation symbolized
society's opposition to the use of intoxicating beverages; yet,
most jurisdictions did not think it necessary to superimpose a
proscription of possession for personal use in the home. </p>

<p>Finally, prohibiting possession for personal use has no
substantive relation to interdicting supply. A possession penalty
may make enforcement of proscriptions against sale a little
easier, but we believe this benefit is of minimal importance in
light of its costs. </p>

<p>The law enforcement goal repeatedly stated at both the federal
and state levels has been the elimination of supply and the
interdiction of trafficking. These avowed aims of law enforcement
make sense, since they are the most profitable means of employing
its manpower and resources in this area. </p>

<p>Indeed, the time consumed in arresting Possessors is
inefficiently used when contrasted with the same amount of time
invested in apprehending major dealers. Although a credible
effort to eliminate supply requires prohibitions of importation,
sale and possession-with intent-to-sell, the enforcement of a
proscription of possession for personal use is minimally
productive. </p>

<p>As noted, most law enforcement officials, district attorneys
and judges recognize the ineffectiveness of the possession
penalty. as a deterrent. Its perpetuation results in the making
of what is commonly referred to as &quot;cheap&quot; cases that
have little or no impact on deterring sale. </p>

<p>The marihuana supply system can be viewed as pyramid with the
major bulk of marihuana entering the system at top of the pyramid
and then descending to the base which represents the user
population. Common sense dictates where law enforcement should
devote its efforts. To remove the profit from the traffic
requires arresting sellers, not users. The oft-heard argument
that the police need possession penalties to compel users to
reveal their sources is not convincing. &quot;Turning
informants&quot; at the base of the pyramid is of marginal value
and limited utility in reaching upwards toward the apex. Further,
the National Survey showed that 60% of the users don't
&quot;buy&quot; marihuana but get it from a friend. The volume of
traffic in the drug at these levels is at best minimal. </p>

<p>In short, personal possession arrests and even casual sales,
which account for more than 95% of the marihuana arrests at the
state local level, occur too low in the chain of distribution to
diminish supply very effectively. </p>

<p>In addition to the misallocation of enforcement resources,
another consequence of prohibition against possession for
personal use is the social cost of criminalizing large numbers of
users. Our empirical study of enforcement of state and federal
marihuana laws indicates that almost all of those arrested are
between the ages of 18 and 25, most have jobs or are in school,
and most have had no prior contact -with the criminal justice
system. The high social cost of stigmatizing such persons as
criminals is now generally acknowledged by the public at large as
well as by those in the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>According to the National Survey, 53% of the public was
unwilling to give young users a criminal record and 87% objected
to putting them in jail. The nation's judges expressed an
overwhelming disinclination to sentence and convict users for
marihuana possession. Of these judges only 13% thought it was
appropriate to incarcerate ail adult for possession and only 4%
would jail a juvenile for marihuana possession. This
disinclination is reflected in the low percentage of arrested
users who are convicted, and the even lower percentage who are
jailed. </p>

<p>Even among the nation's prosecutors, a substantial majority
favor the present trend toward avoiding incarceration for first
offenders. Most jurisdictions have devised informal procedures
for disposing of cases in lieu of prosecution. Our empirical
study shows that 48% of the adult cases, and 70% of the juvenile
cases, were dropped from the system at some point between arrest
and conviction. The picture displayed is one of a large
expenditure of police manpower to enforce a law most participants
further along the line are not anxious to apply. </p>

<p>Other disturbing consequences of laws proscribing possession
for personal use are the techniques required to enforce them.
Possession of marihuana is generally a private behavior; in order
to find it, the police many times must operate on the edge of
constitutional limitations. Arrests without probable cause,
illegal searches and selective enforcement occur often enough to
arouse concern about the integrity of the criminal process. </p>

<p>Yet another consequence of marihuana possession laws is the
clogging of judicial calendars. President Nixon has noted that
one of the major impediments to our nation's efforts to combat
serious crimes is the fact that the judicial machinery moves so
slowly. Swift -arrests, prosecution, trial and sentence would
significantly improve the deterrent effect of law. Yet the
judicial system is overloaded with petty cases, with public
drunkenness accounting for about 50% of all non-traffic offenses.
</p>

<p>In his March 1971 address to the National Conference on the
Judiciary, President Nixon said: </p>

<p>What can be done to break the logjam of justice today, to
ensure the right to a speedy trial-and to enhance respect for
law? We have to find ways to clear the courts of the endless
stream of &quot;victimless crimes&quot; that get in the way of
serious consideration of serious crimes. There are more important
matters for highly skilled judges and prosecutors than minor
traffic offenses, loitering and drunkenness. </p>

<p>To this list we would add marihuana possession, which accounts
for a rising percentage, of judicial caseloads. In Chicago alone,
during the last half of 1970, there were more than 4,000
possession arrests. </p>

<p>A final cost of the possession laws is the disrespect which
the laws and their enforcement engender in the young. Our youth
cannot understand why society chooses to criminalize behavior
with so little visible ill-effect or adverse social impact,
particularly when so many members of the law enforcement
community also question the same laws. These young people have
jumped the fence and found no cliff. And the disrespect for the
possession laws fosters a disrespect for all law and the system
in general. </p>

<p>On top of all this is the distinct impression among the youth
that police may use the marihuana laws to arrest people they
don't like for other reasons, whether it be their politics, their
hair style or their ethnic background. Whether or not such
selectivity actually exists, it is perceived to exist. </p>

<p>For all these reasons, we believe that the possession offense
is of little functional benefit to the discouragement policy and
carries heavy social costs, not the least of which is disrespect
and cynicism among some of the young. Accordingly, even under our
policy of discouraging marihuana use, the better method is
persuasion rather than prosecution. Additionally, with the sale
and use of more hazardous drugs on the increase, and crimes of
violence escalating, we do not believe that the criminal justice
system can afford the time and the costs of implementing the
marihuana possession laws. Since these laws are not mandatory in
terms of achieving the discouragement policy, law enforcement
should be allowed to do the job it is best able to do: handling
supply and distribution. </p>

<p>A criminal fine or similar penalty for possession has been
suggested as a means of alleviating some of the more glaring
costs of a total prohibitory approach yet still retaining the
symbolic disapproval of the criminal law. However, most of the
objections raised above would still pertain: the possibilities of
invasion of personal privacy and selective enforcement of the law
would continue; possessors would still be stigmatized as
criminals, incurring the economic and social consequences of
involvement with the criminal law; the symbolic status of
marihuana smoking as an anti-establishment act would be
perpetuated. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a fine most likely would deter use no more
than does the present possibility of incarceration. It would
continue to impede treatment for heavy and very heavy use and
would persist in directing law enforcement away from the policy's
essential aim which is to halt illegal traffic in the drug. </p>

<p>For all these reasons, we reject the total prohibition
approach and its variations.<br>
</p>

<p><b>REGULATION</b> </p>

<p>Another general technique for implementing the recommended
social policy is regulation. The distinguishing feature of this
technique is that it institutionalizes the availability of the
drug. By establishing a legitimate channel of supply -and
distribution, society can theoretically control the quality and
potency of the product. The major alternatives within this
approach lie in the variety of restraints which can be imposed on
consumption of the drug and on the informational requirements to
which its distribution can be subject. </p>

<p>We have given serious consideration to this set of
alternatives; however, we are unanimously of the opinion that
such a scheme, no matter how tightly it might restrict
consumption, is presently unacceptable.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme at this Time Would
Inevitably Signify Approval of Use</b> </p>

<p>In rejecting the total prohibition approach, we emphasized the
symbolic aspects. In essence, we do not believe prohibition of
possession for personal use is necessary to symbolize a social
policy disapproving the use. Theoretically, a tightly controlled
regulatory schemes with limited distribution outlets, significant
restraints on consumption prohibition of advertising and
compulsory labeling, could possibly symbolize such disapproval.
Our regulatory policy toward tobacco is beginning to slowly to
reflect a disapproval policy toward Cigarette smoking.
Nonetheless, given the social and historical context of such a
major shift in legal policy toward marihuana, we are certain that
such a change would instead symbolize approval of use, or at
least a position of neutrality. </p>

<p>The Commission is concerned that even neutrality toward use as
a matter of policy could invest an otherwise transient phenomenon
with the status of an accepted behavior. If marihuana smoking
were an already ingrained part of our culture, this objection
would be dispelled. However, we do not believe that this is the
case,. We are inclined to believe, instead, that the present
interest in marihuana is transient and will diminish in time of
its own accord once the major symbolic aspects of use are
deemphasized, leaving among our population only a relatively
small coterie of users. With this possibility in mind, we are
hesitant to adopt either a policy of neutrality or a regulatory
implementation of our discouragement policy. The law would
inevitably lose its discouragement character and would become
even more ambiguous in its rationale and its enforcement. </p>

<p>The effect of changing a social policy direction may be seen
with tobacco policy. In recent years, society has ostensibly
adopted a policy of discouraging cigarette smoking. This new
policy has been implemented primarily in the information area
through prohibition of some forms of advertising and through
compulsory labeling. Yet, the volume, of cigarettes used
increased last year. We believe that the failure of the new
policy results from the fact that it supplants one that formerly
approved use. This set of circumstances argues against any policy
which would be regarded as approval of use, including a
regulatory scheme. It is always extremely difficult to transform
a previously acceptable behavior into a disapproved behavior.<br>
</p>

<p><b>2. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme Might Generate a
Significant Public Health Problem<br>
</b></p>

<p>We noted above that institutionalizing availability of the
drug would inevitably increase the incidence of use, even though
that incidence might otherwise decrease. Of greater concern is
the prospect that a larger incidence of use would result in a
larger incidence of long term heavy and very heavy use of potent
preparations. </p>

<p>There are -now approximately 500,000 heavy users of less
potent preparations in this country, representing about 2% of
those who ever tried the drug. Even if the prevalence of -heavy
use remained the same in relation to those who ever used, this
at-risk population would inevitably increase under a regulatory
scheme. If the emotional disturbances found in very heavy hashish
users in other countries were to occur in this country, the
adverse social impact of marihuana use, now slight, would
increase substantially. </p>

<p>We have acknowledged that society, nonetheless, chose to run
such a risk in 1933, when Prohibition was repealed. But alcohol
use was already well-established in this society, and no
alternative remained other than a regulatory approach. In light
of our suspicion that interest in marihuana is largely transient,
it would be imprudent to run that risk for marihuana today.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme Would Exacerbate Social
Conflict and Frustrate a Deemphasis Policy</b> </p>

<p>A significant segment of the public on both sides of the issue
views marihuana and its &quot;legalization&quot; in a highly
symbolic way. Any attempt to adopt a regulatory approach now
would be counterproductive in this respect. The collision of
values resulting from such a dramatic shift of policy would
maintain the debate at a highly emotional level and would
perpetuate the tendency to perceive marihuana use as a symbol of
the struggle between two conflicting philosophies.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. Not Enough Is Known About Regulatory Models In This Area</b>
</p>

<p>Advocates of legalization of marihuana are often inclined to
propose a licensing scheme or an &quot;alcohol model&quot;
without offering a specific program of regulation taking all the
variables into account. Responsible policy planning cannot be so
cursory. Consequently, we have given serious study to the many
issues presented by such a scheme and to the nation's experience
with other drug licensing schemes. On the basis of our inquiry,
we are convinced that such a step should not be taken unless a
realistic assessment of the efficacy of existing schemes and
their potential application to marihuana indicates it would be
successful. Such an assessment raises a number of disturbing
questions. </p>

<p>The regulatory approaches which this nation has used in the
cases of alcohol and tobacco have failed to accomplish two of
their most important objectives: the minimization of excessive
use and the limitation of accessibility to the young. Despite the
warning and restraints on distribution and consumption, more than
50 million Americans smoke cigarettes regularly, and more than
nine million Americans are &quot;problem&quot; drinkers. We have
previously cited data indicating how many of our children begin
habits which have been legally forbidden to them. Since the young
user and the chronic user of marihuana are of primary concern to
our public health officials, the lack of success with alcohol and
tobacco discourages an assumption that the regulation of supply
would minimize use by the younger generation. </p>

<p>Another important purpose of a regulatory scheme is to channel
the product through a controlled system of supply and
distribution. In that way the quality and quantity of the
substance can be regulated. The efficacy of such a scheme as
applied to marihuana is questionable. </p>

<p>Cannabis can be grown easily almost anywhere in the United
States with little or no human assistance. Even if a legitimate
source of supply were established, it is likely that many persons
would choose to ignore the legitimate source and grow their own,
the purity of which would not be in question. If such a practice
were illegal, the necessity for a concerted governmental
eradication program is raised, which would involve a monumental
law enforcement effort. According to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, there are presently an estimated five million acres
of wild marihuana growing in this country and an undetermined
number of acres under cultivation. </p>

<p>Yet, if such a practice were not forbidden, the
revenue-raising, product-control and consumption-restriction
features of a regulatory scheme would be threatened. Instructive
to note is the fact that intensive regulation of alcoholic
beverage production 'has not eliminated illicit production.
During 1970, in fact, 5,228 illegal stills were destroyed by the
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the U.S. Treasury and
5,279 persons were arrested. In 1971, 3,327 illegal stills were
destroyed and 5,512 persons were arrested. </p>

<p>Another disturbing question is raised by the issue of potency
regulation. Most advocates of legalization stipulate potency
limitations as one feature of their scheme. Presumably they would
limit the THC content of the regulated product. This is not an
easy undertaking. Especially when cannabis is so easily grown and
a black market is so easily created, we are dubious about the
success of a regulatory scheme distributing only a product with
low THC content. Again, attention must be paid the prospect of
increased hashish use under a regulatory scheme; merely
stipulating potency control is not sufficient. As we noted in
Chapter II, the heavy, long-term use of hashish is a source of
major concern to the Commission from both private and public
health standpoints. </p>

<p>These are a few of the problems confronting the policy-maker
if be seeks to devise an effective regulatory system of
distribution for what is, in fact, a universally common plant.
Our doubts about the efficacy of existing regulatory schemes,
together with an uncertainty about the permanence of social
interest in marihuana and the approval inevitably implied by
adoption of such a scheme, all impel us to reject the regulatory
approach as an appropriate implementation of a discouragement
policy at the present time. </p>

<p>Future policy planners might well come to a different
conclusion if further study of existing schemes suggests a
feasible model; if responsible use of the drug does indeed take
root in our society; if continuing scientific and medical
research uncovers no long-term ill effects; if potency control
appears feasible and if the passage of time and the adoption of a
rational social policy sufficiently desymbolizes marihuana so
that availability is not equated in the public mind with
approval. <br>
</p>

<p><b>PARTIAL PROHIBITION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The total prohibition scheme was rejected primarily because no
sufficiently compelling social reason, predicated on existing
knowledge, justifies intrusion by the criminal justice system
into the private lives of individuals who use marihuana. The
Commission is of the unanimous opinion that marihuana use is not
such a grave problem that individuals who smoke marihuana, and
possess it for that purpose, should be subject to criminal
procedures. On the other hand, we have also rejected the
regulatory or legalization scheme because it would
institutionalize availability of a drug which has uncertain
long-term effects and which may be of transient social interest. </p>

<p>Instead we recommend a partial prohibition scheme which we
feel has the following benefits: </p>

<p>Symbolizing a continuing societal discouragement of use; </p>

<p>Facilitating the deemphasis of marihuana essential to
answering dispassionately so many of the unanswered questions; </p>

<p>Permitting a simultaneous medical, educational, religious, and
parental effort to concentrate on reducing irresponsible use and
remedying its consequences; </p>

<p>Removing the criminal stigma and the threat of incarceration
from a widespread behavior (possession for personal use) which
does not warrant such treatment; </p>

<p>Relieving the law enforcement community of the responsibility
for enforcing a law of questionable utility, and one which they
cannot fully enforce, thereby allowing concentration on drug
trafficking and crimes against persons and property; </p>

<p>Relieving the judicial calendar of a large volume of marihuana
possession cases which delay the processing of more serious
cases; and </p>

<p>Maximizing the flexibility of future public responses as new
information comes to light.<br>
</p>

<p>No major change is required in existing law to achieve all of
these benefits. In general, we recommend only a decriminalization
of possession of marihuana for personal use on both the state and
federal levels. The major features of the recommended scheme are
that: production and distribution of the drug would remain
criminal activities as would possession with intent to distribute
commercially; marihuana would be contraband subject to
confiscation in public places; and criminal sanctions would be
withdrawn from private use and possession incident to such use,
but, at the state level, fines would be imposed for use in
public.* </p>

<p>Specifically, we recommend the following statutory schemes.<br>
</p>

<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FEDERAL LAW<br>
</b></p>

<p>Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act
of 1970, Congress provided the following scheme with respect to
marihuana, by which was meant only the natural plant and its
various parts, not the synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) : </p>

<ul>
    <li>Cultivation, importation and exportation, and sale or
        distribution for profit of marihuana are all felonies
        punishable by imprisonment for up to five years for a
        first offense and by up to 10 years for a second offense
        (the available penalty is doubled for sale to a minor). </li>
    <li>Possession of marihuana with intent to distribute is a
        felony punishable by imprisonment for up to five years
        for the first offense and by up to 10 years for a second
        offense. </li>
    <li>Possession of marihuana for personal use is a misdemeanor
        punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine
        for first offense and by up to two years in jail and a
        $2,000 fine for second offense (expungement of criminal
        record is available for first offenders). </li>
    <li>Transfer of a small amount of marihuana for no
        remuneration is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one
        year in jail and a $1,000 fine for first offense and by
        up to two years in jail and a $2,000 fine for second
        offense (Congress singled out marihuana in this way to
        allow misdemeanor treatment of casual transfers and
        permitted first offender treatment, as allowed for
        possession for personal use). </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission recommends only the following changes in
federal law:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>POSSESSION OF MARIHUANA FOR PERSONAL USE WOULD NO LONGER
        BE AN OFFENSE, BUT MARIHUANA POSSESSED IN PUBLIC WOULD
        REMAIN CONTRABAND SUBJECT TO SUMMARY SEIZURE AND
        FORFEITURE. </li>
    <li>CASUAL DISTRIBUTION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
        REMUNERATION, OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING
        PROFIT WOULD NO LONGER BE AN OFFENSE.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission further recommends that federal law be
supplemented to provide:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A PLEA OF MARIHUANA INTOXICATION SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE
        TO ANY CRIMINAL ACT COMMITTED UNDER ITS INFLUENCE, NOR
        SHALL PROOF OF SUCH INTOXICATION CONSTITUTE A NEGATION OF
        SPECIFIC INTENT. <br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>* Commissioners Rogers, Congressman from Florida, and Carter,
Congressman from Kentucky, agree with the Commission's selection
of a discouragement policy and also agree that criminalization
and incarceration of individuals for possessing marihuana for
their own use is neither necessary nor desirable as a means of
implementing that policy. </p>

<p>At the same time, both Commissioners feel that the contraband
concept is not a sufficiently strong expression of social
disapprobation and would recommend in addition a civil fine for
possession of any amount of marihuana in private or in public. </p>

<p>Both Commissioners feel that the civil fine clearly symbolizes
societal disapproval and is a simple mechanism for law
enforcement authorities to carry out. If a person is found by a
law enforcement officer to be in possession of marihuana, the
officer would issue such person a summons to appear in court on a
fixed day. Although a warrant would not issue for Research of a
private residence unless there were probable cause to believe a
criminal offense was being committed, a police officer
legitimately present for other reasons could issue a civil
summons for violation of the &quot;possession&quot; proscription.<br>
</p>

<p>Commissioners Rogers and Carter believe that the legal system
must be utilized directly to discourage the person from using
marihuana rather than being utilized only indirectly as In the
case of contraband. </p>

<p>This civil fine would not be reflected in a police record, nor
would it be considered a criminal act for purposes of future job
consideration, either in the private sector or for government
service. </p>

<p>Agreeing with the other Commissioners that the casual
transfers of marihuana for no profit should be treated in the
same manner as possession for one's own use, Congressmen Rogers
and Carter do not agree that it should extend to transfers
involving remuneration. They prefer the limiting language of the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 which
does not include the term &quot;or insignificant remuneration not
involving a profit.&quot; </p>

<p>Apart from the addition of the civil fine to the contraband
recommendation in the respects set out above, Congressmen Carter
and Rogers are in complete agreement with the statutory
recommendations set out in the Report. </p>

<p>Commissioner Ware concurs completely with the statements made
by Congressmen Rogers and Carter but wishes to reemphasize that
the social policy and legal scheme adopted is applicable only to
marihuana and should not be construed to embrace other
psychoactive drugs. The policy set forth in this Report, subject
to the already noted comments of the two Congressional
Commissioners, makes sense for marihuana on the basis of what is
known about the drug and in the absence of any conclusive showing
which would verify some of the anecdotal law enforcement
testimony heard by the Commission regarding criminal behavior
exhibited while under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Commissioner Ware feels that some penalty short of
criminalizing the user, such as a civil fine or some type of
intensive drug education, will act as a positive deterrent toward
minimizing the incidence of marihuana use especially among the
young. Further, he is opposed to the use of any drug for the
express purpose of getting intoxicated, and includes alcohol
within this category. The Commissioner feels that what is needed
is an internalizing of discipline among our citizenry, with the
legal system assisting this process through the use of
disincentives. </p>

<p>Commissioners Hughes, Senator from Iowa, and Javits, Senator
from New York, feel that the Commission has taken a major, highly
laudable step in recommending that the private use of marihuana
be taken out of the criminal justice system. They concur in its
threshold judgment that overall social policy regarding this drug
should seek to discourage use, while concentrating primarily on
the prevention of irresponsible use. They disagree, however, with
three specific recommendations relating to the implementation of
this discouragement policy. </p>

<p>First, they would eliminate entirely the contraband provision
from the partial prohibitory model adopted by the Commission.
They want it eliminated first because its legal implications are
confusing and the subject of disagreement even among lawyers.
Whether or not possession of a given substance is criminal,
possession of material designated as contraband makes that
possession unlawful. Also, marihuana designated as contraband
would be subject to government search and seizure, even though
the underlying possession is no longer criminal. The
provision-which does not apply to marihuana held for personal use
within the home is considered by both Commissioners to be an
unnecessary &quot;symbol&quot; of the discouragement policy. It
will not foster elimination of the misunderstanding and mistrust
which is a hallmark of our current marihuana policy. </p>

<p>Commissioner Hughes and Javits seek to eliminate it also
because as a practical matter it serves no useful law enforcement
purpose within the overall partial prohibitory model. If
marihuana held for personal use within the home is not
contraband, why should marihauna held for personal use within
one's automobile be contraband? The area of operation of the
contraband provision is extremely narrow. If one possesses more
than one ounce of marihuana in public, it may be seized without
regard to the contraband doctrine since such possession is a
criminal violation. </p>

<p>Since the contraband provision does not apply to marihuana
possession and use in private, the only effective area covered by
the contraband provision is the area of possession in public of
less than one ounce. The Commission has chosen to remove the
stigma of the criminal sanction in this kind of case. To impose
instead a contraband provision, which it is argued is in the
nature of a civil &quot;in rem&quot; seizure which does not
operate against the person, is to cloud the issue and to weaken
the force of the basic decriminalization. A persuasive
justification simply has not been made. </p>

<p>Both Commissioners seek to eliminate it also because they
believe that the voice of the Commission should be loud and clear
that the preservation of the right of privacy is of paramount
importance and cannot be casually jeopardized in the pursuit of
some vague public or law enforcement interest which has not been
defined and justified with clarity and precision. </p>

<p>The second area of disagreement with the Commission's
recommendations concerns the casual distribution of marihuana and
the not-for-profit sale. As understood:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) The totally donative transfer is not subject to criminal
penalty, regardless of where it takes place. </p>

<p>(2) The transfer of small amounts for insignificant
remuneration not involving a profit is not subject to criminal
penalty (except if it is accomplished in public, in which case it
is subject to criminal sanction), but (3) The transfer of
&quot;large amounts&quot; for &quot;significant&quot;
remuneration not involving a profit is subject to criminal
penalty. </p>

<p>Footnote 4 on page 158 of the Report, the Commission refers to
a Report of The Senate Judiciary Committee on the Comprehensive
Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. In substance, it
implies that within the meaning of the Act, transfers of -more
than one or two marihuana cigarettes in return for 50 cents or
one dollar to cover cost are not intended to be covered as casual
transfers, but rather are to be treated as unlawful sales. </p>

<p>Commissioners Hughes and Javits feel that the Commission has
failed to set forth a clear standard which will adequately inform
the public of their obligations under the law. The recommendation
and its discussion in the Report are confusing and fail to
provide the individual with sufficient guidance to allow him to
act without having to dodge in and out of illegality. It also
undermines a basic, stated objective of the Commission i.e., to
concentrate the weight of the criminal sanction upon significant
supply and distribution activities, rather than upon casual
consumption. </p>

<p>Moreover, proscribing even the most casual not-for-profit
transfers when they occur in public is, in their opinion, wrong.
Such transfers are necessarily incident to private possession and
use. To hold that they should be subject to criminal sanction is
logically inconsistent with the Commission's rationale and
recommendation on decriminalization of such private activities. </p>

<p>Instead, both Commissioners recommend that all not-for-profit
sales be excluded from the criminal sanction. It Is fundamental
that there be a clear separation between the serious, commercial,
profit-making-seller, or &quot;pusher&quot; as he is known, and
the individual who merely splits the cost of a reasonable supply
of the drug with his friends or acquaintances. </p>

<p>Thirdly, exception is taken to the retention of the criminal
sanction on public possession of more than one ounce. The
individual who buys an ounce and a half would be a criminal when
he buys on the corner, when he puts it in his pocket, when he
gets in his car and drives home, when he is on his doorstep, but
not when he crosses the threshold of his home. Commission policy
should direct the attention of the law enforcement community to
the person who sells the drug for profit, and not to the person
who uses the drug privately. </p>

<p>If an individual has more than a few ounces in his possession,
and there is probable cause to believe that he intends to sell it
for profit, that activity is already covered under the
Commission's recommendation that possession with intent to sell
is illegal. Therefore, there is no need to further proscribe
simple public possession. </p>

<p>All the component parts of the recommended policy of the
Commission should be consistent with its objective of
non-interference with casual transfers and possession and use
which is essentially and fundamentally private and personal. </p>

<p>The contraband device, the not-for-profit sale, and public
possession of some reasonable amount which should be presumed to
be necessarily incident to private use should all be removed from
the ambit of legal sanction. To do so would be to strike down
&quot;symbols&quot; of a public policy which had never been
adequately justified in the first instance. Such steps would in
no way jeopardize the firm determination of the Commission that
the use of marihuana ought to be discouraged. <br>
<br>
</p>

<p><a name="Lastedit"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STATE LAW<br>
</b></a></p>

<p>Under existing state marihuana laws, cultivation distribution
and possession with intent to distribute are generally felonies
and in most states possession for personal use is a misdemeanor.
The Commission strongly recommends uniformity of state laws and,
in this regard, endorses the basic premise of the Uniform
Controlled Substances Act drafted by the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. The following are our
recommendations for a uniform statutory scheme for marihuana, by
which we mean, as under existing federal law, only the natural
cannabis plant and its various parts, not the synthetic
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) <br>
</p>

<p><b>Existing Law<br>
</b></p>

<p>CULTIVATION, SALE OR DISTRIBUTION FOR PROFIT AND POSSESSION
WITH INTENT TO SELL WOULD REMAIN FELONIES (ALTHOUGH WE DO
RECOMMEND UNIFORM PENALTIES).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Private Activities<br>
</b></p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PRIVATE OF MARIHUANA FOR PERSONAL USE WOULD NO
LONGER BE AN OFFENSE. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION IN PRIVATE OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
REMUNERATION OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING A PROFIT
WOULD NO LONGER BE AN OFFENSE. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Public Activities<br>
</b></p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PUBLIC OF ONE OUNCE OR UNDER OF MARIHUANA WOULD
NOT BE AN OFFENSE, BUT THE MARIHUANA WOULD BE CONTRABAND SUBJECT
TO SUMMARY SEIZURE AND FORFEITURE. </p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PUBLIC OF MORE THAN ONE OUNCE OF MARIHUANA WOULD
BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION IN PUBLIC OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
REMUNERATION OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING A PROFIT
WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>PUBLIC USE OF MARIHUANA WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE
BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>DISORDERLY CONDUCT ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC USE OF OR
INTOXICATION BY MARIHUANA WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP
TO 60 DAYS IN JAIL, A FINE OF $100, OR BOTH. <br>
</p>

<p>OPERATING A VEHICLE OR DANGEROUS INSTRUMENT WHILE UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF MARIHUANA WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP TO
ONE YEAR IN JAIL, A FINE OF UP TO $1,000, OR BOTH, AND SUSPENSION
OF A PERMIT TO OPERATE SUCH A VEHICLE OR INSTRUMENT FOR UP TO 180
DAYS. </p>

<p>A PLEA OF MARIHUANA INTOXICATION SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE TO ANY
CRIMINAL ACT COMMITTED UNDER ITS INFLUENCE NOR SHALL PROOF OF
SUCH INTOXICATION CONSTITUTE A NEGATION OF SPECIFIC INTENT. </p>

<p>A PERSON WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY LIABLE IN CIVIL COURT FOR ANY
DAMAGE TO PERSON OR PROPERTY WHICH HE CAUSED WHILE UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The recommended federal approach is really a restatement of
existing federal policy. From official testimony and record
evaluation, we know that the federal law enforcement authorities,
principally the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
and the Bureau of Customs, do not concentrate their efforts on
personal possession cases. The avowed purpose of both Bureaus is
to eliminate major traffickers and sources of supply. For the
most part, the federal agencies have left possession enforcement
to the states. Underlying this approach is a need -to maximize
the use of enforcement resources for major priorities and allow
the states, in exercising their &quot;police powers,&quot; to
assume the responsibility for local activities, including
possession for personal use. </p>

<p>By withdrawing the criminal sanction from possession for
personal use we are, in effect, codifying official policy. In
addition, such a scheme follows the model chosen for alcohol in
the Volstead Act, and also revives the approach taken by Congress
in the Drug Abuse Control Amendments (DACA) of 1965. We are in
agreement with the original thrust of DACA, when Congress brought
previously uncontrolled drugs, LSD, barbiturates and
amphetamines, under control but did not assess criminal penalties
for possession for personal use. </p>

<p>Instead, Congress placed on the prosecution the burden of
proof that the possession was for purposes of sale. Regardless of
whether or not Congress was wise in imposing a penalty in 1968
for possession for personal use, a subject we will consider in
our next Report, we think the original DACA concept is
enlightened where marihuana is concerned. </p>

<p>At the same time, present federal law classifies marihuana as
contraband, and this feature should be maintained. The contraband
concept serves the discouragement policy in two ways: it assists
the removal of supply from the market and it symbolizes a
continuing societal opposition to use. Accordingly, if a person
is found in possession of marihuana in public and the government
is unable to prove any intent to sell, it may nevertheless seize
the marihuana and confiscate it is contraband. </p>

<p>The contraband provision would apply only to possession in
public and would not extend to possession for personal use in the
home. During Prohibition, the Federal Government and most of the
states employed a similar statutory limitation. For example, the
Volstead Act provided that a private dwelling could not be
searched &quot;unless it is being used for the unlawful sale of
intoxicating liquor. . . .&quot; I The impact of this contraband
concept is that marihuana possessed or found in public can be
summarily seized by law enforcement officials and forfeited to
the state for subsequent destruction .2 The criminal justice
system is not involved in the process. The individual receives no
record of any kind; he simply loses the economic value of the
marihuana.3 </p>

<p>With regard to the casual distribution of small amounts of
Marihuana for no remuneration or insignificant remuneration not
involving a profit we are following the approach taken in the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 which
in essence treats such casual transfers as the functional
equivalent of possession. In doing so, Congress recognized that
marihuana is generally shared among friends and that not all
people who distribute marihuana are &quot;Pushers.&quot;* </p>

<p>' 39. Unlawful P0ssession of liquor or property designed for
manufacture thereof ; search warrants. It shall be unlawful to
have or possess any liquor or property designed for the
manufacture of liquor intended for use in violating this chapter
or which has been so used, and no property rights shall exist in
any such liquor or property. A search warrant may issue as
provided in [sections 611 to 631 and 633 of Title 181 and such
liquor, the containers thereof, and such property so seized shall
be subject to such disposition as the court may make thereof. if
it is found that such liquor or property was so unlawfully held
or possessed, or had been so unlawfully used, the liquor, and all
property designed for the unlawful manufacture of liquor, shall
be destroyed, unless the court shall otherwise order. No search
warrant shall issue to search any private dwelling occupied as
such unless it is being used for unlawful sale of intoxicating
liquor, or unless it is in part used for some business purpose
such as a store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boarding
'house. 'Me term &quot;private dwelling&quot; shall be construed
to include the room or rooms used and occupied not transiently
but solely as a residence in an apartment house, hotel or
boarding house. The property seized on any such warrant shall not
lie taken from the officer seizing the same on any writ of
replevin or other like process. (Oct. 28, 1919, e. 85, Title 11,
 25, 41 Stat. 315) </p>

<p>'The federal and state provisions presently in force regarding
the seizure and forfeiture of an automobile transporting
marihuana would no longer be applicable. They would still remain
in force for other controlled drugs classified as contraband. </p>

<p>3 See the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter, Ware, Hughes
and Javits expressed in the footnote on pages 151-156.<br>
<br>
The accuracy of Congress' appraisal is underscored by the
National Survey. When people who had used marihuana were asked
how they first obtained the drug, 61% of the adults and 76% of
the youth responded that it had been given to them. Only 4% of
the adults and 8% of the youth said that they had bought it. When
asked who their source had been, 67% of the adults and 85% of the
youth responded that it had been a friend, acquaintance or family
member. </p>

<p>The close association between the concepts of casual transfer
and personal possession is also underscored by the fact that 56%
of the prosecutors in our survey thought that the present law did
not deter casual transfer at all or deterred it only minimally. </p>

<p>With regard to importation and exportation, we recommend no
change in existing law and make the following observations.
First, the United States must maintain its international standing
and, as a member of the community of nations, this country should
do everything in its power to restrict the exportation of
marihuana to other countries and to penalize such international
traffic. </p>

<p>As to importation of marihuana, the most effective way to
discourage use is to cut off supply at the top of the pyramid.
Recognizing that most of the marihuana consumed in the United
States comes from abroad, we feel that the Bureau of Customs at
the borders should have all necessary authority to halt and
interdict supplies intended for consumption in this country.
There has been a long-standing practice of excepting ports and
borders from procedural rules applying within the United States.
One example is that Customs officials are allowed to search
without the showing of probable cause, even though such a showing
is mandatory for searches conducted within the United States. We
can see a legitimate reason for continuing this policy. <br>
</p>

<p>*In considering this relationship, the Senate, in the Report
of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate
regarding S. 3246 (a precursor bill to the new Federal law)
stated:<br>
</p>

<p>The language &quot;distributes a small amount of marihuana for
no remuneration or insignificant remuneration not involving a
profit&quot; as contained in section 501 (c) (4) is intended to
cover the type of situation where a college student makes a
quasi-donative transfer of one or two marihuana cigarettes and
receives 50 cents or a dollar in exchange to cover the cost of
the marihuana. </p>

<p>Transfers of larger quantities in exchange for larger amounts
of money, or transfers for profit, are not intended to be covered
by this section, but rather are to be covered by section 501 (c)
(2) which deals 'with unlawful distribution. This language
sketches a prototype situation which the Committee had in mind;
however, the wording of the Federal Act and of our
recommendations is not intended to establish inflexible rules.
The objective in both provisions is to distinguish between
commercial sellers and casual distributors. Ultimately the courts
will have the responsibility of drawing this distinction
according to the evidence in individual cases. The recommended
provision intentionally establishes a loose standard not tied to
specific amounts of marihuana or money.<br>
</p>

<p>See also the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter, Ware,
Hughes and Javits expressed in the footnote on pages 151-156.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF STATE RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The states have primary responsibility for enforcing the
existing proscriptions against possession for personal use. Their
present efforts are designed mainly to keep marihuana use
contained, and in private. Such an enforcement policy is
consistent with our social policy approach, and is an appropriate
exercise of the states' obligations to maintain public order. So
while we see no need for criminal sanctions against possession
for personal use or against casual transfers, we recommend a
number of provisions for confining marihuana use to the home. </p>

<p>The first point is that even marihuana possessed for personal
use is subject to summary seizure and forfeiture if it is found
in public. This concept is now applicable under federal law which
we commend also to the states. In our view, the contraband
feature symbolizes the discouragement policy and will exert a,
major force in keeping use private. </p>

<p>Another means of symbolizing the discouragement policy which
has been suggested is the imposition of a civil fine on those
possessing marihuana outside the home for personal use.* Under
such an approach, a fine would be levied and processed outside
the criminal justice system. Essentially, possession of marihuana
would be the equivalent of a traffic offense in those
jurisdictions where such an offense is not criminal. </p>

<p>Such a scheme would accomplish little more than that achieved
under a partial prohibition scheme. Warrants would presumably not
be issued for searches of private residences, and possession
offenses would be detected only by accident or if the offender
uses the drug in public. The more direct way to confront such
behavior is a penalty against public use. </p>

<p>A further problem with the civil fine approach lies in the
area, of non-payment of the fine. With traffic tickets, or with
civil fines levied against industrial polluters, society can
compel compliance by withdrawing its permission to engage in
regulated activity. For example, it can revoke the motorists'
license to drive or the polluters' license to do business within
the state. In short, the state has remedies beyond the criminal
law to achieve its policy goal. The same would not be true for
the marihuana user and enforceability of the statute would
ultimately require court action.<br>
</p>

<p>*See the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter and Ware
expressed in the footnote on pages 151-153. <br>
</p>

<p>As we have suggested, a central feature, of our statutory
approach at the state, level would be a vigorously enforced
prohibition of public use. No intoxicant should be used in
public, both because it may offend others and because the user is
risking irresponsible behavior if he should be under its
influence in public. Moreover, where marihuana is concerned,
continuing societal disapproval requires that the behavior occur
only in private if at all. Public use, under the proposed scheme,
would therefore be punishable by a fine of $100. </p>

<p>We also recognize the need for some prophylactic measure for
anticipating distribution, even though there may be no intent to
sell for profit. To this end, and in order to deter public use,
possession and transfer, we have drawn a line at one ounce of
marihuana. Possession in public of more than this amount would be
punishable by a fine of $100. </p>

<p>For these same reasons, we believe the states should prohibit
all transfers outside the home, whether or not for remuneration.
A transfer for profit would be a felony, as under present law. A
casual transfer of a small amount would be punishable by a fine
of $100. </p>

<p>Taken together, the contraband feature, the proscriptions of
public use and public possession of more than an ounce (even if
for personal use) and the prohibition of public transfers will
reflect the discouragement policy underlying the entire, scheme. </p>

<p>The remaining set of recommendations alms at irresponsible
behavior under the influence of marihuana. Whatever the precise
legal scheme employed, these provisions should be included. </p>

<p>First, the &quot;drunk and disorderly&quot; statutes presently
in force in the states are useful tools for maintaining public
order. We would suggest similar statutes in the case of
marihuana, punishing offenders by up to 60 days in jail, a fine
of $100, or both. Law enforcement authorities must have a means
to halt antisocial behavior exhibited incidental to marihuana
use. </p>

<p>The second aspect of irresponsible behavior is the operation
of automobiles, other vehicles, or any potentially dangerous
instrument while under the influence of marihuana. Such behavior
is gross negligence in itself, risking harm to others
unnecessarily. In addition to penalizing a person who
&quot;drives under the influence&quot; as a serious misdemeanant,
we would impose absolute civil liability on anyone who harms the
person or property of another while under the influence of
marihuana. </p>

<p>Finally, no one should be able to limit his criminal
accountability by alleging that he was under the influence of
marihuana at the time of the crime. Under both federal and state
law, the defendant should not be able to negate the mental
element of &quot;specific intent,&quot; which some offenses
carry, by pleading that he was under the influence of marihuana
and was therefore unable to have formed such an intent. Unlike
many users of heroin, the user of marihuana is not physically
dependent on the drug. The use of the drug is usually a matter of
choice. Although we believe on the basis of available evidence
that there is no causal connection between marihauna use and
crime, we would under no circumstances allow a person to escape
the consequences of his actions by hiding behind the cloak of
marihuana use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Having discussed our recommended scheme at the federal and
state levels, we think it useful to answer some objections we
anticipate will be raised. Possible objections are:<br>
</p>

<p>1. Partial prohibition is not a sufficient reflection of the
discouragement policy. </p>

<p>2. Partial prohibition is logically inconsistent. </p>

<p>3. A possession penalty is necessary for effective enforcement
of sale proscriptions. </p>

<p>4. Partial prohibition won't &quot;work&quot; for marihuana
any more than it did for alcohol. </p>

<p>5. A possession offense is essential as a device for detecting
problem users. </p>

<p>6. Retention of a possession offense is required by our
international obligations. </p>

<p>7. A firm distinction should be drawn between less potent and
more potent preparations. <br>
</p>

<p><b>1. The Partial Prohibition Approach Is a Sufficient
Reflection of the Discouragement Policy<br>
</b></p>

<p>To those who would argue that a criminal sanction against use
is a necessary implementation of an abstentionist policy, we need
only respond that this country has not generally operated on that
assumption. We would be astounded if any person who lived during
the 1920's was not aware of a definite governmental policy
opposed to the use of alcohol. Yet, only five states prohibited
possession for personal use during Prohibition. The failure of
the 18th Amendment, the Volstead Act and 43 state prohibition
acts to criminalize private possession certainly did not signify
official approval of or neutrality toward alcohol use. </p>

<p>As we pointed out in Chapter 1, our nation has not generally
seen fit to criminalize private drug-related behavior; only in
the narcotics area was possession made a crime and marihuana was
brought within the narcotics framework because of unfounded
assumptions about its ill effects. We think it is time to correct
that mistaken departure from tradition with respect to marihuana.
As during Prohibition, the drug will remain contraband, and its
distribution will be prohibited.<br>
</p>

<p>Even as late as 1965, an abstentionist drug policy was not
thought to require prohibition for personal use. At that time,
Congress enacted the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, bringing LSD,
amphetamines and barbiturates under federal control. National
policy was clearly opposed to use of the hallucinogens and the
non-prescription use of amphetamines and barbiturates, yet
Congress did not impose a penalty for possession. Whether or not
Congress' subsequent decision in 1968, to impose such a penalty
was appropriate is an issue we will cover in our next Report
after analyzing the individual drugs controlled. The important
point now is that such a penalty is not a necessary feature of a
discouragement policy for marihuana, regardless of its, propriety
for other drugs.<br>
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>The Partial Prohibition Approach Is Not Logically
        Inconsistent </b></li>
</ol>

<p>It will. be, argued that a law which permits a person to
acquire and use marihuana but does not permit anyone to sell it
to him for profit is logically unsound. We do not agree. If we
had recommended a social policy of approval or neutrality toward
use, partial prohibition would indeed have been illogical.
However, under a discouragement policy, such a, scheme is
perfectly consistent. </p>

<p>Under partial prohibition, use is discouraged in three main
ways. First, law enforcement authorities will make a concerted
effort to reduce the supply of the drug. If a person wishes to
use marihuana, he will have to seek out a person to sell it to
him; and if his seller is in the business of distributing
marihuana for profit, the seller is violating the law. </p>

<p>Second, the user will have to confine his disapproved behavior
to the home. If lie uses the drug in public, he has committed an
offense; if lie possesses it in public, it may be summarily
seized as contraband. </p>

<p>Third, continuing efforts will be made by educators, public
health officials, and official government spokesmen to discourage
use. Realizing that educational efforts are not always
successful, we would hope for a sound program. In any event, the
law should be an ancillary rather than a focal consideration. </p>

<p>There is nothing theoretically Inconsistent about a scheme
which merely withdraws the criminal sanction from a behavior
which is not immoral but which is disapproved. The individual is
being allowed to make his own choice. Hopefully, he will choose
not to use marihuana. If he chooses to do so, however, he will
have to do so discreetly and in private. Apart from its ultimate
possession by the user, however, all marihuana-related activity
is prohibited. The drug is contraband from its initial growth,
through its harvest and distribution. It ceases to be contraband
only when possessed and used in the home.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Prohibition of All Possession Is Not Essential to
Prohibition of Sale<br>
</b></p>

<p>The other side of the &quot;inconsistency&quot; objection is
the argument by law enforcement officials that they cannot
adequately enforce proscriptions against sale without a
possession penalty. We disagree. We have already explained that
enforcement of a possession offense to some extent impedes the
effort to reduce supply. Possession cases are generally regarded
in the law enforcement community and by judges and prosecutors as
&quot;cheap&quot; cases. Few seriously contend that prosecution
of possessors reduces supply. </p>

<p>Some persons argue in response that the law should remain on
the books as a tool not against the possessor but against the
seller. They say that a possession offense is helpful in three
ways. First, a prosecution can be used as a bargaining tool to
encourage the possessor to reveal his source; this is called
&quot;turning an informant.&quot; Second, the police may know
that a person is a seller, but may not be able to prove either
sale or intent to sell, so they can at least charge such
suspected sellers with simple possession. </p>

<p>Third, a corollary of the second argument is that the
possession offense provides a useful tool in the &quot;plea
bargaining&quot; process. That is, a seller may plead guilty to
the lesser offense of possession, now generally a misdemeanor,
instead of running the risk of trial and conviction of the more
serious offense of sale, generally a felony. The prosecution may
accept such a &quot;bargain' if it is uncertain of the strength
of the case, to avoid delay in sentencing, to reduce judicial
backlog or in return for information from the defendant. </p>

<p>From an institutional standpoint, we do not find these
arguments persuasive. First, if a possession offense is on the
books, possession is a criminal activity. We oppose criminalizing
conduct when its purpose and intent is directed not toward that
conduct but toward another behavior. </p>

<p>In answer to the informant argument, the marihuana user (and
this may not be true of other drugs) is simply too low in the
distributional chain to help very much. As indicated earlier, the
National Survey shows most users receive their marihuana from
their friends or acquaintances either as a gift or at cost.
Rarely is the time spent on him or on his &quot;source&quot; a
fruitful allocation of the law enforcement official's time. Also,
it is institutionally improper to hold the criminal sanction over
a person to force him to talk, when we otherwise would be
unwilling to use that sanction. </p>

<p>As to the &quot;lack of proof&quot; and &quot;plea
bargaining&quot; arguments, we believe they challenge a
fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system. That is, under
our law, a person is not guilty just because the police think he
is guilty; his offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
to a judge or jury. If a possession offense were not on the
books, the police would have to gather enough evidence to convict
the seller of sale or of possession with intent to sell, and the
prosecution would have to convince the judge beyond a reasonable
doubt. The defendant, suspected seller or not, is entitled to due
process of law. </p>

<p>The &quot;lack of proof&quot; argument is nothing more than a
plea for an &quot;easy out&quot; when the police do not have
enough evidence. This simply represents an admission that law
enforcement officials want a possession offense which they can
apply selectively, to people whom they think, but cannot prove,
are sellers. Such a notion is inconsistent with the basic premise
of our system of equal treatment under the law. If
&quot;simple&quot; possession is not an offense for some, it is
not an offense for all. A &quot;known seller&quot; is entitled to
the same rights as anyone else: criminal conduct must be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not favor coddling criminals. We
do insist, as did the framers of the Constitution, that suspected
criminal behavior be proved.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. That Partial Prohibition Did Not &quot;Work&quot; For
Alcohol Doesn't Mean It Won't For Marihuana<br>
</b></p>

<p>Prohibition failed to achieve its avowed purpose of
eliminating the use of intoxicating liquors from American life.
Risking an oversimplification, we think two reasons were
essentially responsible for this failure: the unwillingness of a
substantial minority, and probably a majority, of the American
public to discard a habit deeply ingrained in their lives; and
the inability of the law enforcement community to eliminate the
bootlegging traffic which catered to this continuing demand. </p>

<p>As we have repeatedly noted, one of the reasons for adoption
of a partial prohibition approach is uncertainty about the extent
to which marihuana use is ingrained in American culture. Indeed,
adoption of partial prohibition is the best way to find out for
sure. If the social interest turns out to be only transient, this
policy will prove particularly appropriate. </p>

<p>Similarly, an increase in marihuana use may be prevented by a
concerted effort to eliminate major trafficking, the scope of
which is presently only a small fraction of Prohibition
bootlegging. We do not pretend that supply of a plant so easily
grown can be eliminated. However, an intensive effort to
eliminate commercial criminal enterprise should have some impact
on the extent of use. <br>
</p>

<p><b>5. The Possession Offense Is Not Required as a Detection
Device <br>
</b></p>

<p>In addition to their deterrent and symbolic functions, the
drug possession laws serve a third function not shared by most
other criminal laws. Like laws against public drunkenness, they
facilitate societal detection of drug-dependent persons. Ideally,
such persons, although apprehended by law enforcement
authorities, may be detained for purposes of treatment and
rehabilitation. </p>

<p>Whatever the merits of such an argument for the opiates and
alcohol, such an argument does not apply to marihuana. Only a
very small percentage of marihuana users are drug-dependent or
are in need of treatment. Their dependence is generally upon
multiple drug use, not on marihuana. In any event, the existence
of such a small population does not justify retention of the
possession offense as a detection device.<br>
</p>

<p><b>6. International Obligations Do Not Require Maintenance of
a Possession Penalty<br>
</b></p>

<p>Some have raised the possibility that removal of simple
possession criminal penalties would contravene this country's
obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961),
to which it became a signatory in March, 1967. We do not believe
the provisions of that Convention compel the criminalization of
possession for personal use. </p>

<p>Nowhere in the Convention are its Parties expressly required
to impose criminal sanctions on possession for personal use.
Article 4 requires Parties to &quot;take such legislative and
administrative measures as may be necessary . . . . to limit
exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production,
manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and
possession of drugs.&quot; Penal sanctions are not necessarily
included in this formulation. </p>

<p>Article 36, which deals specifically with penal provisions,
requires each party to adopt &quot;such measures as will
ensure&quot; that the listed activities, including possession,
&quot;shall be punishable offenses.&quot; Some have argued that
this provision requires prohibition of personal use. </p>

<p>However, from a comprehensive study of the history of the
Convention, the Commission has concluded that the word
&quot;possession&quot; in Article 36 refers not to possession for
personal use, but to possession as a link in illicit trafficking.
This interpretation is bolstered also by the failure to include
&quot;use&quot; in Article 36 even though it has been included in
Article 4. </p>

<p>Finally, we must consider Article 33, which provides that
&quot;the Parties shall not permit the possession of drugs except
under legal authority.&quot; This Article also does not require
the imposition of any sanctions on possession for personal use.
Experts consulted by the Commission have indicated that this
Article may, nevertheless, require that the Parties to limit
possession and use to medical and scientific purposes. To
affirmatively allow drugs to remain in the possession of persons
for non-medical use would in this view contravene Articles 4 and
33 to read together. From this perspective our international
obligations may require the classification of marihuana, as
contraband. For this reason, together with a desire to symbolize
our discouragement policy in a clear way, we have included the
contraband feature in our legal implementation scheme. </p>

<p>In conclusion, our reading of the Convention is that a Party
may legitimately decide to deal with non-medical use and
possession of marihuana through an educational program and
similar approaches designed to discourage use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>7. No Potency Distinction is Necessary at the Present Time</b>
</p>

<p>Following the approach taken in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970, we have drawn a line between
the natural cannabis plant and the synthetic
tetrahydrocannabinols. &quot;Marihuana&quot; is defined as any
and all parts of the natural plant. That we choose this approach
for purposes of statutory implementation does not mean that we
are unaware of the difference between the less potent and more
potent preparations of the natural plant. </p>

<p>As noted in Chapters 11 and III, the highest risk of cannabis
use to the individual and society arises from the very long-term,
very heavy use of potent preparations commonly called hashish. No
such pattern of use is known to exist in the United States today.
</p>

<p>The predominant pattern of use in the United States is
experimental or intermittent use of less potent preparations of
the drug. Even when hashish is used, the predominant pattern
remains the same. In addition, whatever the potency of the drug
used, individuals tend to smoke only the amount necessary to
achieve the desired drug effect. </p>

<p>Given the prevailing patterns of use, the Commission does not
believe it is essential to distinguish by statute between less
potent and more potent forms of the natural plant. Reinforcing
this judgment are the procedural and practical problems attending
an effort to do so. </p>

<p>If the criminal liability of ail individual user is dependent
on the THC content of the substance, neither lie nor the
arresting officer will know whether he has committed a crime
until an accurate scientific determination is made. Even if such
accurate determinations were feasible on a large scale, which is
not now the case, such after-the-fact liability is foreign to our
criminal laws. </p>

<p>Under present circumstances, then, a statutory line based on
potency is neither necessary nor feasible. We emphasize also that
any legal distinction is an artificial reflection of the
Commission's major concern: the heavy use of the drug over a long
term. The most emphatic element of official policy should be to
discourage such use, especially of the more potent preparations.
Unfortunately precise legislative formulations regarding the
amount of the drug presumed to be for personal use do not assist
this effort at all. Whether it is lawful to possess one ounce of
hashish or a proportionate amount based on potency (for example,
one-fourth ounce), an individual prone to use the drug heavily
will do so. Society's resources should be committed to the task
of reducing supply of the drug and persuading our citizens not to
use it. Expenditure of police time and financial resources in an
attempt to ascertain the THC content of every seized substance
would make little, if any, contribution to this effort.<br>
</p>

<p><b><u>A Final Comment<br>
</u></b></p>

<p>In this Chapter, we have carefully considered the spectrum of
social and legal policy alternatives. On the basis of our
findings, discussed in previous Chapters, we have concluded that
society should seek to discourage use, while concentrating its
attention on the prevention and treatment of heavy and very heavy
use. The Commission feels that the criminalization of possession
of marihuana for personal is socially self-defeating as a means
of achieving this objective. We have attempted to balance
individual freedom on one hand and the obligation of the state to
consider the wider social good on the other. We believe our
recommended scheme will permit society to exercise its control
and influence in ways most useful and efficient, meanwhile
reserving to the individual American his sense of privacy, his
sense of individuality, and, within the context of ail
interacting and interdependent society, his options to select his
own life style, values, goals and opportunities. </p>

<p>The Commission sincerely hopes that the tone of cautious
restraint sounded in this Report will be perpetuated in the
debate which will follow it. For those who feel we have not
proceeded far enough, we are reminded of Thomas Jefferson's
advice to George Washington that &quot;Delay is preferable to
error.&quot; For those who argue we have gone too far, we note
Roscoe Pound's statement, &quot;The law must be stable, but it
must not stand still.&quot; </p>

<p>We have carefully analyzed the interrelationship between
marihuana the drug, marihuana use as a behavior, and marihuana as
a social problem. Recognizing the extensive degree of
misinformation about marihuana as a drug, we have tried to
demythologize it. Viewing the use of marihuana in its wider
social context, we have tried to desymbolize it. </p>

<p>Considering the range of social concerns in contemporary
America, marihuana does not, in our considered judgment, rank
very high. We would deemphasize marihuana as a problem. </p>

<p>The existing social and legal policy is out of proportion to
the individual and social harm engendered by the use of the drug.
To replace it, we have attempted to design a suitable social
policy, which we believe is fair, cautious and attuned to the
social realities of our time.<br>

Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Chapter V </h1>

<h1>marihuana and social policy </h1>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The difficulty in life is the choice.&quot; </p>

<p>George Moore (1900) </p>

<p>A constant tension exists in our society between individual
liberties and the need for reasonable societal restraints. It is
easy to go too far in either direction, and this tendency is
particularly evident where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>We have guided our decision-making by the belief that the
state is obliged to justify restraints on individual behavior.
Too often individual freedoms are submerged in the passions of
the moment, and when that happens, the public policy may be
determined more by rhetoric than by reason. Our effort has been
to minimize the emotional and emphasize the rational in this
Report. </p>

<p><b>Drugs In a Free Society</b> </p>

<p>A free society seeks to provide conditions in which each of
its members may develop his or her potentialities to the fullest
extent. A premium is placed on individual choice in seeking
self-fulfillment. This priority depends upon the capacity of free
citizens not to abuse their freedom, and upon their willingness
to act responsibly toward others and toward the society as a
whole. Responsible behavior, through individual choice, is both
the guarantor and the objective of a free society. <br>
</p>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>The use of drugs is not in itself an irresponsible act.
Medical and scientific uses serve important individual and social
needs and are often essential to our physical and mental
well-being. Further, the use of drugs for pleasure or other
non-medical purposes is not inherently irresponsible; alcohol is
widely used as an acceptable part of social activities. </p>

<p>We do think the use of drugs is clearly irresponsible when it
impedes the individual's integration into the economic and social
system. A preference for individual productivity and contribution
to social progress in a general sense still undergirds the
American value structure, and we emphasize the policy-maker's
duty to support this preference in a public policy judgment. </p>

<p>At the same time, in light of the emerging leisure ethic and
the search for individual meaning and fulfillment noted in
Chapter 1, we cannot divorce social policy from the questions
raised by the recreational use of drugs. Productivity and
recreation both have a place in the American ethical system. They
are not inconsistent unless the individual's use of leisure time
inhibits his productive role in society. </p>

<p>Drugs should be servants, not masters. They become masters
when they dominate an individual's existence or impair his
faculties. To the extent that any drug, including alcohol,
carries with it risks to the well-being of the user and seriously
undermines his effectiveness in the society, that drug becomes a
matter of concern for public policy. </p>

<p>An essential step in the process of policy-formation is a
determination of the circumstances under which use of any given
drug' poses such risks. For some drugs, the risks may be so great
that all permissible measures should be taken to eliminate use.
For other drugs, such risks may be present only under certain
specific circumstances, in which case society may defer to
responsible individual choice on the matter of recreational use
but take appropriate steps to minimize the incidence and
consequences of dysfunctional use. In our Report next year, for
which studies are already underway, we will consider from this
perspective the whole range of drugs now used for non-medical
purposes. </p>

<p> <b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Chapter V </h1>

<h1>marihuana and social policy </h1>

<p> <b>A Social Control Policy for Marihuana<br>
</b> </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
A Social Control Policy for Marihuana </h3>

<p> In formulating a Marihuana policy, our strongest concern is
with irresponsible use, whether it be too often, too much,
indiscriminate, or under improper circumstances. The excessive or
indiscriminate use of any drug is a serious social concern; and
this is particularly true of marihuana since we still know very
little about the effects of long term, heavy use. We have little
doubt that the substantial majority of users, under any social
control policy, including the existing system, do not and would
not engage in irresponsible behavior. </p>

<p> In identifying the -appropriate social control policy for
marihuana, we have found it helpful to consider the following
policy options: </p>

<p> I Approval of Use. </p>

<p> II Elimination of Use. </p>

<p> III Discouragement of Use. </p>

<p> IV Neutrality Toward Use. <br>
</p>

<h4>APPROVAL OF USE </h4>

<p> Society should not approve or encourage the recreational use
of any drug, in public or private. Any semblance of encouragement
enhances the possibility of abuse and removes, from a
psychological standpoint, an effective support of individual
restraint. </p>

<p> For example, so long as this society (not only the
government, but other institutions and mass advertising as well)
in effect approved of the use of tobacco, the growing medical
consensus about the dangers of excessive use did not make a
significant impression on individual judgment. With the Surgeon
General's Report on Tobacco in 1964, Smoking and Health, a very
real change has occurred in the way society now thinks about
cigarettes. </p>

<p> The institutions of society definitely add their influences
to the variety of social pressures which persuade individuals to
use any kind of drugs. Rational social policy should seek to
minimize such social pressures, whether they come from peers,
from the media, from social custom, or from the user's sense of
inadequacy. Official approval would inevitably encourage some
people to use the drug who would not otherwise do so, and would
also increase the incidence of heavy or otherwise irresponsible
use and its complications. On this basis we reject policy option
number one, approval of use. </p>

<h4>ELIMINATION OF USE </h4>

<p> For a half-century, official social policy has been not only
to discourage use but to eliminate it (option number two). With
the principal responsibility for this policy assigned to law
enforcement, its implementation reached its zenith in the late
1950's and early 1960's when marihuana-related offenses were
punishable by long periods of incarceration. This policy grew out
of a distorted and greatly exaggerated concept of the drug's
ordinary effects upon the individual and the society. On the
basis of information then available, marihuana was not adequately
distinguished from other problem drugs and was assumed to be as
harmful as the others. </p>

<p> The increased incidence of use, intensive scientific
reevaluation, and the spread of use to the middle and upper
socioeconomic groups have brought about the informal adoption of
a modified social policy. On the basis of our opinion surveys and
our empirical studies of law enforcement behavior, we are
convinced that officialdom and the public are no longer as
punitive toward marihuana use as they once were. </p>

<p> Now there exists a more realistic estimate of the actual
social impact of marihuana use. School and university
administrators are seldom able to prevent the use of marihuana by
their students and personnel and are increasingly reluctant to
take disciplinary action against users. Within the criminal
justice system, there has been a marked decline in the severity
of the response to offenders charged with possession of
marihuana. </p>

<p> In our survey of state enforcement activities, only 11% of
all marihuana arrests resulted from active investigative
activity, and most of those were in sale situations. For the most
part, marihuana enforcement is a haphazard process; arrests occur
on the street, in a park, in a car, or as a result of a phone
call. Among those arrested, approximately 50% of the adults and
70% of the juveniles are not processed through the system; their
cases are dismissed by the police, by the prosecutors or by the
courts. Ultimately less than 6% of all those apprehended are
incarcerated, and very few of these sentences are for possession
of small amounts for personal use. </p>

<p> In the law enforcement community, the major concern is no
longer marihuana but the tendency of some users to engage in
other irresponsible activity, particularly the use of more
dangerous drugs. Official sentiment now seems to be a desire to
contain use of the drug as well as the drug subculture, and to
minimize its spread to the rest of the youth population. Law
enforcement policy, both at the Federal and State levels,
implicitly recognizes that elimination is impossible at this
time. </p>

<p> The active attempt to suppress all marihuana use has been
replaced by an effort to keep it within reasonable bounds. Yet
because this policy still reflects a view that marihuana smoking
is itself destructive enough to justify punitive action against
the user, we believe it is an inappropriate social response. </p>

<p> Marihuana's relative potential for harm to the vast majority
of individual users and its actual impact on society does not
justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish
those who use it. This judgment is based on prevalent, use
patterns, on behavior exhibited by the vast majority of users and
on our interpretations of existing medical and scientific data.
This position also is consistent with the estimate by law
enforcement personnel that the elimination of use is
unattainable. </p>

<p> In the case of experimental or intermittent use of marihuana,
there is room for individual judgment. Some members of our
society believe the decision to use marihuana is an immoral
decision. However, even during Prohibition, when many people were
concerned about the evils associated with excessive use of
alcohol, possession for personal use was never outlawed federally
and was made illegal in only five States. </p>

<p> Indeed, we suspect that the moral contempt in which some of
our citizens hold the marihuana user is related to other behavior
or other attitudes assumed to be associated with use of the drug.
All of our data suggest that the moral views of the overwhelming
majority of marihuana users are in general accord with those of
the larger society. </p>

<p> Having previously rejected the approval policy (option number
one), we now reject the eliminationist policy (option number
two). This policy, if taken seriously, would require a great
increase in manpower and resources in order to eliminate the use
of a drug which simply does not warrant that kind of attention.<br>
</p>

<h4>DISCOURAGEMENT OR NEUTRALITY </h4>

<p> The unresolved question is whether society should try to
dissuade its members from using marihuana or should defer
entirely to individual judgment in the matter, remaining benignly
neutral. We must choose between policies of discouragement
(number three) and neutrality (number four). This choice is a
difficult one and forces us to consider the limitations of our
knowledge and the dynamics of social change. A number of
considerations, none of which is conclusive by itself, point at
the present time toward a discouragement policy. We will discuss
each one of them separately. </p>

<h5>1. User Preference Is Still Ambiguous </h5>

<p> Alcohol and tobacco have long been desired by large numbers
within our society and their use is deeply ingrained in the
American culture. Marihuana, on the other hand, has only recently
achieved a significant foothold in the American experience, and
it is still essentially used more by young people. Again, the
unknown factor here is whether the sudden attraction to marihuana
derives from its psychoactive virtues or from its symbolic
status. </p>

<p> Throughout this Commission's deliberations there was a
recurring awareness of the possibility that marihuana use may be
a fad which, if not institutionalized, will recede substantially
in time. Present data suggest that this is the case, and we do
not hesitate to say that we would prefer that outcome. To the
extent that conditions permit, society is well advised to
minimize the number of drugs which may cause significant
problems. By focusing our attention on fewer rather than more
drugs, we may be better able to foster responsible use and
diminish the consequences of irresponsible use. </p>

<p> The more prudent course seems to be to retain a social policy
opposed to use, attempting to discourage use while at the same
time seeking to deemphasize the issue. Such a policy leaves us
with more options available when more definitive knowledge of the
consequences of heavy and prolonged marihuana use becomes
available. </p>

<h5>2. Continuing Scientific Uncertainty Precludes Finality </h5>

<p> In 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, society was cognizant
of the effects of alcohol as a drug and the adverse consequences
of abuse. But, because so many people wished to use the drug,
policy-makers chose, to run the risk of individual indiscretion
and decided to abandon the abstentionist policy. There are many
today who feel that if the social, impact of alcohol use had then
been more fully understood, a policy of discouragement rather
than neutrality would have been adopted to minimize the negative
aspects of alcohol use. </p>

<p> Misunderstanding also played an important part when the
national government adopted an eliminationist, marihuana policy
in 1937. The policy-makers knew very little about the effects or
social impact of the drug; many of their hypotheses were
speculative and, in large measure, incorrect. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the argument that misinformation in 1937
automatically compels complete reversal of the action taken at
that time is neither reasonable nor logical. While continuing
concern about the effects of heavy, chronic use is not sufficient
reason to maintain an overly harsh public policy, it is still a
significant argument for choosing official discouragement in
preference to official neutrality. </p>

<h5>3. Society's Value System Is In a State of Transition </h5>

<p> As discussed in Chapter 1, two central influences in
contemporary American life are the individual search for meaning
within the context of an increasingly depersonalized society, and
the collective search for enduring American values. In Chapter
IV, we noted that society's present ambivalent response to
marihuana use reflects these uncertainties. </p>

<p> For the reasons discussed in the previous Chapters, a sudden
abandonment of an official policy of elimination in favor of one
of neutrality toward marihuana would have a profound
reverberating impact on social attitudes far beyond the one issue
of marihuana use. We believe that society must have time to
consider its image of the future. We believe that adoption of a
discouragement policy toward marihuana at this time would
facilitate such a reappraisal while official neutrality, under
present circumstances, would impede it. </p>

<h5>4. Public Opinion Presently Opposes Marihuana Use </h5>

<p> For whatever reasons, a substantial majority of the American
public opposes the use of marihuana, and would prefer that their
fellow citizens abstain from using it. In the National Survey,
64% of the adult public agreed with the statement that
&quot;using marihuana is morally offensive` (40% felt the same
way about alcohol). </p>

<p> Although this majority opinion is not by any means
conclusive, it cannot be ignored. We are well aware of the
skeptics in with which marihuana user, and those sympathetic to
their wishes, view the policy making process; and we are
particularly concerned about the indifference to or disrespect
for law manifested by many citizens and particularly the youth. </p>

<p> However, we are also apprehensive about the impact of a major
change in social policy on that larger segment of our population
which supports the implications of the existing social policy.
They, too, might lose respect for a policy-making establishment
which appeared to bend so easily to the wishes of a
&quot;lawless&quot; and highly vocal minority. </p>

<p> This concern for minimizing cultural dislocation must, of
course, be weighed against the relative importance of contrary
arguments. For example, in the case of desegregation in the
South, and now in the North, cult-Lire shock had to be accepted
in the light of the fundamental precept at issue. In the, case.
of marihuana, there is no fundamental principle supporting the
use of the drug, and society is not compelled to approve or be
neutral toward it. The opinion of the majority is entitled to
greater weight. </p>

<p> Looking again to the, experience with Prohibition, when an
abstentionist policy for alcohol was adopted on the national
level in 1918, its proponents were not blind to the vociferous
opposition of a substantial minority of the people. By the late
1920's and early 1930's, the ambivalence of public opinion toward
alcohol use and the unwillingness of large numbers of people to
comply with the new social policy compelled reversal of that
policy. Even many of its former supporters acknowledged its
futility. </p>

<p> With marihuana, however, the prevailing policy of eliminating
use had never been opposed to any significant degree until the
mid-1960's. Unlike the prohibition of alcohol, which had been the
subject of public debate off and on for 60 years before it was
adopted, present marihuana policy has not until now engaged the
public opinion process, some 50 years after it first began to be
used. Majority sentiment does not appear to be as flexible as it
was with alcohol.<br>
</p>

<h5>5. Neutrality Is Not Philosophically Compelled </h5>

<p> Much of what was stated above bespeaks an acute awareness by
the Commission of the subtleties of the collective consciousness
of the American people, as shown in the National Survey. There is
a legitimate concern about what the majority of the non-using
population thinks about marihuana use and what the drug
represents in the public mind. The question is appropriately
asked if we are suggesting that the majority in a free society
may impose its will on an unwilling minority even though, as it
is claimed, uncertainty, speculation, and a large degree of
misinformation form the basis of the predominant opinion. If we
have nothing more substantial than this, the argument goes,
society should remain neutral. </p>

<p> To deal with this contention, one must distinguish between
ends and means. Policy-makers must choose their objectives with a
sensitivity toward the entire social fabric and a vision of the
good society. In such a decision, the general public attitude is
a significant consideration. The preferred outcome in a
democratic society cannot be that of the policy-makers alone; it
must be that of an informed public. Accordingly, the policy-maker
must consider the dynamic relationship between perception and
reality in the public mind. Is the public consensus based on a
real awareness of the facts? Does the public really understand
what is at stake? Given the best evidence available, would the
public consensus remain the same? </p>

<p> Assuming that dominant opinion opposes marihuana use, the
philosophical issue is raised not by the goal but by how it is
implemented. At this point, the interests of the unwilling become
important. For example, the family unit and the institution of
marriage are preferred means of group-living and child-rearing in
our society. As a society, we are not neutral. We officially
encourage matrimony by giving married couples favorable tax
treatment; but we do not compel people to get married. If it
should become public policy to try to reduce the birth rate, it
is unlikely that there will be laws to punish those who exceed
the preferred family size, although we may again utilize
disincentives through the tax system. Similarly, this Commission
believes society should continue actively to discourage people
from using marihuana, and any philosophical limitation is
relevant to the means employed, not to the goal itself.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>FOR THESE REASONS, WE RECOMMEND TO THE PUBLIC AND ITS
POLICY-MAKERS A SOCIAL CONTROL POLICY SEEKING TO DISCOURAGE
MARIHUANA USE, WHILE CONCENTRATING PRIMARILY ON THE PREVENTION OF
HEAVY AND VERY HEAVY USE.</b> </p>

<p> We emphasize that this is a policy for today and the
immediate future; we do not presume to suggest that this policy
embodies eternal truth. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that
our successor policy planners, at an appropriate time in the
future,, review the following factors to determine whether an
altered social policy is in order: the state of public opinion,
the extent to which members of the society continue to use the
drug, the developing scientific knowledge about the effects and
social impact of use of the drug, and the evolving social
attitude toward the place of recreation and leisure in a
work-oriented society. In our second Report next year, we will
carefully review our findings to see if our perceptions have
changed or if society has changed at that time.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse </b></p>

<h2>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding </h2>

<p><b>Commissioned by President Richard M. Nixon, March, 1972</b>
</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>addendum<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The previous Chapter recommended a social policy oriented
toward the discouragement of marihuana use and presented a set of
proposals for the legal implementation of that policy. In
addition to these legal recommendations for federal, and state
action, the Commission believes certain other recommendations
should be presented for action. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Ancillary Recommendations</b> </p>

<p>These recommendations are presented in three categories: (1)
legal and law enforcement, (2) medical, and (3) other. Some of
these recommendations apply to other drugs as well and will be
discussed further in our second Report. However, we consider it
useful to make recommendations now so that policy planners can be
informed of the implications of what has been studied to date. </p>

<p>Foremost among the Commission's conclusions is a need for
consistency between federal and state laws affecting marihuana
distribution and use, and uniformity of marihuana laws among the
states. The administration of all marihuana laws must be mutally
reenforcing so that total governmental response to marihuana is
both equitable and understandable. </p>

<p><b>Legal and Law Enforcement Recommendations</b> </p>

<p><b>1. Federal</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, ESPECIALLY
THE BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS AND THE BUREAU OF
CUSTOMS, SHOULD IMPROVE THEIR STATISTICAL REPORTING SYSTEMS SO
THAT POLICIES MAY BE PLANNED AND RESOURCES ALLOCATED ON THE BASIS
OF ACCURATE AND COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION. </p>

<p>In an effort to obtain information relating to enforcement of
the marihuana laws including arrest, prosecution, sentencing and
conviction data, the Commission found that sufficient information
was available about prosecution and court action, but not about
the activities of the law enforcement agencies. We were
confronted by and large with inadequate statistical information
and little or no in-depth evaluation. </p>

<p>The statistical reporting procedures of the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the Bureau of Customs are not
uniform, making it extremely difficult to assess the
effectiveness of the two principal drug enforcement agencies of
the Federal Government. The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs keeps centralized files but the Bureau of Customs maintains
its files on a regional basis. In both Bureaus, statistical
information is kept only in its raw form; that is, number of
arrests, number of seizures and so on. Very little analysis
exists of the procedures leading to arrest, of the
characteristics of persons arrested, and of the law enforcement
strategies involved in the arrest. For law enforcement personnel
to understand more fully how they are carrying out their
functions so that internal assessments of particular policies can
be made, sophisticated statistics must be maintained. </p>

<p>Both the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the
Bureau of Customs are aware of these problems. Both were
extremely helpful to the Commission and its research staff in
seeking useful information from the mass of raw statistics.
However, the information from the available statistics is
incomplete and of limited utility for policy planning purposes. </p>

<p>In support of this priority recommendation, Congress is urged
to provide additional and adequate funding for this area, at the
same time requiring both agencies to utilize a common reporting
system so that information can be more easily shared between
them. </p>

<p>In addition, it is recommended that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, in its Uniform Crime Reports, requests the state
agencies to identify marihuana cases separately from narcotic
cases and report them as a separate component. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS
DRUGS SH0ULD INCREASE ITS TRAINING PROGRAMS OF STATE AND LOCAL
POLICE WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE TRAINING IN THE DETECTION OF
TRAFFICKING CASES. </p>

<p>The Commission's interviews with state and local police,
officials revealed a consistent desire to upgrade the quality of
their investigations. Since the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, through its National Training Institute, has
been performing this task well, it is recommended that the funds
be granted by the Congress to extend the range of the educational
program offered and increase the number of persons trained. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: INCREASED BORDER SURVEILLANCE, A TIGHTENING OF
BORDER PROCEDURES, AND A REALISTIC ERADICAT10N PROGRAM TO
DIMINISH THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY, COUPLED
WITH A MORE EFFECTIVE PROGRAM FOR DIMINISHING THE DOMESTIC
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MARIHUANA, ARE REQUIRED. </p>

<p>The Commission, as part of its mandate, studied drug
trafficking patterns along the borders of the United States. An
analysis of border marihuana seizures was also made. The results
of both studies indicated that proportionately larger seizures
were made along the borders at locations where, there were no
manned checkpoints. The Commission therefore recommends that more
vigorous effort be made by federal agencies to interdict
smugglers along the entire border while continuing their efforts
at the formal checkpoints. </p>

<p>In discussions with representatives of other countries, a
common observation made by foreign officials has been this
country's somewhat indifferent attitude about the eradication of
our home-grown marihuana, an attitude that is not appreciated by
other countries wider pressure from the United States to destroy
their crops. Since this Administration has wisely made illicit
trafficking in all drugs a foreign policy priority, we recommend
that priority be supported by an equally assiduous effort to
eradicate marihuana within our borders. </p>

<p>We recommend further that preclearance procedures be
eliminated so that Customs personnel may more effectively control
smuggling of marihuana and other drugs. Preclearance is a
procedure whereby passengers and their baggage destined for the
United States are inspected by U.S. Customs, Immigration and
Agriculture officials prior to departure from a foreign location.
This practice is in effect in Bermuda, Montreal, Nassau, Toronto,
Vancouver, Winnipeg and the Virgin Islands. Other locations are
petitioning for the same privilege. </p>

<p>An inherent weakness in the preclearance procedure is that
Customs personnel stationed outside the United States have no
authority for search, seizure and arrest. This fact is well-known
to the professional smuggler who uses it to his advantage. Since
we have been informed that preclearance creates a gap in Customs'
interdiction process, reason dictates that the procedure be
eliminated in the interest of tighter control. </p>

<p><b>H. State</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: ALL STATES SHOULD ADOPT THE UNIFORM CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES ACT TO ACHIEVE UNIFORMITY WITH REGARD TO MARIHUANA AND
OTHER DRUG LAWS, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE LEGAL RESPONSE TO
POSSESSION FOR ONE'S OWN USE BE UNIFORMLY ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH OUR RECOMMENDATION IN CHAPTER V OF THIS REPORT. </p>

<p>As noted earlier, one of the greatest needs in the entire drug
area is uniformity of state laws with regard to structure and
penalties. While this recommendation applies to all drugs and not
just marihuana, we feel it essential to make this recommendation
now to help deemphasize the marihuana problem. Significant
differences in penalties among the states constitute a valid
source of irritation and conflict among various segments of our
population. In an age of high mobility, it is unconscionable that
penalties should vary so greatly in response, to the same
behavior. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: EACH STATE SHOULD ESTABLISH A CENTRALIZED
COMPULSORY REPORTING AND RECORD-KEEPTNG AUTHORITY SO THAT
ADEQUATE AND ACCURATE STATISTICS OF ARRESTS, SENTENCES AND
CONVICTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS ARE AVAILABLE. </p>

<p>Several states have systems for maintaining records of drug
arrests on a statewide basis. Accurate reporting and compilation
of these cases permit the state to assess accurately the impact
of law enforcement on drug offenders. The Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration of the Department of Justice should
assist the states to establish compulsory statistical reporting
centers so that individual state needs are met and a clearer
picture of the national trends can be, ascertained. Efficient
state record-keeping will have an additional benefit of
increasing the reliability of the Uniform Crime Reports compiled
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THOSE STATES REQUIRING PHYSICIANS TO REPORT
DRUG USERS SEEKING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD CHANGE SUCH
REQUIREMENTS TO INSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE DRUG USER'S
IDENTITY, SO THAT PERSONS NEEDING MEDICAL HELP WILL FEEL FREE TO
SEEK IT. </p>

<p>Seventeen states* currently require physicians to report to a
government agency information on those persons treated by them
who are dependent on, or are habitual users of drugs. No common
pattern emerges among these states. </p>

<p>*California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico. New York,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, Washington. </p>

<p>After reviewing these statutes, the Commission believes that
the disadvantages of maintaining such reporting systems outweigh
the benefits to society or the individual. Fear of disclosure to
the police discourages many persons front seeking needed medical
help. Furthermore, the requirement makes the physician an
informant and an agent of law enforcement. </p>

<p>While a need exists for reliable statistics regarding the
number and nature of those persons being treated, the Commission
does not feel that identification of the individual user is
necessary. We again emphasize that society should encourage
persons in need of medical attention to seek out authorized
practitioners without having to fear legal repercussions for such
action. </p>

<p><b>III. International</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: IF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BECOME A SIGNATORY
OF THE PROPOSED PSYCHOTROPIC CONVENTION, WE RECOMMEND THAT
CANNABIS BE REMOVED FROM THE EXISTING SINGLE CONVENTION AND
CONSIDERATION BE GIVEN TO LISTING IT IN THE PSYCHOTROPIC
CONVENTION AMONG DRUGS WHICH HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS. </p>

<p>Under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, of which
the United States became a signatory in 1967, cannabis, with the
exception of its leaves and stems, is included with narcotic
drugs and cocaine. While that categorization had some
justification in 1961 when knowledge about marihuana was more,
limited, this justification no longer exists. More importantly,
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in
cannabis, is not included in the Single Convention and is
proposed for inclusion in the Psychotropic Convention. </p>

<p>The Commission sees little sense in having the potent
psychoactive ingredient in cannabis covered in one Convention and
the natural supplying data from its major foreign studies of
chronic cannabis users in Jamaica and Greece. For medical
research purposes, an analysis of data derived from populations
in other countries with 10, 20 or 30 years of experience with
heavy marihuana use will provide useful information about
probable consequences if the, incidence of marihuana use in the
United States were to continue and increase, and if more people
engaged in heavy, long term use. </p>

<p><b>IV. Therapeutic Uses</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: INCREASED SUPPORT OF STUDIES WHICH EVALUATE
THE EFFICACY OF MARIHIUANA TN THE TREATMENT OF PHYSICAL
IMPAIRMENTS AND DISEASE IS RECOMMENDED. </p>

<p>Historical references have been noted throughout the
literature referring to the use of cannabis products as
therapeutically useful agents. Of particular significance for
current research with controlled quality, quantity and
therapeutic settings, would be investigations into the treatment
of glaucoma, migraine, alcoholism and terminal cancer. The
NIMII-FDA Psychotomimetic Advisory Committee's authorization of
studies designed to explore the therapeutic uses of marihuana is
commended. </p>

<p><b>V. Community-Based Treatment</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: COMMUNITY-BASED TREATMENT FACILITIES SHOULD BE
PROMOTED IN CARlNG FOR PROBLEM DRUG USERS UTILIZING EXISTING
HEALTH CENTERS WHEN POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. </p>

<p>In studying marihuana, the Commission has obtained information
about a number of treatment centers and services. The wide range
of agencies and the variety of goals and techniques present a
confusing array of services available to drug users, varying
widely in their effectiveness. Uniform criteria for evaluating
the &quot;success&quot; of these programs is urgently needed. </p>

<p>The medical members of the Commission believe that some of the
techniques being used may pose as much potential harm as good.
Many young people who are experiencing profound difficulties
resulting from the use of drugs may suppose they are being
treated and helped, when in reality they are not. In some cases,
the short-term benefit may be disruptive to the long-term welfare
of the individual. In the rush to provide treatment facilities,
many programs have been given impressive credentials without
meeting minimal medical standards. It is essential that treatment
facilities have, as their primary orientation, the well-being of
the individual under treatment. </p>

<p><b>VI. Training Programs</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: PUBLIC HEALTH COURSES ON THE SOCIAL ASPECTS OF
DRUG USE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CURRICULA OF THE SCHOOLS OF
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. </p>

<p>The Commission recommends that schools of the health
professions include in their curricula courses on the social,
public health and therapeutic aspects of drug use as appropriate
to the educational purpose of the individual school. The National
Survey indicated that the public views the family physician as an
important source of information about drugs. Next to school
personnel, physicians were mentioned most often in this
connection. Persons involved in the health professions must be
provided with information about nonmedical as well as the medical
aspects of drug use. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Other Recommendations</b> </p>

<p><b>1. Reclassification of Cannabis</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT SEVERAL STATE
LEGISLATURES HAVE IMPROPERLY CLASSIFIED MARIHUANA AS A NARCOTIC,
AND RECOMMENDS THAT THEY NOW REDEFINE MARIHUANA ACCORDING TO THE
STANDARDS OF THE RECENTLY ADOPTED UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
LAW. </p>

<p>Scientific evidence has clearly demonstrated that marihuana is
not a narcotic drug, and the law should properly reflect this
fact. Congress so recognized in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970, as did The Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in the Uniform Controlled
Substances Law. </p>

<p>In those states where the Uniform Controlled Substances Law
has not yet been adopted, twelve of which continue to classify
marihuana as a &quot;narcotic&quot;, the Commission recommends
that the legislatures distinguish marihuana from the opiates and
list it in a separate category. The consequence of inappropriate
definition is that the public continues to associate marihuana
with the narcotics, such as heroin. The confusion resulting from
this improper classification helps to perpetuate prejudices and
misinformation about marihuana. </p>

<p><b>II. Information</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: A SINGLE FEDERAL AGENCY SOURCE SHOULD
DISSEMINATE INFORMATION AND MATERIALS RELATING TO MARIHUANA AND
OTHER DRUGS. THE NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR DRUG ABUSE
INFORMATION SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY. </p>

<p>A great proliferation of drug information materials has
occurred in recent years. These, materials are currently
distributed by a number of federal agencies. Some of these
materials conflict with each other. The result is a confusion and
uncertainty on the part of the, public about the accuracy of all
these statements. The public should have one federal source from
which to obtain drug information. The National Clearinghouse for
Drug Abuse Information appears best suited to perform this task. </p>

<p><b>III. Education</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE SPECIAL ACTION OFFICE FOR DRUG ABUSE
PREVENTION IN THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
COORDINATION, DEVELOPMENT AND CONTENT REVIEW OF ALL
FEDERALLY-SUPPORTED DRUG EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ANT) SHOULD ISSUE
A REPORT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, EVALUATING EXISTING DRUG EDUCATION
MATERIALS. </p>

<p>The Commission has studied many programs of drug education
throughout the country. Some are irrelevant, others are poorly
designed, still others are misleading, and a good many of them
are, of questionable value. A few are excellent. The Federal
Government must provide assistance to the states and school
districts in this matter, and should provide the leadership in
developing sample programs in cooperation with educational
systems. An evaluation of existing programs by The Special Action
Office for Drug Abuse Prevention of the White House could be very
helpful in improving the standards of drug education. </p>

<p><b>IV. Voluntary Sector Participation</b> </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION: THE COMMISSION NOTES THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE
PLAYED BY THE VOLUNTARY SEC TOR OF THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN
INFLUENCING THE SOCIAL, RELIGIOUS AND MORAL ATTITUDES OF OUR
NATION'S CITIZENS AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR BE
ENCOURAGED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN SUPPORT OF OUR RECOMMENDED
POLICY OF DISCOURAGING THE USE OF MARIHUANA. </p>

<p>Already very active in drug education and prevention
activities, the social agencies, service clubs, church groups,
and other non-governmental bodies have, been extremely helpful in
attending to the difficult problems of drug abuse. The local and
personal nature of such organizations gives them an advantage
over state and federal governments in the development of
attitudes by our citizens. </p>

<p>The policy which we here recommend, indeed any policy which
might be recommended, will inevitably encounter widespread and
earnest objections. The fullest efforts of all citizens of good
will be required to attend to the, massive problem of drug abuse
in a calm, just, responsible and effective manner. The help of
the voluntary agencies in working toward this end is earnestly
invited and urgently needed.<br>

<p>National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse </p>

<p>801 19th Street N.W. </p>

<p>Washington, D.C. 20006<br>
</p>

<p>March 22, 1972<br>
</p>

<p>To The President and Congress of the United States: </p>

<p>As Chairman of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse, I am pleased to submit to you our first year Report in
conformance with the mandate contained in Section 601 of Public
Law 91-513, The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
Act of 1970. </p>

<p>This Report &quot;Marihuana, A Signal of
Misunderstanding&quot; is an all-inclusive effort to present the
facts as they are known today, to demythologize the controversy
surrounding marihuana, and to place in proper perspective one of
the most emotional and explosive issues of our time. We on the
Commission sincerely hope it will play a significant role in
bringing uniformity and rationality to our marihuana laws, both
Federal and State, and that it will create a healthy climate for
further discussion, for further research and for a continuing
advance in the development of a public social policy beneficial
to all our citizens. </p>

<p>Whatever the facts are we have reported them. Wherever the
facts have logically led us, we have followed and used them in
reaching our recommendations. We hope this Report will be a
foundation upon which credibility in this area can be restored
and upon which a rational policy can be predicated. </p>

<p>By Direction of the Commission </p>

<p>Raymond P. Shafer </p>

<hr>

<p>The President </p>

<p>The President of the Senate </p>

<p>The Speaker of the House<br>

<p><b>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding</b> </p>

<p><b>The Technical Papers of the First Report of the National
Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse<br>
March, 1972</b> </p>

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congress created the Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse to
separate fact from fiction, reality from myth, and to achieve a
balanced judgment on the marihuana issue. The first report of the
Commission is an attempt to clarify the essential issues and
concerns of our society regarding marihuana and to extrapolate
our findings and conclusions into a reasonable societal response.
</p>

<p>In an effort to present these complex issues with a maximum of
clarity, comprehension, and readability, the Commission Report
does not include references. This Appendix, however, fully
documents the methodological and substantive, issues presented in
the Report. In addition to the technical data, the Appendix also
contains the historical and philosophical matrix of the Report. </p>

<p>The papers of the Appendix are divided into six major parts.
Part One deals with the biosocial aspects which relate to
marihuana's effect on individuals as well as to the larger
society. </p>

<p>It includes an historical survey of two types of marihuana
use, medicinal and intoxicant, which constitutes a review of
marihuana use in many parts of the world. An analysis of the
accepted sociocultural parameters helps to put the American
marihuana, user into perspective. </p>

<p>Part One also presents detailed and current reviews of the
botanical, psychopharmacologic, physiologic, and behavioral
effects of marihuana on man. </p>

<p>Part Two, the social aspects of marihuana use, discusses
patterns of the individual user as well as the relationship of
marihuana use to violent and non-violent crime. </p>

<p>One of the most controversial issues in the study of marihuana
is its relationship to other drugs. The second chapter of Part
Two deals specifically with this issue and explores, in depth and
with careful consideration, the hypothesis that marihuana use
leads to other drugs, especially heroin. </p>

<p>Part Three is concerned with the legal aspects of the
marihuana controversy. In order to place marihuana, a
psychoactive drug, in proper perspective, a history of the
control of marihuana, alcohol and tobacco is presented. </p>

<p>This section of the Appendix also reviews the current
marihuana laws at the international, federal and state levels
including statutes that require physicians to report drug
addiction. The section concludes with a description of
trafficking and distribution patterns of the drug. </p>

<p>Part Four, the response of the criminal justice system,
analyzes law enforcement behavior with respect to marihuana use.
The relationship between the opinions held by officials in the
criminal justice system and their behavior toward marihuana
offenders is also discussed. </p>

<p>Part Five presents the findings of the Commission-sponsored
National Survey of public attitudes and behavior toward
marihuana, other drug use and related social issues. </p>

<p>Part Six discusses the marihuana issue with respect to
sociolegal policy practices and decisions. Included in the
section is a discussion of the constitutional dimensions which
form the basis for alternative models for the control of
marihuana. A nationwide study of marihuana education presents
policies and programs on a state-by-state basis and includes
descriptions of ongoing marihuana education programs. <br>
</p>

<p>The Appendix concludes with a presentation of future research
recommendations as suggested guidelines for various agencies,
institutions and individuals engaged in research on marihuana. </p>

<p>Each of the papers contained herein represents the composite
effort of the Commission members and staff, consultants,
contractors and youth consultants. </p>

<p>Of necessity, space limitations precluded the publication in
full of many excellent papers; many works are presented either in
abridged form or integrated into the Commission's own
presentation. </p>

<p>A list of all papers submitted to the Commission is presented
at the conclusion of the Appendix. Should any reader wish to
obtain a copy of a particular work, the request should be sent
directly to the author and not to the Commission.<br>
</p>

<h1>History of Marihuana Use: Medical and Intoxicant </h1>

<p>From: <u>Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding</u>, the
Report of the US National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse,
1972</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The term &quot;marihuana&quot; is a word with indistinct
origins. Some believe it is derived from the Mexican words for
&quot;Mary Jane&quot;; others hold that &quot;marihuana&quot;
comes from. the Portuguese word marigu-ano which means
&quot;intoxicant&quot; (Geller and Boas, 1969: 14). This chapter
outlines the many and varied uses of marihuana through history,
and deals with its use in medicine and its use as an intoxicant. </p>

<p>The experience of the 1960's might lead one to surmise that
marihuana use spreads explosively. The chronicle of its 3,000
year history, however, shows that this &quot;explosion&quot; has
been characteristic only of the contemporary scene. The plant has
been grown for fiber and as a source of medicine for several
thousand years, but until 500 A.D. its use as a mind-altering
drug was almost solely confined in India. The drug and its uses
reached the Middle and Near East during the next several
centuries, and then moved across North Africa, appeared in Latin
America and the Caribbean, and finally entered the United States
in the early decades of this century (Snyder, 1970: 129). </p>

<p>Meanwhile it had been introduced into European medicine
shortly after the invasion of Egypt by Napoleon and had a minor
vogue as an intoxicant for a time in France.<br>
<br>
Regardless of which parts of the world are discussed, many of the
same problems and concerns about cannabis are common to all,
including the United States. Understanding its various uses
during many centuries in diverse countries and continents can
perhaps lead to a better understanding of marihuana in general.<br>
</p>

<h2>History of the Medical Use </h2>

<p>The history of cannabis products and their use has been long,
colorful and varied. &quot;To the agriculturist, cannabis is a
fiber crop; to the physician, it is an enigma; to the user, a
euphoriant; to the police, a menace; to the trafficker, a source
of profitable danger; to the convict or parolee and his family, a
source of sorrow&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969: 34). The fact is that
cannabis has been held simultaneously in high and low esteem at
various times throughout recorded history, particularly in our
own times. </p>

<p>The volume of information available on the medical application
of cannabis is considerable. Occasionally certain references have
been condensed or deleted, but this should not detract from the
completeness of the report. </p>

<p>This historical survey of the medical uses of marihuana is
introduced by abroad overview of its use, including brief notes
on current and projected research, and then considers specific
historical settings and circumstances in ancient China, moving on
to Egypt, India, Greece, Africa, and the Western World. </p>

<p>Cannabis sativa has been used therapeutically from the
earliest records, nearly 5,000 years ago, to the present day
(Mikuriya, 1969: 34) and its products have been widely noted for
their effects, both physiological and psychological, throughout
the world. Although the Chinese and Indian cultures knew about
the properties of this drug from very early times, this
information did not become general in the Near and Middle East
until after the fifth century A.D., when travelers, traders and
adventurers began to carry knowledge of the drug westward to
Persia and Arabia. </p>

<p>Historians claim that cannabis was first employed in these
countries as an antiseptic and analgesic. Other medical uses were
later developed and spread throughout the Middle East, Africa,
and Eastern Europe. </p>

<p>Several years after the return of Napoleon's army from Egypt,
cannabis became widely accepted by Western medical practitioners.
Previously, it had had limited use for such purposes as the
treatment of burns. The scientific members of Napoleon's forces
were interested in the drug's pain relieving and sedative
effects. It was used during, and to a greater extent, following
his rule in France, especially after 1840 when the work of such
physicians as O'Shaughnessy, Aubert-Roche, and Moreau de Tours
drew wide attention to this drug.<br>
</p>

<p>With the rise of the literary movement of the 1840-1860 period
in France (Gautier, Baudelaire, Dumas, etc.), cannabis became
somewhat popular as an intoxicant of the intellectual classes. <br>
</p>

<p>In the United States, medical interest in cannabis use was
evidenced in 1860 by the convening of a Committee on Cannabis
Indica of the Ohio State Medical Society, which reported on its
therapeutic applications (McMeens, 1860: 1). Between the period
1840-1890, Walton states that more than 100 articles were
published recommending cannabis for one disorder or another. </p>

<p>Concern about cannabis as an intoxicant led the government of
India to establish the India Hemp Commission of 1893-94 to
examine the entire question of cannabis use in India. </p>

<p>Paralleling the question over cannabis use in the latter half
of the 19th century was the growing medical use of other
medications superior to cannabis in their effects and more easily
controlled as to dose. Consequently, medical use of cannabis
declined and cannabis began to lose support of the medical
profession. </p>

<p>During the years between 1856-1937, cannabis lost its image as
a medicine and was left with a disreputable image as an
intoxicant. Strong public reaction coupled with a campaign in the
public press led to a federal anti-marihuana law in 1937. (The
drug was illegal in many states before 1937.) The issue of
medical use remained active, however, and Dr. William C.
Woodward, Legislative Counsel to the AMA, an opponent of cannabis
use and the only physician to be a witness at the Taxation of
Marihuana hearings, stated: <br>
</p>

<p>There are exceptions in treatment in which cannabis cannot
apparently be successfully subsituted for. The work of Pascal
seems to show that Indian Hemp has remarkable properties in
revealing the subconscious; hence, it can be used for
psychological, psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic research
(Hearings, House of Representatives, 1937: 91).<br>
</p>

<p>Although cannabis drugs are generally regarded as obsolete and
rarely used in &quot;western&quot; medicine today, cannabis is
&quot;still used extensively in the Ayruvedic, Unani and Tibbi
systems of medicine of the Indian-Pakastani subcontinent&quot;
(&quot;The Cannabis Problem, 1962: 27). The Pharmacopoeias of
India mention cannabis use in the recent past. Two preparations
of cannabis, a liquid extract and a tincture, are listed in the
1954 and 1966 Pharmacopoeias of India which contain descriptions
of cannabis and its extract and how it is made (Chopra &amp;
Chopra, 1957: 9).<br>
</p>

<p>A more recent source makes reference to the fact that &quot;in
contemporary India and Pakistan, there continues to be widespread
indigenous medical, 'quasi-medical,' and illicit use of both
opium and cannabis&quot; (Chopra &amp; Chopra, 1957: 12-13).
Bouquet notes that hemp resin is occasionally used in the native
medicines of the countries where it is collected. He points
especially to India where, &quot;the medical systems . . . make
much use of cannabis as a sedative, hypnotic, analgesic,
anti-spasmodic and anti-hemorrhoidal&quot; (Bulletin on
Narcotics, 1962:27). </p>

<p>According to the Canadian Commission of Inquiry into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs:<br>
</p>

<p>There is no currently accepted medical use of cannabis in
North America outside of an experimental context. Although
cannabis has been reported to produce an array of possibly useful
medical effects, these have either not been adequately
investigated, or can be replaced by using other more readily
available and convenient drugs. The natural product's variability
in potency and instability over time are among the factors which
have led to its disfavor in Western 20th century medicine....
cannabis has often been employed in the past, and is currently
used illicitly in North America, to reduce the secondary symptoms
and suffering caused by the flue and the common cold. These . . .
alleged therapeutic properties of cannabis have not been
adequately studied in a scientific context, and their general
medical potential remains a matter of conjecture (1970: 74).<br>
</p>

<p>Similar statements regarding cannabis are to be found in
Marijuana, edited by Erich Goode, and in the textbook
Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics by Goodman and Gilman
(1970: 300). Concerning therapeutic uses, the latter states:<br>
</p>

<p>Although cannabis was once used for a wide variety of clinical
disorders and has even been demonstrated to have antibacterial
activity, there are at present no well substantiated indications
for its use. It is no longer an official drug. Preparations are
rarely available (cannabis preparation and synthetic THC are
obtainable only for research purposes), and prescriptions are
regulated by special tax laws.<br>
</p>

<p>Hollister (1971: 27) lists a few difficulties of the
therapeutic use of cannabis: <br>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The onset of the action of oral doses of THC is often
        rather slow, contrary to that of conventional
        sedative-hypnotics. </li>
    <li>Doses high enough to produce a marked hypnotic effect are
        almost always accompanied by some degree of
        psychotomimetic-like perceptual disorders, which many
        patients might find disagreeable. </li>
    <li>The fine titration of dose required to provide sedative
        effects is likely to be difficult. </li>
    <li>The drug does not have novel effects compared with other
        sedative-hypnotics. <br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The Department of Health, Education, and We] fare report to
Congress in 1971, Marihuana and Health, repeats the statement of
the Canadian Interim Report of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use
of Drugs, and states: &quot;There is no currently accepted
medical use of cannabis in the United States outside of an
experimental context&quot; (DHEW: 1971: 27). Allen Geller and
Maxwell Boas (1969: 4) think that cannabis' &quot;unsavory
reputation has largely stymied further research.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the many statements discounting cannabis' therapeutic
usefulness, some authorities maintain that its medical value
might be reborn through further research and/or use. David
Solomon, in his foreword to The Marihuana Papers (1968: xxi)
argues that: <br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marihuana should be accorded the medical status it once
    had in this country as a legitimate prescription item. After
    1937, with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act and
    subsequent federal and state legislation, it became virtually
    impossible for physicians to obtain or prescribe marihuana
    preparations for their patients. Thus, the medical profession
    was denied access to a versatile pharmaceutical tool with a
    history of therapeutic utility going back thousands of years.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a 1970 article, &quot;Pot Facing Stringent Scientific
Examination ,&quot; reference is made to Dr. Par who states that
there are three areas in which &quot;chemical and animal
experiments are under way:&quot; </p>

<p>(1) Analgesia-mood elevation plus analgesic power may make
useful drug. </p>

<p>(2) Blood pressure reduction-hypertension may be helped by new
drugs which lower the blood pressure by what seems to be action
on the central nervous system. </p>

<p>(3) Psychotherapeutic-new compounds are antidepressants and
antianxiety drugs (Culliton: 1970).<br>
</p>

<p>Mikuriya cites it studies concerning cannabis funded by the
National Institute of Mental Health in 1961. The studies were
&quot;either specialized animal experiments, part of an
observational sociologic study of a number of drugs, or
explorations of chemical detection methods&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969:
38). </p>

<p>Feinglass has pointed to four general categories into which
the clinical studies of marihuana could be divided (1968:
206-208). They are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Anticonvulsant effects-treatment of tetanus, convulsions
        of rabies, epilepsy, and infant convulsions. </li>
    <li>Psychotherapeutic actions - appetite-stimulation,
        treatment of depression, and as a sedative and hypnotic
        in reducing anxiety; treatment of addiction. </li>
    <li>Antibiotic properties. </li>
    <li>Pain-affecting power.<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Grinspoon suggests:<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Very little research attention has been given to the
    possibility that marihuana might protect some people from
    psychosis. Among users of the drug, the proportion of people
    with neuroses or personality disorders is usually higher than
    in the general population; one might therefore expect the
    incidence of psychoses also to be higher in this group. The
    fact that it is not suggests that for some mentally disturbed
    people, the escape provided by the drug may serve to prevent
    a psychotic breakdown (1969: 24).<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mikuriya lists many possible therapeutic uses of THC and
similar products in his paper &quot;Marihuana in Medicine: Past,
Present and Future.&quot; He includes:<br>
</p>

<p>Analgesic-hypnotic, appetite stimulant, antiepileptic,
antispasmodic, prophylactic and treatment of the neuralgias,
including migraine and tic douloureaux,
antidepressant-tranquillizer, anti-asthmatic, oxytocic,
anti-tussive, topical anesthetic, withdrawal agent for opiate and
alcohol addiction, child birth analgesic, and antibiotic (1968:
39).<br>
</p>

<p><b>China</b> </p>

<p>The oldest known therapeutic description Of cannabis was by
the Emperor Shen-Nung in the 28th century B.C. in China, where
the plant had long been grown for fiber. He prescribed cannabis
for beri-beri, constipation, &quot;female weakness,&quot; gout,
malaria, rheumatism and absentmindedness (Bloomquist, 1968: 19). </p>

<p><b>Egypt</b> </p>

<p>In Egypt, in the 20th century B.C., cannabis was used to treat
sore eyes. Additional medical usage was not reported until much
later. </p>

<p><b>India</b> </p>

<p>Prior to the 10th century B.C., bhang, a cannabis preparation,
was used as an anesthetic and antiphlegmatic in India. In the
second century A.D., a Chinese physician, Hoa-Tho, prescribed it
as an analgesic in surgical procedures (Mikuriya, 1969: 34). </p>

<p>From the 10th century B.C. up to 1945 (and even to the present
time), cannabis has been used in India to treat a wide variety of
human maladies. The drug is highly regarded by some medical
practitioners in that country. </p>

<p>The religious use of cannabis in India is thought to have
preceded its medical use (Blum and Associates, II, 1969: 73;
Snyder, 1970: 125). The religious use of cannabis is to help
&quot;the user to free his mind from worldly distractions and to
concentrate on the Supreme Being&quot; (Barber, 1970: 80). </p>

<p>Cannabis is used in Hindu and Sikh temples and at Mohammedan
shrines. Besides using the drug as an aid to meditation, it is
also used to overcome hunger and thirst by the religious
mendicants. In Nepal, it is distributed on certain feast days at
the temples of all Shiva followers (Blum &amp; Associates, 1969,
11: 63). </p>

<p>The Hindus spoke of the drug as the &quot;heavenly
guide,&quot; &quot;the soother of grief.&quot; Considered holy,
it was described as a sacred grass during the Vedic period (Fort,
1969: 15). A reference to cannabis in Hindu scriptures is the
following: </p>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in bhang
... Bhang is the joy giver, the sky filer, the heavenly guide,
the poor man's heaven, the soother of grief ... No god or man is
as good as the religious drinker of Mang. The students of the
scriptures of Benares are given bhang before they sit to study.
At Benares, Ujjain and other holy places, yogis take deep
draughts of Mang that they may center their thoughts on the
Eternal . . . By the help of Mang ascetics pass days without food
or drink. The supporting power of Mang has brought many a Hindu
family safe through the miseries of famine (Snyder, 1970: 125).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Greece</b> </p>

<p>In ancient Greece, cannabis was used as a remedy for earache,
edema, and inflammation (Robinson, 1946: 382-383).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Africa</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis was used in Africa to restore appetite and to relieve
pain of hemorrhoids, its antiseptic uses were also known to
certain African native tribes (O'Shaughnessy, 1842: 431). Various
other uses, in a number of countries, included the treatment of
tetanus, hydrophobia, delirium tremens, infantile convulsions,
neuralgia and other nervous disorders, cholera, menorrhagia,
rheumatism, hay fever, asthma, skin diseases, and protracted
labor during childbirth.<br>
</p>

<h3>The 19th Century </h3>

<p>Documents of the 19th century report on the use of cannabis to
control diarrhea in cholera and to stimulate appetite. In his
reports of the late 1830's and early 1840's, O'Shaughnessy (1842:
431) stated that tetanus could be arrested and cured when treated
with extra large doses of cannabis. </p>

<p>John Bell, M.D., Boston, reported enthusiastically in 1857,
about the effects of cannabis in the control of mental and
emotional disorders as opposed to the use of &quot;moral
discipline&quot; to restrain the mentally ill. Similarly, in
1858, Moureau. de Tours reported several case histories of manic
and depressive disorders treated with hashish (Walton, 1938: 3). </p>

<p>The Ohio State Medical Society's Committee on Cannabis Indica,
convened in 1860, reported that their respondents claimed
cannabis successfully treated neuralgic pain, dysmenorhea,
uterine hemorrhage, hysteria, delirium tremens, mania, palsy,
whooping cough, infantile convulsions, asthma, gonorrhea, nervous
rheumatism, chronic bronchitis, muscular spasms, tetanus,
epilepsy and appetite stimulation (McMeens, 1860: 1). </p>

<p>The India Hemp Commission (1894: 174) likewise was informed of
similar medicinal uses for cannabis. Specific reports included
the use of cannabis as an analgesic, a restorer of energy, a
hemostat, an ecbolic, and an antidiaretic. Cannabis was also
mentioned as an aid in treating hay fever, cholera, dysentery,
gonorrhea, diabetes, impotence, urinary incontinence, swelling of
the testicles, granulation of open sores, and chronic ulcers.
Other beneficial effects attributed to cannabis were prevention
of insomnia, relief of anxiety, protection against cholera,
alleviation of hunger and as an aid to concentration of
attention.<br>
</p>

<h3>MEDICAL USES IN THE 20TH CENTURY </h3>

<p>Despite the fact that marihuana was made illegal in the United
States in 1937, research has continued on the medical uses of
marihuana. The findings include various possible medical
applications of cannabis and its chemical derivatives. </p>

<p>One of the most recent and interesting findings (Frank, 1972)
concerns the effect of cannabis in reducing intraocular pressure.
It was found that as the dose of marihuana increased, the
pressure within the eye decreased by up to 30%. This occurred in
normal persons as well as in those with glaucoma, a disease of
the eye in which increased intraocular pressure may cause
blindness. Much more research is necessary in connection with
this experimental clinical finding before final judgment can be
passed on such a possible therapeutic value. </p>

<p>During the past 20 years in western medicine, marihuana has
been assigned antibiotic activity; as a result, several studies
relating to this possibility have been undertaken. H. B. M.
Murphy (1963: 20) reported investigations in Eastern Europe. He
stated that &quot;it is alleged to be active against gram
positive organisms at 1/100,000 dilution, but to be largely
inactivated by plasma, so that prospects for its use appear to
be, confined to E. N. T. (ear, nose and throat) and skin
infections.&quot; </p>

<p>Dr. J. Kabelikovi (1952: 500-503) and his coworkers carried
out tests on rats, which were similar to tests carried out with
penicillin in vitro. The alcohol extract of cannabis was
bacterially effective against many gram-positive and one
gram-negative microorganisms. It was also found that a paste form
of external application was successful. According to Kabelikovi,
&quot;from a study of 2,000 herbs by Czechoslovakian scientists
it was found that cannabis indica (the Indian Hemp) was the most
promising in the realm of antibiotics.&quot; </p>

<p>In a 1959 publication of Pharmacie, Krejci stated: &quot;From
the flowering tips and leaves of hemp, cannabis sativa var indica
bred in Middle Europe, were extracted a phenol and an acid
fraction. From the acid fraction, two acids were obtained, of
which one preserved its antibiotic properties&quot; (p. 349). In
another Czechoslovakian publication, Krejci (1961: 1351-1353)
referred to two additional samples with antibiotic activity. </p>

<p>Sample I in Fig. 1 has been sufficiently identified as
cannabidiolic acid and sample 9 as cannabidiol. Both fractions
show antibiotic activity. The results of tests lead us to
conclude that the antibacterial action of cannabis sativa is not
identical to the hashish effect found, for example, in
tetrahydrocannabinol. However, it was established that cannabis
sativa is effective as an antibiotic for local infections. </p>

<p>Kabelik, Krejci, and Santavy (1960: 13) include in
&quot;Cannabis as a Medicant&quot; the various microorganisms
against which cannabis is effective. </p>

<p>Proof could be furnished that the cannabis extracts produce a
very satisfactory antibacterial effect upon the following
microbes: staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, steptococcus alpha
haemolyticus, streptococcus beta haemolyticus, enterococcus,
diplococcus pneumonia, B. anthracis, and corynebacterium
diptheriae i.e., all of them gram-positive microorganisms.
Noteworthy is the effect upon staphylococcus aureaus strains,
which are resistant to penicillin and to other antibiotics. </p>

<p>These authors also mentioned that E. coli (gramnegative
bacteria) were tested and found to be resistant to the cannabis
extract. One of the conclusions was &quot;the possibility of
utilizing the antibiotics locally without any danger of producing
resistant strains to other antibiotics administered at the same
time throughout treatment&quot; (Kabelik, et al., 1960: 13). </p>

<p>Veliky and Genest in &quot;Suspension Culture of Cannabis
Sativa,&quot; (1970) reported that &quot;the ethanol extract of
cultured cells exhibited antibiotic activity against Bacillus
megatherium, staphlococcus aureaus and escherichia coli&quot; (p.
493). </p>

<p>Other reports said that &quot;a pronounced antibiotic effect
has been observed in South America, where fresh leaves, after
being ground, are used as a poultice for furuncles, and in folk
medicine in Europe for treatment of erysipelas&quot; (Kabelik, et
al., 1960: 8). </p>

<p>This section on the -antibiotic uses of cannabis concludes
with a summary of several reports from various countries. In
Pharmacopee Arabe: &quot;The ground-up seeds are mixed with bread
for people with tuberculosis&quot; (Andrews and Vinkenoog, 1967:
145). In Czechoslovakia: &quot;A preparation from seed pulp was .
. . introduced by Sirek to act as a roborant diet in treatment of
tuberculosis&quot; (Kabelik, 1960: 8). &quot;In Southern Rhodesia
the plant is used as an African remedy for malaria, anthrax,
sepsis, black water fever, dysentery, blood-poisoning, tropical
quinine-malarial haemoglobinuria, and a wart medicine&quot;
(Watt, 1961: 13). In Argentina: </p>

<p>Cannabis is considered a real panacea for tetanus, colic,
gastralgia, swelling of the liver, gonorrhoea, sterility,
impotency, abortion, tuberculosis of the lungs and asthma ...
even the root-bark has been collected in spring, and employed as
a febrifuge, tonic, for treatment of dysentery and gastralgia,
either pulverized or in form of decoctions. The root when ground
and applied to burns is said to relieve pain. Oil from the seeds
has been frequently used even in treatment of cancer . . .
(Kabelik, 1960: 8).<br>
</p>

<p>In 1949, Davis and Ramsey reported a study of the effect of
THC on epileptic children. &quot;The demonstration of
anticonvulsant activity of the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
congeners by laboratory tests (Loewe and Goodman, Federation
Proc., 6: 3521 1947) prompted clinical trial in five
institutionalized epileptic children&quot; (David and Ramsey,
1949: 284-285). Of these five children, all had severe
symptomatic grand mal epilepsy with mental retardation; three
also had cerebral palsy; and three had focal seizure activity.
The EEG tracings were reported to be grossly abnormal in all five
children. The results after treatment with homologues of THC,
were reported as follows: </p>

<p>Three children-responded at least as well as to previous
therapy. </p>

<p>Fourth child-almost completely seizure free. Fifth
child-entirely seizure free. </p>

<p>As a result of their study, David and Ramsey (1949: 284-285)
felt that &quot;the cannabinols herein reported deserve further
trial in non-institutionalized epileptics.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Vansim of Edgewood Arsenal has written in a recently
published book &quot;Psychotomimetic Drugs,&quot; that the
synthetic preparations of cannabis are of interest. There are
three areas where they may be of definite use in medicine (Efron,
1969: 333-334). One concerns the use of a cannabis analogue which
Dr. Walter S. Loewe reported very effective in preventing grand
mal seizures if given in small doses. </p>

<p>The second use refers to cannabis as an antidepressant. Straub
(Walton, 1938: 3), Adams (1942: 726-727), and Stockings (1947,
920-922) point to the possible use of cannabis and cannabis
analogues in relieving dysphoria in depressed patients. Other
authors (Parker and Wrigley, 1950: 278-279) had lesser success
but recommended further research in this field. </p>

<p>A report from London in 1968 suggests that cannabis treats the
symptoms and not the cause by focusing the user's attention on
his anxieties and pains without helping him to resolve them
(Report by the Advisory Committee, 1968: 11). </p>

<p>The third use is described by Douthwaite, who used hashish in
1947 &quot;for reducing of anxiety and tension in patients with
duodenal ulcer&quot; (Pond, 1948: 279). </p>

<p>A report in a 1965 issue of Medical News (&quot;Cardiac
Glycocides,&quot; p. 6) suggests cannabis as treatment for a
specific form of malignancy. </p>

<p>Cannabis is recognized as an appetite stimulant, which
suggests that the drug might be useful in the treatment of
pathological loss of appetite known as anorexia nervosa
(Grinspoon, 1969: 21). Similar symptoms exist in terminal cancer
patients who, when treated with cannabis over a short period of
time, demonstrated stimulation of appetite, euphoria, increased
sense of well-being, mild analgesia and an indifference to pain
which reduced the need for opiates (DHEW, 1971: 11). </p>

<p>Cannabis has been recently proposed as an adjunct in the
treatment of alcoholics and drug addicts. Roger Adams (1942:
726-727) and Todd Mikuriya (1970a: 187-191) noted that the
substitution of smoked cannabis for alcohol may have
rehabilitative value for certain alcoholics. </p>

<p>Regarding the use of cannabis analogue in the treatment of
drug, alcohol and depressive state withdrawal, Thompson and
Proctor (1953: 520523) report the following: </p>

<p>Depressive States: </p>

<p>20 cases of neurotic depression-4 improved (20%) </p>

<p>6 cases of psychotic depression-none improved (00%) </p>

<p>Post-Alcoholic Cases: </p>

<p>70 cases--59 reported clinical alleviation of symptoms (84%) </p>

<p>Drug Cases: </p>

<p>6 cases of barbiturate addiction-4 reported amelioration of
symptoms (66%) </p>

<p>4 cases of dilaudid addiction-3 reported alleviation (75%) </p>

<p>2 cases of pantopan and one paregoric addiction-all reported
smooth withdrawal (100%) </p>

<p>12 cases of Demerol addiction-10 withdrawals in one week (83%)
</p>

<p>6 cases of morphine addiction-2 withdrawals without unpleasant
symptoms (33%)<br>
</p>

<p>The doctors concluded that &quot;Pyrahexyl (a synthetic
cannabis-like drug) and related compounds are beneficial in the
treatment of withdrawal symptoms from the use of alcohol to a
marked degree, and in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms from
the use of opiates to a less marked, but still significant
degree&quot; (Thompson &amp; Proctor, 1953:520-523). </p>

<p>Drs. Allentuck and Bowman (1942) undertook a study of the use
of marihuana in the morphine abstinence syndrome. They stated: </p>

<p>A series of cases were selected from among drug addicts
undergoing treatment. . . . Comparative results were chartered
for the gradual withdrawal, total withdrawal, and marihuana
derivative substitution, as methods of treatment. . . . 49
subjects were studied. The results in general, although still
inconclusive, suggest that the marihuana substitution method
ameliorated or eliminated (the symptoms) sooner, the patient was
in a better frame of mind, his spirits elevated, his physical
condition was more rapidly rehabilitated, and he expressed a wish
to resume his occupation sooner (p. 250). <br>
</p>

<p>In his study of the medical application of cannabis for Mayor
LaGuardia's committee, Dr. Samuel Allentuck reported
&quot;favorable results in treating withdrawal of opiate addicts
with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a powerful purified product of
the hemp plants&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969: 38). </p>

<p>Roger Adams' detailed studies, as reported by Dr. C. K.
Himmelsbach in his 1944 article &quot;Treatment of the Morphine
Abstinence Syndrome with a Synthetic Cannabis-Like Compound&quot;
(1944:26), indicated that &quot;withdrawal manifestations were
considered to be mild. The reported therapeutic value of
marihuana was attributed to improved appetite, greater sleep,
euphoria, and a reduction of the intensity or elimination of
abstinence phenomena.&quot; Himmelsbach, however, had lesser
success when he studied the effect of a &quot;pyrahexyl&quot;
compound on the morphine abstinence syndrome, as noted by his
conclusions that: </p>

<p>(1) Pyrahexyl compound appears to possess considerable
cannabis-like effect when administered orally, but little or none
when given intramuscularly. </p>

<p>(2) When given by mouth In definitely effective amounts
pyrahexyl compound had no appreciable ameliorative effect on the
opiate abstinence syndrome (P. 29).<br>
</p>

<p>The New York City Mayor LaGuardia's Committee on Marihuana
(1944: 147-148) reported two possible therapeutic applications of
marihuana: </p>

<p>The first is the typical euphoria-producing action which might
be applicable in the treatment of various types of mental
depression; the second is the rather unique property which
results in the stimulation of appetite. In the light of this
evidence and in view of the fact that there is a lack of any
substantial Indication of dependence on the drug, It was reasoned
that marihuana might be useful in alleviating the withdrawal
symptoms in drug addicts. However, the studies here described
were not sufficiently complete to establish the value of such
treatment . . . . </p>

<p>A study was then undertaken at Riker's Island (N.Y.)
Penitentiary involving 56 morphine or heroin addicted inmates.
Two groups were equally matched according to age, physical
condition, length and intensity of habit, etc. One group received
no treatment or Magendie's solution, and the other received 15
mg. of THC and/or placebo. </p>

<p>&quot;The impression was gained that those who received
tetrahydrocannabinol had less severe withdrawal symptoms than
those who received no treatment or who were treated with
Magendie's solution&quot; the report stated. However, the report
further said that this alleged therapeutic use of marihuana
should be &quot;investigated under completely controlled
conditions&quot; before meaningful conclusions can be developed
(New York City Mayor, AU: 147-148). </p>

<p>Some reports indicate that cannabis helps relieve labor pains.
Such uses are reported among native tribes in South Africa and
Southern Rhodesia: &quot;The Suto tribe fumigates the parturient
woman to relieve pain;&quot;the Sotho women of Basutoland
&quot;are reported as smoking cannabis to stupefy themselves
during childbirth,&quot; and have also been known to
&quot;administer the ground-up achene with bread or mealiepap to
a child during weaning&quot; (Watt, 1962:13). </p>

<p>The use of cannabis in the treatment of leprosy has been
described in a 1939 dictionary of Malayan medicine: &quot;Seeds
of Hydnocarpus anthelmintim ... form the basis of the Tai Foon
Chee treatment of leprosy. After crushing and sieving, they are
mixed with cannabis indica in the proportion of two parts of the
seeds to one of Indian hemp&quot; (Andrews and Vinkenoog, 1967:
146). Likewise, Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk quote Pappe that
&quot;the early colonist employed a decoction in the treatment of
chronic cutaneous eruptions, possibly in leprosy (Andrews and
Vinkenoog, 1967: 146). </p>

<p>Kabelik, Krejci, and Santavy have reported favorable results
&quot;in stornatitis aphtosa, gingivitis, and in paradentoses
with a mouthwash of the following composition: Tinct. Cannabis
20.0, Tinct. Chamomillae, Tinct. jernmarum populi (or another tan
for example, Tinct. Gallarum) aa 10.0 to be applied in the form
of sprays or linaments to the inside of the mouth&quot; (Kabelik
et al., 1960: 13). </p>

<p>In reference to the use of cannabis, Chopra and Chopra (1957:
12-13) listed some preparations used in the practice of
indigenous medicine in India in 1957. They summarize their
article &quot;The Use of the Cannabis Drugs in India&quot; (1957:
12-13) by saying: </p>

<p>. . . with regard to the use of cannabis in Indian indigenous
medicine at the present time, it may be said that It was and
still is fairly extensively used in both the Ayurvedle (Hindu)
and Tibbi (Mohammedan) systems of medicine as an anodyne,
hypnotic, analgesic and antispasmodic, and as a remedy for
external application to piles. It is also used in the treatment
of dysmennorhoea, rheumatism, chronic diarrhoea of the sprue
type, gonorrhoea, malaria and mental diseases on the advice of
itinerant practitioners of Indigenous medicine as well as quacks
who roam about the country. For medicinal purposes the drug is
administered by mouth and hardly ever by smoking. </p>

<p>The use of cannabis drugs in indigenous medicine has greatly
declined during recent years for two reasons-firstly, because of
the rapid deterioration of the potency of cannabis drugs in
storage, the specimens available on the market being often Inert
and quite useless; secondly, because a number of potent and
effective drugs of the type used In western medicine are now
available on the market and are used quite extensively by the
practitioners of indigenous medicine in place of cannabis, for
the anodyne, sedative and hypnotic effects. In the rural areas of
India, however, the practitioners of indigenous medicine still
use cannabis quite extensively In their practice.<br>
</p>

<p>The same article lists a variety of uses in which cannabis is
employed therapeutically in veterinary medicine. </p>

<p>Dr. R. N. Chopra (1940: 361) reports the following medicinal
household uses of Indian Hemp:<br>
</p>

<p>The hemp drugs are popularly used as household remedies in the
amelioration of many minor ailments. A mild beverage made from
bhang leaves is believed to sharpen appetite and to help
digestion. Indian hemp Is commonly used as a smoke and as a drink
for its supposed prophylactic value against marihuana in
malarious tracts. Bhang beverages form one of the popular
household remedies for gonorrhoea and dysuria. On account of
their mild diuretic and sedative properties these drinks probably
give a certain amount of symptomatic relief. Likewise, the use of
bhang for dysmenorrhea, asthma, and other spasmodic conditions is
not uncommon. A poultice made from fresh leaves is a common
household remedy for painful affections of the eyes,
conjunctivitis, swollen joints, orchitis, and other acute
inflammatory conditions. <br>
Tuberculosis, anthrax, tetanus, and menstrual cramps are among
the miscellaneous medical uses of cannabis reported. Reports from
Mexico indicate the use of marihuana smoking &quot;to relax and
to endure heat and fatigue&quot; (Mikuriya, 1969: 37). </p>

<p>Kabelik et al. (1960: 13) also discuss other varied uses of
cannabis. <br>
</p>

<p>In human therapy the best results have been obtained with the
following medicaments combined with substances derived from
cannabis: dusting powder together with boric acid (otitis),
ointment (staphylococcus infected wounds, staphylodermia and so
on), ear drops (otitis chron.), alcohol solutions with glycerine
(treatment of rhagades on the nipples of nursing women-prevention
of staphylococcic mastitis,) aqueous emulsions (sinusitis),
dentin powder with the IRC (Isolated Resin from Cannabis)
(caries). The preparations mentioned above have been already
tested clinically, and will eventually be made available for
production. . . . the experiments made in clinical practice,
particularly in stomatology, otorhinolaryngology, gynecology,
dermatology, phisiology, with some pharmaceutical preparations
containing antibacterial substances from cannabis have been
reported. Attention has been drawn to the advantageous
utilization of the active substances from cannabis in veterinary
medicine, and particularly in preventive medicine for
anthropozoonoses.<br>
</p>

<p>Murphy (1963: 20) refers to an article by Lang,
&quot;Treatment of Acute Appendicitis with a Mixture of Ma
Jen,&quot; which says &quot;the drug has apparently been used in
China for the treatment of appendicitis.&quot; The Xosa tribe in
South Africa &quot;employs it for treatment of inflammation of
the feet&quot; (Kabelik et al., 1960: 7), while the Mfengu and
Hottentot use the plant as a snake-bite remedy (Watt, 1962: 13). </p>

<p>Other therapeutic uses attributed to marihuana are for the
treatment of migraine headaches, as an analgesic, and as a
hypnotic. Hollister (1971: 28) stated that &quot;other uses which
have been proposed for marihuana include the treatment of
epilepsy, as prophylaxis for attacks of migraine or facial
neuralgia, or as a sexual stimulant.&quot; <br>

<p><b>Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding</b> </p>

<h1>History of the Intoxicant Use<br>
</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The preceding history of the medical use of marihuana has
provided an outline of how marihuana has been alleged to care
diseases and relieve pain. This section discusses the non-medical
use of cannabis. The survey includes a discussion of marihuana
use in India, the rest of Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United
States; and a concluding analysis of the intoxicant use in
contemporary times. </p>

<p>Assessing marihuana's use as an intoxicant is difficult
because for many people around the world, its importance as an
intoxicant has been secondary to its use as a folk medicine or a
ceremonial adjunct (Grinspoon, 1971: 173-174). Caffeine and
nicotine apart, cannabis is second in worldwide popularity only
to alcohol. </p>

<p><b>India</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana was probably first used as an intoxicant in India
around 1000 B.C., and soon became an integral part of Hindu
culture (Snyder, 1970: 125). In China, where the marihuana plant
had been used to make cloth and certain medicines for centuries,
it was not recorded as an intoxicant. Explanations are unclear as
to why marihuana was used as an intoxicant in India but not in
China. </p>

<p>Marihuana was also used as an intoxicant in other parts of the
world prior to 500 A.D. but was not as well documented as the use
of opium. The drug &quot;nepenthe&quot; in Homer's Odyssey is
believed by a number of scholars to have been a brew in which the
most active ingredient was hemp (Brotteaux, 1967: 10). Galen
wrote in the second century that it was customary to promote
hilarity and happiness at banquets by giving the guests hemp
(Reininger, 1967: 14-15). </p>

<p>Cannabis is used in three different preparations in India
(Snyder, 1970: 27). The first is called bhang, comparable in
potency to marihuana in the United States. It is made from the
leaves and stems of uncultivated plants and blended into a
pleasant tasting liquid concoction. The second is ganja, more
potent than bhang, made from the tops of cultivated plants. The
third and most potent preparation, charas, is similar to hashish
or &quot;hash&quot; and is obtained by scraping the resin from
the leaves of the cultivated plants. Hard blocks are pressed from
this material which are converted for smoking. </p>

<p>High-caste Hindus are not permitted to use alcohol. But they
are allowed bhang at religious ceremonials, and also employ it as
an intoxicant at marriage ceremonies and family festivals. Bhang
is used by laborers in India in much the same way as beer is used
in the United States (Barber, 1970: 80). </p>

<p>The lower classes of India use either a few pulls at a ganja
pipe or sip a glass of bhang at the end of the day to relieve
fatigue (Grinspoon, 1971: 173), to obtain a sense of well-being,
to stimulate appetite, and to enable them to bear more cheerfully
the &quot;strain and monotony of . . . daily routines&quot;
(Geller and Boas, 1969: 5). These types of users and objectives
are frequently the reverse of those in the United States where
marihuana users consider themselves an exclusive and advanced
&quot;in-group&quot; (Andrews and Vinkenoog, 1967: iii). A major
intoxicant use in India is for religious purposes. </p>

<p><b>Asia and the Middle East</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis spread from India to other parts of Asia, to the
Middle East and then to Africa and South America, although some
believe it may have originated independently in the latter two
continents (Fort, 1969: 15). Cultural values may have played a
part in determining its use. Opium and cannabis were equally
available in pre-Communist China; but cannabis had no vogue as an
intoxicant (Barber, 1970: 80). The Chinese spoke of the plant as
the &quot;Liberator of Sin.&quot; In India, it was called. the
&quot;Giver of Life&quot; (Fort, 1970: 15). One author proposed
that temperament may have also played a role in this
determination, suggesting that perhaps the placid, practical
Chinese did not appreciate the euphoria produced by cannabis
(Snyder, 1070: 125). </p>

<p>Additional evidence of mid-Asian use comes from cuneiform
tablet interpretations that ascribe use in Persia circa 700-600
B.C. and of the time of Ashurbanipal's Assyrian reign, 669-626
B.C. (Blum. and Associates, 1969, 1: 62). </p>

<p>The drug's popularity as an intoxicant spread to the Middle
East and thoroughly permeated Islamic culture within a few
centuries (Geller and Boas, 1969: 5). Because alcohol was
prohibited to the followers of Mohammed, cannabis was accepted as
a substitute. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The Myth of the Assassins</b> </p>

<p>Two Muslim myths, one from the 10th century A.D. and the other
from the 13th century A.D., have been the sources of some of the
contemporary attitudes about the drug. The first myth deals with
hashish as a magical eastern drug brought by the Arabs into Spain
in the 10th century. These invaders confined its use primarily to
themselves, taking it back to Africa when they left Spain.
Although it did not become a European habit, some beliefs about
the drug were left behind. </p>

<p>The existence of this &quot;magical eastern drug&quot; was
probably known to Marco Polo, the Venetian traveler of the 13th
century A.D. before he left on his journey to the East. Marco
Polo returned to Europe with his own tale of cannabis which, in
the potent form of hashish, was said to be used as an intoxicant
by Hasan-I-Sabbah to send his ruthless followers on missions of
murder. The word &quot;assassin&quot; was said to be derived from
the word &quot;hashish,&quot; or from Hasan (Geller and Boas,
1969: 6). Marco Polo had written about how this &quot;Old Man of
the Mountain&quot; sent his men out on their missions with all
the color and pageantry that Europeans associated with the East.
As Marco Polo described: </p>

<p><i>In the territory of the Assassins there were delicious
walled gardens in which one can find everything that can satisfy
the needs of the body and the caprices of the most exacting
sensuality. Great banks of gorgeous flowers and bushes covered
with fruit stand amongst crystal rivers of living water....
Trellises of roses and fragrant vines cover with their foliage
pavilions of jade and porcelain furnished with Persian carpets
and Grecian embroideries.</i> </p>

<p><i>Delicious drinks in vessels of gold or crystal are served
by young boys or girls, whose dark unfathomable eyes cause them
to resemble the Houris, divinities of that Paradise which the
Prophet promised to believers. The sound of harps mingles with
the cooing of doves, the murmur of soft voices blends with the
sighing of the reeds. All is joy, pleasure, voluptuousness and
enchantment.</i> </p>

<p><i>The Grand Master of the Assassins, whenever he discovers a
young man resolute enough to belong to his murderous legions . .
. invites the youth to his table and intoxicates him with the
plant &quot;hashish.&quot; Having been secretly transported to
the pleasure gardens the young man imagines that he has entered
the Paradise of Mahomet. The girls, lovely as Houris, contribute
to the illusion. After he has enjoyed to satiety all the joys
promised by the-Prophet to his elect, he falls back to the
presence of the Grand Master. Here he is informed that he can
enjoy perpetually the delights he has just tasted If he will take
part in the war of the Infidel as commanded by the Prophet </i>(Geller
and Boas, 1969: 6).<br>
</p>

<p>Another translation (Kitti, 1967: 24) begins the tale this
way: </p>

<p>Now no man was allowed to enter the Garden save those whom he
intended to be his ASHISHIN. </p>

<p>In reality, this was a religious situation and scholars have
long since exposed Marco Polo's tale as being a myth, at best an
imaginative embellishment of tales he had heard.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Africa</b> </p>

<p>Use of cannabis in most parts of Africa developed slowly, most
of it during the past 100 years (Blum and Associates, 1969, I:
73). A report from Africa in 1891 (Reininger, 1966: 141-142),
dealt with a tribe that used hemp as an intoxicant in their newly
formed religion and in preparation for battle. A similar use is
described in the Congo, when Simba warriors in 1964 were said to
use a cannabis-alcohol mixture in preparation for battle, to
rouse themselves for the battle and to magically guarantee
immunity from harm. </p>

<p>In Morocco, marihuana, called kif, has been used as an
intoxicant by adult males for centuries; that custom continues
today even though the drug is illegal (Mikuriya, 1970: 122-123). </p>

<p>Although moderate use appears to be tolerated in the areas of
India, North Africa and the Middle East, excessive use is
generally viewed as indicative of serious personality problems
(Geller and Boas, 1969: 7).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Europe</b> </p>

<p>One of the more suggestive parallels between 19th century
France and the United States today is the fact that the French
interest in cannabis at that time was aroused by the returning
French soldiers and scientists of Napoleon's army in Egypt, a
source of the drug. A similar interest occurred in the United
States after the Korean conflict, and has intensified since
Vietnam (Geller and Boas, 1969: 7). </p>

<p>During the 19th century, European interest in the drug was
aided by two scientific reports, the first by W. B. O'Shaughnessy
in 1839, and the second report by Queen Victoria's physician,
Russell Reynolds. Both men recommended its medical use for a
variety of ailments and as a mild euphoriant (Grinspoon, 1971:
56). Cannabis received highly laudatory testimonials from the
medical profession of that day and was readily available without
prescription (Snyder, 1970: 121). </p>

<p>Interest in cannabis was further kindled by popular writers
who used and spoke of hashish enthusiastically, including Charles
Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud, and Pierre Gautier. Gautier and
Baudelaire, in fact, were members of the Club des Hachischins, in
which a number of writers and intellectuals gathered and
experimented with hashish (Geller and Boas, 1969: 13). </p>

<p>Although the public delighted to read of the French writers'
drug experiences, the public did not care to engage in the same
kind of activity; to them the experiences were frightening and
repugnant. &quot;As a result, the smoking of hashish remained the
sub-rosa province of a few European artists until the recent
trans-Atlantic phenomenon of the American drug culture&quot;
(Geller and Boas, 1969: 8).<br>
</p>

<p><b>United States </b></p>

<p>The, events surrounding the introduction of cannabis use to
the New World are entirely unclear. Some historians say the
Spaniards brought the plant with them in the 16th century, other
say marihuana smoking came in with the slave trade or with the
Asian Indian migration of the late 18th century. </p>

<p>The hemp plant was cultivated in the United States for
centuries, apparently without general knowledge of its
intoxicating properties (Grinspoon, 1971: 10). Cannabis was an
often used medicine in the United States in the 19th century. It
was easily available without a prescription and was also widely
prescribed by physicians (Snyder, 1970: 26). Hemp was used by the
pioneers to cover their wagons. The plant was a major crop in
Kentucky, Virginia, Wisconsin and Indiana, and was one of the
more important southern agricultural products, after cotton.. It
is still used to make rope, twine and textiles, while the seed is
used as bird food (Geller and Boas, 1969: 16). </p>

<p>Marihuana use as an intoxicant in the United States began
slowly in the early part of this century. Puerto Rican soldiers,
and then Americans who were stationed in the Panama Canal Zone,
are reported to have been using it by 1916. American soldiers
fighting Pancho Villa circa 1916 also learned to use it. This
follows the first reported use in Mexico in the 1880's (Blum and
Associates, 1969, 1: 69-70). Intoxicant use in the United States
is also traced to the large influx of Mexican laborers in the
1910's and 1920's (Geller and Boas, 1969: 14). </p>

<p>The 1933 Report of the &quot;Military Surgeon&quot; stated,
regarding marihuana use among the soldiers in the Canal Zone,
that: </p>

<p><i>Marihuana as grown and used on the Isthmus of Panama is a
mild stimulant and intoxicant. It is not a &quot;habit
forming&quot; drug in the sense that the derivatives of opium,
cocaine, and such drugs, are as there are no symptoms of
deprivation following its withdrawal.</i> </p>

<p><i>Delinquencies due to marihuana smoking which result in
trial by military court are negligible in number when compared
with delinquencies resulting from the use of alcohol drinks,
which is also classed as a stimulant and intoxicant </i>(Geller
and Boas, 1969: 147).<br>
</p>

<p>The report went on to say that marihuana presented no threat
to military discipline, and &quot;that no recommendations to
prevent the sale or use of marihuana are deemed advisable.&quot; </p>

<p>Cannabis has been rejected in various societies on ascetic
grounds. In such puritanical societies such as the Wahabil of
Arabis and the Senussis of Libya, no smoking of any kind was
tolerated, nor was coffee. In North Africa, social rank dictated
use: the aristocratic Moors scorned both hemp and tobacco
smoking, preferring instead, as compatible with high status,
opium eating (Blum and Associates, 1969, 1: 73). </p>

<p>One statement highlighting this kind of value conflict comes
from a Nigerian journalist (Davies, 1966: 299-300) attempting to
explain the 15-year prison sentences of foreign tourists for
growing and smoking marihuana: </p>

<p><i>There is a growing trend in the more economically advanced
countries to indulge at leisure in the exploration of the
personality. At a certain stage of development, there is less
need to produce and more time to spend consuming. This is
healthy. If used properly, marihuana could be helpful at this
stage of development. However, countries which are only beginning
to develop a more complex economic structure must channel all
their energies into creating a new system. This means that they
must sacrifice more of their pleasure. People who smoke hemp seem
on the whole to be less aggressive than people who drink alcohol.
Hemp smoking may have a positive value for certain social
functions....</i> </p>

<p><i>One of the first acts of the Military Government was to
issue a decree making it punishable by death to grow marihuana,
and by up to twenty years of prison for merely being in
possession of it . . . meantime, we Nigerian have to stop getting
high for a while and develop our country.<br>
</i></p>

<p>In the United States, the decade of the 1960's has seen a
spectacular and unprecedented spread of the use of marihuana,
chiefly among the youth. An estimated 24 million persons have
used marihuana and approximately 3.4 million are current users.
The numbers involved and the fact that use spans all age groups
and social classes in American life has produced marked public
reaction and a need for more information on the drug.<br>

<p> <b>II. Biological Effects of Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>Botanical and Chemical Considerations<br>
<img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</h1>

<p> Cannabis sativa is one of man's oldest and most widely used
drugs. The substance has been used in various ways as long as
medical history has been recorded and is currently used as a
multipurpose drug throughout the world (Adams, 1942; Adams,
1941-1942; Grinspoon, 1969; Indian Hemp, 1969; Walton, 1938). </p>

<p> During the past few years, a resurgence of the use of
marihuana by western society, its increased importance as a
social issue and the development of more precise compounds and
analytic techniques have sparked dormant scientific interest in
the substance. However, this effort has added little to what was
already known about the clinical syndrome produced by cannabis
(Hollister, 1971) and described by investigators during the last
100 years (Hollister, 1971; Beaudelaire, 1861; Moreau, 1845;
Lewin, 1964; Indian Hemp, 1969; Mayor's Committee, 1944). </p>

<p> Strongly held, diametrically opposed opinions exist about
whether the ultimate effects of cannabis use are harmful,
harmless, or beneficial to human functioning (Pillard, 1970). </p>

<p> Despite these conflicting opinions, from a scientific
perspective, the literature on marihuana is as clear, if not
clearer, than for many other botanical substances consumed by
man. Most of the older reports suffer from multiple scientific
defects such as biased sampling, lack of adequate controls,
unsophisticated techniques, and use of unstandardized marihuana
of unknown potency. Nevertheless, much is known about the use of
cannabis by man. Marihuana has a unique position in the multitude
of pharmaceuticals in that human experimentation has been greater
than laboratory animal experimentation. </p>

<p> The crucial experiments about social effects from chronic use
will be settled by close observation of those who use the drug.
The issues of potential therapeutic utility; mechanisms of mental
function alteration; and the relationship to mental illness will
require more extensive laboratory experimentation (Hollister,
1971).<br>
</p>

<h2>Botanical and Chemical Considerations</h2>

<p> In the past several years considerable progress has been made
in adding to the understanding of marihuana as a complex drug
containing botanical substance. Much important information has
been obtained from intensive investigation of marihuana of
worldwide origin cultivated under Government contract by the
University of Mississippi (Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Marihuana is a preparation derived from the hemp plant,
Cannabis sativa. This plant is an annual which either is
cultivated or grows freely as a weed around the world, including
most of the United States. When cultivated in temperate climates,
plantings are made in May to June. The seeds germinate in less
than a week. in moist soil. After thinning, the plants grow as
rapidly as two feet a week during the peak growing season. They
can reach a height of up to 18 feet at maturity, approximately
three to five months after planting. Growth is greatly inhibited
by inadequate light, water or soil nutrients. </p>

<p> Marihuana is produced by cutting the stem beneath the lowest
branches, air drying, and stripping seeds, bracts, flowers,
leaves and small stems from these plants. Stems and seeds are
variably removed using a mesh screen producing manicured
marihuana. Hashish is produced by scraping the thick resinous
material secreted by the flowers (Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Many morphological variations in branching and leaf structure
are observed among plants produced by different seed types. The
characteristic leaf is palmately-compound and contains an odd
number of coarsely serrated leaflets. Plants of a given seed type
generally grow at similar rates and resemble each other. Thus,
botanists believe, Cannabis sativa represents a single species
which has not stabilized and has many variations (Doorenbos et
al., 1971). </p>

<p> Cannabis Sativa is a dioecious species with separate male and
female plants, both producing flowers. Some monoecious variants
are reported. Pollination appears to be accomplished by air
currents. Bees are attracted by male flowers but not by female
flowers. Sex cannot be established until flowering begins and the
structure of the male and female flower is distinct. Male plants
begin shedding leaves shortly after flowering, shied their pollen
and die. Female plants lose their older leaves as the seed
matures. After shedding their seed, they die. Contrary to popular
belief, there is no significant difference in drug content
between male and female plants at equivalent states of maturity
(Fetterman et al., 1970; Ohlsson et al., 1971). Male plants
mature earlier than the females, shed their pollen and die while
the female plant is continuing to mature. </p>

<p> The drug content of the plant parts is variable. Generally,
the, drug content decreases in the following order: bracts,
flowers, leaves. Practically no cannabinoids are found in the
stems, roots and seeds. Obviously, fluctuations in pharmacologic
activity of a sample of Marihuana, depend on the mixture of these
plant parts which is determined by the manicuring process
(Fetterman et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Different variants of the plant contain different amounts of
psychoactive drug. Variants of cannabis Sativa cover a spectrum
of drug contents. Generally, they can be classified as either
drug or fiber genotype. Drug type is high in THC and low in
cannabidiol and the fiber type is the converse. This type is
determined genetically and transmitted by the seed. </p>

<p> Thus, seeds from different geographical areas produce plants
with a wide range of drug content. For example, when grown under
similar conditions, plants grown from seeds from Mexico may
contain 15 times more psychoactive drug than those grown from
seeds from Iowa. Of course, individual plants of the same variant
often contain greatly different drug content (Fetterman, et al.,
1970). </p>

<p> Environmental factors are not as important as heredity in
determining type, but they influence to some degree the drug
content. However, environmental factors, including type of soil,
water, growing space, temperature and light do play an important
role in determining the size and vitality of the plant (Doorenbos
et al., 1971; Ohlsson et al., 1971; Phillips et al., 1970). </p>

<p> This notorious variability of cannabis preparations causes
many disadvantages for detailed and reproducible biological work.
Consequently, much effort has been expended to provide a firm
chemical basis in order to provide pure and well-defined
substances for research. </p>

<p> The major naturally occurring active component of cannabis,
1-delta 9-trans tetrahydrocannabinol, was not isolated in a pure
form and its structure illucidated until 1964 (Gaoni and
Mechoulam, 1964; Mechoulam and Gaoni, 1967; Mechoulam et al.,
1970). In addition, the A' isomer, which is usually present in
small quantities in the natural product representing less than
10% of the combined THC content, has a similar spectrum of
activity (Hively et al., 1966). These two chemicals, available by
industrial synthesis (Fahrenholtz et al., 1967; Petrzilka and
Sikemeier, 1967) or by extraction from the natural plant, can
apparently reproduce fully the effects of the crude drug in
animals and man. More than 20 natural cannabinoids have been
identified in the plant (Figure 1) (Mechoulam, 1970; Shani and
Mechoulam, 1970; Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> All but Delta 11 and Delta 9 THC are inactive
psychopharmacologically and do not seem to exert potentiating or
other effects. However, new compounds, cannabinoids and
non-cannabinoids, are being isolated from the plant and require
further investigation. Several studies may indicate that some
material present in natural marihuana may act synergistically
with THC and potentiate its psychological effect Leniber (1972)
Paton and Pertwee (1971) suggest cannabidiol may play this role. </p>

<p> The chemical nomenclature of tetra-hydrocannabinols is in a
state of confusion due to the existence of two numbering systems.
The dibenzopyran or formal system treats the compound as
substituted dibenzopyrans ( Delta 9 THC) while the monoterpenoid
system considers them as substituted terpenes (Al THC). The
formal system will be used hereafter (Figure 2).<br>
</p>

<p> Many of the natural cannabinoids are present in the plant as
acids. These acids are believed to be psychopharmacologically
inactive. However, they are converted rapidly when heated, and
slowly when stored into their respective active neutral
components (Figure 3) (Waller, 1971). This conversion
(decarboxylation) does not apparently occur when the acids are
absorbed after oral consumption (Mechoulam, 1970). </p>

<p> The proposed biogenesis (Figure 4) of All THC appears to
proceed through cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis variates of the fiber
type apparently do not perform this conversion. Thus, cannabidiol
is the cannabinoid present in the largest percentage in the
non-drug variety (Phillips et al., 1970). Marihuana appears to
lose its potency over time due to conversion of THC to cannabinol
(CBN) (Mechoulam, 1970) and this also apparently occurs more
quickly for hashish implying the presence of a stabilizing
substance in the whole plant (Figure 5). </p>

<p> Recently, the n-propyl homologue, of Delta 9 THC has been
isolated from crude marihuana. It has about 20% of the activity
of Delta THC in mice, and probably makes only a small
contribution to the total marihuana effect (Gill, 1971). Merkus
(1971) and Vree et al. (1971) have recently identified propyl and
methyl cannabinol homologues in hashish in extremely small
quantities. </p>

<p> In addition, numerous other non-cannabinoids have been
identified in the natural material. Most of these have little or
no psychoactivity (Gill et al., 1970; Bercht et al., 1971).
Recently, waxes. starches, oils, terpenes and simple nitrogenous
compounds including muscarine, choline and trigonelline as well
as volatile low-molecular weight piperdines have been isolated. </p>

<p> Additionally, four more complex nitrogenous containing
compounds of the generally-accepted alkaloid type have been
reported in marihuana leaves in minute concentrations (average
0.002%). These produced decreased activity but no acute toxicity
in mice (Klein et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Another laboratory has isolated two steroids and triterpenes
from. marihuana as well as tyramine amide derivatives from the
roots (Doorenbos et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Analysis of the smoke obtained from marihuana has been
investigated. As in the case of any combustible plant, a gas and
particulate phase is produced. Both these phases are delivered to
the lung. Both the gas and particulate phase consist of compounds
present in approximately the same percentages as other burned
cellulose containing materials except for the cannabinoid
fraction. This includes carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
hydrogen cyanide gases. (Truitt et al. , 1970) </p>

<p> The remainder, the smoke condensate, consists of a complex
mixture of relatively non-volatile compounds. Included in this
mixture are the cannabinoids (16%), carbohydrates and alcohols
(8%), fatty and aromatic acids (11%), polybasic acids (7%),
aliphatic amines (1%), aromatic phenols (27%), aliphatic phenols
(6%), tannin (6%), unidentified compounds (18%) (Truitt et al.,
1970). </p>

<p> Another group of investigators (Magus and Harris, 1971)
compared the tar collected from combustion of marihuana
cigarettes with the tar yielded from tobacco cigarettes. They
reported that the total tar yield from marihuana was slightly
less than half that produced by an equal weight of tobacco. The
tar contained similar constituents based on typical changes
produced on skin of mice. </p>

<p> In addition, there a multitude of synthetic compounds related
to the naturally occurring Delta 9 THC derivatives and much more
potent (Figure 6). A large number of bomologues have been
prepared all with similar activity but differing widely in their
potency. </p>

<p> In general, the activity of these compounds increases
dramatically over that of A' THC by lengthening the 3 alkyl side
chain to 6 and 7 carbons, with additional branching in the alpha
and beta positions. The dimethylheptyl analogue (EA1476 or DMHP)
is the most active having 50 times the activity of A' THC. The
1-methyloctyl substitution (MOP, EA1465) is the next most potent,
compound. The 1,2-dimethylortyl substitution resulted in a 251
fold decreased activity from DMHP. (Domino et al., 1972; Sim and
Tucker, 1963) </p>

<p> Numerous variations of the basic structures in the
cyclohexene moeity of the molecule, as well as the replacement of
-both methyl groups-by-hydrogen resulted in partial and even
complete, loss of activity (Domino et al., 1972; Sim and Tucker,
1963). </p>

<p> Mechoulam. (1971) has summarized the investigations related
to the structure activity relationships of the cannabinoids as
follows: </p>

<p> (1) The pyran ring with a hydroxyl group at 1 position and an
alkyl group at the 3 position is an essential requirement for
psychotomimetic activity, eg., cannabidiol is inactive. </p>

<p> (2) The aromatic hydroxyl group has to be f reo or esterified
for activity. </p>

<p> (3) The presence of a carboxyl, acetyl or carbomethoxyl group
in position 2 or 4 renders the compound inactive. Substitution
with an alkyl ,group at position 2 retains activity. </p>

<p> (4) Dextrorotary (+) delta-9-THC is inactive whereas its
optical isomer levorotary (-) delta9-THC is active. </p>

<p> (5) Maximal activity is seen if the double bond is in the
delta-9 or delta-8 position. The delta,-6a, 10a-THC is relatively
inactive. 9 (6) The activity of the delta-6a, 10a-THC can be
increased by replacement of the pentyl side chain with a hexyl
side chain to form synhexyl which is an active compound.
Branching of the side chain may lead to considerable increase in
potency. The substitution of a dimethyllheptyl side chain for the
pentyl side chain in the delta-6a, 10a analogue of THC to form
DMHP or EA1476 results in a marked increase in pharmacologic
activity.<br>
</p>

<p> (7) Substituents at the 9 and 10 position have to be in the
plane of the ring (that is equatorial) in order that high
activity be retained. </p>

<p> More detailed information on materials, chemistry, bioassays,
analytical methods, and methodology for detecting THC or its
metabolites in biological fluids may be obtained from The
Metabolism of the Tetrahydrocannabinols (Lemberger, 1972) and The
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 1972 Report on
Marihuana and Health.<br>

Effect </title>

<h1>Factors Influencing Psychopharmacological Effect<br>
</h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> A renewed interest in marihuana studies has been prompted by
the recent clarification of the complexities of its chemistry,
new techniques to quantity the amounts of active drug in natural
materials, and the availability of purified
tetrahydrocannabinols. These advances allow more precise
scientific research on psychiopharmacological effect.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP<br>
</b> </p>

<p> A major advance has been a quantification of dose of THC in
relation to clinically observable phenomena. This has been
extensively studied over a wide dose range for marihuana (Rodin
and Domino, 1970; Melges et al., 1970; Tinklenberg et al., 197O;
Weil et al., 1968; Meyer et al., 1971; Clark and Nakashima, 1968;
Clark et al., 1970; Jones and Stone, 1970; Mayor's Committee,
1944; Manno et al., 1970) and Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol
(Isbell et al., 1967; Waskow et al., 1970; Hollister et al.,
1968; Perez-Reyes and Lipton, 1971; Lemberger et -al., 1971;
Dornbush and Freedman, 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> Investigations by Isbell et al. (1967), Kiplinger et al.
(1971) and Renault et al. (1971) have clearly demonstrated that
when reliable quantities of smoked marihuana or THC are delivered
to the subject, a reproducible linear dose-dependent effect
occurs on indices of physiologic, psychomotor, and mental
performance as well as on mood and subjective experiences over a
dose range of 12.50 to 200 micrograms of Delta 9 THC per kilogram
of body weight.<br>
</p>

<p> In a 154 pound man this is comparable to consuming 0.88 to
17.5 milligrams of Delta 9 THC or 88 to 150 milligrams of
marihuana containing one percent Delta 9 THC. It is generally
assumed that good quality marihuana available in the United
States contains 1% Delta 9 THC and an average marihuana cigarette
consists of 500 milligrams of marihuana; thus, 5 milligrams of
Delta 9 THC (Hollister, 1971). </p>

<p> As with most drugs, the larger the dose taken, the greater
the psychopharmacologic effect. Isbell et al. (1967) noted that
clinical syndromes vary from a mild euphoric feeling of
relaxation at low doses (25 micrograms per kilogram) to an
intensive hallucinogenic-like experience at high doses (250
micrograms per kilogram).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>DOSE-TIME RELATIONSHIP<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Similar time-action curves have been demonstrated for smoked
Delta 9 THC and equivalent quantities of smoked marihuana
(Hollister et al.,1968; Isbell et al., 1967 Renault et ai., 1971
Kiplinger et al., 1971). Symptoms began almost immediately after
smoking (2-3 minutes). At lower doses, the peak effect is seen at
10 to 20 minutes and the duration of effect is 90 minutes to two
hours. At higher doses, symptoms persist for three to four hours.
</p>

<p> Therefore, as with most drugs, the larger the dose taken, the
longer the action. The subjective symptoms experienced by the
subject appear to parallel in time the subjective effects and
some physiological indices such as pulse rate (Isbell et al.,
1967; Hollister, 1968 - Renault and Schuster, 1971; Kiplinger et
al., 1971; Galanter et al., 1972; Lemberger et al., 1971). Others
such as reddening of the eyes have a delayed peak response and
longer duration (Kiplinger et al., 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION<br>
</b> </p>

<p> A second factor which influences the effect experienced by
the user is the manner in which the substance is consumed. That
is, whether it is smoked, swallowed or injected. </p>

<p> Isbell et al. (1967) demonstrated that smoked material is two
and a half to three times as effective as orally consumed
marihuana in the form of a 95% ethanolic solution in producing
equivalent physiologic and subjective effects.<br>
</p>

<p> In addition, the oral time-action curve is extended with
onset of symptoms one-half to one hour after administration. A
peak effect is reached in two to three hours and the effect
persists for three to five hours at low doses and six to eight
hours at larger doses (Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell, et -al.,
1967; Lemberger et al., 1971; Perez-Reyes, and Lipton, 1971). </p>

<p> In general, the effects produced by ingested THC or ingested
marihuana extract are comparable to those produced by nearly
one-third the amount of smoked and inhaled THC or marihuana
(Hollister, 1971). </p>

<p> Recent work has been reported which clarifies these findings.
Lemberger et a]. (1971) studied absorption into the blood
utilizing radioactive labeled THC by three routes of
administration: smoked, ingested in 95% ethanolic solution in
cherry syrup, and intravenously injected. The first appearance of
the drug into the, blood was immediate intravenously; almost
immediate, by inhalation; and delayed for 15 to 30 minutes when
ingested. </p>

<p> Perez-Reyes and Lipton (1971) using labeled AO THC
demonstrated that rate of absorption by the gastrointestinal
tract, and the duration of action is greatly influenced by the
vehicle used to ingest the drug. Speed and completeness of
absorption varied when the THC was dissolved in 100% ethanol or
sesame oil or emulsified with a bile salt (sodium glycocholate),
and administered to a subject who had fasted 12 hours. With the
bile salt vehicle, the physiologic and subjective effects were
noted between 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and lasted two to
three hours. In contrast, the effects, with ethanol or sesame
oil, appeared after one ,hour and lasted four to six hours.<br>
</p>

<p> Hollister and Gillespie (1970) hypothesized that this delayed
gastrointestinal absorption of THC might be accounted for by the
nonpolar vehicle required to dissolve TUC or marihuana extracts. <br>
</p>

<p> Furthermore, Perez-Reyes and Lipton (1971) found that the
peak levels and duration of radioactivity in the plasma
paralleled the physiologic and subjective effects, although the
plasma levels remained high for a longer period of time than the
effect. Subjects receiving the drug emulsified in sodium
glycocholate or dissolved in sesame oil had three times higher
plasma levels of radioactivity with much less excreted in the
feces than those receiving the drug dissolved in ethanol. </p>

<p> These results indicate that the THC was poorly absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract when given in all alcoholic solution.
The sesame oil solution and the glycocholic acid preparation
allowed more complete absorption and the latter preparation was
much faster. It is of interest that the degree of subjective high
after ingestion of 37 milligrams Delta 9 THC also parallels the
plasma radioactivity. </p>

<p> Thus, the subjects reported their experience, as intense and
unpleasant both with the bile salt and the sesame oil, and as
moderate and entirely pleasant with ethanol. (Perez-Reyes and
Lipton, 1971) This correlates well with earlier findings of
Hollister et a]. (1968).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>QUANTIFICATION OF DOSE DELIVERED<br>
</b> </p>

<p> The problem in quantifying the THC dose delivered by
different routes of administration has been clarified by several
studies using radioactive compounds. However, until a method for
determining the THC blood concentration is developed, only
estimates oil amount delivered are possible. </p>

<p> Radioautographic studies clearly demonstrate that intravenous
injection gives the, most complete and consistent delivery
(Lemberger et a]., 1971; Me Isaac et M., 1971; Ho et a]., 1971;
Kennedy and Waddell, 1971; Idanpaan-Heikkila, 1971). These
investigators have demonstrated that THC is poorly absorbed from
the injection site after intraperitoneal or subcutaneous
injection. </p>

<p> As discussed earlier, the completeness of absorption ocurring
after oral administration of THC appears to depend upon the
vehicle. Judged by radioactivity levels, almost complete
absorption of the THC occurs with an oil or bile acid vehicle,
but absorption is incomplete with an alcohol vehicle.
(Perez-Reyes et al., 1971) <br>
</p>

<p> Recent animal studies performed for NIMH indicated that the
oral dose necessary to produce comparable gross behavioral
changes in lab animals is about three times higher than the
intravenous dose (Marihuana and Health. 1971: 171). Ferraro
(1971) demonstrated the comparability of effective oral doses of
THC in chimpanzees and humans. Furthermore, preliminary work
performed in the laboratories of M. Isaac (1971) and Harris
(1971) and Mechoulam (1971) appear to indicate that the
intravenously administered dose of Delta 9 THC necessary to
produce detectable behavioral changes in monkeys (20 to 50
microgram/ kg) on conditioned learning tasks is comparable to
that in man. (Kiplinger et a]., 1971; Lemberger et al., 1971). <br>
</p>

<p> The dose of THC absorbed from natural marihuana extracts
ingested orally is uncertain. THC is present as an acid in
variable quantities in natural marihuana. THC acid has not
presently been proven to be active. Claussen and Korte (1968)
reported that the THC carboxylic acid is converted to free THC
during the smoking process. Whether these, acids are active
themselves; are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or
converted there into THC; or are decarboxylated in the, body is
unknown presently.<br>
</p>

<p> Because inhalation is the most widely used route of
administration of marihuana, several laboratories have
investigated the effect of combustion and smoking oil marihuana.
Because techniques and conditions varied between laboratories,
precise quantification of the delivery to the smoker's lungs is
uncertain.<br>
</p>

<p> Manno, et al. (1970) calculated that about 50% of the THC
contained in a marihuana cigarette would be delivered to the
smoker's lungs for absorption if the entire cigarette were smoked
in 10 minutes and each inhalation was retained for 30 seconds
with no sidestream loss. Truitt (1971) and co-workers (Foltz et
al., 1971) found that 50%c of THC was pyrolyzed and 6% was lost
in the side stream while noting that almost 21% of the THC
remained in the butt when three-fourths of the cigarette is
consumed. </p>

<p> Agurell and Leander (1971) studied the transfer of THC using
actual smoking subjects where only the main stream smoke was
collected. They found that 14-29%% of the THC was transferred in
the mainstream smoke for a cigarette and 45% for a pipe. However,
they stated that this amount transferred would be comparable if
no butt was left. </p>

<p> Agurell and Leander found that the amount transferred was not
effected by depth of inhalation but that smokers using deep
inhalation retained 80% of the transferred THC while those using
superficial inhalation tended to exhale more than 20% of the
transferred THC. Mikes and Waser (1971) also found about 22% in
the mainstream smoke. </p>

<p> These divergent data appear to be comparable when corrected
for loss to sidestream and retention in the unsmoked portion.
Thus, the efficiency of delivery of THC by smoking and inhalation
using good techniques, and smoking the entire cigarette
approximates 40-50% of the original THC contained. A small
fraction is lost in the uninhaled sidestream smoke, about 50% is
destroyed during pyrolysis and a variable amount is exhaled from
the respiratory dead space. </p>

<p> In apparent confirmation, Lemberger et al. (1971, 1972),
using radiolabeled THC added to a marihuana cigarette, found that
the initial plasma level of radioactivity after smoking was about
onehalf the level after intravenous injection. Oral
administration of the same dose of THC in an alcohol vehicle
produced about one-half the peak level as smoking. However,
Galanter et al. (1972) noted marked variability in the amount of
THC absorbed using a standardized routine of inhaling,
breath-holding and finishing the cigarette within a set time
period.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>EFFECT OF PYROLYSIS ON THE CANNABINOIDS<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Several investigators have studied the effect of pyrolysis on
the cannabinoids. Most have concluded that only negligible
changes occur in the original cannabinoid fraction of marihuana
except for decarboxylation of the acids to the cannabinoids. No
evidence was found for isomerization of Delta 9 THC or Delta 8
THC nor the formation of any new pyrolysis products (Manno et
al., 1970; Coutselinis &amp; Miras, 1970; Claussen and Korte,
1968; Foltz et al., 1971; Agurell and Leander, 1971). Mikes and
Waser (1971) suggested that a small percentage of cannabidiol was
converted to Delta 9 THC, but this observation was not confirmed
by the other groups. </p>

<p> Coutselinis and Miras (1970) noted that less THC was
destroyed during smoking when Delta 9 THC was the only
cannabinoid present rather than when a resin or a mixture of
cannabinoids were present. This was believed to be at least
partially accounted for by the distribution of THC in the
cigarette. More destruction occurred when the THC was evenly
distributed in the cigarette than when it was present in a
well-defined lump.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>SET AND SETTING</b> </p>

<p> A most important variable encountered when evaluating the
effect of marihuana is the interaction of the drug with the
non-drug factors, set and setting. Set refers to the drug-taker's
biological make-up including personality, past drug experiences,
personal expectations of drug effect, and mood at the time of the
drug experience. Setting refers to the external surroundings and
social context in which the individual takes the drug. Set and
setting exert their largest effect on psychoactive drugs, like
marihuana, with subtle subjective mental effect and minimal
physiological effect. Set and setting exert a variable but often
marked influence on the potential drug effects (Waskow et al.,
1970; Wickler, 1970). </p>

<p> The results of a series of experiments by Jones (1971)
suggests the subjective state produced by &quot;a socially
relevant dose of smoked marihuana.... 9mg THC&quot; is determined
more by set and setting than by the THC content of the marihuana.
</p>

<p> In one experiment, a greater variety and more intense
pleasurable symptoms occurred in a fourman group allowing
unstructured interpersonal interaction than in unstructured
solitary test situations. Contrasting behavioral patterns were
observed by the investigator and reported subjectively by the
individuals. Subjects tested individually demonstrated a relaxed,
slightly drowsy, undramatic state as they read, listened to the
radio, or sit doing nothing. In the group setting there was
elation, euphoria, uncontrolled laughter, a marked lack of
sedation and much conversation. (Jones, 1971) </p>

<p> This strongly emphasizes the importance of setting in the
marihuana experience. The reason is apparent why marihuana is
usually used with other people. However, most investigators
studying its effects evaluate their subjects alone, in
well-controlled, sterile, scientific laboratories. </p>

<p> The importance of the placebo effect (the subject experiences
a drug effect from an inert material) to the &quot;social
high&quot; obtained from marihuana was studied in another
experiment (Jones and stone, 1970; Jones, 1971). Misjudgments of
the pharmacologic potency of both the smoked placebo (marihuana
without THC) and active marihuana were commonly made by the
subjects although physiologic and performance indices routinely
matched the distinction correctly. The smoking of a material that
smells and tastes like marihuana by individuals with marihuana
experience appeared to produce a mental state that is interpreted
as being high if combined with the expectation of becoming high. </p>

<p> The importance of learning to get high was demonstrated when
individuals who smoked marihuana less than twice a month were
compared with those who used marihuana at least seven times a
week. Although both groups rated the active marihuana equally
potent, the frequent users rated the placebo equally to the
active drug, while the infrequent users experienced significantly
less high from the placebo. </p>

<p> The infrequent users' experiences appears to reflect mainly
pharmacologic factors with moderate set-setting influence.
However, the frequent users' response to the placebo appears to
reflect mainly learned set-setting influence and minimal
pharmacologic factors. (Jones, 1971) </p>

<p> Smith and Mehl (1970) call learning to get high &quot;
reverse tolerance.&quot; During the early exposures to marihuana
the individual learns to appreciate the subtle drug effect with
repeated experience with the drug. Consequently, less drug may be
required to experience the desired high in the early stages of
marihuana use. </p>

<p> Further evidence for this is seen when the familiar smoking
route and smell and taste cues are made ineffective by giving the
active and inactive material by the oral route (Jones and Stone,
1970). Both groups of users can significantly distinguish the
intoxication produced by 25mg of active material. But the
frequent user rates this high significantly poorer than his
smoking high while the infrequent user rates them correctly.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>TOLERANCE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> The development of tolerance is another important factor that
may influence the psychophysiological effects of marihuana.
Although tolerance occurs with many drugs and the process has
been studied for over a century, the mechanism of this complex
phenomenon is not completely known. Kalant et a]., (1971) have
extensively discussed tolerance to the psychotropic drugs. </p>

<p> Tolerance has two different connotations. The first, termed
&quot;initial tolerance,&quot; is an expression of the dose of
the drug which the subject must receive at his first exposure to
produce a designated degree of effect. These authors state that a
variety of congenital and environmental factors contribute to the
wide range of differences in &quot;initial tolerance&quot;
observed among different individuals, sexes, species, age groups
and so on. </p>

<p> The second meaning of tolerance is that of an &quot;acquired
change in tolerance&quot; within the same individual as a result
of repeated drug exposures so that an increased drug dose is
required to produce the same specified degree of effect, or the
same dose produces less effect. In this chapter, tolerance will
be used synonymously with &quot;acquired increase in
tolerance.&quot; -Tolerance can only be discussed for each
specific drug action and not for all the actions of a given drug
on the body. That is, tolerance occurs at different rates for
some of the various effects of the same drug on the body and may
not occur for other effects of the same drug. The relationship
between &quot;initial tolerance&quot; and &quot;acquired change
in tolerance&quot; has not been clearly established. </p>

<p> There are two classes of tolerance based on possible
mechanisms. The first, dispositional tolerance refers to changes
in absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism which
produce a reduction in the intensity and duration of contact
between the drug and the target tissue on which it acts. </p>

<p> The second, functional tolerance includes changes in the
properties and functions of the target tissue making it less
sensitive to the same dose of the drug. Physiological tolerance
implies a, change in the target organ while psychological or
&quot;learned tolerance&quot; implies the acquisition of new
skills or functions to replace those changed in the target tissue
(Kalant et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Considerable evidence is accumulating which demonstrates that
tolerance does develop in numerous animal species (pigeons, rats,
dogs, monkeys, chimpanzees, mice) to the behavioral and
physiological effects of marihuana and THC in doses many times
larger (from 1 mg. to 500 mg./ kg/day) than the minimal active
dose (Carlini, 1968; Silva et al., 1968; McMillan et al., 1970,
1971; Frankenheim et al., 1971; Carlini et al., 1970; Thompson et
al., 1971; Pirch et al., 1972; Ferraro, 1971; Elsinore, 1970;
Cole et al., 1971). <br>
</p>

<p> Lipparini et al. (1969) were not able to demonstrate
tolerance in the rabbit. </p>

<p> Tolerance, appears to develop rapidly to high doses even when
injections are spaced up to about a week apart. Tolerance to high
doses appears to be long-lasting with little loss of tolerance
even after a month. But at low doses in the behavioral range,
tolerance appears to completely dissipate in a few days after a
single dose. The magnitude of tolerance development can be large.
After repeated exposure, a dose of over one hundred times the
original produces little effect (McMillan et al., 1971). </p>

<p> The development of tolerance to THC in animals occurs for
some effects but not for others (McMillan et al., 1971; Pirch et
al., 1972; Thompson et al., 1971 ). This differential development
of tolerance may explain why tolerance to certain effects studied
has not been demonstrated (Masur and Khazan, 1970; McMillan et
al., 1971; Barry and Kubena, 1971; Kubena et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Lomax (1971) and Thompson et al. (1971) have noted that the
development of tolerance to one effect of the drug (hypothermia
or sedation) may allow the expression of the opposite effect
(hyperthermia or stimulation) to which tolerance does not
develop. </p>

<p> Cross tolerance has been demonstrated between delta-9-THC,
delta-8-THC and its synthetic analogues. Cross tolerance, has not
been demonstrated between THC and lysergic acid diethylamide
(LSD), mescaline or morphine (McMillan et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Preliminary work performed by McIsaac (1971) and Harris et
al., (1972) demonstrated a reduction in the duration and quality
of response on a conditioned learning task by monkeys on the
seeond intravenously administered dose of THC. Tolerance
developed extremely rapidly so that no effect on behavior was
seen after five days. After a. two-week period without THC, the
animals were retested and the same degree of tolerance had
persisted. The researchers believe these observations might
indicate a rapid behavioral adaption or &quot;learned&quot;
functional tolerance. </p>

<p> However, evidence indicates that dispositional tolerance
and/or physiological type of functional tolerance also plays a
role at least at higher doses. Tolerance develops to the central
nervous system depressant effects, hypotherma hypopnea (Thompson
et al., 1971) and the EEG effects (Pirch et al., 1971) of the
drug. McMillan et al., (1971) have demonstrated that tolerance to
the effects of THC on behavior can be blocked by the hepatic
microsomal enzyme inhibitor, SKF-525-A which has been shown to be
a potent inhibitor of THC metabolism (Dingell et al., 1971).
Methodological techniques must be, developed which will allow
microdistribution studies to be performed in tolerant animals
with low doses of THC before the mechanism of tolerance
development can be clarified. </p>

<p> Evidence for the development of marked tolerance by man has
been suggested by studies of heavy daily very long term users of
hashish, charas or ganja in foreign countries. Reports from the,
Eastern literature (Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Dhunjibhoy, 1930;
Ewans, 1904) and more recently from Greece (Miras, 1965; Fink et
al., 1971) and Afghanistan (Weiss, 1971) relate daily consumption
of enormous quantities of potent cannabis preparation estimated
to contain up to about one gram of THC per day. </p>

<p> Weiss (1971) has noted that daily charas smokers start with
small doses and then in order to achieve the same effect
gradually increase their daily dose about 5-6 times over a 20 to
30 year period. Generally, most reach their maximum dose by age
40 and then gradually decrease their daily dose by 50% usually
ceasing use by their 60's. Some smokers have been noted to raise
their original daily dose up to a maximum of 10 times within the
first two years. </p>

<p> Others have noted that moderate use for many years does not
necessitate increased doses (Sigg, 1963). </p>

<p> At least part of the increase in daily amount of drug used is
accounted for by the finding that the duration -of the
intoxication becomes shorter over the years so that the very
heavy smoker must consume the drug more frequently to remain
intoxicated. Additionally, smokers report that they have on
occasion discontinued use for days or months after which they
experienced similar effects at smaller doses (Weiss, 1971). </p>

<p> Fink et al. (1971) noted that as hashish users total daily
dose was decreased by more than half over the years, the
frequency of use per day declined correspondingly. </p>

<p> Rubin and Comitas (1972) noted that very long term Jamaican
ganja smokers generally consumed an average of seven spliffs
daily (a ganja cigarette several times the size of an American
marihuana cigarette) with a maximum of 24. </p>

<p> Further evidence for the development of tolerance, at least
to certain of the depressant effects, is that these very long
term smokers apparently tolerate the extremely high doses well
without dysphoria or decreased ability to perform their usual
activities (Weiss, 1971; Fink et al., 1971; Rubin and Comitas,
1972). </p>

<p> Smith and Mehl (1970) noted the, accumulating American
anecdotal evidence of mild tolerance development after heavy
daily use for a number of years. Jones (1971) and Meyer et a].
(1971) have suggested diminished effect on physiologic and
psyochomotor performance, that is, little or no impairment of
function in daily users compared with infrequent, intermittent
users of marihuana. Additionally, several investigators have
noted that frequent users had little or no impairment on
psychomotor performance tasks while marihuananaive individuals
given the same dose had impaired function. (Clark et al., 1968,
1970; Jones and Stone, 1970; Mayor's Committee, 1944; Weil et
al., 1968). </p>

<p> Subsequently (Mendelson et al., 1972) repetitive daily (free
access) use over a 21-day period by groups of long-term
intermittent (average 7.7 sessions per month) and moderate,
marihuana users (daily average, 33 smoking sessions per month)
was studied. The development, of tolerance was strongly suggested
to the physiological pulse rate and general depressant effect on
activity as well as psychological effects which impair recent
memory, time estimation and psychomotor coordination. </p>

<p> No tolerance development occurred to the subjective effects
of marihuana for experienced users over the 21-day period (global
&quot;highness&quot;, somatic, perceptual, awareness, feeling,
control, friendliness, ambivalence and altered thinking).
Furthermore, with the exception of a higher ambivalence rating
for the daily riser group, there were no differences in the
subjective reports of the daily users or intermittent users.
(Mendelson et al., 1972). The ambivalence score is believed (Katz
et al., 1968) to be the best measure of &quot;psychedelic ef
fects&quot; of hallucinogenic drugs. </p>

<p> In a prior study (Meyer et al., 1971) found that while the
heavy smokers experienced more profound subjective effects soon
after smoking, they were less intoxicated than the intermittent
users one hour later. </p>

<p> These findings suggest to the investigators that the quality
of the &quot;high&quot; may be different for heavy and
intermittent users and may change with heavy use. Tolerance, to
the subjective effects of marihuana may occur predominantly to
the depressant effects so that the stimulatory effects (or
hallucinatory-like) would be predominant in the heavy users. The
intermittent users who smoked marihuana several times daily in
the, current study showed no increase in the ambivalence, rating.
</p>

<p> The increased daily frequency of marihuana use by both groups
over time by shortening the interval between smoking sessions
appears consistent with earlier observations (Meyer et al., 1971)
that the duration of the desired &quot;high&quot; is shorter in
heavy users than in intermittent users. </p>

<p> Fink et al. (1971) confirmed several of these findings in a
study in which intermittent users smoked a fixed dose (14 mg. of
THC) of marihuana. They noted a suggestion of development of
tolerance to pulse rate, short-term memory, digit symbol
substitution but not to the subjective high or EEG changes.
However, the subjects did feel that the duration of the
intoxication shortened progressively during the second half of
the experiment. </p>

<p> Schuster and Renault (1971) administered twice daily fixed
doses of marihuana (smoke from 430 mg. of marihuana with 1.5% THC
content) to intermittent users over a 10-day period. A peak
tachycardia, of 20 to 30 beats per minute and a usual social high
were produced. Preliminary observations revealed the development
of tolerance to time estimation in a few days, but no evidence
for tolerance to the tachycardia, orthostatic blood pressure, or
rating of the high. </p>

<p> Hollister (1971), in preliminary studies found no significant
evidence of tolerance after five daily oral doses of 20 mg. of
THC. Clinical responses measured were subjective judgment of the
high, mood, pulse rate, reading comprehension or excretion of
urinary metabolites.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>REVERSE TOLERANCE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Smith and Mehl's (1970) clinical observations of many
marihuana smokers suggest a J-shaped time curve of tolerance to
marihuana. A novice marihuana smoker often reports feeling no
high or requiring considerably more drug to get high on his first
few trials with the drug than after he obtains more experience
with the drug. This phenomenon has been called &quot;reverse
tolerance.&quot; These clinicians believed this represented
&quot;learning to get high&quot; or acquiring the ability to
appreciate or become sensitive to the subtle aspects of the
intoxication.<br>
</p>

<p> Goode (1971) found that more frequent and term marihuana
smokers tend to require fewer &quot;joints&quot; to get high but
differences were not statistically significant. </p>

<p> Weil et al. (1968) reported that experienced users of
marihuana achieved a &quot;high&quot; after being given the same
dose as naive (non-users) persons who did not experience a high
but did demonstrate objective physiologic and psychomotor drug
effects. </p>

<p> Meyer et al. (1971) found that heavy marihuana, users (daily
for three years) were most sensitive to the &quot;high&quot; and
required less marihuana to achieve a social high than infrequent
intermittent users (use one to four times per month for less than
two years). </p>

<p> Phillips et al. (1971) reported an increase in severity of
symptoms after repeated administration of THC to rats. This
&quot;sensitization&quot; may be a correlate of reverse
tolerance. </p>

<p> Lemberger et al. (1971) supplied additional evidence for
reverse tolerance based on the intravenous administration of 0.5
mg of THC to experimental subjects. Naive subjects experienced no
effect from this small dose. However, daily marihuana users, who
were told they were receiving a non-pharmacologically active dose
of THC, reported a &quot;marihuana high,&quot; which lasted up to
90 minutes. </p>

<p> Lemberger et al. (1971, 1972) and Mechoulam (1970) suggested
the possibility that enzymes necessary to convert THC to a more
active compound require prior use of marihuana. </p>

<p> Reverse tolerance appears to be a complex phenomenon. Jones
(1971) presented evidence which stressed the importance of
expectation, setting and prior drug experience on learning to get
&quot;high.&quot; As the user gains more experience with
marihuana, the more the individual's mind is able to respond to
the expectation of the &quot;high&quot; by actually becoming high
when given an inert material which smells and looks like
marihuana. </p>

<p> Weil (1971) believes that the capacity to get
&quot;high&quot; is an inherent characteristic of each
individual's mind. He, believes that marihuana facilitates the
user's abilitv to achieve this altered state of consciousness,
that is, learn how to get high. </p>

<p> Mendelson et al. (1972) did not find evidence for reverse
tolerance. In fact, the daily users were more likely than the
intermittent users to smoke two cigarettes per occasion. Both
groups had had an average of five years of marihuana use. Several
other investigators did not obtain any evidence of reverse
tolerance after repetitive daily use in experienced subjects
(Hollister, 1971; Schuster and Renault, 1971; Fink et al., 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>METABOLISM<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Metabolism of the drug by the body exerts an important
influence on the psychopharmacologic effect of marihuana. Many
laboratories in many countries have been examining the
metabolism, of the cannabinoids using in vitro liver microsomal
enzyme preparations.<br>
</p>

<p> With the recent availability of radiolabeled Delta 9 and
Delta l THC, cannabinol and cannabidiol much activity has
occurred in vivo in animals. A comprehensive review of these
areas including studies of absorption, disposition, excretion,
metabolism and stimulation-inhibition of metabolism is beyond the
scope of this report. Readers interested in further details in
this area are referred to an excellent comprehensive review by
Lemberger (1972). <br>
</p>

<p> From animal and in vitro studies it appears that the liver
rapidly changes Delta 9 and Delta 11 THC in a similar manner by
hydroxylation to 11-OH THC. This compound appears to be as potent
or possibly more potent pharmacologically than the parent
compounds This metabolite appears to be, rapidly hydroxylated to
8-11 dihydroxy Delta 9 THC (7-11 dihydroxy All THC) which is
inactive. The 8-OH Delta THC appears to be a minor active
metabolite (Christensen et al., 1971; Burstein et 1970; Ben-Zvi
et al., 1970; Foltz et al., 1970; Wall et al., 1970,71; Nilsson
et al., 1970). </p>

<p> These metabolites are excreted primarily into the bile and
then to the feces. Some evidence exists for an enterohepatic
circulation returning the drug to the blood. (Miras and
Coutselinis, 1970; Klausner and Dingell, 1971) </p>

<p> Another metabolic pathway appears to be present resulting in
a series of acidic metabolites excreted primarily in the urine
(Agurell et al, I., 1970). Recently, Burstein and Rosenfeld
(1971) isolated and identified a majo r rabbit urinary
metabolite, 11-carboxy-2'-hydroxy-Delta 9 THC. They postulate
that other acidic metabolites might be esters or amides of this
compound (Figure 7). </p>

<p> Recently, Nakazawa and Costa (1971) demonstrated that A' THC
was metabolized by lung microsomes forming two unidentified
products not found in liver homogenates.<br>
</p>

<p> Lemberger et al. (1970, 1971, 1972) and Galanter et al.
(1972) have performed metabolic studies in mail using
intravenous, oral and smoked Delta 9 THC. These studies indicate
that the THC disappears from the plasma in two phases. </p>

<p> The initial rapid phase has two components and represents
metabolism by the liver and redistribution from the blood to the
tissues. The slower second phase represents tissue retention and
slow release and subsequent metabolism. </p>

<p> The plasma 1/2 life of THC was significantly shorter in daily
users than nonusers at both the first component of phase one (10
minutes versus 13 minutes) and phase two (27 hours versus 56
hours). Tissue distribution was similar in daily and nonuser (1/2
life 2 hours). </p>

<p> Therefore, immediate metabolism of THC and subsequent
metabolism is more rapid for daily user than the non-user
implying specific enzyme induction. THC persists in the plasma
for a considerable period of time, at least three days, with a
half life of 57 hours for nonusers and 28 hours for daily users. </p>

<p> The presence of 11-hydroxy THC and more polar metabolites in
the plasma of both users and nonusers within 10 minutes indicates
that the metabolite probably accounts for the pharmacological
activity of marihuana, not THC. </p>

<p> Further metabolism of the 11-hydroxy THC to more polar
inactive 8-11 dihydroxy A' THC metabolite occurs more rapidly in
users than nonusers. During the first few hours after injection,
unchanged THC, its polar metabolites and nonpolar metabolites in
the plasma, decline rapidly and then level off as they are
distributed to the tissues. THC persists in the plasma, for at
least three days, and both users and non-users excrete
metabolites in the urine and feces for more than a week.<br>
<br>
Delta-9-THC is extensively metabolized to more polar compounds
which were excreted in the urine and feces. Urinary excretion and
biliary excretion (reflected a day later in the feces) was
greatest during the initial 24 hours, then gradually tapered off.
All THC is metabolized since no unchanged THC was excreted in the
feces or urine. No difference in total cumulative excretion was
observed but a significantly larger percentage of the metabolites
were excreted in the urine of users than nonusers. About 40-45%
of the metabolites were collected in the feces in both groups in
one week. Urinary excretion in this period accounted for 30% in
daily users and 22% in nonusers. (Lemberger et al., 1970, 1971,
1972) </p>

<p> Perez-Reyes et al. (1971) found a similar pattern of
excretion of metabolites after oral administration. </p>

<p> Urine contained no Delta 9 THC, only a small quantity (3%) of
11-hydroxy THC and 90% more polar acidic compounds as yet
unidentified. (Lemberger, 1971). Preliminary studies by Burstein
and Rosenfeld ('1971) suggest that these human acidic urinary
metabolites are identical to the 11-carboxy-2' hydroxy THC found
in rabbits. </p>

<p> In man, Lemberger et al. (1971, 1972) found that 11-OH THC
and 8-11-OH THC were primarily excreted in the feces. Twenty-two
percent of the metabolites in the feces were unchanged 11-hydroxy
THC and slightly less were 8-11-dihyd-roxy THC. The remainder
were unidentified more polar compounds, perhaps conjugates of
these metabolites. </p>

<p> All user subjects (Lemberger et al., 1970, 1971, 1972) but no
non-user noted a high after intravenous injection of the 0.5 mg
dose of Delta 9 THC. This would be a dose range of 5 to 7
micrograms/kg. Highs have been noted by Kiplinger et al. (1971)
with smoking THC to deliver a dose of 6.25 micrograms/kg. The
high for some lasted up to 90 minutes. Thus, the plasma levels of
Delta 9 THC and its metabolites seen after intravenous injection
suggest that psychopharmacologic effects are seen in the first
component of the rapid phase and terminated by redistribution and
metabolism after the initial phase. The 11-hydroxy Delta 9 THC
would be present at this early phase and is probably responsible
for the activity of Delta 9 THC in marihuana. </p>

<p> Further evidence that the 11-OH Delta 9 THC is responsible
for marihuana's effect was seen in oral and inhalation studies.
By the oral route, blood levels of unchanged THC were relatively
low compared to the radioactivity levels of the metabolic
products at the time of peak subjective effect. While the blood
level of unchanged THC at the peak oral effect was identical to
that after intravenous injection of the 0.5 mg. dose, the
psychologic, effect was much more pronounced after oral
administration of the larger 20 mg. dose of THC. Again after
inhalation, the plasma levels of the metabolites correlate
temporally with the subjective effects but the plasma levels of
unchanged Delta 9 THC do not. (Lemberger, 1970, 1971, 1972;
Galanter, 1972)<br>
</p>

<p> <b>PATTERN OF USE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> The drug effect of marihuana can only be realistically
discussed within the context of who the user is, how long he has
used, how much and how frequently he uses and what is the social
context of the use. In general, for virtually any drug the
heavier the use pattern, that is the longer the duration, the
more frequently the use and the larger the quantity used on each
occasion, the greater the risk for either direct or indirect
damage. </p>

<p> Tolerance development is only one of a variety of occurrences
which are related to the repetitive use of marihuana. Any
discussion of drug effect must take into account the time period
over which the drug is used (duration of use). This is necessary
in order to detect cumulative effects or more subtle
gradually-occurring changes. Of course, the issue of causality is
quite complex because of the multitude of factors other than
marihuana use that have a direct or indirect effect on the
individual over a period of years. </p>

<p> For the purposes of this report, immediate or acute effects
will refer to those drug effects which occur during the drug
intoxication or shortly following it. Short-term or sub-acute
will arbitrarily refer to periods of less than two years;
long-term, from two to 10 years; and very long term (or chronic),
greater than 10 years. </p>

<p> Frequency of use, will arbitrarily be designated in the
following manner: experimental use refers to use of marihuana at
least one time but not more than once a month; intermittent use
refers to use more than once a month but not more than 10 times a
month (several times a week) ; moderate use refers to use of the
drug more than 10 times a month but not more than once a day;
heavy use designates use more than once, daily and very heart use
refers to use many times a day, usually with potent preparations
(high THC content), producing almost continual intoxication so
that the smoker's brain is rarely drug free.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>AMOUNT OF DRUG CONSUMED<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Relatively little actual data are available on the amount of
marihuana, smoked per occasion or per day by current users in the
United States. (McGlothlin, 1971, 1972). Estimates of the
quantity of THC consumed are difficult because of the variability
of potency as well as weight and size of the marihuana cigarette
(&quot;joint&quot;) and the degree of cleaning of stems and seeds
from the dried leaves manicuring&quot;). </p>

<p> The analytic data available indicates most of the marihuana
used in the United States is of Mexican origin and averages about
I % THC per dry cleaned weight of marihuana (Lerner and Zeffert,
1968; Jones, 1971). Subjective ratings by experienced marihuana
users appear to substantiate the data that marihuana containing
1% THC is of average quality (Jones and Stone, 1970; Weil et al.,
1968). </p>

<p> Marihuana cigarettes are estimated (McGlothlin, 1971, 1972)
to average about 0.5 g in weight and, therefore, contain about 5
mg of THC. Cigarettes used in the eastern states are generally
smaller than those, rolled in the west (McGlothlin, 1971; New
York Police Department, 1969, 1970) </p>

<p> Most data indicates that for the large majority of users
one-half to one cigarette (2.5 to 5 mg THC) is sufficient to
&quot;get high&quot; in intermittent moderate users, although
often two or more cigarettes were smoked to achieve additional
effect (Nisbet and Vakil, 1972; Shean and Fechtmann, 1971;
McGlothlin et al., 1970- McGlothlin, 1972; Jones, 1971; Goode,
1970). </p>

<p> Current American daily users appear to consume one to two
cigarettes per occasion (Jones, 1971) although some users
estimate they smoke three to five cigarettes per occasion
(McGlothlin et al., 1970). Goode (1971), however, found
practically no relationship between amount required to get high
and frequency of use (daily to less than monthly) or duration of
use (less than two years to six or more years). In fact, the
heavy and longer term users were less likely to require more
&quot;joints.&quot; </p>

<p> Thus, the estimated 15 mg THC for current daily users is
about one-half that estimated for confirmed regular users 30
years ago in the United States (Mayor's Committee, 1944; Charen
and Perelman, 1946) and one-third to one-fourth the median daily
consumption of daily users in North Africa and India. </p>

<p> The maximum daily consumption of 10 cigarettes (50 mg THC)
for current heavy U.S. marihuana smokers (Jones, 1971;
McGlothlin, 1972) is about the same as the average amount
consumed by daily chronic users in other countries, and about
one-fourth or less of the maximum in these countries (Soueif,
1967; Sigg, 1963; Indian Hemp Drug Commission's Report,
1893-1894; Chopra, 1940; Chopra and Chopra, 1939). </p>

<p> Studies of American military in Vietnam (U.S. Congress, 1971;
Colbach and Crowe, 1970; Forrest, 1970), and Germany (Tennant et
al., 1971) described the daily use of quantities of hashish or
potent marihuana comparable to amounts consumed by regular
chronic users in other countries. </p>

<p> Experimental data appear to confirm these estimates of
quantity of THC consumed. Isbell et al. (1967) and Jones (1971)
found that most subjects reported a normal &quot;high&quot; after
smoking 5-10 mg of THC. Meyer et al. (1971) found that a
&quot;very high&quot; state was attained by ad libitum smoking of
3.12 mg THC by daily users and 3.78 mg THC by intermittent users.<br>
</p>

<p> In experiments by Johnson and Domino (1971), subjects were
urged to smoke until they were as high as they had ever been on
marihuana and felt they could not smoke any more. These subjects
smoked from one to four cigarettes containing 8.7 mg of THC to
reach this level of intoxication. The range was from 8.7 to 30 mg
of THC with a mean of about 20 mg THC. </p>

<p> Intermittent and daily users were allowed to smoke marihuana
on a free choice basis over a 21day period in studies by
Mendelson et al. (1972). Each cigarette contained one gram of
marihuana of approximately 2% THC content, or about 20 mg of THC.
</p>

<p> Subjects were asked to rate their high on a 10 point scale
with 10 corresponding to highest ever; five as moderately high
and zero, no effect. Ratings for the daily user group ranged from
zero to nine with an average of about six for all cigarettes
rated. Individual means ranged f rom three to about seven. On
almost all occasions, subjects in both groups smoked the entire
cigarette. </p>

<p> Kiplinger et al. (1971) and Lemberger, et al. (1971) noted
that daily long-term users were able to detect effects of the
&quot;high&quot; at doses calculated to deliver as low as 5-7
micrograms/kg THC (equivalent to smoking about 100 mgs. of
marihuana containing 1 % THC). Perhaps this explains the finding
that many users are able to &quot;get high&quot; smoking US
wild-growing marihuana containing front near zero to 0.5% THC
(Lerner, 1969; Phillips et al., 1970; Fetterman et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Several ad libitum experiments were performed with marihuana
of unknown composition (Williams et al., 1946; Siler et al.,
1933) using &quot;confirmed regular marihuana users&quot;
confined over a 39 and six-day period. The users, who generally
consumed three cigarettes per day, under these rather artificial
conditions of the, experiment consumed means of 17 (range nine to
26) and five (range one to 20) cigarettes per day respectively. </p>

<p> Miras and Coutsilinis (1970) reported recent experimental
data on chronic Greek hashish users who routinely use, single
smoked doses of hashish containing 100 mg of THC. Under ad
libitum conditions, these users averaged 150-350 mg of THC per
day over a 30-day period. </p>

<p> The subjects studied during a 21-day period of free choice
Marihuana consumption by Mendelson et al. (1972) generally
consumed all of one cigarette containing 20 mg of THC per smoking
session. 'The subjects who were previously daily users were more
likely during the experiment to consumer more, than one,
cigarette per session than the, previously intermittent users. </p>

<p> Individual consumption by the intermittent users ranged from
an average of about one-half to<br>
six cigarettes per day (group mean three) while the daily users
consumed an average of three-anda-half to nine cigarettes per day
(group mean six-and-a-half). Reasons given by the subjects for
the dramatic shift in the frequency of marihuana use included
boredom, testing the limits of their endurance, demonstrating its
harmlessness to the research staff, and subtle social pressure. </p>

<p> <b>DURATION OF USE</b> </p>

<p> Very little American data exists on the duration of marihuana
use. Practically no data exists which demonstrates the extent
that persons who initiated marihuana use some 20-40 years ago
have continued its use. Robins and Murphy (1967) in a follow-up
study of St. Louis black males noted that 20% of those who had
tried marihuana by age 24 were still using it to some degree 15
years later. McGlothlin et a]. (1970, 1971) reported on a sample
of predominantly white adults who began using, marihuana in
adolescence and had continued infrequent use for more than 20
years. </p>

<p> In the case of Western and particularly middle class American
use of marihuana, the rapid climb to prominence of the phenomenon
since the midsixties raises the question of whether the entire
drug movement is transient or permanent. Certainly, the majority
of the youthful users and many of the adults have used the drug
less than 10 years and probably less than five years. </p>

<p> One 1970 survey (Lipp, 1970) revealed that 77% of those
students who initiated marihuana use four to five years earlier
were still using it to some degree. A recent study (Walters et
a]., 1972) indicates that students who first used marihuana
before entering college in September 1965 and had continued use
of marihuana in February 1969 (&quot;old user&quot;) differed
from the, vast majority of users who began their drug use in
college (&quot;new user&quot;). </p>

<p> The old user is more likely to experiment with a wide variety
of drugs, to be extremely active in radical political
organizations, to be alienated from American society, to be less
definite about career plans, and to have more heterosexual
activities. </p>

<p> The Commission-sponsored National Survey indicated that
marihuana use by both youth (12-17 years of age) and adults (18
and over) is experimental in approximately 75% of those who have
ever used marihuana. These individuals have, either stopped using
it (66% of adults and 57% of youth) or are, using, it once, a
month or less. In contrast, 13% of the ever used subsample (12%
adults, 16% youth) use marihuana once a week or more. </p>

<p> In other non-Western countries, cannabis use frequently
persists for long periods. Especially in the East, persons using
it for 20-40 years or more are not uncommon. In other cultures,
initiation is most common in adolescence. Once the habit is
established it is likely to continue on a daily basis for many
years and frequently continues as a lifetime practice (Weiss,
1971; Sigg, 1963; Soueif, 1967; Watt, 1936; Chopra and Chopra,
1939; Bouquet, 1951; VN, 1957). </p>

<p> Probably the duration of use will vary considerably depending
on cultural acceptance or rejection (McGlothlin, 1972). </p>

<p> <b>INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS</b> </p>

<p> Little experimental work has been done on the interaction
between marihuana and other drugs used socially or medically
although this will become an important area as usage increases. </p>

<p> Marihuana is often used with sweet wines to enhance its
effect. Some evidence for an additive effect of marihuana and
alcohol on motor and mental performance and subjective effect has
been seen experimentally (Manno et al., 1971; Jones and Stone,
1970). Some degree of additive effects would be expected with
barbiturates based on their similarity to alcohol. A more
complex, mixed pattern of effect might be expected with
amphetamines and hallucinogens. These latter combinations are
rarely used socially (Hollister, 1971).<br>

<p> <b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
Drug Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Acute Effects of Marihuana </h1>

<p> <b>(Delta 9 THC)</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> <b>SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS</b> </p>

<p> Descriptive accounts of marihuana intoxication have been
written by noted authors, Beaudelaire (1961), scientists, Moreau
(1945), and common users Tart, 1970, 1971; Isbell et al., 1967;
Report by Advisory Committee, 1968). Adequate description of the
state of mind produced by low doses is difficult because it is
not approximated in the usual states of consciousness or by other
commonly used drugs. The closest non-drug approximation may be
the altered state of consciousness experienced in the hypnotic
trance or transcendental meditation or the, transition zone
between waking and sleep (Weil, 1971). Due to the highly
subjective nature of the experience, there is much individual
variation in the effects described. </p>

<p> Tart (1970, 1971) studied the range of potential common
effects in an extensive survey of 150 users. Changes noted by
these studies at low doses (usually smoked dose about five mg.
THC) include euphoria, with restlessness and mild mental
confusion. Sensory perception of the external environment. is
altered. Users often perceive an overestimation or slowing of
elapsed time and expansion of space, enhanced sense of tactile,
olfactory, gustatory perceptions and often a feeling of hunger.
Visual alterations reported are more vivid imagery and seeing
forms and patterns in objects that are usually amorphous.
Increased awareness of subtle qualities of sound such as purity,
distinctness or rhythm are characteristically perceived by users.
A dreamy, relaxed state and disinhibition, with uncontrollable
laughter is reported and users often believe that interpersonal
relations are altered, and act to potentiate social interaction. </p>

<p> At moderate doses intensifications of changes experienced are
reported. Users' reports include disturbed associations, dulling
of attention, vivid visual imagery, fixed ideas, rapidly changing
positive and negative emotions, fragmentation of thought, flight
of ideas, impaired immediate memory, altered sense of identity,
increased suggestibility and a feeling of enhanced insight. At
higher doses, interpersonal relations are dulled and the user
feels less social and more withdrawn. </p>

<p> At larger doses psychotomimetic (hallucinogenic-like)
phenomena are experienced in a wavelike fashion. These include
distortion of body image, depersonalization, visual illusions and
distortions, synesthesia, dream-like fantasies and vivid
hallucinations.<br>
</p>

<p> Data from Isbell et a]. (1967) and Perez-Reyes et al. (1971)
have indicated that the hallucinogenic oral dose is in the range
of 0.4 to 0.5 mg./kg Delta 9 THC. Thus, the hallucinogenic dose
is 80 times larger than the delivered dose of smoked marihuana
producing minimal subjective effects (five micrograms/kg.) or
about 11 to 14 times larger than the usual smoked dose.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>LETHALITY</b> </p>

<p> There is no conclusive evidence that short-term marihuana use
alone directly results in any physical damage to man. A few
scattered fatalities associated with marihuana use are
occasionally reported. Most are from 19th century Indian
experiences with large oral doses of charas (Deakin, 1880;
Bouquet, 1951; Ewens, 1904, Walton, 1938; Indian Hemp Drugs,
1893). Brill et al. (1970) and Smith (1968) have noted that there
have not been any reliable reports of human fatalities
attributable purely to marihuana, although very high doses have
been administered by users. </p>

<p> A frequently cited recent report from Belgium by Heyndrickx
et al. (1970) describes an essentially negative pathological and
toxicological study of a 23-year-old man found dead in the
presence of marihuana, and hashish. A cannabinoid was detected in
his urine. However, this finding in no way inculpates marihuana
as the responsible agent. There are many possible causes of
sudden death which are not toxins and do not produce observable
pathology; e.g. anaphylactic reactions, insulin shock, cardiac
arhythmias, etc. </p>

<p> A case report (Nahas, 1971) of an attempted suicide by
smoking hashish, recently in France is even more anecdotal. An
individual was reported to have smoked consecutively ten pipes of
hashish containing approximately 200 mg of Delta 9 THC each
before losing consciousness. But recovery occurred after
supportive treatment. </p>

<p> Another case report (Hughes et al., 1970) relates severe
diabetic coma with ketoacidosis after the ingestion of huge
amounts of marihuana by a mental patient. However, it appears
that the pronounced vomiting secondary to the marihuana ingestion
caused a severe electrolyte imbalance and alkalosis. Possibly a
vulnerable glucose-regulating system responded to the severe
stress inappropriately. Retrospectively, there was no history of
diabetes noted previously but this was not confirmed or ruled out
by lab tests prior to the episode. </p>

<p> Several case reports (Henderson and Pugsley, 1968 King and
Cowen, 1970; King et al., 1970; Lundberg et al., 1971; Gary and
Keylon, 1970) noted acute severe, physiological disturbances and
acute collapse (shock, chills and fever) subsequent to
intravenous injection of suspensions of marihuana. These symptoms
may have been due to an allergic reaction to injected foreign
plant material, to a bacteremia and/or to the injection of
insoluble particles which are filtered by the organs. The
symptoms may be considered a complication of the mode of use,
rather than results of the drug. </p>

<p> Although a median lethal dose has not been established in man
(Brill et al., 1970), one has been found in laboratory animals.
Earlier reports (Lowe, 1946; Joachimoglu, 1965) used materials of
uncertain potency and composition. Recent studies utilized
carefully quantified materials. One group, Phillips et al.
(1971), utilizing THC extracted from marihuana, demonstrated the
following LD50 (the dose that causes death in 50% of the animals)
in units of mg/kg of Delta 9 THC from mice,/rats: oral 481.9/666,
intraperitoneal 454-9/ 372.9, intravenous 28.6/42.47. </p>

<p> Thompson et al. (1971) under contract to the National
Institute of Mental Health have recently carried out extensive
studies in rats, dogs and monkeys in order to define the range of
toxicity of the drug. The group used synthetic Delta 9 and A' THC
and a crude marihuana extract (CME) of carefully define
composition. Delta 9 THC was more potent than Al THC. CME was
less potent than a similar quantity of A' THC. </p>

<p> Acute toxicity was studied using intravenous, intraperitoneal
and oral routes of administration in rats. An LD50 similar to
that reported by Phillips et al. (1971) was found by the
intravenous route (20 mg/kg of THC) and intraperitoneal route
(400 mg/kg) but higher values were noted with oral administration
(1140 mg/kg). Interestingly, the LD50 for males was 1400 mg/kg
while for females it was 700 mg/kg by the oral route. The minimal
lethal dose orally was between 225 and 450 mg/kg. </p>

<p> An LD50 was not attainable in monkeys and dogs by the oral
route. Enormous dose levels (over 3000 mg/kg of Delta 9 THC) were
administered without lethality to most animals. A dose of about
1000 mg/kg THC was the lowest dose which caused death in any
animals The completeness of intestinal absorption of THC at these
high doses is unknown. Behavioral changes in the survivors
included sedation, huddled posture, muscle tremors,
hypersensitivity to sound and hypermobility. </p>

<p> The cause of death in the rats and mice subsequent to oral
THC was profound central nervous system depression leading to
dyspnea, prostration, weight loss, loss of Fighting reflex,
ataxia, and severe fall in body temperature which led to
cessation of respiration from 10 to 46 hours after single dose
oral administration. No consistent pathological changes were
observed in any organs. The cause of death when it rarely
occurred in the higher species did not appear to be related to
the same mechanism as in the rats. </p>

<p> Using intravenous administration, the acute one dose LD50 for
Delta 9 THC was 100 mg/kg in dogs and 15.6 to 62.5 mg/kg in
monkeys depending on concentration of the solution. The minimal
lethal intravenous dose for dogs, also depending upon
concentration, was 25 to 99 mg/kg and for monkeys 3.9 to 15.5
mg/kg. </p>

<p> In contrast to the delayed death observed in rats after oral
administration, lethality in rats, dogs and monkeys after
intravenous injection occurred within minutes after injection.
When sublethal amounts were injected, central nervous system
depression with concomitant behavioral changes similar to those
observed after oral doses were observed. However, their onset was
more rapid and the intensity of effect more severe with
anaesthesia, and convulsions noted after injection. The monkeys
and dogs that survived the intravenous injection of THC recovered
completely within five to nine days. </p>

<p> The only consistent pathological changes were noted in the
animals which succumbed. Pulmonary changes including hemorrhage,
edema, emphysema and generalized congestion were found and death
resulted from respiratory arrest and subsequent cardiac failure.
The investigators presumed one mechanism possibly accounting for
these findings was due to the concentration of the THC solution
and its insolubility in water. Presumably, when these highly
concentrated solutions mixed with the blood, the THC precipitated
out of solution. The precipitated foreign material then formed
aggregates (or emboli) that were filtered out in the lung
capillaries causing a physical blockage of pulmonary blood flow. </p>

<p> Subsequently, intravenous studies were repeated using Delta 9
THC emulsified in a sesame oil-Tween 80-saline vehicle at 15
mg/ml or 40 mg/ml. The emulsions were administered at a uniform
rate of 2 ml/15 sec. Doses administered were 1, 4, 16, 64,
92,128, 192 and 256 mg/kg. All monkeys injected with 92 mg/kg or
less survived and completely recovered from all effects with two
to four days. All monkeys injected with 128 mg/kg or more
succumbed within 30 minutes for all but one (180 minutes). </p>

<p> Histopathological changes found in the lungs of the deceased
monkeys were like those described after the, previous intravenous
experiment. All the monkeys that died exhibited severe
respiratory depression and bradycardia within five minutes after
the injection. Respiratory arrest and subsequent cardiac failure
occurred within minutes. Behavioral changes preceding death were
salivation, prostration, coma and tremors. </p>

<p> Behavioral and physiological changes described clinically in
the surviving monkeys followed a consistent developmental
sequence and were roughly dose related in severity and duration.
Onset was 15 minutes following injection and duration was up to
48 hours. Huddled posture and lethargy were the most persistent
changes. Constipation, anorexia and weight loss were noted.
Hypothermia, bradycardia and decreased respiratory rate generally
were maximal two to six hours post injection. Tremors with motion
but not at rest were believed to be caused by peripheral muscle
inadequacy. </p>

<p> In summary, enormous doses of Delta 9 THC, All THC and
concentrated marihuana extract ingested by mouth were unable to
produce death or organ pathology in large mammals but did produce
fatalities in smaller rodents due to profound central nervous
system depression. </p>

<p> The non-fatal consumption of 3000 mg/kg A THC by the dog and
monkey would be comparable to a 154-pound human eating
approximately 46 pounds (21 kilograms) of 1%-marihuana or 10
pounds of 5% hashish at one time. In addition, 92 mg/kg THC
intravenously produced no fatalities in monkeys. These doses
would be comparable to a 154-pound human smoking at one time
almost three pounds (1.28 kg) of 1%-marihuana or 250,000 times
the usual smoked dose and over a million times the minimal
effective dose assuming 50% destruction of the THC by smoking. </p>

<p> Thus, evidence from animal studies and human case reports
appears to indicate that the ratio of lethal dose to effective
dose is quite large. This ratio is much more favorable than that
of many other common psychoactive agents including alcohol and
barbiturates (Phillips et al. 1971, Brill et al. 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS</b> </p>

<p> Much research has been reported on the effect of single doses
of marihuana or THC on a wide variety of indices of physiologic
function in animals. Most animalt studies involved large doses
a-rid produced profound changes similar in nature but less in
magnitude than those described in the previous paragraphs. These
have been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere (Secretary HEW 1972,
Forney, 1971; Secretary HEW, 1971) and should be consulted if
more detailed information is required. </p>

<p> Similarly, much research has been done in man. As discussed
in the previous section on factors influencing the
psychopharmacological effect in man, an acute dose-response
relationship has been clearly defined over a dose range relevant
to human usage patterns for these effects. Thus, with increasing
dose, the larger the effect on the index being observed and the
longer the effect persists. However, there is a wide variation
between individuals' responses but each individual is quite
consistent. </p>

<p> The most consistent physiological sign is an increased pulse
rate (Mendelson et al., 1972; Johnson and Domino, 1971; Renault
et al., 1971; Galanter et al., 1972; Domino, 1970; Hollister et
al., 1968 Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's Committee 1944; Waskow et
al., 1970; Isbell and Jasinski, 1969; Meyer et al., 1971; Weil et
al., 1968; Jones and Stone, 1970; Clark and Nakashima, 1968).
This does not appear to be a direct drug effect on the heart
(Manno et al., 1970). Instead, the drug appears to cause complex
changes in the autonomic nerves regulating heart rate. Thus,
Kiplinger et al. (1971) demonstrated that the increase produced
by marihuana in heart rate is prevented by pretreatment with a
Beta-sympathetic nervous system blocking agent, propranolol. A
comparable increase rate was produced by treatment with
isoprotemol, a Beta-sympathetic like drug. One subject developed
an abnormal bigeminal rhythm after both marihuana and
isoproternol. </p>

<p> Renault et al. (1971) noted a consistent effect of marihuana
on the cardiac rhythm which also produced an increased heart
rate. The effect was the suppression of the normal sinus
arrhythmia usually produced by respiration. Respiration usually
produces a slowing of heart rate mediated by the vagal
parasympathetic nerve supply. This depression of normal vagal
tone was further evidenced by the absence of heart rate slowing
during forced expiration against a closed glotis (valsalva
maneuver). This effect seemed to wax and wane over several
minutes producing alternate periods of rapid and slowed heart
rate. </p>

<p> Both autonomic nervous systems seem to be affected by
marihuana; the sympathetic is stimulated while the
parasympathetic is inhibited. </p>

<p> Kiplinger et al. (1971) clearly demonstrated that the amount
of increase in _pulse rate was directly related to the dose of
THC administered as did Renault et al. (1971) and Johnson and
Domino (1971) over a wide range of doses. Both experienced and
inexperienced marihuana smokers demonstrated increases regardless
of the subjective state described. Tachycardia is noted rapidly
and reaches a peak about 15 to 20 minutes after finishing
smoking. The pulse rate returns to normal within one to
one-and-a-half hours. </p>

<p> Other than the one report of bigeminy (Kiplinger et al.,
1971), little or no alteration of normal heart rhythm were noted
by electrocardiogram (Isbell et al., 1967; Mayor's Committee,
1944) other than sinus tachycardia (Mendelson et al., 1972).
Johnson and Domino (1971) noted premature ventricular
contractions in a few of their subjects, but they felt this
effect was more likely produced by the smoking itself rather than
by the drug. </p>

<p> Conjunctival injection, reddening of the eyes due to
increased prominence of the conjunctival blood vessel and
dilation of the scleral vessels, (Hepler et al., 1971; Kiplinger,
et al., 1971) is another highly consistent occurrence (Mendelson
et al., 1972, Allentuck and Bowman, 1942; Ames, 1958; Hollister,
et al., 1968; Isbell et al., 1967; Manno et al., 1970; Waskow et
al., 1979; Weil et al., 1968) produced by orally ingested and
smoked al., 1968). This finding is produced by orally ingested
and smoked marihuana (or THC). And thus the effect must be a
direct drug effect and not caused by irritation from smoke
(Perez-Reyes and Lipton, 1971). Kiplinger et al. (1971) noted
that this finding was dose-related although it develops slowly
reaching a maximum about one hour after smoking. </p>

<p> Reported effects on blood pressure are inconsistent. Some
investigators find lowered pressure (Hollister et al., 1968;
Isbell et al., 1967; Waskow, et al., 1970) while others report a
slight increase (Johnson and Domino, 1971; Domino, 1970; Mayor's
Committee, 1944) and still others report increases and decreases
(Mendelson et al., 1972; Perez-Reyes et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Preliminary results of a carefully performed study of the
cardiovascular effects (Weiss, 1971) demonstrated orthostatic,
hypotension in the erect position and hypertension when supine. </p>

<p> Little or no effect has been demonstrated in humans on a wide
variety of parameters investigated. Body temperature is unchanged
(Mendelson et al., 1971; Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell et al.,
1967; Brooks, 1896) as is respiratory rate (Domino, 1970; Isbell
et al., 1967; Weil et al., 1968), lung vital capacity and acute
bronchospasni (Mendelson et O., 1972) and basal metabolism
(Mayor's Committee, 1944). </p>

<p> Several studies (Mendelson et al., 1972; Mayor's Committee,
1944; Personal Communication, 1970) have examined changes in
blood cells and blood chemistry. No acute effects were
demonstrated on red blood cell number, or structure; differential
and total white blood cell count; platelet count; reticulocyte,
count; serum electrolyte concentrations; calcium and phosphorous
serum levels; liver function tests; uric acid concentration; type
or quantity of serum proteins. Although increased frequency of
urination is often reported, increased urine volume has not been
demonstrated (Ames, 1958; Mayor's Committee, 1944) and no
alteration of kidney function identified (Personal Communication,
1970; Hollister et al., 1968; Mayor's Committee, 194-4; Mendelson
et al. 1972). </p>

<p> Reports of increased hunger, especially for sweets (Allentuck
and Bowman, 1942; Ames, 1958; Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's
Committee, 1944), have focused attention on blood sugar and food
intake. No consistent significant change in blood sugar has been
demonstrated (Dornbush and Freedman, 1971; Hollister, 1971;
Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell et al., 1967; Manno et -al., 1970;
Personal Communication, 1970; Weil et al., 1968) with some
investigators finding decreases (Beringer et al., 1932;
Lindemann, 1933-1934), others finding increases (Manno, 1970;
Mayor&quot;s Committee, 1944), still others finding both
increases and decreases (Miras, 1965). </p>

<p> Podolsky (1971) found that although fasting blood glucose was
unchanged by smoking marihuana, higher 30 and 60 minute glucose
levels were noted after a standard dose of glucose. No
corresponding alteration in insulin or growth hormone levels was
demonstrated. </p>

<p> Hollister and Gillespie (1970) found an increased total food
intake when the drug was administered after breakfast but not
after an overnight fast. Half the subjects reported subjective
increased hunger. Subjects' free fatty acid levels and blood
glucose remained unchanged while the placebo controls' free fatty
acid values decreased. Another study suggested increased appetite
and food intake but was without adequate controls (Personal
Communication, 1970). </p>

<p> An investigation of physiological parameters of stress after
marihuana (Hollister, 1969; Hollister et al., 1970) revealed only
a minimal increase in white blood cells and a minimal decrease in
cosinophils but no changes in serotonin, cortisol level and
urinary catecholamines. However, another investigator (Chopra,
1969) demonstrated increased catecholamine excretion especially
those from the adrenal medulla. <br>
</p>

<p> Hepler and Frank (1971) and Frank et, al(1971) have carefully
studied ophthalmological changes produced by marihuana. Swelling
of the eyelids (Ames, 1958), ptosis (Isbell et al., 1967),
photophobia and nystagmus (Allentuck and Bowman, 1942) and
dilated, sluggish reacting pupils (Mayer-Gross et al., 1960;
Mayor's Committee, 1944) were all mentioned in earlier
discussions but were not demonstrated (Hepler et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Findings which were quantifiable (Hepler et al., 1971) were a
slight pupillary constriction with normal responsiveness to light
and accommodation and an increase in glare recovery time. No
change was evident on near and far visual acuity, fundiscopic
exam, visual field acuity and depth and color perception.
However, a decrease in tear secretion and an increase in
conjunctival injection was demonstrated.<br>
</p>

<p> Hepler and Frank (1971) reported an average of about 25%
decrease in the intraocular pressure of most normal subjects
after smoking marihuana. A preliminary trial in one patient with
glaucoma demonstrated similar findings (Frank, 1971).<br>
</p>

<p> No objective impairment of improvement invisual acuity or
brightness perception (Caldwell et al., 1970; Caldwell et al.,
1969) nor effect on depth perception and duration of after image
(Clark and Nakashima, 1968) was noted in other studies.<br>
</p>

<p> Neurological examinations have consistently revealed no major
abnormalities during marihuana intoxication. (Mayor's Committee,
1944; Rodin and Domino, 1970; Rodin et al., 1970; Personal
Communication, 1970). Subjects often report muscle weakness.
Minimal decreased leg, hand and finger maximum muscle strength
have been demonstrated objectively (Fere, 1901; Hollister et al.,
1968; Mayor's Committee, 1944). However, electromyography was
reported to be normal (Personal Communication, 1970<br>
</p>

<p> A slightly increased briskness in the knee jerk has been
detected (Domino, 1971 - Rodin and Domino, 1970) while no change
in threshold or elicitation of deep tendon reflexes is usually,
reported (Hollister et al., 1968; Isbell et al., 1967). </p>

<p> Incoordination, fine tremor and ataxia are often experienced
by the user (Ames, 1958; Beringer et al., 1932; Clark et al.,
1970; Mayor's Committee, 1944). The presence of a fine tremor and
decrements in hand steadiness and static body equilibrium leave
been demonstrated with refined measuring devices when they are
not grossly observable (Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's Committee,
1944; Mendelson et al., 1972). Kiplinger et al. (1971) using
sensitive apparatus demonstrated these fine hand tremors and
changes in body equilibrium are also dose related.<br>
</p>

<p> Cranial nerve function and somatic sensation have not been
significantly impaired or improved. Subjective reports of
increased auditory sensitivity contributing to greater esthetic
appreciation of music (Winick, 1960) have been generally
unconfirmed in objective tests of auditory acuity and pitch,
frequency or intensity or threshold discrimination (Aldrich,
1944; Caldwell et al., 1970; Caldwell et al., 1969; Clark and
Nakashima 1968; Mayor's Committee, 1944; Meyers and Caldwell,
1969). Objective improvement in auditory acuity in several
subjects was noted (Walton, 1938; Williams et al., 1946).<br>
</p>

<p> Similarly, improvement in visual acuity and discrimination
and altered depth perception reported by users has been
unconfirmed objectively (Caldwell et al., 1970; Caldwell et al.,
1969; Clark and Nakashima, 1968; Mayor's Committee, 1944;
Hollister and Gillespie, 1970; Jones and Stone, 1970; Frank et
al., 1971). </p>

<p> A slight improvement in vibratory sensation (Rodin and
Domino, 1970), no change in touch or two-point discrimination
(Rodin and Domino, 1970; Williams et al., 1946) nor olfactory and
gustatory senses (Williams et al., 1946) have been demonstrated.
Decreased sensitivity to pain has been objectively demonstrated
(Personal Communication, 1970) which corroborates its past
therapeutic use as an analgesic. </p>

<p> One of the most frequently reported subjective effects of
marihuana intoxication is a distortion of time sense (Tart,
1971). Actual elapsed time is overestimated or perceived as being
longer than actual clock time. Thus, present events are perceived
as prolonged when intoxicated and isolated from the past and
future. They are in the &quot;hereand-now&quot; (Melges et al.,
1971). Many have confirmed this experimentally (Ames, 19,58;
Clark et al., 1970; Mendelson et al., 1972; Dornbush and Freeman,
1971; Hollister and Gillespie, 1970; Weil et al., 1968; Williams
et al., 1946). The over-estimate is much greater during periods
lit which the subject is performing a task than for unfilled
time, and the error is (greater as the time period is longer
(Clark et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Melges et al. (1971) have demonstrated that marihuana
intoxication induces temporal distortions with a greater
concentration on the present and a shortening of span of
awareness into the past and future. They believe that under the
drug's influence, as the, subject becomes less able to integrate
past, present and future, his awareness becomes more concentrated
on present events. These present events are experienced as
prolonged or timeless because they no longer appear to the
intoxicated individual as transitions from the past to the
future.<br>
</p>

<p> Melges and Bowlby (1969) have described habitual marihuana
smokers who specifically use the drug to achieve the
&quot;here-and-now&quot; orientation. These smokers claim this
focus on the present permits them to be more open to immediate
experience while being less troubled by past and future concerns.
This focus may also explain the belief that perceptions during
intoxications are both unexpected and never experienced
previously.<br>
</p>

<p> The effect of intoxication on the resting
electroencephalogram are still unclear but generally have been
minimal, inconsistent and within normal limits. In early studies
(Wikler and Lloyd, 1945; Williams et al., 1946) a decrease in
alpha activity was noted. More recently (Ames, 1958) noted a
delayed alpha increase with concomitant increases in beta and
theta activity. Rodin and Domino (1971) reported a slight shift
toward slower alpha frequencies. </p>

<p> Three other studies (Jones and Stone, 1970; Hollister et al.,
1971; Rickles et al., 1970), failed to find consistent changes
but noted increased alpha frequency, increased synchronization
and occasional paroxysmal activity. These effects were ascribed
to relaxation and drowsiness. </p>

<p> Two investigators (Chopra, 1935; Miras, 1969) reported
decreased fast activity and other variable effects. Most
recently, Volavka et al. (1971) and Fink et al. (1971), reported
a significant rapid onset effect occurring during the five-minute
smoking period and of short duration (less than 30 minutes) in
continuously alert individuals. The principal changes detected by
computer analysis were a dose related increase in percent alpha
time and an associated reduction in theta and beta hands.<br>
</p>

<p> Roth et al. (1972), demonstrated that auditory evoked
responses were decreased in amplitude by marihuana and THC
particularly during the first few minutes of stimulation. These
results may indicate that the intoxicated individual may receive
external auditory stimuli differently during the intoxication
period.<br>
</p>

<p> The prominent and frequently reported sedative effects of
marihuana and the dreamlike states occurring during intoxication
directed several investigators to study the effects of marihuana
on sleep. Fragmentary data from one sleep laboratory (Pivik et
al., 1969) indicated decreased rapideye-movement (REM) sleep
time. Another sleep lab (Rickles et al., 1970), in preliminary
work demonstrated an increase in REM sleep time. Fink et al.
(1971) noted that EEG defined sleep (stages one and two) were
dose dependent but THC did not act like a classical sedative. The
occurrence of EEG sleep was much more frequent in the placebo and
low dose (10 mg THC) conditions than in the high dose condition
(20 mg THC). <br>
</p>

<p> Mendelson et al. (1972) noticed an increased amount of total
sleep as well as an increase in discrete episodes of sleep
related to marihuana smoking. These findings correlate well with
questionnaire data (Tart, 1970) indicating that at moderate
doses, users found it easier to induce sleep and that sleep was
considered to be more refreshing, while at higher doses both
aspects were impaired. <br>
</p>

<p> In summary, marihuana containing Delta-9-THC is a
pharmacologically active drug with minimal acute physiological
effects at the low to moderate doses used by man.<br>
</p>

<p> Based on its few consistently observed physiological effects,
marihuana is a rather unexciting compound of negligible acute
physiological toxicity at the usual doses consumed by man. The
subjective state characteristically described by the intoxicated
user is far more interesting to both the user and the scientist
than the objective one observed by the investigator.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>EFFECTS ON MENTATION AND PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Characteristically, intoxication with psychoactive materials
effect psychomotor and mental functions. It is apparent from the
subjective assertions of users and a wide range of experimental
studies that marihuana is no exception (Clark and Nakashima ,
1968; Clark et al., 1970; Dornbush and Freedman, 1971; Hollister
and Gillespie, 1970; Manno et al., 1970; Mayor's Committee, 1944;
McGlothlin et al., 1971; Melges et al., 1970; Meyer et al., 1971;
Weil and Zinberg, 1969; Weil et al., 1968; Volavka et al., 1971;
Galanter et al., 1972; Kiplinger et al., 1971; Mendelson et al.,
1972; Dornbush et al., 1971). </p>

<p> Psychomotor tasks which have been tested include tapping
speed, handwriting and free-hand writing and free handdrawing,
simple and complex reaction time, pursuit rotor and tracking
tasks and continuous performance tests. Cognitive tasks
frequently tested are simple arithmetic problems, serial addition
or subtraction, fine judgment tasks, 'digit-symbol substitution
test, digit-code memory, reading comprehension, speech or verbal
out-put, forward and backward digit spans, goal directed complex
serial subtractions and additions to reach a set end sum, and
short-term or immediate memory functions.<br>
</p>

<p> In general, Kiplinger et al. (1971) have clearly demonstrated
that the degree of impairment is dose related and varies in
degree during the period of intoxication exerting its maximal
effect at the peak intoxication. </p>

<p> Naive subjects commonly demonstrate greater decrement in
performance than experienced users but report less subjective
effect (Weil et al., 1968). Experienced users appear to better
compensate to the effect of the drug especially for ordinary
performance at lower doses (Clark and Nakashima, 1968; Clark et
al., 1970; Crancer et al., 1969; Jones and Stone, 1970; Meyer et
al., 1971; Weil and Zinberg, 1969; Jones, 1971; Mendelson et al.,
1972). Performance of simple or familiar tasks (i.e. simple
reaction time) during intoxication is minimally effected.
However, on unfamiliar or complex tasks (i.e., complex reaction
time), performance decrements occur (Weil and Zinberg, 1969;
Dornbush et al., 1971; Moskowitz et al., 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> Performance decrements are further enhanced when verbal tasks
are performed during delayed auditory feedback (Kiplinger et al.,
1971). Also marked individual differences in performance are
noted between similar subjects. (Clark and Nakashima, 1968; Clark
et al., 1970; Manno et al., 1970; Kiplinger et al., 1971). A
cyclical waxing and waning of the intensity of the intoxication
and concomitant performance occurs periodically (Clark et al.,
1970; Melges et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Finally, when subjects concentrate on the task being
performed at &quot;normal social high,&quot; objective evidence
of intoxication is not apparent and the individual may perform
better than when drug free (Rodin and Domino, 1970; Mendelson et
al., 1972).<br>
</p>

<p> Obviously, these observations raise practical doubts
regarding the intoxicated individuals' ability to function at
jobs requiring memory, concentration, and organization of
thinking.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>THE INTOXICATED MENTAL STATE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Several investigators have suggested that shortterm memory is
the mental function most significantly affected by marihuana and
contributes to the subtle alterations of mental functioning
noted. Generally an impairment of recent or short term memory is
demonstrated (Abel, 1970,1971; Dornbush et al., 1971; Menges,
1970-71; Tinklenberg, 1970; Clark et al., 1970; Weil et al.,
1968). Thus, mental tasks requiring immediate information
acquisition (Abel, 1971) and/or retrieval (Weil et al., 1968) are
effected. </p>

<p> Abel (1971) recently showed that marihuana blocks the
acquisition process involved in the storage of new interferes
with the retrieval of already stored information. Decrements are
produced in decisions requiring recent memory or sustained
alertness (Clark et al., 1970) ; conversation (Well et al., 1968)
; calculations, or reading which requires retention, coordinating
and indexing sequential information termed temporal
disintegration (Melges et al., 1970, 1971). </p>

<p> Melges eta]. (1970, 1971) theorizes that episodic impairment
of immediate memory produces voids which are filled with
perceptions and thoughts extraneous to the organized mental
processes. He suggests that this leads to temporal disintegration
producing a fragmented and disorganized temporal experience in
which past and future time frames are blurred and the present is
experienced as prolonged or boundless. Thus, depersonalization
occurs as the individual experiences himself temporally in a
strange and unreal manner during marihuana intoxication. </p>

<p> <b>UNPLEASANT REACTIONS: &quot;TOO STONED&quot; AND
&quot;NOVICE-ANXIETY&quot; <br>
</b> </p>

<p> These substantial cognitive and psychomotor effects are
probably responsible for many of the acute adverse reactions to
marihuana. One, of the most common is the heavy, drugged feeling
where the individual feels mentally and physically sluggish so
that every motion and thought seems to require extreme effort
(Smith and Mehl, 1970). This probably reflects impaired cognitive
function and psychomotor retardation from getting &quot;too
stoned.&quot; This most frequently occurs after oral ingestion of
a large dose of drugs or in inexperienced smokers who have, not
learned to selftitrate their dose to achieve the desired high. </p>

<p> In these instances, depression, anxiety, fatigue, short-term
memory loss, dizziness, nausea, incoordination, palpitations are
experienced as generalized discomfort, and ill-being. </p>

<p> &quot;Novice anxiety reactions&quot; or panic reactions
account for a majority of acute toxic reactions to marihuana
(Baker and Lucas, 1969; Baker-Bates, 1935; Gaskill, 1945;
Grossman, 1969; Persyko, 1970; Bialos, 1970; Sonnenreich and
Goes, 1962; Sigg, 1963; Dally, 1967; Hamaker, 1891; Marten, 1969;
Smith and Mehl, 1970; Walton, 1938). </p>

<p> When dosage, set and setting are optimal the distortion of
self (depersonalization) and temporal disintegration
(timelessness of the present moment) common to marihuana
intoxication is recognized by the individual as time-limited and
drug-induced. It is usually experienced as pleasurable. But, if
dose, set and setting are not optimal the experience may cause
the intoxicated individual to fear that loss of his identify and
self control may not end or that he is dying or losing, his mind.
Acute, anxiety or panic results (Mel et al., 1970). </p>

<p> Non-drug factors of set and setting play a most important
role in these, reactions. Of course, the great variability of
individuals makes the effect of marihuana on any specific
individual rather unpredictable. </p>

<p> The large majority of these anxiety reactions occur in
novices who have intense underlying anxiety surrounding marihuana
use such as fears of arrest, of disruption of family and
occupational relations and of possible physical and mental
dangers. Also, individuals with relatively rigid personality
structures, whose values are more in line with those of the
&quot;straight&quot;society and have little desire for new and
different experiences, appear to experience these, anxiety
reactions much more frequently than those, individuals who are
members of the &quot;counterculture&quot; (Smith and Mehl, 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> In addition, simple episodes of neurotic depression may be
observed in these, same types of individuals during periods of
unusual psychological stress (Well, 1970). Both of these types of
reactions are transient and abate as the drug effects wear off
over a few hours. Treatment should consist of gentle but
authoritative. reassurance that nothing is seriously wrong and
that the drug effects will wear off and the individual will feel
normal&quot; again (Smith and Mehl, 1970; Well, 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>ACUTE PSYCHOSES<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Rare cases of full-blown acute psychotic episodes
precipitated by marihuana use are reported in individuals with
histories of mental disorder, with marginal psychological
adjustments or with poorly developed personality structures and
ego defenses (Talbott, 1968; Heiman, 1968; Kaplan, 1971; Pernot,
1969; Keeler, 1968; Defer and Diehl, 1968; Wurniser et al., 1969;
Allentuck and Bowman, 1942; Bromberg, 1939; Bromberg, 1934;
Curtis and Wolfe, 1939; Hughes et al., 1970; Isbell et al., 1967;
Keup , 1970; Keeler, 1967; Talbott and Teague, 1969 Mayor's
Committee, 1944). </p>

<p> Marihuana intoxication may hinder the ability of these,
individuals to maintain structural defenses to existing stresses,
or, alternatively produce a keener awareness of personality
problems or existing stresses (Smith, 1968). Psychotherapy and
antipsychotic medications are useful in controlling and
preventing this reaction (Weil, 1970). </p>

<p> Exceptionally rare reports from North America of nonspecific
toxic psychosis or actite brain syndrome have occurred after
extremely high drug dose consumption, although such reports are,
more common in the eastern countries. These conditions are
self-limited and clear spontaneously as the drug effect abates
(Weil et al., 1968; Bartolucei et al. 1969 Ames, 1958; Isbell et
al., 1967; Mayor's Committee, 1944; Williams et al., 1946). </p>

<p> Finally, marihuana intoxication may trigger delayed anxiety
reactions or psychotic episodes in a small percentage of persons
who have prior experience with hallucinogenic drugs (Ungerleider
et al., 1968; Ungerleider, 1969; Weil et al., 1968; Favazza and
Domino, 1969). </p>

<p> In summary, the acute psychomotor-cognitive effects of
marihuana intoxication are, interesting academically to gain
understanding of normal and abnormal mental function. Also, for
practically determining the danger-risk factor for the individual
including determination of his functional level personally,
vocationally and socially in this society. The effect on
personal-social-vocational function is highly individualized and
difficult to predict at present. </p>

<p> Although reports of anxiety attacks and psychotic episodes
are more frequent as marihuana use spreads, they are still
exceedingly rare and their incidence appears to be decreasing as
use becomes more acceptable to more diverse populations. For
example, during the nine-year period of 1961 to 1969, out of
701,057 admissions to Los Angeles County Hospital, located in a,
city with very high marihuana use, only three patients required
hospitalization for psychic sequelae of marihuana smoking
(Lundberg, et al., 1971). <br>
</p>

<p> In contrast, many cases are being seen in Vietnam soldiers
where a extremely potent material is available and daily stresses
are high, but, these probably represent only a small fraction of
marihuana, users (Talbott and Teague, 1969; Talbott, 1968;
Heiman, 1968). </p>

<p> During the, academic year 1968 and 1969, eight students were
seen in the mental hygiene division of a private Eastern
University student population (8,500) with acute anxiety
reactions (Bialos, 1970). The frequency of marihuana-associated
acute adverse, anxiety reactions requiring attention at Boston
University Student Health Service (student population 20,000) is
between five and seven yearly (Pillard, 1970). </p>

<p> In a recent survey of newly admitted patients to a large
mental hospital, marihuana was the direct cause of the
hospitalization in only 0.9 per thousand admissions (Keup, 1970).<br>
</p>

<p> <b>PERSISTENT EFFECTS AFTER ACUTE DOSE<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Investigators have not noted persistent effects after smoking
marihuana for periods of more than three to five hours (Fink et
al., 1971; Weil et al., 1968; Pillard, 1970). </p>

<p> Users report only minimal hangover effects (Mayor's
Committee, 1944; Haines and Green, 1970; McGlothlin et al., 1971)
after very heavy use. Feelings of lassitude and heaviness of the
head, lethargy, irritability, headaches and loss of concentration
are reported especially when associated with lack of sleep
(Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Indian Hemp, 1893). This may be related
to preliminary data (Rickles et al., 1970) suggesting a subtle
increase in REM sleep time primarily seen in the last one-third
of the night in individuals who smoked one to two cigarettes per
day usually at night for at least a year.<br>
</p>

<p> <b>EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA USE ON CONCOMITANT BEHAVIOR<br>
</b> </p>

<p> Mendelson et al. (1972), under contract to the Commission,
analyzed the effects on behavior of acute marihuana intoxication
on an extensive variety of assessine nts including a simple
operant task, mood states, individual and group observations
before, during and after smoking and clinical psychological
evaluations. </p>

<p> Sleep-inducing properties were confirmed. Increased amounts
of total sleep were observed in both number and length of shorter
and longer blocks of consecutive hours of sleep related to
marihuana smoking.<br>
</p>

<p> Examination of mood assessments prior, during and after
marihuana smoking indicates that the acute effects were a
reduction of negative moods (anxiety, hostility, and guilt-shame)
and an increase in the positive moods (carefreeness and
friendliness). Examinations of the mood prior to smoking revealed
that the subjects tended to smoke marihuana when they reported
generally positive moods. The effect of the drug was to increase
this positive mood. One paradoxical finding was that the subjects
also reported feeling more depressed after smoking.<br>
</p>

<p> Acute effects of marihuana on cognitive and motor functions
were studied with a battery of tests sensitive to brain function
(Halstead Category Test, Tactile Performance Test, Seashore
Rhythm Test, Finger Tapping Test, Trail Making Test and the
Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale). No alterations in performance
as a result of acute intake of marihuana were noted in any of
these. </p>

<p> The acute effect of marihuana smoking on social behavior was
investigated, by observing the individual and his interaction in
small groups. The data indicated very strongly that marihuana
smoking, in addition to being a subjective drug experience, is
also a social activity around which verbal interaction and other
types of social behavior are centered. </p>

<p> Although marihuana smoking tended to be, a group activity,
subjects did not always engage in verbal communication while
smoking. Subjects often were observed withdrawing from the social
interaction and then participating in some type of
noncommunicative passive activity, such as watching television,
listening to music, reading or staring at objects or people. This
decrement in total interaction appeared to be a drug effect. </p>

<p> Heavy marihuana users tended to be more withdrawn than the
intermittent users, often listening to the stereo and focusing on
the personal effects of the drug. The intermittent users tended
to watch television which provided group entertainment, thus
enhancing the social effects of the drug. </p>

<p> Verbal interaction in formal task-oriented discussion groups
diminished when several group members were simultaneously
intoxicated. How-ever, groups engaged in problem-solving tasks
performed more efficiently because less suggestions and
discussion ensued before proposing a workable solution. The
groups tended to become more convivial and less task-oriented
although none failed to arrive, at the goal. Marihuana did not
appear to increase hostility during these sessions and
furthermore tended to change the nature of hostile communication
from direct criticism to indirect sarcasm. </p>

<p> Assessment of risk-taking behavior revealed that under the
influence of marihuana, users tend to become more conservative in
the decision making. </p>

<p> In summary, it appears that marihuana does exert subtle
effects on measurable components of social behavior and
interaction.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Effects of Short-Term or Subacute Use</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>ANIMAL STUDIES (PRECLINICAL)</b> </p>

<p>Studies have only begun in this area in the last 10 years.
Subacute toxicity studies in rats involving 30 daily
intraperitoneal injections of up to 30 mg/kg THC were recently
reported by Phillips et al. (1971). No fatalities were observed.
Total body and organ weight (rains were significantly retarded
over the period. However, no significant differences in organ
histology were detected although in a few animals there were
suggestions of change in liver and testicular cells. An
interesting phenomena also observed was a suggestion of increased
sensitivity to effects of Delta 9 THC occurring after two weeks
of daily treatment. </p>

<p>Thompson et al. (1971) under contract to NIMH studied the
toxicity in rats treated daily for seven, 28, 91 and then 119
days with oral Delta 9 THC, A&quot; THC and crude marihuana
extract at doses from 50 to 500 mg/kg. The findings were
generally similar for all three preparations although A&quot;
effect was greater than All THC which in turn was greater than
CME. </p>

<p>A bimodal pattern of behavorial toxicity was exhibited by the
cannabinoids for all time periods of dosing ranging from five to
119 days. Initially, a dose-related generalized central nervous
system depression was noted. This was characterized by huddled
posture, inactivity, drowsiness, slow movements, unkempt
appearance, loss of appetite, wide stance, constipation, weight
loss, depressed respiration and heart rate and fall in body
temperature. Tolerance gradually developed to the initial
depressant effects starting after two to five doses and continued
at different rates for different parameters. </p>

<p>Concomitant to the development of tolerance, rats exhibited
progressively more hyperactivity, manifesting increased
exploratory behavior, grooming and motor activity. The daily
duration of the altered behavior progressively shortened.
Tolerance to the hyperactivity was not seen in the rats. Later,
in the experimental period, the rats became hyper-irritable and
exhibited fighting behavior, especially at lower doses.
Additionally, tremors and later chronic convulsions occurred in
significant numbers of rats. </p>

<p>The onset and frequency of chronic convulsions were
dose-related and the severity increased as the duration of dosage
was extended. Cumulative toxicity, as evidenced by increased
mortality, was observed in the rats but most deaths and maximal
toxicity (central depression) occurred 36 to 72 hours following
first treatment. Drug dose-related histopathological changes in
all treated rats (in addition to decreased body and organ weight
gains) were hypocellularity of the spleen and bone marrow,
vacuolization of the adrenal gland and degeneration of the testes
(seminiferous tubules) or ovarian stronia. Extended doses from
five to119 days were not significantly more toxic except to the
adrenals. No evidence of abstinence syndromes were noted upon
abrupt cessation of these doses. </p>

<p>Similar behavorial and clinical findings were observed in
monkeys given 50-500 mg oral Delta 9 THC, All THC and equivalent
CME for up to 91 days. Cumulative toxicity was less severe and
all monkeys survived the initial moderately severe central
nervous system depression. Tolerance to the depression occurred
and the monkeys returned to their undrugged behavior. Mild
hyperactivity was noted only in several of the median dosed
animals. </p>

<p>Three of 28 monkeys studied became moribund on days 10, 14 and
16 respectively. These were sacrificed and the only
histopathology seen was severe hemorrhagic and probably
drug-related enterocolitis. The bone marrow and kidney changes
seen probably were due to severe electrolyte imbalance resulting
from the intestinal lesion. The thymus lesion is consistent with
stress due to this electrolyte imbalance. Pancreatic atrophy was
due to weight changes. Eight additional monkeys were sacrificed
at 28 days in fair-to-good condition and no histopathology was
demonstrable. Several other monkeys had bloody diarrhea, but
recovered spontaneously without demonstrable histopathology. </p>

<p>The remaining 17 monkeys were all in fair-to good condition at
28 days and hyperactivity was no longer observed. They were
treated at the same dose for an additional 63 days. Tolerance to
the central depression continued to develop so that the effects
lasted only one to two hours at 91 days. No additional monkey
fatalities were recorded -and the remaining 17 monkeys were
normal histopathological at autopsy. Urine and ophthalmological
examinations were all within normal limits. Hematological and
blood chemical changes after 28 and 91 days were minor and little
affected in the surviving monkeys. </p>

<p>Thus, a. minimal toxicity in monkeys, either physical or
behavorial, is evident after 91 daily doses orally of enormous
amounts of Delta 9 THC. However, significant cumulative toxicity,
primarily a generalized central nervous system depression, is
evident in the first few days but tolerance rapidly develops to
these effects. A dose-related hemorrhagic enterocolitis occurred
which may lead to electrolyte imbalance and death in a few
monkeys. This probably is a direct irritative phenomena. </p>

<p>Again, the enormous daily doses of THC that were administered
to these animals cannot, be compared to the daily doses used in
man even by the heaviest users. </p>

<p>The effects were observed of 28 daily administrations to
monkeys of intravenous Delta 9 THC in sesame oil-Tween 80-saline
vehicle at doses of 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg. Behavioral, clinical,
hematological and hemochemical changes were similar for monkeys
given single or repeated injections. However, the duration was
extended in the 28-day groups and tolerance gradually developed.
Delayed death indicative of cumulative toxicity occured on days
eight and 19 in two of four animals given the largest dose. </p>

<p>Histopathological changes, noted in the two animals which
succumbed and in one of the highdose monkeys, were acute
hemorrhagic pneumonia resembling the finding in the
single-intravenous studies at doses of 128 mg/kg or greater.
Additionally in the repeated dose study, edema, ulceration and
fibrosis at the injection sites probably contributed to minor
hematological and hemachemical alterations. </p>

<p>In summary, the 1972 Marihuana and Health Report to the
Congress from the Secretary of HEW noted that these doses were
employed in rodents and mammals to test the limits of toxicity.
The doses are much higher than those used by man and the routes
of administration substantially dif ferent. These studies have
shown that the margin of safety between the lethal dose and the
pharmacologically active doses of Delta 8 and All THC and crude
marihuana extract is large. Consequently, it has been determined
that these compounds could be safely administered to man for
Phase I and early Phase II clinical studies (Secretary of HEW,
Feb. 11, 1972, p. 158-160).<br>
</p>

<p><b>HUMAN EXPERIMENTS (CLINICAL)<br>
</b></p>

<p>Only a few investigators have studied the subacute
administration of marihuana to man. Marihuana cigarettes of
unknown potency were made available to 34 military prisoners in
Panama by Siler et al. (1933). The mean daily consumption was
five cigarettes (range one to 20). The usual behavior effects
associated with marihuana use were noted. No ill effects were
observed nor abstinence syndrome seen. </p>

<p>Williams et al. (1946) made available marihuana cigarettes of
unknown potency to six prisoner addicts who were experienced
marihuana users in the Public Health Service Lexington Hospital.
The subjects were permitted to freely consume the drug in any
quantity desired. The number of cigarettes consumed increased
only slightly over a 39-day period. The daily range was from nine
to 26 per day with a mean of 17. Only minimal evidence of
tolerance was seen. There was no evidence of physical dependence;
that is, no observable abstinence, syndrome was observed after
abrupt termination of the drug. </p>

<p>In general, the following observations were made on these
subjects: daily rectal temperature increased slightly; pulse,
rate increased for three weeks, then returned to normal; no
change was noted in respiratory rate, coordination, or rote
memory ; increase was noted in sleep and body weight while
caloric intake initially increased then progressively decreased;
mild confusion was observed; general intelligence tests were
slightly impaired while psychomotor tests were performed faster
but less accurately; EEG showed inconsistent changes but returned
to normal five days after cessation; and mood was euphoric for
several days followed by general lassisitude and indifference. </p>

<p>In a recent uncontrolled preliminary study (Personal
Communication, 1970), marihuana extract was administered daily to
eight terminal cancer patients from four to 13 days (mean 8.5
days). Daily doses were purposefully raised by the investigator
from 7.5 mg (mean daily dose 19.8 mg THC). The total dose per
individual patient averaged 168 mg with a range from 75-210 mgs. </p>

<p>Euphoria was experienced by all eight subjects and one had a
transient anxiety episode at a high dose. Three subjects
demonstrated decreased-opiate analgesic needs indicating an
analgesic-effect of the drug. Five subjects reported improved
appetite and five, of six tested, demonstrated objective
improvement in depression on Back scale. No new changes were seen
in physiological parameters, neurological status, blood cell and
chemistry values or urine examination. During the period of drug
effect, drowsiness was common but not lethargy, lassitude or
indifference. In fact, all became more active on the ward. No
evidence of abstinence symptoms were seen after abrupt
discontinuation of the drug.<br>
</p>

<p>Volavka et a]. (1971) in preliminary experiments administered
two marihuana cigarettes daily (13 mg Delta 9 THC) to four
detoxified heroin addicts. Pleasant effects peaked during the
second week and then leveled off. Prominent dysphoric effects and
depressive reactions with paranoid thoughts appeared during the
third to sixth days and persisted causing cessation of the study
by one subject after 10 days and after 17 days by another. The
other two subjects completed the entire planned 22 days. </p>

<p>Again no abstinence syndrome was seen and the dysphoric
symptoms disappeared within five days after the last dose.
Consistent electroencephalogram changes developed in three of
four subjects indicating increased synchronization. Their EEG
changes first appeared immediately after smoking.<br>
</p>

<p>In two of the f our subjects they were detectable, in the
presmoking records after days 12 and eight, and did not begin to
subside until 48 hours after the last dose in two subjects and
persisted for the entire 72 hours follow-up in a third subject. </p>

<p>Fink et al. (1971) subsequently studied five medical and
graduate students who had been almost daily marihuana smokers in
college and were currently weekend smokers. Each subject smoked
under laboratory conditions one marihuana cigarette containing 14
mg of THC each morning daily for 21 days. </p>

<p>No subject reported any adverse effects from smoking. The
subjects were generally able to conduct their usual daily
activities including jobs. However, they reported they did not
function completely up to par during the several hour duration of
the acute drug effect. There were no effects which persisted for
more than three to five hours and cumulative effects were not
noted day to day. No persistent decrements were seen in behavior,
mental status, EEG, heart, rate, short-term memory, or
psychomotor function tests. In sum, daily marihuana smoking for
21 days was well tolerated by well-adjusted graduate students. </p>

<p>Mendelson et al. (1972) performed a Commission-sponsored study
of the biological and behavioral concomitants of 21 days repeated
doses of marihuana. Subjects were individuals whose life style,
activities, values and attributes were more characteristic of the
unconventional youthful subculture than most of their peers in
the general population. Their mean age was 23. Based on I.Q.
testing they were superior intellectually although they had
completed, on the average, two-and-a half years of college. Their
job histories were rather erratic and characteristic of a pattern
of itinerant living. Their family background was a middle or
lower-middle socioeconomic status. In addition alcohol use was
infrequent while use of drugs, especially hallucinogens and
amphetamines, was significant. </p>

<p>Two groups of 10 subjects each were investigated over separate
31-day periods of confinement on a comfortably furnished research
ward equipped with an array of recreational materials. A large,
open yard was available for outdoor recreational activities. The
research period was divided into three periods: a pre-drug period
of five days during which the subjects were drug free; a,
subsequent 21-day period when marihuana, could be earned by
performing a, work-contingent operant task, then purchased and
smoked on a free-choice basis; and a five-day post-drug period
without access to marihuana. </p>

<p>All attempts were made to not interfere in any way with
performance of the operant task or free choice marihuana smoking
although the subjects were under constant observation. A vast
array of behavioral and biological assessments were made during
the experimental period to determine any effect of repeat doses
of marihuana over this time. </p>

<p>Two groups of subjects, studied separately, differed primarily
in the frequency of marihuana smoking over the past year. Both
groups had averaged about five years of marihuana use (range two
to 17 years). The first group studied, referred to as the
&quot;casual&quot; users by the authors, reported an average
frequency of marihuana use, of 7.7 occasions per month (range
three to 15 occasions). The second group studied, referred to as
the &quot;heavy&quot; users by the authors, reported almost daily
use of marihuana (average 33 sessions per month; range 20+ to 75,
including one substitute subject to fill the group who only
smoked about 10 times a month). <br>
</p>

<p>During the first 20 days of the smoking period, the casual
group's consumption averaged three cigarettes daily (individual
average was one-half to six) while that of the heavy users
averaged six-and-a-half cigarettes daily (individual average
three to eight-and-a-half). Both groups demonstrated a,
progressive trend toward increased daily consumption during the
experiment. Close examination of the consumption patterns for
individual subjects showed that the trend toward increased use
occurred in the subjects who were initially the heaviest users.
Several subjects who were initially the least frequent users did
not increase their use of marihuana over the course of the study.<br>
</p>

<p>Subjects in both groups tended to smoke practically all of
each cigarette including the butt. Each cigarette contained about
20 mg- Delta 9 THC. Therefore, the heavy users average daily
intake was 130 mg of THC or a total of almost, Joni- -grams of
THC over the 21-day period. The casual users average intake was
slightly less than half this amount.<br>
</p>

<p>No abstinence syndrome or physical dependence was observed
after abrupt termination of smoking. Signs of mild to moderate
psychological dependence. were possibly seen in the heavy group
but no evidence of psychological dependence was seen in the
casual users.<br>
</p>

<p>No consistent clinically significant physiological or
biochemical changes were demonstrated during or after the period
of repeated use of marihuana. </p>

<p>Urinalysis, complete blood counts, cell morphologies and
differentials, and blood chemistry determinations (calcium,
phosphorous, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid,
cholesterol, total protein, albumen, total bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and serum glutamic oxalacetic
transaminase) were unaffected. </p>

<p>Weight gain occurred in all but one subject. Maximal gain was
seen during the marihuana smoking period. The subjects were not
judged to be clinically malnourished prior to the experiment. </p>

<p>Normal body temperature was not altered. No significant
change, in pulmonary function (decreased. vital capacity or acute
broncho spasm) was observed during the marihuana smoking period.<br>
</p>

<p>Variable inconsistent changes in upright blood pressure were
noted. Effects on pulse rate were related only to acute drug
administration and were more pronounced during the initial
smoking phases. This suggests that tolerance developed to
drug-induced tachycardia. No significant electrocardiographic
changes were observed. Marihuana smoking had no apparent effect
on exercise related cardiac vascular function.<br>
</p>

<p>Physical examinations revealed only the development of
persistent conjunctival injection, lateral gaze nystagmus and
fine, finger tremors. These findings were believed to be acute
drug effects and of no clinical significance. No signs of
neurological abnormality were observed. No cumulative effect of
marihuana to cause, impairment of cognitive function was noted on
a battery of tests sensitive to organic brain function. </p>

<p>An increased amount of sleep in both shorter and longer blocks
of consecutive hours was observed. Also an increase in the number
of discrete episodes of sleep, especially one to three hour
episodes also occurred during the marihuana use period.
Reappearance of pre-drug pattern was seen during the post-drug
period. This reversion appeared to begin toward the end of the
drug period which may be indicative of tolerance, to the acute
depressant-like effects of marihuana. </p>

<p>Generally, performances on short-term memory, psychomotor
skills and time estimation suggests that repeated marihuana
smoking had no discernible effect on the ability to improve
performance with practice on these measures. Tolerance appeared
to develop to the acute decrement in performance on these
measures. On the time estimation task, a tendency appeared for
the subjects to increasingly overcompensate for the acute drug
effect with repeated testing in the nonintoxicated state.<br>
</p>

<p>Both casual and heavy users had a marked decrement in total
social interaction during the first portion of the marihuana
smoking period. Total interaction of the casual subjects
continued to diminish subsequently. Heavy users subsequently
tended to exceed presmoking levels of interaction indicating they
accommodated to the depressant effects of repeat doses of
marihuana. </p>

<p>Both groups became progressively more convivial and less
task-oriented in group discussions. They offered less suggestions
in problem-solving tasks but continued to efficiently solve the
problem. </p>

<p>Casual users reported general relative increases in negative
daily moods and decreases in positive daily moods during the
course of the study. The trend began with the onset of smoking
and persisted through the post-smoking period. This trend could
be a sequelae of repeated marihuana use or related to non-drug
variables (set and setting). </p>

<p>The heavy users did not evidence this trend toward relative
increases in dysphoric mood until the post-smoking period. Again
this may be related to repeated marihuana use, reflect
psychological dependence or be related to set and setting
variables, such as boredom and tension associated with the
prolonged study period. </p>

<p>Finally, repeated use of marihuana over the 21day period did
not decrease motivation to engage in a variety of social and
goal-directed behaviors. Almost without exception, every subject
earned the maximum number of points every day throughout all
non-drug and drug periods. No consistent alteration in pattern of
work could be related to repeated marihuana use. Subjects often
performed very high work output while they were smoking marihuana
and experiencing the maximum drug effects. </p>

<p>Repeated marihuana use, did not decrease subject's motivation
to complete the study. Nor was any noticeable effect observed on
interest and participation in a variety of personal activities,
such as, writing, reading literature, keeping up with current
national and world events, and participation in both athletic and
esthetic endeavors.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Effects of Long-Term Cannabis Use</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patterns of marihuana use in Western countries, particularly
the United States are primarily long term (two t o 10 years).
Additionally, Western investigators have been able to observe
those who use marihuana at most, daily and more often, moderately
or intermittently. Consequently, observed effects are rare.
Knowledge is incomplete but certain trends appear to be emerging
in regard to American usage patterns. </p>

<p>The relevance of Eastern reports of heavy hashish use is
uncertain. Nutrition, disease prevalence and quality of medical
care impose limits on transferring Eastern observations to
Western conditions of use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DEPENDENCE AND TOLERANCE</b> </p>

<p>Neither severe physical dependence, nor prominent withdrawal
symptoms after abrupt termination of very heavy usage is
suggested by some overseas experience (Charen and Perelman, 1946;
Fraser, 1949; Ludlow, 1857, Marcovitz and Myers, 1944; Siler et
al., 1933; Walton, 1938). Other studies, however, suggest marked
psychological dependence from heavy use producing compulsive drug
taking in very heavy users (Indian Hemp, 1893; Chopra and Chopra,
1957; Bouquet, 1944; Lambo, 1965). </p>

<p>Psychosomatic abstinence syndromes often reported were
physical weakness, intellectual apathy, loss of appetite,
flatulence, constipation, insomnia, fatigue, abdominal cramps and
nervousness, restlessness, and headache. For most heavy users the
syndrome of anxiety and restlessness seem to be comparable to
that observed when a, heavy tobacco smoking American attempts to
quit smoking. </p>

<p>However, the psychological dependence appears to be severe as
evidenced by the f act that one group of subjects were unable to
cease their habitual use although the frequency of use, was only
eight to 12 times per month (Soueif, 1967). This psychological
dependence may have made some users claim physical dependence so
that the government did not terminate dispensing them their drug.
Studies in the United States using must lower doses for shorter
periods of time have revealed little if any evidence of
psychological dependence (Bromberg, 1934 Mayors Committee, 1944;
Williams et al., 1946). </p>

<p>Tolerance to the subjective and depressant effects of the drug
(discussed in an earlier section) does probably occur in man,
with heavy use. Thus, increasingly larger and more frequent doses
become necessary to experience the desired effects. </p>

<p>Several investigators have recently studied the question of
physiological and psychological dependence to Delta 9 THC in
monkeys using intravenous self-injection techniques. </p>

<p>Deneau and Kaymakcalan (1971) demonstrated that no monkey
initiated self-administration over a three-week period when given
the opportunity to self-inject a behaviorly effective dose of 100
micrograms per kilogram of Delta 9 THC in a Tween solution. The
researchers subsequently administered to these monkeys this dose
every six hours. Tolerance developed to the behavioral effects
within a few days. Dose administered was progressively increased
up to 400 micrograms per kilogram over the course of a month.
When the injections were abruptly discontinued, all six monkeys
showed after twelve hours, behavioral and physiological changes
described by the researchers as mild abstinence signs. Two of the
six monkeys then initiated and maintained for several weeks the
self-administration of THC. </p>

<p>The investigators believe these findings are evidence for mild
psychological and physiological dependence on THC. However,
vehicle controls were not included in the research design. Thus,
the abstinence signs and subsequent behavior may possibly be
accounted for by the biological effects in of the Tween vehicle. </p>

<p>Harris et al. (1972) utilized several procedures to maximize
the possible conditions necessary for developing self-injection
in monkeys. These procedures included: spontaneous Delta 9 THC
self administration with no previous training to the technique;
self-administration of A' THC after training, with cocaine alone
and a mixture of cocaine and Delta 9 THC. Doses utilized ranged
from 20 to 500 micrograms per kilogram suspended in
polyvinylpyrrolidone. In all cases, monkeys failed to self
-administer Delta 9 THC. </p>

<p>The researchers conclude that A' THC lacks the reinforcing
effects of psychomotor stimulants and depressants which monkeys
readily self infuse with no auxiliary incentives. Also Delta 9
THC lacks a reinforcing function even for monkeys that are
well-trained with cocaine and have experienced several days of
rather large quantities of Delta 9 THC during the early pleases
of extinction of the cocaine reinforced response. </p>

<p>Finally, the results demonstrate that a two week period of
exposure to Al THC (in a mixed solution with cocaine) does not
result in the degree of homeostatic imbalance which occurs with
morphine, ethanol, barbiturates and sometimes the amphetamines
which accounts for the continued self-administration of these
drugs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Permanent congestion of the transverse ciliary vessels of the
eye and accompanying yellow discoloration is the only physical
effect firmly linked to long-term marihuana use (Ames, 1958;
Chopra, and Chopra, 1957; Dhunjibhoy, 1928). Although there are
several suspected or reported effects, none has been conclusively
demonstrated in a valid study. Some (Chopra and Chopra, 1939;
Indian Hemp, 1893) claim that bronchitis, asthma and other
respiratory problems may be produced by chronic and excessive use
of potent compounds in India. Eastern smoking, preparations are
often a mixture of tobacco and hashish. </p>

<p>Indian users reportedly exhibit digestive tract abnormalities,
weight loss and disturbed sleep (Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Soueif,
1967). However, the contributing factors of poor living
conditions, malnutrition and prevalence of communicable disease
could not easily be separated. </p>

<p>A high percentage of heavy Moroccan users have developed
obliterative arteritis of the lower extremities (Sterne, 1960)
possibly related to the occurrence of tropic foot ulcers (Ganja
-foot) (Miras, 1965). The progression of this abnormality is
claimed to parallel prolonged use of the drugs. </p>

<p>Mendelson et al. (1972) were unable to demonstrate clinically
significant abnormalities in the extensive battery of tests
performed which could be attributed purely to the subjects
long-term use of marihuana. No histories were obtained of
neurological, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, cardiac,
gastrointestinal, (renitourinary, or nutritional disorders. No
history of psychotic illness was given. </p>

<p>All subjects were Judged to be in normal mental, health by
psychiatric interview and psychological tests (MMPI and Edwards
Personality Preference Inventory). Three subjects were felt to be
neurotic. </p>

<p>Pre-drug complete physical exams, chest X-ray,
electrocardiogram, urinalysis, complete blood count and blood
chemistry profile did not demonstrate, any clinically significant
abnormalities. No subject showed evidence of poor nutrition. </p>

<p>Pulmonary vital capacity and one second forced expiratory
volume were reduced in 12 of the 20 subjects initially. These
changes were not correlated with either current cigarette smoking
or f requency or duration of marihuana smoking. Histories of past
cigarette use, past patterns of marihuana use and past or present
contact with environmental air pollutants were inadequate to
attempt to account for these pulmonary findings. </p>

<p>Many of the subjects were in fair to poor physical condition
as judged by a cardiac exercise tolerance test. </p>

<p>Four of the 20 subjects' initial performance on a battery of
cognitive functions tests was poorer than would have been
predicted by high average to superior I.Q. scores and educational
backgrounds. One of the casual subjects demonstrated improvement
with retesting consistent with good brain function. Thus,
behavioral impairment was present in three subjects.<br>
</p>

<p>Whether the impairment is related to prior drug histories,
particularly the excessive use of LSD by the two heavy users,
cannot be ascertained. For the casual users, nothing in the case
histories possibly elucidated the reason for relatively poor
performance based on the exceptionally high I.Q., 139 and 128. </p>

<p>Many Western investigators have suggested that smoking hashish
or marihuana may possibly cause bronchitis, asthma or
rhinopharyngitis (Bloomquist, 1967; Waldman, 1970; Tylden and
Wild, 1967; Schwartz, 1969). </p>

<p>Tenant et al. (1971) described bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma
and rhinopharyngitis in 22 American soldiers in Germany who
smoked daily enormous quantities (100 grams or more) of hashish
for six to 15 months. These conditions, believed to be caused by
irritation of the respiratory tract by hashish smoke, seemed to
improve, with diminished hashish use. </p>

<p>Twenty-one of the subjects were tobacco cigarette, smokers and
occasionally smoked hashish rolled in a tobacco cigarette. Nine
patients had symptomatic bronchitis. Five of these subjects
underwent pulmonary function tests while consuming their usual
daily amount of hashish and again three days after discontinuing
use. A mild obstructive pulmonary deficit was demonstrated which
was at least partially corrected with diminished hashish intake.
Hashish contributed to rbinopharyngitis in 12 of the patients and
this effect was not allergic in origin. Urticaria, acne, diarrhea
and gastrointestinal cramps were less frequent complaints.
Extensive hemotological and hentochemical studies including liver
function tests were performed and were within normal limits. </p>

<p>Mann et a]. (1970, 1971) and Finley (1971) studied the effect
of marihuana smoking on the pulmonary function of eight
non-cigarette smoking marihuana smokers (20-27 years old).
Marihuana smoking history was defined in marihuana
cigarette-years, that is, one marihuana cigarette daily for one
year or the equivalent over a longer or shorter period. The mean
marihuana cigarette years for the group was 11 and the range from
2.5 to 26. Three of the marihuana users also used hashish. Chest
X-ray, comprehensive spironietry deterinitiations, lung volumes
and carbon monoxide diffusion studies were observed and retested
with prednisone. Pulmonary functions were essentially normal for
all of the non-cigarette smoking marihuana smokers and
non-smoking controls.<br>
</p>

<p>These investigators were able to distinguish differences in
quantity and structure and function in pulmonary macrophages and
minor material between marihuana smokers and nonsmokers. In
tobacco smokers more marked changes were noted. These changes do
not indicate a diminution in defensive capacity of these cells. </p>

<p>Kew et al. (1969) has suggested a possible hepatotoxic effect
of marihuana. right persons who smoked marihuana for two to eight
years, at least six times a week, evidenced mild liver
dysfunction by liver function tests and liver biopsy. Several of
the patients admitted to the use of alcohol and oral amphetamines
but denied use of intravenous drugs. The authors concluded that
the findings were not unequivocally due to marihuana. </p>

<p>Hochman and Brill (1971) noted abnormal liver function tests
in 10 of 50 frequent marihuana users. However, all admitted to
long-term, regular and heavy use of alcohol. When these subjects
abstained from alcohol for one month but continued their usual
marihuana usage, evidence of disturbed liver function cleared in
nine out of 10 subjects. </p>

<p>Recently, Liskow et al. (1971) reported the appearance of an
anaphylactoid reaction in a 29year-old woman after smoking
marihuana for the first time. Skin tests were positive for an
allergy to marihuana, constituents. Allergy to marihuana,
especially in areas of the country where it grows wild, may be
more common than generally believed. </p>

<p>Campbell et al. (1971) presented evidence of ventricular
dilatation consistent with cerebral atrophy by air
encephalography in 10 young males (average age 22) with histories
of consistent marihuana use for three to 11 years as well as less
frequent use of LSD and amphetamines. The first four of the
patients had been referred originally for neurological
investigation of behavioral change, memory loss or headache. The
remaining six subjects were selected from patients tinder
treatment for drug abuse because of their long history of
marihuana use and concomitant neurological and behavioral
symptoms. </p>

<p>However, the patients showed personality behavioral and mental
disorders, as well as histories of head trauma and psychomotor or
grand mal epilepsy that are commonly associated with
ventriculographic changes. Also alcoholism can be associated with
these findings. Additionally, the authors compared their subjects
ventriculograms with those of normal young adults originally
referred for loss of consciousness, syncope and headache without
subsequent development of neurological illness. </p>

<p>Thus, the authors demonstrated dilation of the third
ventricle, of the frontal or temporal horn, or of the trigone of
the lateral ventricle. All of these are commonly associated with
personality and mental disorders such as these patients shelved.
However, whether these changes are caused by marihuana is not
proven because no specific neuropathological cause for the
cerebral atrophy was identified. Further carefully designed
studies are required to clarify this finding. </p>

<p>The LaGuardia Report (Mayor's Committee, 1944) indicated no
damage to the cardiovascular, digestive, respiratory and central
nervous system, nor the liver, kidney or blood in individuals who
had used from two to 18 cigarettes of unknown potency (average
seven) for a period of two-and a-half to 10 years (average
eight). However, this study was not up to modern standards as it
lacked double-blind precautions and placebo controls and adequate
statistical analysis of the data. Bias was present in reporting.
Small numbers of prisoners were used as subjects. </p>

<p>Another less comprehensive American study of 310 individuals
who used marihuana on the average of seven years was performed on
soldiers (Freedman &amp; Rockmore, 1946). It did not demonstrate
any evidence of physical or mental deterioration.<br>
</p>

<p>Another team of investigators (Meyer et al., 1971; Mirin et
al., 1970) examined a group of 10 male marihuana users (average
age 25) who had consumed the drug about 20 to 30 times a month
for all average of 4.4 years (one-half to five year range) and
had smoked daily for three of the 4.4 years. Heavy use was
correlated with psychological dependence, search for insight or
meaningful experience, multi-drug use, poor work adjustment,
diminished goal directed activity, decreased ability to master
new problems, poor social adjustment and poorly established
heterosexual relationship. No physical or neurological or
psychiatric abnormalities were noted in their work-up. </p>

<p>Indeed, numerous American investigators have not reported
abnormalities in baseline, examinations of their experimental
subjects who have various patterns of marihuana use from very
infrequent to many times a day.<br>
</p>

<p><b>GENETICS AND BIRTH DEFECTS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Much concern about possible effects on the unborn generations
has arisen because of marihuana's use by persons in their
reproductive years. Presently, most studies are preliminary.<br>
</p>

<p>There are three isolated case reports in man (Gelehrter, 1970;
Carakiishansky et al., 1969; Heelit et al., 1968) of birth
defects in mail in the offspring of parents who had used
marihuana and LSD. However, due to their complex gestational
histories and the high level of birth defects seen in a
&quot;normal&quot; population, a causal relationship cannot be
attributed to cannabis or anything else. At present, there is no
substantial evidence indicating that marihuana at the dose
commonly used is a teratogen in man. </p>

<p>Marihuana has been implicated as a teratogen in animals by
several groups at high doses. One study (Miras, 1965) showed
reduced fertility in rats impregnated after being fed a diet
containing marihuana extract for several months. However, the
offspring were normal. The reduced fertility may be related to
the finding of marked decrease rate of cellular division, but
without chromosomal damage, -when Delta 9 or All THC is added to
white blood cell cultures (Neu et al., 1969 Martin, 1969). </p>

<p>Dorrance et al. (1970) and Gilmore et al. (1970) detected no
significant difference in lymphocyte chromosomes in groups of
users and nonusers. No significant differences were, found in
lymphocyte chromosomes between heavy, long-term. Jamaican ganja
users and matched nonusers. (Rubin and Comitas, 1972) </p>

<p>Pregnant mice injected with cannabis resin on day six of
gestation caused stunted but not malformed offspring. Fetal
reabsorption occurred when the dose was given on days one to six
(Persand and Ellington, 1967). A second experiment using rats
injected on days one to six produced a high frequency of
malformed progeny. Another investigator (Geber, 1969; Geber and
Schramm, 1969) demonstrated congenital malformations in fetal
hamsters and rabbits after large multiple doses of cannabis
extract. </p>

<p>Another group (Pace et al., 1971) have administered a wide
range of dosages of Delta 8 and Delta 9 THC and marihuana extract
by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intravenous routes at
varying intervals pre- and post-conception to rats, hamsters and
rabbits. Delta 9 THC up to 200 mg/kg in variety of dose schedules
produced reduced average litter size and stunted pups at high
doses but no birth defects. A low incidence of abnormalities
occurred in rats and rabbits with marihuana extract, but a high
incidence of neonatal deaths was observed apparently due to
inadequate material lactation. </p>

<p>Studies with radioactive labeled THC (Idanpaaiini-Heikkila et
al., 1969) indicated that it did cross the placenta in high
concentrations early in gestation during the developmentally
labile phase. </p>

<p>These studies suggest that Delta 9 THC itself is not a
teratogen. Instead, perhaps some unidentified substance or
substances in the plant extract may be causing the teratogenic
effect noted by this group and others when injected. It is
uncertain whether this theoretical substance(s) volatilizes
during smoking or enters the pulmonary vasculature (Pace et al.,
1971).<br>
</p>

<p>Consequently, the following FDA label required of many
currently prescribed psychoactive drugs warning about use in
Pregnant women and women of childbearing age, appeals indicated.
&quot;Safe use of the drug during pregnancy and lactation has not
been established; therefore, in administering the drug to
Pregnant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing
potential, the potential benefits must be weighed against the
possible hazards. Animal reproduction studies have yielded
inconclusive results. . . . There have been clinical reports of
congenital malformation associated with the use of this drug, but
a causal relationship has not been confirmed.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>ORGANIC BRAIN DAMAGE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Deterioration of mental functioning allegedly due to long-term
use of marihuana can be subdivided into four major categories:
organic brain damage, mental illness-psychosis, amotivational
syndrome, and recurrent-pnuenomenia. As with alcoholism, it is
quite often impossible to distinguish whether the described
effects result from drug use or represent personality traits or
changes which would have been present without the drug use. </p>

<p>When marihuana consumption was irregular, mental deterioration
was not evidenced (Freedman and Rockmore, 1946) in 310 users with
an average history of seven years of use. Sixty-seven heavy users
in New York showed no evidence of dementia attributable to drug
use although they did have underlying personality disorders.
Another investigation (Mayor's Committee, 1944) of individuals
who used a daily average of seven marihuana cigarettes (two to 18
range) for average of eight years (two-and-a-half to 16 range)
showed no evidence of brain damage or mental deterioration. </p>

<p>Reports from India (Chopra, 1935; Chopra, 1940; Chopra and
Chopra, 1939; Chopra, Chopra, and Chopra, 1942) relate minor
impairment of judgment and memory, limited self -neglect and
insomnia, when potent preparations are consumed regularly in
large amounts for many years. No evidence for mental
deterioration or brain damage has been noted.<br>
</p>

<p>Miras (1967) has described a Greek population of heavy hashish
smokers who appear as outcasts from the community after 15 to 20
years of heavy hashish use. They appear mentally sluggish and
depressed. They are reported to exhibit laziness, psychic
instability, amorality and apparent lack of drive and ambition.
Their speech and behavior has been described as -peculiar. Some
degree of responsibility is retained in that some do work to
cover their living and drug purchasing expenses. Some of them are
still quite intelligent. Memory is not deteriorated except during
the intoxication. They appear overly suspicious. Samples of their
electroencephalograms were believed to demonstrate abnormalities.
</p>

<p>However, Miras believes that this effect is related to the
quantity and frequency of hashish use. He describes three
categories of long-term hashish users. Type A uses low doses
intermittently and is socially and mentally unaffected. Type B1
uses low doses daily and no interference is caused in function.
Type B 2 uses high doses daily causing dependence and performance
decrements. Type C uses very high doses daily allegedly causing
mental deterioration and abnormal behavior described above. Fink
and Dornbush (1971) are currently intensively studying this
population. The results will be described in a later section. </p>

<p>Non-differentiated psychosis noted in foreign populations may
also be included within this diagnostic category. These will be
discussed with the psychosis.<br>
</p>

<p><b>PSYCHOSIS</b> </p>

<p>The alleged connection between mental illness and cannabis
derives from Africa, the Middle East and India. These areas are
currently developing economically and scientifically, but for
many years medical care and especially psychiatric care were
given low priority. Many chronic illnesses still persist in these
countries which may affect mental functioning. Furthermore,
well-trained psychiatrists and methodologists are very rare in
mental hospitals in these countries. Consequently, the findings
of earlier studies are questionable due to lack of controls,
biased sampling and poor data collection and failure to account
for variables like nutrition, living standard, cultural factors
and socioeconomic status. </p>

<p>India's mental institutions were widely quoted to support the,
connection between excessive cannabis consumption and insanity.
The Indian Hemp Commission performed a thorough and objective
investigation of this question, although methodologically it was
not up to modern standards. The Commission was unconvinced of the
reliability of hospital statistics, where often the diagnosis was
not made by a psychiatrist but by a referring policeman. </p>

<p>Therefore, the Commission examined all admissions to Indian
mental hospitals for one year. They found that cannabis rise
could not be considered a factor in more than seven to 13% of all
cases of both acute and chronic psychosis. </p>

<p>Chopra et al. (1942) carefully performed the same examination
of admission to Indian mental hospitals from 1928 through 1939
when cannabis use was extremely high. They found 600 cases of
acute and chronic psychosis which could be traced to cannabis
use. Other reports from India have produced varying estimates of
the incidence of cannabis psychosis (Peebles and Mann, 1914;
Chopra, 1971; Dhunjibhoy, 1930 Evens, 1904). In Egypt 27% to 33%
of mental hospital admissions were cannabis related (Ireland,
1893; Warnock, 1903). </p>

<p>Benabud (1957) reported that cannabis users comprised 68% of
all mental hospital admissions in Morocco but only 25% of these
admissions could be called cannabis psychosis. Watt (1936 and
1961) reported that 2% to 3% of mental hospital admissions in
South Africa were due to the use of dagga (cannabis). </p>

<p>Boroffka (1966) and Asuni (1964) reported that 14% of
psychiatric admissions in Nigeria used cannabis. Toxic psychosis
accounted for half of these and cannabis was felt to aggravate
underlying schizophrenia in the remainder. </p>

<p>Several statistical studies from other countries including
Jamaica, Colombia, Algeria, Panama and Tunisia support this type
of data (Prince et al., 1970; Beaubrun, 1971 Allentuck and
Bowman, 1942; Bouquet, 1951; Chevers, 1870; Defer and Dielil,
1968; Fraser, 1949; Freedman and Rockmore, 1946; Porst, 1942;
Siler et al., 1933; Reales-Aroyco, 1953; Medical Staff, 1938). </p>

<p>Very little information is available on the prevalence of
psychosis in the overall population of cannabis users. Chopra and
Chopra (1939) classified 2% of the ganja and charas smokers and
0.5% of the bhang drinkers in their sample of 1,200 as psychotic.
</p>

<p>Roland and Teste (1958) estimated that no more than 0.5% of
kif (cannabis) smokers in Morocco suffer from recurrent mental
conditions. </p>

<p>Prince et al. (1970), in a study in Jamaica, noted that about
20 patients per year are admitted to mental or general hospitals
with acute psychotic reactions allegedly precipitated by ganja.
In one general and one mental hospital the, ganja smokers
comprised 20% of the psychiatric admissions. Furthermore, the
percentage of heavy ganja smokers in the community was
significantly higher than 20%. Thus, a larger percentage of
psychiatric admissions were, derived from non-ganja smokers in a
comparable lower socioeconomic segment of the population. </p>

<p>This finding contrasts with the 68% prevalence of cannabis use
among psychiatric admissions reported by Roland and Teste (1958)
which is considerably higher than the prevalence of cannabis use
in the general population of Morocco. </p>

<p>Studies based on several hundred cases indicate that the large
majority of individuals hospitalized in mental institutions for
&quot;cannabis psychosis&quot; have suffered acute toxic
psychoses associated with a sharp toxic overdose or massive
excesses among habitual users. Occasional smokers and moderate
habitual users seldom had psychotic reactions and then only when
there were substantial predisposing factors. </p>

<p>The acute clinical picture seen in these delirium with
confusion, disorientation, terror, and subsequent amnesia is that
of a severe exogenous psychosis. It does not typically involve
the type of thought disorder characteristic of schizophrenia.
Short recovery times ranging from a few days to six weeks are
uniformly reported in sharp contrast to the lengthy recovery
period of functional psychoses (Chopra et al., 1942; Roland, and
Teste, 1958; Defer and Diehl, 1968; Beaubrun , 1971; Stringaris,
1939). </p>

<p>Consequently, the psychiatric literature on cannabis-induced
chronic psychosis is quite confused. In general, it appears that
cannabis use probably produces a specific psychosis, but this
must be quite rare, since the prevalence of psychosis in heavy
cannabis users, world-wide, is only doubtfully higher than the
prevalence in general populations (Murphy, 1963). However,
incidence and prevalence data for these countries on psychosis of
users and non-users of cannabis does not exist. </p>

<p>A Morroccan investigator, Christozov (1965), studied 140
chronic heavy hashish users hospitalized in a mental hospital.
Their behavior was characterized by a confusional state of
consciousness, an impulsivity, an irresponsible attitude, and an
instability of mood and character. The patients were often
psychotic with persistent hallucinations. Intellectual functions
were reduced in over half the cases although this was related to
a low intellect prior to drug use. Electroencephalography showed
no specific changes. In addition, it was noted that half of the
patients were also alcoholics. <br>
</p>

<p>The majority of the patients were, sedated and showed a rapid
improvement, allowing them to be discharged and be employed,
Although it appeared that these characteristics are reversible,
the patient often returned to heavy drug use again causing return
of the syndrome. </p>

<p>Thus, the existence of a more long lasting cannabis-related
psychosis is poorly defined. Some evidence indicates the
existence, of a, quite rare slow-recovery, residual
cannabis-psychosis following heavy chronic use. Patients often
exhibit schizophrenic-like withdrawal, mental confusion and mild
residual hallucinations; but there is little tendency for the,
symptoms to become organized or proliferate. The symptoms develop
gradually and then subside gradually before proceeding to
full-blown psychotic symptoms. These may produce gradual psychic
deterioration in the habitual excessive user after prolonged
periods of time. Several authors theorized that the chronic
psychosis consists of recurrent acute attacks with gradual
deterioration in habitual excessive users (Roland and Teste,
1958; Chopra, et al., 1942; Stringaris, 1939; Sigg , 1963).<br>
</p>

<p>Most investigators, therefore, find it exceedingly difficult
to distinguish a psychosis due to cannabis from other acute and
chronic psychoses because, few, if any symptoms, are uniquely
found in it and not observed in other psychoses. Often the
diagnosis of cannabis psychosis is made because of the history of
heavy marihuana or hashish use. Several have suggested that a
characteristic cannabis psychosis does not exist and that
marihuana will not produce a psychosis in a well-integrated,
stable person (Allentuck and Bowman, 1942; Reales-Aroyco, 1953). </p>

<p>In addition, alcohol often played a part in producing the
mental derangement (Medical Staff, 1938; Porst, 1942). Most data
refers to any form of psychosis in marihuana users; not
specifically cannabis psychosis. </p>

<p>Although it is fairly well-established that cannabis use
attracts the mentally unstable, the prevalence of major mental
disorder among cannabis users appears to be little if any higher
than that in the general population. Therefore, true cannabis
psychosis must be earlier, very rare or it must substitute for
other forms of psychosis. Perhaps, cannabis use alternatively is
protecting some less stable individuals from a psychosis (Murphy,
1963). </p>

<p>Because of these many difficulties, the role of cannabis use
in acute and especially chronic psychoses in these countries is
impossible to determine with certainty. </p>

<p>Finally, the Eastern literature often mentions the existence
of a characteristic psychic degeneration among older habitues
after prolonged excessive use (Chopra et al., 1942; Christozov,
1965; Indian Hemp Commission, 1893; Roland and Teste, 1958;
Stringaris, 1939; Warnock, 1903). They are frequently described
as showing a single minded, carefree state, such as
&quot;Kif-happy vagabonds.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>Soueif (1967) administered psychomotor and cognitive
performance tests to imprisoned hashish users and non-hashish
users in Egypt. Preliminary results indicate that, on most of the
tests, the hashish sample scored 10% to 20% below the control,
and differences were larger for those with higher educational
levels. These results do not necessarily indicate a causal
relationship. Assessment of the significance of these findings
must await further description of the samples utilized. </p>

<p>Experience in the U.S. and Western Europe has not involved a
level of marihuana use comparable to the above-mentioned
countries. Consequently, the associated chronic psychotic
disturbances have not been seen.<br>
<br>
In Western countries, Bromberg (1939) and Allentuck and Bowman
(1952) reported on acute psychotic episodes with clear-cut onset
during the marihuana intoxication. Most symptoms cleared within a
few days although several had a, prolonged illness. These rare
acute psychotic episodes, discussed earlier, have been described
recently by a variety of authors in scattered countries (Smith,
1968; Weil, 1970; Bialos, 1970; Keeler, 1967; Milman, 1971;
Pesyko, 1970 Kaplan, 1971; Prince et al., 1970; Baker and Lucas,
1969; Grossman, 1969; Beaubrim, 1971; Spencer, 1970). </p>

<p>Some of these reported cases are quite transient and clear
rapidly with support of others and may be more like acute panic
reaction than psychosis. Still others appear to fit the picture
of transient toxic psychosis. </p>

<p>A few cases of marihuana psychosis reported by Kaplan (1971)
recovered very slowly after extensive psychotherapy. However, the
high incidence of schizophrenia and borderline states described
in these patients and their families may indicate that marihuana
use merely aggravated or precipitated an underlying psychosis in
these individuals. </p>

<p>George (1970) reported a case in Britain in which an acute
episode of confusion, disorientation, hallucination, anxiety,
paranoia, agitation and memory loss related to cannabis use was
followed by a more chronic schizophrenic-like syndrome with
thought disorder, incongruous affect and hallucinations. This
individual was experiencing considerable financial and marital
stress prior to these two separate acute episodes. The chronic
condition eventually responded to psychotherapy.<br>
</p>

<p>Bernhardson. (1969) reported aggravation by cannabis of
schizophrenic conditions in several Scandinavian patients. Perna
(1969) reported a case in which marihuana appeared to aggravate
an extended psychosis for which the patient had required
psychiatric treatment prior to the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>Keup (1970) reported 14 cases of prolonged psychotic symptoms
requiring hospitalization associated with the use of marihuana.
He noted evidence for the existence of a, high level of
psychopathology in many of them which predated their marihuana
use.<br>
</p>

<p>Kolansky and Moore (1971) in a widely publicized report of
cases of individuals ages 13-to-24 has claimed profound adverse
psychological effects from smoking marihuana two or more times a
week. </p>

<p>Of 38 individuals reported, all had decompensated
personalities, eight had psychoses (four attempted suicide) and
13, according to the authors became sexually promiscuous due to
marihuana. These clinical impressions were, all based on, at
most, a few interviews with the, individuals who were referred to
these psychiatrists for consultation for problems (including
one-third by legal authorities after arrest for possession of
marihuana). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the authors made sweeping generalizations to
all young adolescent marihuana users from this biased and
non-representative sample. No attempt was made to interview other
young marihuana users who have not been referred for psychiatric
help, and the high prevalence of promiscuity and psychopathology
in comparable adolescent populations was totally disregarded. In
addition, case histories of previous mental health were obtained
introspectively from the patient, their families or the referral
source. </p>

<p>Thus, it is impossible, to state unequivocally, as the authors
do, that since marihuana use and psychiatric problems occurred at
the same time the former is causative of the latter. </p>

<p>Several authors have reported acute toxic psychosis following
marihuana use by soldiers in Vietnam (Talbott and Teague, 1969;
Colbach and Crowe, 1970, Bey and Zecchinelli, 1971). </p>

<p>All these cases represented transient reactions and cleared
rapidly with treatment. In many cases, personality disorders or
borderline personality states appeared to be predisposing factors
in the development of the psychotic state. Often revealed were
problems of identify diffusion, ego weakness, low self-esteem and
inability to form close interpersonal relationships. Also the
stressful conditions of the setting in which the drug was used
deserves emphasis. </p>

<p>Halikas et. al. (1971, 1972) performed intensive psychiatric
interviews on a population of 100 regular marihuana users and a
control group of 50 of their non-using or casually using friends.
Half of each group met the criteria for some psychiatric
diagnosis. Psychiatric illness and antisocial behavior most often
preceded marihuana use. </p>

<p>Some attempts have been made to estimate the incidence, of
psychosis and other adverse reactions to marihuana in Western
countries. Obviously, such estimates depend on how these
reactions are defined-one questionnaire study of 2,700
psychiatrists, psychologists, internists and general
practitioners in the Los Angeles area reported 1,887
&quot;adverse reactions&quot; to marihuana in an 18-month period
(Ungerleider et al., 1968). Adverse reactions were not defined by
the authors in the survey. Those reported ranged from mildly
unpleasant parental objections to use to severe anxiety or acute
psychosis. </p>

<p>Keeler (1967) reported on &quot;adverse reactions&quot; to
marihuana (paranoid feelings, etc.) which are limited to the
immediate period of intoxication. These phenomena occasionally
occur in such a light proportion of regular users that they are
of little interest in the present discussion, e.g., 80% of users
report they sometimes have paranoid reactions during the
marihuana intoxication (Tart, 1970). </p>

<p>Other estimates have been based on hospital admissions in
which marihuana use was the recognized precipitating cause.
Lundberg et al. (1971) reviewed the admission records for the Los
Angeles County General Hospital for the period 1961-1969 and
found marihuana use was listed as the reason for admission in
only nine out of 700,000 cases, and five of these were for
intravenous injections. </p>

<p>Keup (1970) reports that 0.9 per 1,000 of the 1968 admissions
to a Brooklyn psychiatric hospital were directly related to
cannabis use, and in another 1.9 per 1,000 it was found to be a
contributory factor. </p>

<p>In 1966, psychiatric hospitals in England listed 82 admissions
for which cannabis use was considered a factor (Baker and Lucas,
1969) in 1967, the number was 140 (George, 1970). For the 1966
data, further analysis revealed that eight of the 82 cases were
acute psychotic reactions to cannabis, 20 were related to
&quot;cannabis addiction as a way of life,&quot; and cannabis
could not be established as a definite factor in the remainder
(Baker and Lucas, 1969). </p>

<p>Colbach and Crowe (1971) estimate that among a population of
45,000 U.S. soldiers in Vietnam in 1969, some 40 to 50 per month
were hospitalized for psychiatric reasons and about five of these
were associated with (usually heavy) marihuana use. </p>

<p>Among college populations, Pillard (1970) estimates five to
seven marihuana-associated anxiety reactions are, seen per year
by the Boston University Health Service which cares for a student
population of 20,000; and Bialos (1970) reported 11 cases during
a one-year period (1968-1969) for a student population of 8,500. </p>

<p>If it is assumed that about one-third of the Vietnam and
college populations are using marihuana to some degree, the
annual incidence of hospitalized cases in Vietnam would be about
four per 1,000 users; the rate for student-health cases, 0.3 to
1.3 per 1,000 users. </p>

<p>The 1972 Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare's report
on Marihuana and Health prepared by the National Institute of
Mental Health noted in summary that marihuana can clearly
precipitate certain less serious adverse psychiatric reactions,
such as simple depression and panic, particularly in
inexperienced users. </p>

<p>In these reactions, non-drug factors may be the most important
determinants. Psychotic episodes may also be precipitated in
persons with a preexisting borderline personality or psychotic
disorder or those persons under excessively stressful conditions.
These acute psychoses appear to share considerable clinical
similarities with the acute toxic psychoses noted in the Eastern
literature. Both these psychoses resemble an acute brain syndrome
in that they occur primarily after heavier than usual usage and
are self-limited and short-lived after the drug is removed from
the body. </p>

<p>Some reports describing a prolonged psychotic course after an
initial acute episode cannot rule out the role of pre-existing
psychopathology. At the present time evidence that marihuana is a
suf ficient or contributory cause of chronic psychosis is weak
and rests primarily on temporal association. This issue may be
clarified by extensive epidemiological and controlled clinical
studies. (Secretary, HEW, 1972) </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME<br>
</b></p>

<p>Another type of possible mental deterioration or subtle
personality and behavioral changes associated with heavy
long-term cannabis use is the amotivational syndrome. </p>

<p>This syndrome has been described world-wide in its extreme
form when the most potent preparations are, used (Miras, 1967;
Chopra. and Chopra, 1957; Chopra et aL, 1942; Christozov, 1965;
Indian Hemp, 1893; Benabud, 1957; Warnock, 1903). Its most
extreme form depicts a loss of interest in virtually all
activities other than cannabis use. The resultant lethargy social
and personal deterioration and drug preoccupation may be
comparable to the skid row alcoholics' state. </p>

<p>Benabud (1957) describes the occurrence of this syndrome in
individuals chronically intoxicated with hashish. These
individuals are unlikely to show conventional levels of
motivation. Also the time required to obtain and consume enough
drug to maintain this state is not likely to leave much time for
other pursuits. The passive user tends to lose interest in work
and other long-term goals. </p>

<p>The question of whether there exists a significant causal as
opposed to an associative or correlational relationship, only
attracted attention when the traditionally achievement-oriented
Western youth adopted cannabis use. The traits of passivity or
amotivation are commonly described among heavy cannabis user
throughout the world. </p>

<p>A number of Eastern authors have expressed the opinion that
this is a result of organicity from chronic cannabis use in large
amounts, without objective studies being performed. </p>

<p>Recently the term has been used to describe the behavior of
numbers of young Americans who are for a variety of reasons
dropping out of school, refusing to prepare themselves for
traditional adult roles and smoking marihuana. </p>

<p>This type of social maladjustment is not comparable in
magnitude to that described in other cultures. However, the
individual may lose the desire to work, to compete, to face
challenges. Old interests and concerns are lost and the
individual's life, becomes centered around his compulsive drug
use. In addition, the individual may ignore personal hygiene,
experience loss of sex drive and avoid social interaction (Mirin
et al., 1970; Smith, 1968). </p>

<p>West (1970) and McGlothlin and West (1968) have described a
clinical syndrome as a result of observations of regular
marihuana users for four years. Their clinical impressions are
that these individuals show subtle changes in personality over
time which might represent an organic syndrome. These include
diminished drive, lessened ambitious decreased motivation,
apathy, shortened attention span, loss of effectiveness,
introversion, magical thinking, derealization and
depersonalization, decreased capacity to carry out complex plans
or prepare realistically for the future, a peculiar fragmentation
in flow of thought, and a progressive loss of insight. </p>

<p>Another psychiatrist, Powelson (1971), has also concluded on
the basis of over five years clinical experience with drug users
at the University of California, Berkeley, that the effects of
marihuana are cumulative. He, feels that after a period of
prolonged use a disorder of thinking characterized by a lack of
coherence and a pathological thinking process results. </p>

<p>These disturbing findings are being reported more frequently,
especially in adolescent and young-adult groups. Recently,
tentative and preliminary data (Francois et al., 1970; White et
al., 1970) has been presented on a group of 19 hospitalized
14-to-20-year-old patients with behavioral disorders who had used
marihuana and other drugs heavily. </p>

<p>In addition to &quot;amotivation,&quot; they showed primitive
and magical modes of thought and low frustration tolerance.
Subtle EEG patterns were detected although this finding is not
uncommon in adolescents with behavior problems. </p>

<p>The researchers are presently carrying out a study in
non-hospitalized adolescents without behavioral disorders who
have similar patterns of drug use in order to clarify their
findings. </p>

<p>Kornhaber (1971) believes that at least twice daily marihuana
use for a year, in a 13-to-18-yearold population, has a
deleterious effect upon the developing adolescent. The
intoxicated state facilitates a regression from
logical-mathematical thought processes to a more primitive
conceptual mode of fantasy and magical thinking and impairs
learning ability and judgment by decreasing attention and
concentration. Thus, the developing youth turns away from reality
toward fantasy and from structure and activity to passive
dependency. </p>

<p>Kornhaber suggests that marihuana facilitates the development
of normal adolescent turmoil into a pathological state. However,
he feels that the existence of the syndrome depends partially on
the individual's vulnerability to the drug influence. </p>

<p>A possibly milder variation of this syndrome has been
clinically observed by Scher (1970) in individuals in the
20-to-30 age group who have used marihuana daily for five years
while apparently functioning normally in society with good jobs,
often creative ones. These individuals begin to experience a
vague sense of functioning at reduced efficiency level. Thus, the
disabilities experienced are personal and internal ,and
constitute a vague neurotic depressive-like syndrome,. </p>

<p>In addition to the methodological problems of (Establishing
causative as opposed to associative relationships, it is also
very difficult to obtain a sample of heavy cannabis users in the
West who have not had substantial experience, with other drugs,
especially the strong hallucinogens. </p>

<p>Koridiaber (1971) has described a sample of 50 adolescent
psychiatric patients who used marihuana daily and also took other
drugs. He concluded that marihuana exercised a &quot;chronic,
tranquilizing, psychomotor-depressant effect&quot; among these
patients, and facilitated regression, fantasy and magical
thinking. School performance, participation in sports, and
personal hygiene also declined. He reported improvement in school
performance, mood and the underlying depressive symptoms for many
patients four to six weeks after discontinuing marihuana use. </p>

<p>Given there is a fairly strong tendency for heavy cannabis
users to be passive and apathetic, to emphasize the present over
the future, and to choose fantasy over rationality, there are
several ways by which this relationship might come about
(McGlothlin, 1972). </p>

<p>First,, persons who already exhibit these, traits may simply
be attracted to the use of cannabis. Sociologists tend to favor
this explanation, arguing that the relationship between cannabis
use and various behavioral indicators is not causal, but simply
one manifestation of a general pattern of youthful deviance or
rebellion (Goode, 1970). </p>

<p>Utilizing a large sample, Johnson (1971) found that marihuana
use is associated with impaired school performance and several
forms of deviance; however, other indicators such as premarital
sex and high school truancy predicted the dependent variable as
well or better. Tobacco and alcohol use were nearly as good
predictors as marihuana. </p>

<p>A second related explanation is that the illegal. context in
which the drug is taken forces the adoption of a nonconforming
life style. The users is thus further alienated from the dominant
culture through his close ties with the cannabis-using group. </p>

<p>Third, cannabis use and associated activities may largely
substitute for other interests. The individual may focus so much
of his time and energy on cannabis that he has little time for
other endeavors. </p>

<p>Fourth, heavy cannabis use may act pharmacologically to
produce a chronic tranquilized state. Although the acute phase of
intoxication is relatively short, there is some evidence of a
lethargic hangover effect (Haines &amp; Green, 1976). </p>

<p>Fifth, personality and behavior changes may result through the
routine process of learning via exposure. If an impressionable
youth spends a great deal of his time in the world of cannabis
intoxication, he may learn to think in a similar manner when not
intoxicated. In particular, he may learn to choose the drug
fantasy as an alternative to solving personal problems and facing
adult responsibility. </p>

<p>A related explanation is that cannabis acts as a catalyst,
creating a condition which facilitates change, providing other
necessary conditions are present. Cannabis, along with the strong
hallucinogens, produces a kind of mind-loosening effect in which
mechanisms providing structure and stability to perception of
self-image, environment, time sense,, etc., are temporarily
suspended. </p>

<p>The, more frequent users welcome this effect and report
utilizing the loosening effect of the drug to achieve further
personality change in the direction of less conformity and more
spontaneity, that is. the &quot;hang-loose ethic&quot; (Suchman,
1968; Simmons and Winograd, 1966). </p>

<p>In addition, the cannabis intoxication produces a heightened
suggestibility which likely makes the user more amenable to
adopting the attitudes and values of the subculture in which the
drug is taken. At a minimum, it may be concluded that the effects
of cannabis can reinforce and provide a rationalization for
previously existing tendencies. </p>

<p>Finally it is possible that chronic cannabis use can result in
organicity (Soueif, 1967). </p>

<p>In summary, if cannabis use produces personality and behavior
changes via one or more of the above mechanisms, the extent of
such changes is likely to be strongly related to the amount
consumed and the age of the user. According to evidence found in
Western literature, frequent use may be quite disruptive during
the formative years of adolescence. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the Eastern literature indicates that,
although the very heavy user (200 mg. THC or more per day) is
largely incapacitated, manual laborers often function adequately
while consuming amounts containing 30 to 50 mg. THC per day
(Roland and Teste, 1958; Chopra and Chopra, 1939). Similarly,
many musicians and entertainers in the United States have lived
productive lives while using marihuana (Winick, 1960). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>RECURRENT PHENOMENON</b> </p>

<p>Another poorly understood phenomenon is the spontaneous
recurrence of all or part of the drug intoxicated state (somatic
and visual sensations) when not under the influence of the drug.
This phenomenon has been called a &quot;flashback&quot; when it
occurs spontaneously or &quot;a contact high&quot; when it occurs
in the presence of others who are intoxicated. </p>

<p>Flashbacks have been reported with marihuana use alone.
However, these occurrences are apparently predominant in
marihuana users, who have taken hallucinogenic drugs previously.
These marihuana, users occasionally find that marihuana highs
change for them after their hallucinogenic. experiences. For
example, a simple hallucination experienced previously may
reoccur while high on marihuana. </p>

<p>These flashbacks may be interpreted as pleasant, even desired
experiences by some but unwelcome and disturbing to others. The
recurrences are benign in most individuals and tend to disappear
as the hallucinogenic experience recedes in time (Keeler, 1967;
Smith, 1968; Weil, 1970; Bialos, 1970; Blumenfield, 1970). </p>

<p>Truly vivid experiences which recapture most of the elements
of the original experience are extremely rare (Smith and Meld,
1970). More often they resemble an anxiety state occurring after
an unpleasant high or the recurrence of a new perceptual
awareness gained while high. It is difficult to differentiate
these recurrences from the not uncommon deja vu phenomenon in
which a person has the illusion that a perceived situation has
occurred before. These recurrences are intermittent and usually
occur within a few days to weeks following the use of marihuana.<br>

<h1>Investigations of Very Heavy, Very Long-Term Cannabis Users </h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Proving a causal relationship between the use of any substance
and an associated illness or condition is extremely difficult.
Ideally, prospective longitudinal studies on large populations of
both substance users and nonusers matched for socioeconomic and
psycho-cultural variables should be performed for many years in
order to detect subtle or cumulative effects. Unfortunately, the
enormous expenditures of research effort and finances that would
be required for a large scale investigation of this nature are
prohibitive. </p>

<p>Consequently, carefully designed and controlled, clinical and
epidemiological studies of very heavy, very long-term cannabis
users in foreign countries must be relied upon to provide
important data on possible effects because these populations are
not obtainable in the United States.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>GREECE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Preliminary results (Freedman and Fink 1971, Fink and Dornbush
1971, Fink 1971) from an intensive medical, neurological, and
psychiatric study of 31 male chronic hashish users in Greece,
performed under contract to the National Institute of Mental
Health, have revealed few abnormalities in these individuals.
Non-users matched for socioeconomic, and psycho-cultural factors
including life style, alcohol and tobacco consumption and
nutrition and general health have not been studied. </p>

<p>In collaboration with Professors Miras and Stefanis in Athens,
Fink and co-workers are studying a population of chronic hashish
users that Professor Miras has known for many years. The
population studied is composed of 31 male subjects ranging in age
from 26 to 69 years with a mean of 46 years. </p>

<p>The subjects report starting hashish use at 13 to 35 years of
age with a mean of 19. They have -used hashish from 10 to 49
years, with a median of 28 years. In the past they used an
average of eight grams of hashish daily with a range of 2 to 24:
grams daily. (The hashish it estimated to contain 4% THC on the
average. Therefore, average daily use was 320 mg. of THC). </p>

<p>In the past, 27 of the subjects were daily -users and four
used every other day. Frequently of hashish use per day was: once
per day-2 subjects, twice per day-6 subjects, three times per
day-14 subjects, four times per day-4 subjects, and five, or more
times per day-5 subjects. </p>

<p>The men reported a reduction in drug use with time ascribed to
increasing difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies due to
increased enforcement of the drug regulations. At present they
use an average of three grams of hashish daily (320 mg. of THC)
with a range of one to 10 grams daily. </p>

<p>Twelve now use hashish daily, eight use, every other day and
11 use less frequently. Frequency of daily hashish use is: once
per day-5 subjects, twice per day-12 subjects, three times per
day-10 subjects, four times per day-2 subjects, and gve(sic) or
more times per day-2 subjects. </p>

<p>The men are primarily hashish users. One has used opiates. Two
are heavy users of alcohol and six report occasional to frequent
use of alcohol at the present time. Tobacco is smoked by all
subjects averaging 40 cigarettes per day. </p>

<p>Twenty-three of the subjects report periods of abstinence from
hashish averaging ten months but up to three years. Hashish use
is primarily social by 20 subjects, and 15 subjects smoke in
solitude. </p>

<p>Pipes and cigarettes in which hashish is mixed with tobacco
are used interchangeably. The usual time of smoking is after work
(21 subjects) but 12 subjects smoke before work and five smoke
anytime. </p>

<p>In this population, the median education is three-and-a-half
years of school with a range of none to nine. Five of the men are
illiterate. Twenty-one of the men are married, one is cohabiting,
four are single and five are divorced or separated. </p>

<p>All of the married men are employed and support their
families. The subjects report changing their jobs frequently and
11 had periods of unemployment from three to 120 months. Ten were
classified as skilled workers and 21 as unskilled workers. Their
jobs include selling scrap metals, general labor, cartage,
messenger, maintenance assistants, etc. </p>

<p>Arrests are common and 19 report at least one non-hashish
related arrest. Eighteen have been in regular military service,
six were exempt because of hashish use and seven for other
reasons. </p>

<p>Interestingly, 10 of the 15 wives interviewed prefer the
behavior and attitudes of their husbands when they are using
hashish compared to when they are drug-free. </p>

<p>In regard to family and personal background 20 had refugee
parents, 13 had alcoholic or hashish using fathers, 26 had three
or more siblings, 19 had dominant mothers. Fifteen of 21 had
dominant wives. Seven reported broken homes under age 16. </p>

<p>Apparently, the subjects participation in society is
consistent with their lower socioeconomic background. No gross
behavioral deviation was detected I in this population. </p>

<p>Psychiatric status was evaluated by history and psychiatric
interview. Nine have had psychiatric hospitalization of which
three were in the military and related to hashish use. Two have,
had psychiatric outpatient treatment. Eight had histories of
neurotic traits during childhood. In their psychiatric
evaluation, three men are considered to have psychiatric
pathology. Two of these were considered sociopaths on the basis
of homosexuality and criminal behavior. The third was diagnosed
as a schizophrenic. No overt signs of any organic mental syndrome
were detected. None of the three men were believed to require
psychiatric intervention. The schizophrenic, although suspicious
and withdrawal, is a successful business man and lives with his
family on weekends. </p>

<p>Complete physical and neurological examination revealed three
prominent findings. All had very poor dentition which the men
ascribed to hashish smoking. Chronic bronchitis was detected in
14 of the men and emphysema in three others. This finding is not
surprising because all subjects were tobacco cigarette smokers
averaging 40 cigarettes per day, in addition to their very heavy
hashish consumption. Enlarged livers were also found in nine of
the 31 subjects. </p>

<p>Because no extensive psychological test battery has been
developed or standardized in Greece, American tests were used.
These tests are not culture-free, and it is possible that certain
items or subtests were inappropriate for the subjects because
they had not acquired the type of knowledge or skills required
due to their poor level of education. </p>

<p>The Wechsler-Bellevue I.Q. tests were translated into Greek
and administered. Because of these, factors, comparison of level
of performance between these subjects and white middle class
Americans is meaningless. </p>

<p>The mean I.Q. is 86 with a range of 69 to 109. The mean verbal
is 90.3 and the mean performance was 83.6. The group of subjects
performed lower than expected on digit symbol, digit span and
similarities but higher than expected on comprehension,
arithmetic, vocabulary and picture completion. The Ravens
Progression Matrices showed a similar pattern and mean I.Q. The
significance of these findings will depend on a comparison with a
matched nonuser population. </p>

<p>Resting electroencephalograms were obtained in 30 subjects and
evaluated independently by four experts. Twenty-five were within
normal limits. </p>

<p>Testing was incomplete in one record. One record in a subject
who had a head injury within the prior three months showed focal
slowing. </p>

<p>Two of the four experts judged the remaining three, records as
showing low degrees of average to low voltage theta activity
indicative of cerebral dysfunction. The remaining two experts
judged these records as within normal limits. </p>

<p>This medical and psychological data suggests some effects of
very long term, very heavy hashish use. Without a matched
comparison group, factors independent of hashish use, such as
age, socioeconomic conditions, or environmental conditions, may
account for the observed changes. </p>

<p>However, the researchers note that these men have survived
chronic hashish use in high doses without gross behavioral
deviation. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>JAMAICA<br>
</b></p>

<p>Another foreign investigation (Ruben et al., 1972) conducted
in Jamaica (under contract for the National Institute of Mental
Health) studied chronic cannabis users and matched nonuser
controls. Preliminary findings have shown little evidence of
significant differences between the two groups in the extensive
anthropological, medical, psychiatric and psychological
investigations. </p>

<p>Ganja use is widespread and endemic in the Jamaican lowest
socioeconomic strata, and in particular in a millenial-religious
sect known as the Rastafarians. More than 50% of all male
Jamaicans are estimated to use some form of cannabis, and
probably about 20% are regular heavy users of ganja. </p>

<p>The drug was brought to Jamaica from India over 130 years ago
by indentured East Indian laborers. However, presently the
heaviest ganja users are Afro-Jamaicans who comprise 90% of the
population. </p>

<p>The Rastafarian religious sect, founded by Marcus Garvey,
preach a &quot;Back to Africa&quot; destiny and claim Haile
Selassie to be God. The Rastafarians have always worn. long hair
and beards and dressed eccentrically. They believe that &quot;the
herb&quot; was given them by God to help them to understand his
wisdom exemplified in their greeting, &quot;Peace and Love.&quot;
</p>

<p>The Rastas reject the values of the dominant society and
regard the government as &quot;the powers of Babylon&quot;. They
have, chosen to opt out of conventional society and instead work
and live in a communal existence in poverty. They emphasize the
value of ganja in achieving a new level of meaning in this
existence. </p>

<p>The Rastafarians add ganja to their infant first bath and
start feeding the drug to their infants from the time of weaning
in an infusion known as ganja tea. They continue to smoke and
drink the drug throughout life. </p>

<p>They, like many other Jamaicans, believe in its medicinal
properties especially for asthma and indigestion and promotion of
healing; that it gives protection from evil spirits; that it
cleanses the skin and purifies the blood; that it promotes sexual
vigor; that it gives energy for work and relieves fatigue and
provides relaxation after work. </p>

<p>Extensive in-depth studies have been carried out by a team of
anthropologists from The Research Institute for the Study of Man
in conjunction with The Departments of Psychiatry, Pathology,
Physiology and Medicine, of the University of the West Indies.
Anthropology field workers lived for extensive periods of time in
five rural communities (including fishing, farming and cane
cutting areas) and two urban districts. </p>

<p>Over 2,000 people were observed and studied in these
communities. Overall life styles of the ganja users were not
notably different from nonusing individuals in the Jamaican
lowest socioeconomic strata. Users are working, maintaining
stable families and homes, and actively participating in their
society. No evidence was noted of crime or aggressive behavior or
drug use other than alcohol related to ganja use. No evidence of
physical dependence was demonstrated. Minimal psychological
dependence was observed but no drug craving was expressed. </p>

<p>Thirty long-term ganja smokers and 30 nonusers matched
demographically to control factors other than ganja use, were
chosen as representative of this functioning lower socioeconomic
population and selected for intensive hospital study in order to
determine, differences between the two groups. </p>

<p>The mean age of the subjects was 33 with a range of 23 to 51.
The primary occupation of one-third of the subjects was farming.
The next most common occupations were, fishing, skilled and
semiskilled laborers. Half practiced no formal religion, five
were Rastafarians and the remainder practiced a wide variety of
traditional religious. Almost three-fourths of the males had
stable &quot;marriages&quot; and the remaining single subjects
were predominantly the younger ones. </p>

<p>The subjects were divided into three groups. Twenty-three were
nonganja smokers, 28 were regular daily ganja smokers and 9 were
occasional ganja smokers using the drug several times a we or
less. Three types of regular ganja smokers were delineated: light
smokers using one to four spliffs daily moderate smokers using
four to seven spliffs daily; and heavy smokers using eight or
more spliffs per day. </p>

<p>Age of first use ranged from 8-36 years of age. Regular use of
ganja occurred at a median age of 16 years with a range of 9-25
years. All ganja smokers had used the drug at least 7 years and
some up to 37 years with a mean of 17.5 years. </p>

<p>The ganja users consumer on the average seven spliffs of ganja
daily with a range of one to 24 per day. The typical ganja
cigarette or cigar, termed a spliff is roughly a four-inch-long
paper cone and contains about two to three grams of ganja with a
delta 9 THC content of about 2.9% on the average (range of
0.7-10.3%) mixed with about half of a Tobacco cigarette. Also
many smoke ganja in a Chillum pipe using very deep inhalation to
fill their lungs with smoke. They consume 14 pipe fulls per week
on the average, with a range of 1-25 per week. </p>

<p>No significant differences in neurological abnormalities,
electroencephalographic abnormalities, hemochemical changes
including liver function, urinalysis, chest X-ray abnormalities
or chromosome damage in lymphocytes were found in the users or
controls. </p>

<p>One user had a long history of bronchial asthma and another
had a mild case of Jamaican neuropathy, but nothing suggests
these disabilities were in any way related to ganja use. Minor
electrocardiographic abnormalities were present in about
one-third of both users and controls. This may be related to a
syndrome of unknown etiology known as Jamaican cardiomiyopathy. </p>

<p>Thorough physical examination and hematological studies
revealed only minimal significant differences between ganja
smokers and non-ganja smoking controls. Comprehensive evaluation
of red blood cell indices revealed that the ganja smokers had
significantly higher hemoglobin levels and packed red cell
volumes (hematocrit) than the non-ganja smokers. </p>

<p>These hematologic findings are compatible with those reported
recently (Sangan and Balberzak, 1971) for heavy tobacco cigarette
smokers. The authors noted that cigarette smoking causes a
functional tissue hypoxia due to deficits in lung func tionwith
resultant arterial oxygen unsaturation. Thus, an increased demand
is placed on the bone marrow to provide more red blood cells to
increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. </p>

<p>In addition to the heavy smoking of ganja in spliffs and
pipes, 27 of the 30 ganja smokers were tobacco smokers, and
several have smoked tobacco cigarettes heavily. 19 of the 30
non-ganja smokers were tobacco cigarette smokers and tended to be
light tobacco cigarette smokers. </p>

<p>Thus, the data appears to suggest that a combination of
factors including number of years and quantity of cigarette
smoking, ganja spliff smoking and ganja chilum pipe smoking is
significantly correlated with the hematological changes
indicative of functional hypoxia. However, pulmonary function
studies did not demonstrate significant decrements correlated
with ganja or tobacco smoking. </p>

<p>No significant differences were found between groups by a
thorough psychiatric and psychological examination. All subjects
were judged to be in normal mental health. Subjects were
administered a battery of standardized reliable American
psychological tests known to be sensitive to impairment in brain
function. These tests were not culture free so that comparison of
performance, between Jamaicans and Americans is meaningless
Nineteen tests evaluating 47 variables were performed including
one personality test, three tests of intelligence and verbal
abilities, and 15 neuropsychological tests. </p>

<p>Two of 47 variables had statistically significant differences
between ganja smokers and non-smokers. The smokers scored higher
on the digit span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale and bad a more centralized personality organization on the
Lowenfeld Mosaic Test. </p>

<p>Non-smokers had the best performance on the number of edge
contacts with the non-dominant hand on the Holes Test. These few
significant differences were considered chance findings by the
investigators. </p>

<p>In general no consistent differences were found on these
psychological tests between ganja smokers and non-smokers. The
data clearly indicate that the long-term ganja use by these men
did not produce demonstrable intellectual or ability deficits
when they were without the drug for three days. No evidence in
these results suggest permanent brain damage. </p>

<p>The alleged role of ganja in producing personality change in
the direction of a loss of competitive striving and an
unwillingness to work, termed the amotivational syndrome was also
investigated. </p>

<p>Based on clinical impressions gained from careful sociological
and psychological techniques, the investigators noted that the
chronic ganja smoker differed little in work habits or record
from his matched control. No evidence of an amotivational
syndrome was found. In fact, the subjects believe ganja has a
functional value as a work adjunct. It provides energy for work
and helps them do arduous boring jobs. </p>

<p>In the Jamaican culture, ganja may produce a
&quot;motivational syndrome&quot;. In an objective videotape
evaluation of work energy output and ganja smoking, ganja use did
not lower productivity on simple repetitive tasks, such as
woodcutting which requires compulsive concentrated effort. </p>

<p>A study of cultivators points up the relationship of
population, land, and economic pressures to ganja use. In the
area studied land resources are scarce, farms small and
cultivation difficult on the hilly slopes. Market conditions
determine income from cash crops and restrictions on migration
maintain population pressures on limited resources. </p>

<p>For these farmers, the researchers suggest that ganja use,
decreases total cultivated acreage and consolidates production
while disruption of competition and social cohesiveness among the
farmers is avoided. </p>

<p>These data may indicate that heavy ganja use during
cultivation in farming situations with limited alternatives may
serve to maintain the status quo. However, it is possible that
the compulsive concentrated effort experienced by the cultivators
with heavy ganja use may be productive in areas with good soil
and climatic conditions where systematic weeding can increase
crop yields. </p>

<p>As a result of the extensive anthropological study, the
investigators believe that ganja use in Jamaica is a culturally
determined phenomenon. A &quot;ganja complex&quot; exists which
consists of closely related, learned patterns of behavior
manifested by the members of the society. </p>

<p>The ganja complex appears to be functional for the
working-class Jamaican. Various elements Of the complex including
economic, social and personal are interrelated in ways that
contribute to operation of the whole culture.<br>

<p><b>AFGHANISTAN<br>
</b></p>

<p>Dr. Salamuddin Weiss (1971) studied 1011 chronic hashish users
in Kabul in order to obtain a general picture of the charas habit
in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>Cannabis is cultivated in this tropical country. A
concentrated product, charas, the resin obtained from the
flowering tops of the female plant, is the preparation generally
used. The most common method of smoking charas is in a clay water
pipe called a Chelum. Next most commonly used is a pipe or needle
and straw. Infrequently, charas is smoked in tobacco cigars or
cigarettes. Chewing the leaves or drinking a charas mixture as a
confection is quite rare. </p>

<p>Although charas smokers are found throughout society, they are
predominantly found in certain groups. The ages of the subjects
studied ranged from 13 to 70 years old. More than 75% were,
married. Almost all were males. </p>

<p>Socioeconomic status was as follows: 70%, lower, 28% middle
and 2% upper. 82% are illiterate, 27% had a primary school
education and less than 1% had any higher education. </p>

<p>Most smoking occurs in groups of two to 20 friends in quiet
out of the way places. Most users smoke several times a day. The
longer one has smoked charas, the shorter the duration of the
high and the more often the individual can smoke each day. </p>

<p>Weakness, sexual difficulties and physical impotence are
commonly reported by smokers. Most report they have a good
appetite and eat more than normal, but malnutrition is common. </p>

<p>One hundred chronic smokers were selected at random and
examined medically: 93 were malnourished; no evidence of illness
was found in 79 subjects; 13 showed signs of respiratory illness
(bronchitis) ; 7 showed sleep disturbances and one had pulmonary
tuberculosis. No deaths have been reported from charas overdose.
One subject out of the 1,011 was known to be chronically
psychotic. </p>

<p>A review of over 150,000 outpatient and inpatient psychiatric
visits per year over the past 10 years revealed 20 short-term
psychotic episodes yearly involving charas alone and 16,
short-term psychotic episodes yearly involving both charas and
other drugs. An absence of chronic mental illness related to
charas use was noteworthy. </p>

<p>Most charas smokers commence use during their teens, gradually
increasing their use about five or six times until they reach
their highest dose between the ages of 20 to 40 years. </p>

<p>At the extreme, smokers have raised their daily dosage up to
10 times their starting dose within the first two years. They
then gradually decrease their daily requirement by about 50% upon
reaching their 60's. Generally, most smokers cease charas use
after their 60's, but some. use extremely low doses for the rest
of their lives. </p>

<p>I These patterns of use are consistent with the development of
tolerance. Additionally, chronic smokers note they are able to
use larger doses than they did when they began use without any
significant signs of intoxication. Also after stopping charas use
for a few days or months, the users report they restart use at
smaller doses to achieve the desired effect. </p>

<p>No physical dependence was noted. Marked psychological
dependence was present which makes it difficult to stop their
habitual use. Discontinuation of charas use produced mild
psychologic abstinence signs. These signs, generally include
restlessness loss of appetite, sleeplessness, nervousness,
headache, and gastrointestinal upset. </p>

<p>Most smokers after discontinuation of use are quite able to
live with their families and perform their jobs without
discomfort. Most chronic smokers return to charas use within days
or months. Out of a group of 100 randomly selected ex-smokers who
had used for eight to 22 years, 42 have not returned to charas
use, 16 use occasionally and 42 have returned to daily use within
one to 13 months. </p>

<p>Most common explanation given by the subjects for restarting
use were to continue close relationships with charas using
friends and lack of a busy job. </p>

<p>A group of 100 opium addicts were selected at random from the
community; 51 of these started their drug use with charas and
later substituted opium for charas. </p>

<p>Generally, charas smokers report that they become faster in
their daily jobs, but observation reveals a slowness in these
activities. The ability to perform a non-complicated job is
comparable to non-charas smokers. They tend to be cooperative but
lazy persons. They tend to be more theoretical than practical and
avoid making decisions. They do not demonstrate creativity or
contribute significantly to the improvement of their community. </p>

<p><b>Summary<br>
</b></p>

<p>Marihuana has been used by man in countries around the world
for many centuries. Scientifically, more is known about
marihuana's effects than many other botanical substances consumed
by man. </p>

<p>Marihuana is one of several preparations from the plant,
cannabis sativa. The plant contains many different chemicals, but
tetrahydrocannabinol appears to be the major active
psychopharmacologic ingredient. The potency of the preparation is
determined by the THC content, which varies according to the
origin of the seed, the conditions of cultivation, and the extent
of manicuring. </p>

<p>Several important factors exert significant influences on the
psychopharmacological effect. These include dose, method of use,
set and setting, and pattern of use including frequency and
duration of use. </p>

<p>The acute subjective experience is dose-dependent. At low
doses commonly used in this country a mild intoxication occurs,
but at higher doses psychotomimetic experiences can occur. Few
consistent physiological effects are noted. No pathologic bodily
changes have been conclusively demon, strafed from acute use.
Subtle effects on recent memory, psychomotor function, and social
behavior have been demonstrated. </p>

<p>The margins of safety between the effective dose and the toxic
dose is quite large. No human fatalities have been noted in this
country caused by marihuana. The most common adverse reactions
are becoming too intoxicated, and the acute anxiety panic
reaction. Both of these are transient and related to dose
consumed as well as set and setting factors. </p>

<p>Acute psychotic, reactions are quite rare. They usually last a
few days to weeks and occur in predisposed persons either with
preexisting mental disorders or borderline personalities
especially under stressful conditions. Transient acute brain
syndrome or toxic psychosis is possible at extremely large doses.
</p>

<p>Evidence has accumulated which indicates that differential
tolerance does develop at least, in persons who smoke large
amounts of marihuana several times a day. Development of
tolerance to the depressant effects on behavior appears to
precede development of tolerance to the intoxicant effect. </p>

<p>Physical dependence has not been demonstrated. Little, if any,
psychological dependence is present in most intermittent
marihuana users. Moderate psychological dependence occurs in
moderate to heavy users and marked psychological dependence has
been described in very heavy chronic users. </p>

<p>Some detrimental effects have been conclusively linked to
short- and long-term marihuana use for very heavy users. The most
frequently reported change in the heavy, long-term smokers of
large quantities of potent preparations is chronic bronchitis
comparable to that developed by a heavy, long-term tobacco
cigarette smoker. A chronic cannabis psychosis probably occurs
rarely in heavy chronic, hashish smokers in Eastern countries.
Most psychotic episodes are the acute variety and clear in a few
days to weeks. No objective evidence has been demonstrated that
even very heavy, long-term hashish use causes organic brain
damage. </p>

<p>Objective studies of chronic, heavy smokers of potent
preparations have not causally linked this drug with the
amotivational syndrome which has been described by many
clinicians. Almost all chronic, heavy hashish smokers are
indistinguishable from their peers in the lower socioeconomic
strata of their respective societies in social behavior, work
performance, mental status and overall life style.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>III. Marihuana and Public Safety</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The significant role of the law enforcement community and the
popular press in promoting the idea that marihuana use leads to
undesirable and antisocial behavior has been discussed in the
Report. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the genesis of
the, perceived problem and the theoretical basis for these
allegations. </p>

<p>The early campaigns against marihuana use can be viewed as an
extension of the temperance and moral reform movements which
swept the country during the 1920's. They were generally
spearheaded by persons who opposed the use of opiates, alcohol
and tobacco on the grounds that all such substances were
physically, mentally and morally debilitating. The presumed
dependence of the user on the drug, the loss of self-control and
the unhealthy preoccupation with pleasure-seeking activities
purportedly induced by these substances were seen as contrary to
the traditional values of our society. </p>

<p>Reiteration of these themes by practicing professionals,
respected members of officialdom and the popular press ultimately
gave rise, to what Lindesmith (rev. ed., 1968: 188-189) has
termed the &quot;evil causes evil&quot; fallacy, and which Goode
(1972) has de-scribed as follows: </p>

<p>The impetus behind public and even expert conceptions of drugs
and drug use is that a phenomenon so patently undesirable and
universally condemned as the use of narcotics or marihuana must,
inevitably, have both pathological causes as well as pathological
consequences. Thus, the task of science and medical research is
seen as &quot;discovering&quot; these negative concomitants of
illicit drug use. In this way, we can all feel better about
condemning the phenomenon itself because our moral and
ideological feelings can thereby be, backed up and verified by
the Indisputable data of positive science (p. 1). </p>

<p>This same philosophical leaning of persons who view marihuana
as a significant danger to both the individual and society
carries with it a corollary that use be prohibited and the user
punished. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most persistent controversy with respect to
marihuana use is the degree to which it poses a danger to public
safety. Public and professional opinion surveys have repeatedly
demonstrated the existence of a widespread belief that marihuana
use leads to the commission of deviant, delinquent, criminal and
violent acts. In addition, some persons have recently expressed
concern that marihuana impairs driving skills and performance
and, in this way, also constitutes a public safety hazards. </p>

<p>This chapter will review the evidence pertaining to the
effects of marihuana on criminal and violent behavior, deviant
and aggressive sexual behavior and driving skills and
performance. Then an effort will be made to assess both the
nature and strength of the purported relationships between
marihuana use and these behaviors.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Problems in Assessing the Effects of Marihuana<br>
</b></p>

<p>The degree to which marihuana constitutes a danger to public
safety is dependent, in large measure, upon the drug's
observable, effects on the behavior of the user. No drug,
including marihuana, produces the same effect at all times, under
all conditions and in all individuals. Rather, the quality (form
and intensity) and the quantity (extent and frequency) of the
perceived effects are determined by the complex interaction of
both pharmacological and extrapharmacological factors. As Goode
(1972) has noted: </p>

<p><i>We should bear this qualification in mind when looking at
the relationship between the ingestion of a drug and any
subsequent behavior-with the latter supposedly &quot;caused&quot;
by the effects of the drug. Drug effects vary, and, in addition,
even standard effects do not automatically translate into
specific forms of human behavior</i> (P. 18).<br>
</p>

<p>In a paper prepared for the Commission, Tinklenberg (1971 :
1-8) has enumerated some of the basic factors which should be
taken into consideration in evaluating the relationship between
marihuana and crime. They are equally relevant, however, for the
assessment of any behavioral effect presumably attributable to
marihuana, and for that reason they are summarized below. </p>

<p><b>Definition and Congeners</b>. The concentration of the
principal active chemicals in cannabis (THC and their
metabolites) in any given amount of marihuana varies widely
according to where the plant is grown, how it is cultivated,
harvested and cured. These variations permit a wide range of
pharmacological potencies and unknown variations in their effects
on behavior. </p>

<p><b>Drug-Drug Interactions.</b> Given the strong possibility of
intentional or inadvertent adulteration of marihuana with other
psychoactive drugs, it may be that behavioral changes attributed
to marihuana may actually derive from the adulterants or from the
interaction of THC and the adulterants (which may well be
occasioned by the deliberate rather than unknown simultaneous or
sequential use, of other psychoactive drugs). </p>

<p><b>Dose-Response Functions.</b> With respect to the question
of how drugs affect behavior, it is likely that marihuana
influences behavior in different ways and degrees, depending upon
dosage levels. Although it is common to infer that higher doses
of a given drug will induce more of a particular response and
lower doses less, such inferences may be inaccurate in that drug
effects can show a curvilinear dose-response relationship (as
seems to be the case with alcohol). </p>

<p><b>Time-Action Functions.</b> Time-action function describes
the changing effects of marihuana during the course of the drug
action. During the brief periods in which the drug effects are
most intense, there may be a more pronounced alteration in
behavior than during most of the points on the drug time-action
continuum. </p>

<p><b>Individual Variation.</b> Different individuals apparently
respond quite differently to the same dose-time factors of
marihuana as well as other drugs. In some laboratory studies,
where, high doses of marihuana induced considerable euphoria and
enhanced conviviality in most subjects, a few subjects who
received the same dosage in the same setting experienced
paranoia, excessive agitation and aggressive tendencies. </p>

<p><b>Cumulative Effects</b>. The effects of marihuana on
individual behavior have been shown to vary according to the
amount of previous experience with the drug. There is increasing
evidence that chronic users respond quite differently to
marihuana than do occasional users. The cumulative extent of
previous experience may have an important influence on subsequent
behavioral responses. </p>

<p><b>Psychological and Environmental Variables.</b> The
behavioral response to marihuana and to other drugs is at least
partially dependent upon such psychosocial variables as the
expectations of the user regarding its influence on his behavior.
These expectations are in turn derived from. the personalities of
the, individuals involved, recent events in their lives, and the
physical, interpersonal and social milieu in which the marihuana
use occurs. The behavioral responses to marihuana use are likely
to correlate with such psychological and environmental variables
quite independently of any pharmacological effects the drug may
exert. </p>

<p><b>Personality Factors</b>. A certain number of individuals in
any given population demonstrate characteristic and relatively
enduring patterns of antisocial behavior regardless of their
immediate circumstances, possible drug use and the like. These
individuals, variously described as antisocial, criminal or
emotionally unstable, typically manifest, from childhood on,
recurrent tendencies toward deviance in many areas of life. For
some of these people, those predisposed toward both criminality
and drug abuse, crime and drug use do coexist. However, the
assumption that the drug causes crime or vice versa is not
necessarily valid. One should not automatically conclude from
this that the use of drugs has no influence on their criminal
behavior. Drug use may possibly provide a form of reinforcement
which may increase or decrease the likelihood of a criminal act. </p>

<p><b>Crime Process Factors.</b> Crime process factors refer to
the complexities of criminal behavior and the possible influence
of marihuana on that behavior. A multifactored perspective of the
etiology of crime , including personal, social and situational
variables, allows for the possibility that at each step in the
chain of events leading to the commission of a criminal act,
marihuana use may contribute to enhance or diminish the
possibility of this outcome. <br>
</p>

<p>In short, any interpretation of the data to be presented below
which fails to take into account at least some of these variables
will likely result in a &quot;post hoc, ergo propter hoc&quot;
fallacy-that is, the invalid assumption that simply because one
event occurs later than another event (one commits a crime after
smoking marihuana) that the latter is caused by the former
(marihuana caused the crime).<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and Violence</h1>

<p>(The evidence to be presented here applies not only to
aggression and to violence but to marihuana's relationship to
crime in general, and is therefore equally relevant to a later
section on marihuana and non-violent crime. The effects of
marihuana on sexual behavior, including the commission of sexual
offenses will be treated in the following section on marihuana
and sexual behavior.) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The popular and professional literature contains numerous
unsupported and often emotionally charged accusations regarding
marihuana's contribution to violence. </p>

<p>In at least two dozen comparatively recent eases of murder or
degenerate sex attacks, marihuana proved to be a contributing
cause (Anslinger, 1937). </p>

<p>In a recent study of thirty-seven murders in New Orleans in a
year, seventeen were traced directly to marihuana. . . . Evil
marihuana is pock-marking this nation with murders, sex attacks,
suicides, and crimes in every category from bank stick-ups to
petty thievery . . . (LaRoe, 1940). </p>

<p>Marihuana, while giving the hallucinations of cocaine, adds
delusions of impending physical attack by one's best friend or
close relatives. In addition, marihuana is intrinsically and
inherently crime exciting. It has led to some of the most
revolting cases of sadistic rape and murder of modern times
(Rowell and Rowell, 1939: 67). </p>

<p>Even sex does not satisfy the abnormal urges induced by
marihuana. There is still the necessity for further excitement,
more emotional release. That is when the guns are grabbed, the
knives waved and the razors swung. And all that is a marihuana
user's idea of what is normal! (Williams, 1969). </p>

<p>To add greater credibility to their undocumented assertions,
some persons describe the manner in which the drug purportedly
leads to violence. </p>

<p>In the earliest stages of intoxication the willpower is
destroyed and inhibitions and restraints are released; the moral
barricades are broken down and often debauchery and sexuality
result. Where mental instability is inherent, the behavior is
generally violent. An egotist will enjoy delusions of grandeur,
the timid individual will suffer anxiety, and the aggressive one
often will resort to acts of violence and crime ... (Anslinger
and Tompkins, 1953: 22). </p>

<p>Smoking of the weed is habit-forming. It destroys willpower,
releases restraints, and promotes insane reactions ... Robberies,
thrill murders, sex crimes and other offenses result (New York
Daily Worker, 1940, in Solomon, 1968: 288). </p>

<p>Others simply deny these allegations or assert that there is
no evidence to support the thesis of an independent causal
relationship. </p>

<p>The fact that so many witnesses testified to the peaceable and
orderly character of the excessive consumers goes far to prove
that in this country experience shows that as a rule these (hemp)
drugs do not tend to violent crime and violence (Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission, 1969: 258). </p>

<p>A fair summary of the available evidence would be that very
rarely do major (particularly violent) crimes follow upon the use
of the drug, and that, in instances where they do, the
relationship is an indirect one (Ausubel, 1958: 103). </p>

<p>One likely hypothesis is that, given the accepted tendency of
marihuana to release inhibitions, the effect of the drug will
depend on the individual and the circumstances. It might, but
certainly will not necessarily or inevitably, lead to aggressive
behavior or crime (President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice, 1967: 13). </p>

<p>The relationship between marihuana use land the commission of
aggressive acts or violent crime such as murder, rape and assault
remains one of the most controversial issues relating to the
drug. Persons who believe that such a relationship exists often
argue that marihuana triggers the release of inhibitions and
restraints, destroys the will power and heightens aggressive
tendencies of the user, serving as a catalyst for the commission
of aggressive or violent acts. </p>

<p>This argument raises several fundamental questions: Are the
effects presumably induced by the drug commonly experienced by
marihuana users? Are these effects, to the extent that, they do
occur, generally or frequently translated into overt behavior?
And is the behavior which presumably manifests itself ordinarily
violent or aggressive? </p>

<p>The answers to these questions may be obtained from several
sources, including the results of laboratory experiments designed
to measure certain physiological and psychological reactions and
to identify observable behavioral effects; and retrospective
self-reports of effects purportedly experienced by marihuana
users. Additional clues may be gained from examination of the
criminal records of known marihuana users and the incidence of
marihuana. use among persons arrested for or convicted of violent
crimes. However, while these latter methods may reveal
statistical associations (which could prove to be spurious upon
further analysis), they should riot be interpreted to demonstrate
the existence of a causal connection between marihuana use and
the offenses committed. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE VIOLENT AND CRIMINOGENIC EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA</b> </p>

<p>The empirical evidence gathered to date lends no support to
the hypothesis that marihuana heightens aggressive tendencies in
the user or that its effects significantly increase the
likelihood of inciting the user to violence or crime. However,
those findings summarized below do not mean that marihuana cannot
be related to aggressive or violent behavior but merely suggest
that the effects of the drug and the behaviors in question may
operate independently. </p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944) studied the
psychomotor effects of marihuana on 72 prisoners, both users and
non-users. Marihuana was administered experimentally as both an
oral extract and as cigarettes. The data show that the degree of
the drug's effect on psychomotor activities is dependent upon the
complexity of the function and, in some cases, on the strength of
the dose administered. Although simple reaction time and tasks
were only slightly affected, more complex functions like static
equilibrium and body and hand steadiness were significantly and
adversely affected by both large (5 cc.) and small (2 cc.) doses
of the drug. </p>

<p>In contrast to the ability of amphetamines to enhance muscular
performance and to increase physical activity (Weiss and Laties,
1962; Tinklenberg and Stillman, 1970), marihuana has been found
to decrease the inclination toward physical activity and to
actually reduce both physical exertion and activity (Mayor's
Committee on Marihuana, 1944; Hollister, et. a]., 1968;
Hollister, 1971), thereby decreasing the probability of inciting
the user to assaultive behavior. </p>

<p>Although marihuana has been found to reduce inhibitions in
some persons, it has not been shown to exaggerate extant
aggressiveness to any appreciable degree; in some instances it
has, in fact, been shown to reduce aggressiveness, and to induce
timidity, fear and passivity in the user (Bromberg) 1934,1939;
Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Allentuck, 1942; Chopra, and Chopra,
1942; Charen and Perelman, 1946; Carstairs, 1954; Blumer, et.
al., 1967; National Institute of Mental Health, 1970, 1972). </p>

<p>In recent years, a number of studies have been conducted in
which marihuana users were asked to describe the effects they
experienced while under the influence of the drug. On the whole,
their findings are similar to those obtained from the results of
laboratory experiments. </p>

<p>Halikas, Goodwin and Guze (1971) found that the majority of
the users in their sample reported &quot;usually&quot; feeling
relaxed (79%) and peaceful (74%). </p>

<p>Tart (1971) administered a questionnaire to college students
in California, one item containing a list of 206 possible effects
of marihuana. Respondents were asked to indicate whether, within
the last six months, they had experienced the designated effects
never, rarely, sometimes, very often or usually. Of the 153
respondents, 69% gave one of the latter three responses to the
item: &quot;My inhibitions are lowered so that I do things I'm
normally inhibited to do.&quot; </p>

<p>To the item: &quot;I lose control of my actions and do
antisocial things (actions that harm other people) that I
normally wouldn't do,&quot; 22% said rarely, 1% said sometimes,
and the remaining 77% replied &quot;never.&quot; With respect to
other more specific effects, 23% of the users stated they
&quot;usually&quot; felt physically relaxed, and 49% said they
&quot;very often&quot; felt physically relaxed and did not want
to get up or move around when high on marihuana (pp. 703-704). </p>

<p>In a study by Brotman and Suffet (1970) of 74 users in New
York City (both students and nonstudents) no one mentioned any
hostile feelings or actions when asked to describe what happens
when they get high on marihuana (p. 264). </p>

<p>Goode (1970) asked 204 respondents to describe their
experiences when high on marihuana. Table 1 illustrates the
responses of the users to effects possibly related to aggression
or crime (pp. 53-54). </p>

<p>In a more recent, Commission-sponsored survey of 15 to 34 year
old male residents of Philadelphia, respondents were interviewed
about the extent and frequency of their marihuana use, the extent
to which marihuana figured in the commission of criminal or
delinquent acts and the effects they generally experienced while
under the influence of the drug (Goode, 1972). With respect to
the effects experienced, nearly all the marihuana users (about
75% of the total sample reported that they had tried marihuana at
one time or another) denied that the effects of marihuana on them
could be interpreted as criminogenic or violent in nature. Table
2 below presents the subjective effects of marihuana related to
crime and violence which were reported by the 559 respondents. <br>

<p>The data show that the overwhelming majority of the
respondents report &quot;never or almost never&quot; experiencing
effects which can be characterized as producing frustration,
anger, or aggression, and that they usually do Dot experience
effects which could be taken to indicate an increase in
suggestibility. On the other hand, substantial proportions of the
respondents reported feeling relaxed (72%), less angry (53%) and
drowsy or sleepy (47 %, ) at least half of the time. </p>

<p>In sum, these data suggest that marihuana does not commonly
produce effects which are likely to increase aggression or incite
the user to violence. Numerous studies designed to assess the
relationship more directly demonstrate, on the whole, that
marihuana does not play a significant role in the commission of
violent crimes. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>MARIHUANA AND VIOLENT CRIME: THE EVIDENCE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Over the years a number of approaches have been utilized in an
effort to assess the relationship between marihuana use and
violent crime. Perhaps the simplest approach is to compile a.
list of violent offenses allegedly committed by marihuana users
and to establish, retrospectively, the role of marihuana in the
commission of these offenses. </p>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission (1894), for example,
investigated 81 cases of violence allegedly caused by hemp drugs
in in effort to determine whether or not a causal relationship
existed. Of these 81 cases, 11 were too old to permit adequate
investigation. In 23 of the cases examined, however, 18 showed no
evidence of a connection between the crimes and the use of hemp
drugs. The Commission concluded that: </p>

<p><i>In respect to his relations with society, however, even the
excessive consumer of hemp drugs is ordinarily inoffensive,. His
excesses may indeed bring him to degraded poverty which may lead
him to dishonest practices; and occasionally, but apparently very
rarely indeed, excessive indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to
violent crime. But for all practical purposes it may be laid down
that there is little or no connection between the use of hemp
drugs and crime </i>(Indian Hemp Drugs Commission, 1893-1894,
reprinted 1969: 204). </p>

<p>Similarly, in 1938 the Foreign Policy Association published
the accounts of 10 marihuana crimes, including murder and
assault, &quot;culled at random from the files of the U.S. Bureau
of Narcotics&quot; (Merrill, 1938: 28). These cases were
presented in such a way as to imply that marihuana caused the
offenses. According to Grinspoon (1971: 302), they &quot;gave the
reader the distinct impression that the -user of marihuana was a
violent criminal who was given to rape, homicide, and
mayhem.&quot; Bromberg (1939), however, questions the validity of
the causal assumption. </p>

<p>It is difficult to evaluate these statements, because of their
uncritical nature.... Among the ten patients, the second, J. O.,
was described as having confessed how lie murdered a friend and
put his body in a trunk while under the influence of marihuana.
J. 0. was examined in this clinic (Bellevue Hospital) ; although
lie was a psychopathic liar and possibly homosexual, there was no
indication in the examination or history of the use of any drug.
The investigation by the probation department failed to indicate
use of the drug marihuana. The deceased, however, was addicted to
heroin (p. 9). </p>

<p>Based on retrospective case analyses, some observers have
attempted to specify more precisely. the nature of the purported
relationship or the situations in which aggressive behavior may
result from marihuana use. Bromberg (1939), for example,
suggested that aggressive or violent behavior may arise when a
naive subject develops a panic state in response to
marihuana-induced hallucinations. Allentuck and Bowman (1942)
believed that aggressive or antisocial behavior following use may
occur as a reaction to some unpleasant external stimulus during
the phase, of hypersensitivity and heightened psychomotor
activity. Others have suggested that antisocial conduct of an
aggressive or violent nature may occur when marihuana is used, as
alcohol often is, to release repressed feelings of hostility
(Siler, et al., 1933; Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Allentuck and
Bowman, 1942; Freedman and Rockmore, 1946; Murphy, 1963), and to
serve as a fortifier for aggressive or violent crimes (Ewens,
1904; South Africa Interdepartmental Committee on Abuse of Dagga,
1952; Ames, 1958; Watt, 1961; Blumer, et al., 1967; Miller,
1968). </p>

<p>The available evidence bearing on these issues, however,
suggests that panic reactions rarely occur; that psychomotor
activity is more often reduced than enhanced following use; that
aggression rarely follows use, but when it does, it generally
occurs among individuals with histories of maladjustment,
emotional instability or impulse disorders (Bromberg, 1934, 1939;
Charen and Perelman, 1946; Ausubel, 1958; Bloomquist, 1968;
Grinspoon, 1971; Kaplan, 1971; National Institute of Mental
Health, 1972). </p>

<p>After a series of studies of marihuana and crime, Chopra and
Chopra (1939) concluded that if any relationship existed between
marihuana use and violent crime, it was an indirect one. They
stated that: </p>

<p><i>So far as premeditated crime is concerned, especially that
of a violent nature, hemp drugs . . . may not only not lead to
it, but they actually act as deterrents.... One of the, important
actions of these drugs is to quieten and stupify the individual
so there is no tendency to violence. . . . The result of
continued and excessive use of these drugs in our opinion is to
make the individual timid rather than lead him to commit a crime
of a violent nature</i> (p. 92). </p>

<p>Over the years, the conclusion of the Chopras has received
increasing support from many quarters of the research community
(Mayor's Committee on Marihuana, 1944; Maurer and Vogel, 1962;
White House Conference on Narcotic Drug Abuse, 1962; Murphy,
1963; President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice, 1967; National Institute of Mental
Health, 1970, 1972). </p>

<p>In the absence of possibilities for addressing the issue more
directly, several researchers have relied on statistical studies
and have sought to establish the overall and comparative
incidence of detected violent crimes among cannabis users. One
method has been to compile lists of violent crimes committed
during specific periods of time and to determine the proportion
of these offenses committed by cannabis users. </p>

<p>Lambo (1965) compiled a list of crimes occurring in three West
African countries during a recent two-year period. He claimed
that users of cannabis had committed 51% of the 73 murders, 31%
of the 263 cases of assault and battery and 26% of the 472 cases
against women. </p>

<p>Some have preferred to base their statistical studies on
samples of offenders (rather than lists of offenses) drawn from
the arrest or conviction files of law enforcement agencies.
Several researchers adopting this method are content to identify
the marihuana users in their samples and then simply report the
number of users charged with violent crimes or the proportions of
the total number of violent crimes perpetrated by the users. </p>

<p>The District Attorney of New Orleans, for example, testified
before the House Ways and Means Committee that of the 450 men
convicted of major crimes in 1930, 125 were identified as regular
marihuana users. Approximately one-half of the murderers and
one-fifth of those charged with assault, robbery or larceny were
said to be regular marihuana users (U.S. House of
Representatives, 1937: 23-24). </p>

<p>Bromberg (1939) reviewed the records of 16,854 offenders in
the psychiatric clinic of New York County's Court of General
Sessions during the period 1932 to 1937. Of the 67 marihuana
users identified, only six had been charged with violent crimes.
He concluded that there was no causal relationship between
marihuana use and aggressive crime. </p>

<p>Others go one step further and attempt to compare the users'
rates of violence with those of other selected populations such
as non-marihuana using offenders, offenders using other drugs, or
all of fenders in a given file. </p>

<p>Bromberg and Rodgers (1946) studied the civilian and military
criminal records of 8,280 convicted offenders at the United
States Naval Prison in Portsmouth, Now Hampshire between January
1, 1943 and July 1, 1945. Of the total number of offenders
investigated, 40 or .0048% were identified as marihuana users (23
used to excess, 10 were moderate users and seven were described
as light users). Of these 40, only two reported being more
aggressive while under the influence of marihuana than they would
be under normal conditions and three had been charged with
violent crimes (assault or striking an officer) while in the
military. Comparison of the users' criminal records with those of
40 randomly selected non-using prisoners revealed that the
non-user group had committed more aggressive crimes than the
users. </p>

<p>In conclusion, the researchers stated that: </p>

<ol>
    <li><i>There is no positive relationship between aggressive
        crime and marihuana usage in the Naval service; . . . </i></li>
    <li><i>. . . there is no significant causal relationship
        between aggressive crime in civilian life (of the naval
        offenders studied) and the use of marihuana . . . . </i></li>
    <li><i>Marihuana usage is but an aspect of some type of
        mental disorder or personality abnormality </i>(p. 826). </li>
</ol>

<p>Maurer and Vogel (1962) have stated a similar conclusion. </p>

<p><i>&quot;It has not been our impression from contact with many
hundreds of marijuana users that these people are violent
criminals; ... While there may be occasional violent psychopaths
who have used marijuana, have committed crimes of violence, and
who have, in court, explained their actions as uncontrolled
violence resulting from the use of the drug, these are exceptions
to the general run of marijuana users.... Marijuana is not
possessed of any mysterious power to force people to commit acts
which they would not otherwise perform </i>(p. 281). </p>

<p>Blum (1969) reviewed the data provided in 1966 by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation as part of its Careers in Crime Project.
The data showed that marihuana users did not differ significantly
from either heroin users or from all offenders (drug and non-drug
users) in their rate of violent crime relative to their total
non-drug offenses (28%, 26% and 26%, respectively). </p>

<p>There have been several statistical studies, also using
offender populations, designed to assess the degree to which
persons arrested for cannabis use have previous or subsequent
arrests for violent crimes. </p>

<p>Bromberg and Rodgers (1946) found that of the 40 offenders in
their sample identified as marihuana users, 12 had been charged
with previous offenses, three of them for assault. </p>

<p>Gardikas (1950) reviewed the criminal records of 379 persons
arrested between 1919 and 1950 for publicly using hashish. Of
these, 117 (31%) reportedly progressed from hashish use to other
crimes, about one-third of these subsequent crimes involving
violence or weapons. Gardikas stated that one subgroup of these,
offenders accumulated 420 offenses of assault, woundings,
threats, robberies, and manslaughter (p. 5). </p>

<p>In sum, these statistical studies based on samples of violent
offenses, violent offenders or arrested marihuana law violators
indicate that some individuals identified as marihuana users do
commit violent crimes, have committed them in the past and go on
to commit them in the future. </p>

<p>Their numbers, however, are generally small, both absolutely
and relatively. These studies therefore suggest a very weak and
insignificant statistical association between marihuana use and
violent crime which may itself be completely attenuated when the
proper statistical controls are applied. </p>

<p>These studies do not establish a causal relationship between
cannabis use and violent crime; nor do they permit an affirmative
response to the crucial question of whether the use of marihuana
alters the progression to violent crime at a significantly
greater rate than that which might be expected from some other
criminal subgroups, more representative samples of cannabis
users, or samples drawn from the general population. They also
fail to address themselves to the external conditions and
circumstances which might serve to mitigate the observed
relationships. </p>

<p>Several recent and more sophisticated empirical investigations
have addressed some of the critical questions left unanswered by
statistical studies of offender populations. Namely, they set
about to determine whether marihuana users in the general
population commit acts of aggression or violence significantly
more frequently than do nonusers; and whether any observed
differences between users and non-users may be more directly
attributable to extra-pharmacological (social, cultural,
psychological) variables than to the use of marihuana itself or
to the pharmacological action of the drug per se. </p>

<p>In 1965, Robins and his associates (1970) conducted a survey
of 20 black men born in St. Louis between 1930 and 1934. The
marihuana users in the sample were then compared with the
nonusers relative to their ratings on a &quot;violence
syndrome&quot; constructed by the researchers. </p>

<p>Respondents were rated high on the violence syndrome if they
reported having participated or felt like participating in three
or more of the following items, one of which was a judgment by
the interviewer that the respondent demonstrated hostility during
the interview: </p>

<p>1. Getting hurt in a fight. </p>

<p>2. Ever feeling like killing someone. </p>

<p>3. Ever hitting people when angry. </p>

<p>4. Being quick to lose one's temper. </p>

<p>5. Throwing or breaking things when angry. </p>

<p>6. Ever hurting someone in a fight. </p>

<p>7. Ever fighting with a weapon. </p>

<p>8. Getting mean when drinking. </p>

<p>9. Interviewer's observation of respondent's hostility. </p>

<p>The researchers found that those who had used marihuana during
adolescence were more likely to score high on the violence
syndrome than were those who did not use the drug for the first
time until adulthood; 31% of the respondents who had used
marihuana and no other drug during adolescence exhibited three or
more of these measures, 24% of those who used marihuana only but
started as adults scored high, 16% of the non-users were
classified as high on the violence syndrome, and 45% of those who
used marihuana and other drugs were so classified. </p>

<p>The researchers also found that users were significantly more
likely to report the, commission of &quot; adult person or
property offenses&quot; than were nonusers; 32 % of the nonusers,
48 % of the marihuana only adult starters, 56% of the marihuana
only adolescent starters, and 77% of the multiple drug users
reported committing crimes against persons or property as adults.
</p>

<p>Based on these data, marihuana users were said to be
significantly more likely to have exhibited violent behavior than
were nonusers. This conclusion, however, seems somewhat
premature. </p>

<p>First, upon the application of three &quot;pathological&quot;
controls (dropping out of school, alcoholism and involvement in
juvenile delinquency), the original relationship was reduced to
some unspecified extent; the researchers reported only that these
controls &quot;failed to completely wipe out&quot; the
statistical correlation. Secondly, several of the items would not
appear to be sufficiently discriminating in that large numbers of
people, whether drug users or not, have probably been quick to
lose their temper, hit people when angry (most parents, for
example), or felt like killing someone in a moment of anger. The
subjective nature of the last item the interviewer's observation
of hostility has already been noted. </p>

<p>Thirdly, neither the drinkers nor those who were multiple drug
users were isolated in the analysis, making it impossible to
determine whether or not the apparent relationship between
marihuana use and violence may have been a. function of these
other drugs rather than the marihuana. </p>

<p>Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the researchers found
several other &quot;pathological&quot; variables correlated with
the use of marihuana in their sample: (a) low income, (b) low
status jobs, (c) unemployment, (d) receiving financial aid, (e)
failing to graduate from high school, (f) fathering illegitimate
children, (g) marrying women who had been married previously or
who had children, and (h) drinking &quot;heavily enough to
create, social or medical problems.&quot; </p>

<p>Because none of these variables was controlled in the data
analysis (despite the fact that most of them have been found to
be significantly related to delinquency and crime and
characteristic of persons involved in delinquent, criminal and
drug subcultures), it is impossible to determine whether or not
any or all of these variables played a mediating role in the
observed relationship between marihuana use and antisocial
behavior in the, sample. As Goode (1972) has noted, the fact that
the three controls which were applied did reduce the
relationship, makes it likely that &quot;additional controls
would reduce the relationship even more, indeed, reduce it to
zero, if applied simultaneously&quot; (p. 13). </p>

<p>As such, although this study represented a significant step
forward in investigating the relationship between marihuana and
crime or violent behavior, its methodological limitations
preclude generalizations of the findings to the larger universe. </p>

<p>In a study of drug use among lower class minority group youth,
Blumer and his associates (1967) found that marihuana users were
much less likely to commit aggressive or violent acts than were
those who used amphetamines or preferred alcohol, and that most
of the marihuana using youths deliberately shunned aggressive
behavior and adopted, instead, a &quot;cool,&quot; non-violent
style. The researchers did find a small group of youths (termed
&quot;the rowdy&quot;) who were oriented toward aggressiveness.
Generally, these youths preferred alcohol over other drugs and
were found, for the most part, to have been raised in an
aggressive and combative social milieu. The researchers point
out, however, that most marihuana users in the sample were not of
the rowdy type, even though it is this small group which often
forms the basis of the public and police image of the youthful
marihuana user. In commenting on the role of marihuana in the
passage of youth from rowdy to a cool style, the authors note,
that the passage from the rowdy type to a cool and mellow
youngster, as it relates to the use of drugs, involves chiefly a
shift to the smoking of marijuana. . . . [The youngsters']
accounts and discussions also stress that the use of marijuana
both produces and symbolizes a &quot;mellow&quot; mode of conduct
that is opposed to that associated with rowdy behavior. They
place great weight on the &quot;socializing&quot; effects of
marijuana use, declaring that its use not only leads youngsters
away from violence but has the effect of changing them into
social human beings (p. 30). </p>

<p>In a large scale, systematic survey (questionnaire and
interview) of more than 1300 students at five West Coast colleges
and universities, Blum and his associates (1969) found that 19%
of the total sample had used marihuana but that 94% had used
alcohol. One, percent of the marihuana users reported fights or
other criminal behavior which they attributed to the drug. Of
those who used alcohol, 8% reported fights and 2% reported
offenses while under the influence of this drug. The researchers
make particular note of the fact that despite the increase of
marihuana use on these campuses since the middle and late
sixties, there has been no comparable increase in assaultive
crimes. </p>

<p>In a Commission-sponsored household survey of 15 to 34
year-old male residents of West Philadelphia, Goode (1972) found
that not one of the violent crimes, including &quot;forcing
sexual intercourse,&quot; was significantly correlated with
marihuana use. Among the five offense types showing a very weak
relationship to the use of marihuana, the only so-called violent
offense, &quot;hurting someone in a minor way,&quot; showed the
weakest association. The author notes that &quot;the statistical
differences in rates of offenses between users and nonusers rest
on adding together a small number of weakly correlated offenses.
. . . [They do not indicate] massive differences, or differences
indicating higher rates of classic, violent crimes among
users&quot; (p. 32a). </p>

<p>These more rigorous studies of the relationship between
marihuana use and violent crime suggest that marihuana users in
the general population do not commit acts of aggression or
violence significantly more frequently than do nonusers; that
marihuana does not heighten aggressive tendencies in most users
and may, in some cases, serve to reduce aggressiveness; and that
much of the observed relationship between marihuana and violence
is probably a function of social, cultural or psychological
variables such as multiple drug use, set and setting and
involvement in a criminal or drug subculture. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that marihuana use will cause or
lead to the commission of aggressive or violent acts by the large
majority of psychologically and socially mature individuals in
the general population. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>OPINIONS ABOUT MARIHUANA AND AGGRESSIVENESS: THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES<br>
</b></p>

<p>Several references have already been made to anecdotal case
histories, to the claims made and to the opinions formerly held
by a number of law enforcement authorities relative to the
relationship between marihuana use and aggressive behavior or
violent crime. A few systematic efforts have been made to explore
the current opinions and attitudes of law enforcement and
criminal justice officials. </p>

<p>Probably the first detailed survey of the opinions of police
officers was that conducted by a Stanford University law student
in 1968. Part of this unpublished study has been summarized by
Kaplan (1971) and is reprinted below. </p>

<p>Law enforcement agencies have continuously supported the
existence of a strong causal relationship between the use of
marijuana and acts of aggression and violence. In order to
determine the nature and basis for this belief, sixteen law
enforcement and narcotics officers were interviewed. The officers
selected for the interview from each pollee department were those
who spent the largest percentage of their time actually working
with marijuana users. When the department had several officers
working full time on narcotics, the officer In charge was
interviewed, on the supposition that as chief officer, he would
have the longest and widest range of experience with marijuana
users. </p>

<p>Of those interviewed, seven spent 100% of their time on
narcotics problems; three spent 75% to 100%; I spent about 50%;
and the remaining five spent 10% to 25%. All emphasized that of
their narcotics work, a major proportion of the time is spent on
marijuana problems. </p>

<p>The context in which the officers observe individuals under
the influence of marijuana is an important factor in evaluating
their observations. Only three had done stakeout work where
conduct could be observed while under cover. The remaining
thirteen officers had only encountered marijuana users in either
arrest or questioning situations. In response to the question of
whether they had opportunities for informal contact with people
using marijuana while off duty or in a social situation, the
officers uniformly answered, &quot;no.&quot; </p>

<p>The specific subject of this project, i.e. marijuana and
aggression, was never mentioned to the officers. They were told
only that I was interested in the marijuana question. The first
question which I asked was to briefly characterize, from their
per8onal experience and observations, the behavior of individuals
while under the influence of marijuana. During this original
description, 10 of the officers mentioned violence or aggressive
behavior as a common characteristic. The six other officers
didn't mention aggression as a distinguishing characteristic in
their original description however, in the next question, when
specifically asked if marijuana does lead to aggressive behavior,
all said that it did. </p>

<p>Every one of the officers pointed out the wide range of
conduct which they see exhibited by those that are
&quot;high&quot; on marijuana. They emphasized that how a person
reacts depends on his particular personality. As one officer
commented, &quot;Some individuals are very happy and to them
everything is beautiful, while others are always looking for a
fight.&quot; Six (6) of the officers emphasized how quickly they
can see one mood change into the other-at one moment docile and
passive, at another extremely aggressive. </p>

<p>A few of the officers commented that along with the direct
influence of marijuana, another important factor in aggressive
behavior Is the arresting situation. One officer, Lieutenant A of
the B Police Department, who has done quite a bit of stake-out
work as well as undercover investigation, pointed out that this
change from &quot;silly, joking, funny and talkative&quot; moods
to apprehensive and often aggressive postures is many times
precipitated by the realization that a law enforcement officer is
present. </p>

<p>Sergeant C of the D Police Department also felt the
&quot;arresting situation&quot; was probably the primary factor
in aggressive behavior reports about marijuana users. Sergeant E
also mentioned &quot;the approach of a known policeman&quot; as a
factor in the aggressive behavior which they see. However,
Sergeant E also estimated that one fifth </p>

<p>of the males, when under the influence of [marijuana] and when
aware that they are being arrested, will break and run or resist.
This he feels is a much higher percentage than for other types of
arrests. Similarly most of the officers did maintain that even
considering all other factors such as arrest, the marijuana was
the force in most cases which was responsible for the aggression
and violence. </p>

<p>Mr. F of the G County Sheriff's Office, however, maintained
that in the last few years, those arrested for marijuana offenses
have tended to resist arrest less often than previously. He
stated, &quot;They now feel they don't have to fight the officers
because of the laws-because of legalizing attempts, they feel
they don't have to fight, for they will have their day in
court.&quot; </p>

<p>Sergeant H of the I Police Department stated that recently
(within the last year) he has seen no aggressive reaction to
marijuana because of the extremely weak grades of marijuana now
available. He felt that the determinative factor in how a person
reacts while &quot;high&quot; is the strength of the grass
smoked. He reported that the grass they have recently been
finding has a very low resin content and its effects are merely
&quot;a quick stimulant followed by a depressed mood.&quot;
However, in another part of the interview, when discussing the
type of personality prone to using marijuana, Sergeant H
distinguished between those now smoking and the &quot;old
grasshead.&quot; These latter were, only &quot;Spanish-American
or criminals.&quot; Now, however, &quot;people without criminal
records are joining the ranks of criminals.&quot; This major
shift in the personality type now using marijuana, it would seem,
would be another factor leading to Sergeant H's observation that
the problems with aggressive reactions have decreased. </p>

<p>While all stated their belief that marijuana does lead to
aggressive behavior, it was in most cases very difficult to
elicit from the officers any specific instances where they
personally had observed an aggressive reaction to the use of
marijuana. Four (4) officers stated that they had never
personally seen someone aggressive under marijuana. They all,
however, had heard reports of such instances from other officers.
It should be noted also, that these four officers are from small
police departments located chiefly in middle class residential
areas. </p>

<p>Me officers who did cite specific examples of aggressive
behavior from their personal observations cited such conduct as
individuals who possessed marijuana fighting among themselves,
cases of resisting arrest, a [man] picking a fight in a bar,
beating one's wife, sexual promiscuity, stealing, reckless
driving, and carrying knives and guns. While citing this type of
example most officers emphasized the real difficulty in telling
when someone is &quot;high.&quot; Except for a few symptoms such
as red or dilated eyes, they have to make the judgment from the
general actions of the subject. When the subject is acting
peculiar and there is no alcohol, or they find marijuana in his
possession, then they assume he is &quot;high.&quot; </p>

<p>It was also difficult to limit these discussions solely to
marijuana. When asked for personal case histories, they often
recounted incidents of individuals who had also been using other
drugs or alcohol in combination with marijuana. The officers tend
to group all of the drugs together, and discuss them together in
generalities applying to all. One officer, from J County,
recounted as one of his -personal experience histories with
aggression and marijuana, a boy who went &quot;berserk&quot; on
Christmas day, and who finally had to be shot by the police. On
checking newspaper accounts, it appears that LSD was also
involved in the episode. </p>

<p>The officers all indicated that they have personally seen many
aggressive reactions to the use of alcohol. Most, however, did
not feel they could compare the frequency with that of marijuana.
Most deal mainly with narcotic problems and thus spend most of
their time with marijuana problems. The alcohol problems, and
specifically the aggressive or belligerent drunk, are handled by
the &quot;beat&quot; cops. </p>

<p>It was also difficult to limit the discussion to personal
experiences of the officers themselves. Many of them, when asked
for specific examples, went immediately to their desks for
reports and articles issued by other law enforcement agencies.
This it seems is a problem which developed because of the sample
chosen to interview. Because they were usually the most
experienced and the chief narcotics officers, most of them are
called upon to give speeches before PTA's, church groups, school
classes, etc. They all, therefore, were familiar with the
literature distributed by law enforcement.... </p>

<p>Three of the officers cited as proof of marijuana's danger a
recent distribution which pointed out that the &quot;death
penalty&quot; Is now imposed on marijuana offenders in Nigeria. </p>

<p>When questioned on passive reactions to marijuana, all of the
officers could think of personal encounters with people who were
&quot;high&quot; and who were decidedly passive and docile. Yet
only four of the officers included this trait in their original
characterization of behavior under marijuana. Eight of the
officers, however, in their original description of behavior
while &quot;high&quot; described some persons as
&quot;happy,&quot; &quot;funny,&quot; or &quot;giggly.&quot; </p>

<p>One question asked of the officers was aimed at
differentiating the aggressiveness (chiefly in terms of frequency
of resisting arrest) between those &quot;high&quot; on marijuana
and those arrested for sale or for possession. As mentioned
previously, the officers indicated that generally they have a
very difficult time distinguishing those who are
&quot;high.&quot; The officers interviewed generally work on
[arresting] pushers, and dealers. Their attention is usually not
drawn to individuals because of the particular conduct they might
be exhibiting, but rather because the individual is dealing in
marijuana. When pot parties where everyone is high have been
[broken up], Sergeant 0 of D reported that the places raided have
usually been on the peaceful side. Another officer, K, on the
narcotics detail in D, felt that users are usually &quot;very
easy to arrest. With others, such as pushers, and sellers,
however, officers have to -be more careful.&quot; Captain L of M
disagreed, however, maintaining that those under the influence
must be watched more closely and are usually more aggressive and
violent because of a lessening of concern for the consequences
and a lack of ability to make sound judgments. Deputy Chief N of
the 0 Police Department pointed out that In 0 at any rate, there
is a certain &quot;show&quot; which those arrested feel they must
put on; &quot;it is hard to separate this show from the effects
of the marijuana,&quot; Lieutenant P of the 0 Police Department
said his experience indicated that those under the influence had
to be watched closely. He has arrested people, [when they were]
&quot;high&quot; three of four times without incident; the fifth
time, however, he felt they might go wild. </p>

<p>In response to a question of whether they felt that some
persons smoke pot before engaging in crimes against property,
such as robbery, ten of the officers replied that they did
believe that this occurred often. Seven of these could cite
specific examples of people who had been picked up for stickups,
car thefts, etc. and who reported using marijuana beforehand to
bolster their courage, or sharpen their senses. However, the
other three of the ten had only heard of such conduct. The
remaining six officers answered that they did not think this was
common, and had never seen any examples. . . . </p>

<p>None (of the officers) believed however that marijuana was
responsible for any long-term effects resulting in aggressive
behavior. The relationship between marijuana and aggression, they
feel, is limited strictly to the period of time during which the
user is under the influence. In terms of long-range effects of
marijuana on aggression, the reactions of the officers confirm
that, if anything, there is a negative correlation. That is,
marijuana leads to nonaggressive, non-competitive, passive
conduct, when viewed in the context of chronic use. </p>

<p>Whatever limitations and qualifications one can cite regarding
the conclusions drawn by law enforcement officers, one thing
remains certain: they do believe that the use of marijuana leads
in a significant number of cases to aggressive behavior (Kaplan,
1971, citing Schofield: 110-115). </p>

<p>In seeking to present to the public as much information about
marihuana and its effects, from as many different sources and
approaches as possible, the Commission sponsored the design and
execution of two opinion surveys of the criminal justice
Community. In addition to soliciting their current opinions about
the relationship of marihuana to aggressive or violent behavior,
and to infer from them the extent to which their professional
experience with marihuana users may have changed over the years,
the Commission sought to determine the extent to which current
opinions and attitudes of the criminal justice community reflect
the growing body of empirical evidence on the subject. </p>

<p>To these ends, nationally representative samples of
prosecuting attorneys, judges, probation officers and court
clinicians were surveyed by mail. The questionnaires mailed to
these officials contained items relative to the relationship
between marihuana use and aggressive or violent behavior. The
results of these surveys show that more than three fourths of the
781 judges, probation officers and court clinicians responding to
a mail survey (InTech, 1971) regarded as either questionable or
&quot; probably untrue&quot; the statement that &quot;most
aggressive acts or crimes of violence committed by persons who
are known users of marihuana occur when the offender is under the
influence of marihuana. More than 60% however, regard as equally
questionable or untrue the statement that most such aggressive
acts or crimes of violence occur when the offender is not tinder
the influence of the drug but is attempting to obtain it or the
money to buy it. Table 3 shows the percentage of each of the
three groups of respondents answering in this manner. (InTech,
1971). </p>

<p>These figures give the impression that neither judges,
probation officers nor court clinicians are certain of the role
of marihuana in the commission of violent crime. Their tendency
to deny both statements suggests that at the least, the
relationship, to the extent that it does exist, is a tenuous one.

<p>Total 32.1 37.0 23.2 </p>

<p>In its survey of state prosecuting attorneys, the Commission
likewise found a tendency for these officials to deny a causal
relationship between marihuana use and aggressive behavior; 52%
of the respondents stated that they either did not believe or
were uncertain about the proposition that use of marihuana causes
aggressive behavior. Of those who did believe in a causal
relationship, however, two-thirds of the respondents' beliefs
stemmed front other than personal observation of aggressive
behavior exhibited by marihuana users. </p>

<p>These opinion surveys reveal that at least these members of
the criminal justice community have begun to reexamine their
earlier beliefs. The data suggest that, in their professional
experience, they have not found marihuana users to be aggressive
or violent to such an extent as to elicit strong and consistent
opinions about the causal relationship between marihuana use and
violence. <br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and Sexual Behavior</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Since the mid-1930's, Americans have, at one time or another,
either acclaimed or decried marihuana as an aphrodisiac, lauded
its ability to intensify and enhance enjoyment of sexual
experiences and accused it of heightening sexual aggression and
inciting the commission of sexual offenses. Even today, there is
no consensus among Americans regarding what they consider to be
the effects of marihuana on sexual desire, arousal and
performance. Rather, what evidence exists on the subject
continues to reveal the existence of diverse and often
inconsistent beliefs and experiences. </p>

<p>Society's concern about the effects of marihuana on sexual
behavior, however, does not generally center on the drug's
inherent ability to produce or heighten sexual arousal per se but
on the relationship between sexual arousal and the likelihood of
sexual excess on the part of the user. The key question is the
extent to which and the conditions under which marihuana acts as
a catalyst to sexual aggression, profligacy, promiscuity and
other aberrant sexual behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>MARIHUANA AND PSYCHOSEXUAL STIMULATION</b> </p>

<p>The numerous medical and clinical observations, experimental
investigations and survey studies reviewed by the Commission show
that the belief regarding the stimulant effects of marihuana and
the use of hemp drugs to achieve sexual arousal, the improvement
of sexual powers and the prolongation of coition have existed for
centuries and have be-en documented (Chopra and Chopra, 1939;
Bouquet, 1950; Robinson, 1967; Grinspoon, 1971) ; The proportion
of the population actually aroused sexually by marihuana,
however, is difficult to assess. Relevant research findings are
based on widely divergent research procedures, differing criteria
of arousal, and variations in the amount of arousal experienced.
Nonetheless, it is fair to state that marihuana produces
heightened sexual interest, desire and arousal in substantial
proportions of both male and female users (Bromberg, 1934;
Allentuck, 1944; Johnson, 1968; Goode, 1969; Hochman and Brill,
1971). It is equally accurate to state, however, that marihuana
does not increase and in fact may decrease sexual desire or
stimulation in significant proportions of users (Walton, 1938;
Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Taylor, 1963; Brenner, Coles and
Meagher, 1970; Goode, in press). At best, the available evidence
is inconclusive. </p>

<p>In a study of regular marihuana users conducted by three
physicians, for example, &quot;heightened sexual feeling&quot;
and &quot;increased sexual arousal&quot; while under the
influence of the drug were reportedly experienced
&quot;usually&quot; by one-third of the subjects (34%, and 33%,
respectively) and each of these effects was experienced
&quot;occasionally&quot; by 59% of the sample (Halikas, Goodwin
and Guze, 1971). </p>

<p>In another more recent study by physicians, &quot;increased
sexual appetite&quot; was reported by 60% of the chronic users
and 43% of the occasional users of marihuana. Responses to a
similar question regarding &quot;decreased sexual appetite,&quot;
revealed that 75% of the chronic users and 70% of the occasional
users reported that this never occurred (Hochman and Brill,
1971). </p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944) likewise attempted
to assess the effects of marihuana on sexual interest and sexual
stimulation. Its clinical studies of 72 male prisoners conducted
at the Welfare Hospital in New York City revealed that
&quot;although there was an undeniable increase in overt sex
interest following the ingestion of marihuana, . . . This sex
interest seems to have been due primarily to the fact that these
men have been imprisoned for various periods and had not had
access to women&quot; (p. 130). With respect to marihuana's
effect on sexual stimulation the Committee indicated that
although &quot;some evidence of eroticism&quot; was reported (in
about 10% of the 150 instances in which marihuana was
administered), there was no &quot;frank expression of sexual
stimulation&quot; despite the presence of female nurses,
attendants and others associated with the experiment (p. 38). </p>

<p>More recently, Professor Goode published the results of an
informal survey of about 200 marihuana users in which he inquired
about the relationship of marihuana to both sexual desire and
sexual activity. To the question, &quot;Do you think that being
high on marihuana stimulates your sex interest, or not?&quot;,
38% said that their interest in sex while high was no different
in degree from their normal interest in sex; 5% stated that being
high on marihuana had a negative effect, i.e., that &quot;it
tended to turn them off sexually&quot;; 13% replied that the
effect depended on either their mood, their partner or both; and
44% (39% of the men and 50% of the women) reported that it
&quot;definitely increases their sexual desire&quot; (1970: 162).
</p>

<p>Perhaps the most conclusive and consistent finding to emerge
from studies of the effects of marihuana on psychosexual
stimulation is that the degree of sexual interest, desire and
arousal induced by marihuana is dependent on the characteristics
of the user and the extent to which he comes to expect or
anticipate such an effect. Research shows that women are more
likely to report heightened sexual desire than are men (Goode,
1969) ; that young people more frequently report arousal than do
older persons (Bloomquist, 1968; Brenner, Coles and Meagher,
1970) ; 2 that frequent users are more likely to report increased
sex interest than infrequent users (Goode, 1970) ; that persons
who are more sexually experienced are more likely to be sexually
aroused by marihuana than are those less sexually experienced
(Brenner, Coles and Meagher, 1970; Hochman and Brill, 1971; Goode
in press) and that those who expect to be sexually aroused by the
drug are more likely to be so aroused than those who do not
(Goode, 1969; Fort, 1970; Grinspoon, 1971). </p>

<p>There is nothing inherent in the drug itself which produces
heightened sexual interest, desire or arousal, nor is there any
physiological evidence to show that marihuana directly or
specifically acts on either the, sexual centers of the brain or
the sexual organs. As one observer has noted, marihuana &quot;is
not a sexual stimulant; that is, in the, sense that it will not
excite mindless, laboratory-located animal tissue&quot; (Goode,
1969: 20). In short, marihuana is not an aphrodisiac. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>HOW MARIHUANA INFLUENCES SEXUAL RESPONSE</b> </p>

<p>It has already been stated that marihuana is not, in itself,
an aphrodisiac although a substantial number of persons report
increased sexual interest, desire and arousal following use of
the drug. To what, then, are these effects attributable? Research
hearing on this question suggests that to the extent that
marihuana influences these respouses, it does so indirectly by
acting on the higher centers of the brain to relax inhibitions
and reduce, the usual restraints on behavior. By so doing, the
user is placed in the position of being freer to respond to his
sexual needs and desires (Walton, 1938; Allentuck and Bowman,
1942; Ausubel, 1958; Brown, 1961; McGothlin, 1966; Rosevear,
1967; Bloomquist, 1968; Oursler, 1968; Goode, 1969; Fort, 1970).
The extent to which these responses occur, however, are dependent
upon individual expectation and knowledge (Fort, 1970) and the
social situation (set and setting) in which the marihuana use
takes place (Goode, 1969). As Professor Goode has stated, Man's
somatic responses are often influenced more by what he thinks
than by biological and chemical imperatives; in fact, it can
happen that what he thinks actually becomes his biological and
chemical imperative (1969, p. 20). </p>

<p>In addition to its effects on sexual inhibition and restraints
(the extent and consequences of which will be examined later),
marihuana is also reported to intensity aesthetic experiences and
to enhance sensual activity. As one observer has noted, it is
perhaps the principal effect of marihuana to take one more
intensely into whatever experience - .&quot; (Trocchi, 1967:
108). </p>

<p>One observer points out, however, that most of the users of
marihuana in this country are youths between the ages of 14 and
25 and that &quot;this age span needs no aphrodisiac to stimulate
either interest or capacity to perform&quot; (Bloomquist, 1968:
183). </p>

<p>It is this fact (which probably explains why substantial
proportions of marihuana users characterize their sexual
experiences under the influence of the drug as particularly
intense, prolonged, sensuous and pleasurable (Johnson, 1968;
Goode, 1969; Brenner, Coles and Meagher, 1970; Hochman and Brill,
1971; Tart, 1971; Abelson, et al., 1972). </p>

<p>In one study of marihuana users conducted by a psychologist,
65% reported a heightened sense of touch, 55% stated that
&quot;touch takes on new qualities,&quot; and 56% replied that
&quot;sexual orgasm was very often or usually more exciting than
when &quot;straight&quot;' (Tart, 1971). Of the approximately 500
marihuana users surveyed by Goode, 68% (74% of the men and 62% of
the women) reported that marihuana &quot;Generally acted as a
pleasure enhancer (and) usually increased their sexual
enjoyment&quot; (Goode, in press, pp. 8-9). </p>

<p>In still another study of marihuana users, both occasional and
chronic, &quot;increased sexual pleasure&quot; was the second
most common response, by the chronic users and the eighth most
commonly reported effect by the occasional users; 83% of the
former and 50% of the latter reported that increased sexual
pleasure was often or always experienced after smoking
marihuana.' Interesting too, was the finding that 85% of the
chronic users and 78% of the occasional users reported never
experiencing &quot;decreased sexual pleasure&quot; following use
of the drug (Hochman and Brill, 1971:7). </p>

<p>In the Commission's National Survey, respondents were asked to
indicate whether or not they believed that marihuana increases
sexual pleasure. Of those adults admitting they had tried
marihuana at least once (15%), 52% thought that the drug does
increase sexual pleasure. Both adults and youth in general,
however, seem to be less certain of this effect. Only about
one-fourth of all respondents (24% of adults and 26% of youth)
indicated agreement with the statement while slightly tinder
one-half of those surveyed (48% of the adults and 49% of the
youth) expressed uncertainty about marihuana's ability to
increase sexual pleasure (Ableson, et al., 1972: 25-33). </p>

<p>3 The students were also asked to assess the degree of
importance attached to a number of possible motivations for using
marihuana. As might be expected from the findings regarding
marihuana and sexual enjoyment, significantly more of the users
than the nonusers attached at least some degree of importance to
marihuana's perceived ability to enhance sexual experiences. To
the item: &quot;for better sexual experiences,&quot; 12% of the
non-users, 40% of the occasional users and 70% of the chronic
users felt that it was of some importance or &quot;very&quot;
important in motivating use of the drug (Hochman and Brill,
1971). </p>

<p>The research bearing on the effects of marihuana on sexual
pleasure suggests that marihuana is not usually perceived by the
general public to increase sexual enjoyment, that users are
significantly more likely to believe that marihuana has this
effect than are non-users, that those who expect to receive
increased sexual pleasure are more likely to experience it than
those who do not, and that frequent or regular users are
significantly more likely to have actually experienced this
effect than are those who use the drug less frequently. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA ON OVERT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR<br>
</b></p>

<p>As noted at the beginning of this discussion, society in
general and policy makers in particular are primarily concerned
about the extent to which and the conditions tinder which
marihuana is likely to generate or increase, the likelihood of
sexually aberrant or aggressive behavior. Marihuana has already
been shown to increase psychosexual stimulation in substantial
proportions of users and to serve as a relaxer of inhibitions and
restraints. The questions as yet unresolved, however, relate to
(a) the importance of sexual arousal in generating sexual
activity-particularly deviant sexual acts, and (b) the extent to
which inhibitions and restraints, which normally serve to protect
the individual and society from sexual excess and abuse, are
lowered by marihuana to the point of being inoperative. </p>

<p>The available evidence suggests that (a) although marihuana
users are more sexually active and sexually permissive than are
nonusers, marihuana does not generally stimulate sexual activity,
appreciably alter established patterns of sexual behavior or
serve as a catalyst to sexual promiscuity; (b) the marihuana user
is rarely sexually aggressive; and (c) persons arrested for
marihuana law violations generally do not have previous or
subsequent criminal records for the commission of sexual offenses
(Walton, 1938; Brown, 1961; White House Conference on Narcotic
Drug Abuse, 1962; Blunt et al., 1969; Bremner, Coles and Meagher,
1970; Goode, 1972; Goode, in press). </p>

<p>Before summarizing the research forming, the basis of these
assertions, however, it should be noted that there, are several
contradictory research findings with respect to (a) above. In one
recent study, for example, two Philadelphia physicians
investigating the effects of marihuana on adolescents and young
adults reported that the drug was directly responsible for sexual
promiscuity in 13 of their female patients. In the words of these
clinicians: </p>

<p><i>This group is singled out because of the unusual degree of
sexual promiscuity, which ranged from sexual relations with
several individuals of both sexes, and, sometimes, individuals of
both sexes on the same evening. In histories of all of these
individuals, we were struck by the loss of sexual inhibitions
after short periods of marihuana smoking. Seven patients of this
group became pregnant (one on several occasions), and four
developed venereal diseases. . . . In no instance was there
sexual promiscuity prior to the beginning of marihuana smoking. .
. . We take these results to indicate marihuana's effects on
loosening the superego controls and altering superego ideals</i>
(Kolansky and Moore, 1971: 491). <br>
</p>

<p>During 1970, another researcher (Goode, in press) distributed
questionnaires on drug use to between 500 and 600 undergraduates
in a large lecture course at a State University. Four measures of
sexual activity were employed: (1) engagement in premarital
intercourse, (2) the respondent's total number of different
sexual partners, (3) the age of first intercourse and (4) the
average frequency of intercourse during the six months prior to
the study. The three indices of drug use employed were whether or
not the respondent had ever smoked marihuana, the frequency of
marihuana use during the six months prior to the survey, and the
total number of drugs or drug types ever used by the respondent.
The researcher found that &quot;all measures of sexual activity
correlated significantly -and powerfully with all measures of
drug use&quot; (p. 12). More specifically, marihuana users were
far more likely to have engaged in premarital intercourse (72%)
than were non-users (34%) ; the greater the frequency of
marihuana use and the greater the number of drugs ever tried, the
earlier was the first intercourse, the greater was the frequency
of intercourse and the greater was the number of sexual partners.
</p>

<p>As the researcher suggests, one might be tempted to conclude
from these findings that marihuana, as well as other drugs,
causes early sex, frequent sex and sex with a number of different
partners were it not for the fact that similar findings point to
a relationship in the opposite direction. That is, not only were
marihuana users and drug experimenters more likely to experience
sex early in their lives, but &quot;it is also the sexually
precocious who are more likely to use drugs, including
marihuana&quot; (p. 14). Of all respondents reporting intercourse
by age 16, for example, 7% stated that they had never tried any
illegal drug, but total absence of illicit drug use was found in
47% of the virgins (p. 14). </p>

<p>Professor Goode concludes that &quot;using marihuana or other
illegal drugs no more 'causes' sexual behavior than sexual
behavior 'causes' drug use&quot; (p. 14). Rather, he suggests, </p>

<p><i>Both sexual permissiveness and marihuana use as well as, to
some extent, experimentation with certain other illegal drugs-are
indicators of the young person's involvement in and with a
subculture which is tolerant toward a wide range of
nontraditional values and activities . . . Quite clearly,
marihuana use grows out of a specific life style, which is, in
turn, partly dependent on specific sociocultural background
factors and permissive sexual behavior (branded as
&quot;promiscuous&quot; by those who disapprove of it) is a part
of this life style</i> (pp. 14, 16). </p>

<p>Similar to Goode's findings are those obtained from a mail
survey of 1400 undergraduate students at UCLA (Hochman and Brill,
1971). The data show that marihuana users have their first sexual
experience earlier than do non-users (50% of the users and 30% of
the non-users had their first experience before age 18) ; have
more sexual experience than non-users; have a greater number of
sexual partners than do nonusers (twice as many users as
non-users had five or more sexual partners) ; and have more
liberal attitudes toward sex than do non-users. </p>

<p>One of the questions asked of the students was: &quot;In your
experience or opinion, do you think that marihuana usage over a
long period results in sexual promiscuity?&quot; Over half of the
non-users (54%) and almost three-fourths (73%) of the users
believed this happened rarely or not at all while 12% of the
nonusers, 3% of the occasional users and 2% of the chronic users
believed that extended use of marihuana frequently leads to
sexual promiscuity. </p>

<p>Although the users more often suffered from venereal disease
than did the nonusers (7% vs. 2%), there were no differences
between the groups in the average frequency of sexual
intercourse, the number of concurrent sexual partners, the number
of pregnancies, miscarriages and illegitimacies, or the incidence
of homosexuality. </p>

<p>A more middle-of-the-road position regarding the association
between use of marihuana and sexual promiscuity was revealed in a
Commission sponsored mail survey of 781 judges, probation
officers and court clinicians (InTech, 1971). In an effort to
develop a profile of the regular marihuana. user, respondents
were asked: &quot;In light of your professional experience, do
you, think all, most, some or just a, few of the people who
regularly use marihuana are sexually promiscuous?&quot; </p>

<p>Tabulation of the responses revealed, among all three groups,
considerable uncertainty and ambivalence as manifested in the
findings that 23% of the total sample either did not answer the
question or stated that they did not know, and that three-fifths
of those who responded (70%) would answer no more categorically
than to say that only some&quot; could be characterized in this
manner. The percentages of each of the three groups of
respondents stating that all or most, some and few or none of the
regular marihuana users are sexually promiscuous are shown in
Table 4. </p>

<p>The Commission has found several studies dating from 1939
which support the assertions that the marihuana user is rarely
sexually aggressive and that he rarely has a criminal record for
the commission of sexual offenses. </p>

<p>A survey of the criminal records of 379 Greek offenders either
sentenced or arrested for the public use of hashish between 1919
and 1950 (Gardikas, 1950) revealed no link between the use of
hashish and the commission of sexual offenses. </p>

<p>Lambo (1965) compiled a list of crimes which occurred during a
recent two-year period in three West African countries. Of the
472 &quot;offences against women&quot; committed during the
period of study, 26% were claimed to have been committed by users
of cannabis. </p>

<p>In a, study conducted by the Kinsey Institute for Sex
Research, 1500 incarcerated sex offenders were interviewed about
their sexual offenses. The researchers found that in marked
contrast to the role of alcohol in the commission of their
offenses, particularly aggressive sex crimes, marihuana was a
very insignificant factor. While the presence of alcohol was
reported in relation to 67% of all sexually aggressive acts
against children and 39% of such aggressive acts against adult
women, marihuana was mentioned in only eight sexual offenses out
of a total of 2,022 such offenses committed by the respondents
(Gebbard, Gagnon, Pomeroy and Christenson, 1967: 761-819). </p>

<p>Two recent systematic studies of rape cases recorded by the
police in Philadelphia (Amir, 1971) and Denver (MacDonald, 1971)
gave no indication that marihuana was specifically linked to
these offenses. It should be noted, however, that the involvement
of marihuana in these cases, unlike the involvement of alcohol,
was not specifically explored.<br>

<p>Total (N=701) 21.3 59.6 19.1<br>
</p>

<p>In two Commission-sponsored studies of the relationship
between marihuana and crime, no evidence was found to suggest
that marihuana is a significant factor in or contributor to the
commission of sexual offenses. A study of 1,776 youthful
offenders (16 to 21 years of age) arrested for marihuana law
violations in five New York counties between 1965 and 1969
revealed that none of the offenders had either a previous or
subsequent criminal record for the commission of sexual offenses
(Weitzner, et. al., 1971). </p>

<p>In another study sponsored by the Commission, interviews with
559 male residents (16 to 34 years of age) of West Philadelphia,
revealed that six respondents, or about one in 100, admitted to
having committed the offense of &quot;forcing sexual
intercourse,&quot; three having reportedly committed it more than
once but none having been apprehended for these offenses (Goode,
1972; 29a). </p>

<p>In an effort to assess the role of marihuana in these
offenses, respondents were asked whether or not they had used the
drug within the 24 hours preceding the commission of both their
first and most recent offenses. In contrast to alcohol, which was
reported to have been consumed within 24 hours prior to one-third
of the first and most recent offenses of forcing sexual
intercourse (two out of six and one out of three, respectively),
none of the offenders reported smoking marihuana within 24 hours
of either the first or most recent time they committed this
offense (Goode, 1972: 29a). </p>

<p>Research findings which are available lend little support to
the thesis that marihuana either causes or is a significant
factor in the heightening of sexual aggression or the commission
of sexual offenses.<br>
